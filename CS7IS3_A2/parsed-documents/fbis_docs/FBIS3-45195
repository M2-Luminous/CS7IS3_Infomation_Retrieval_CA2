Recently, in order to prepare against possible trouble in the political situation after Deng's death, the CPC quietly made certain arrangements and adopted some measures. One of the measures was to restore the mechanisms for the old guard to get involved in politics. After the disbandment of the Central Advisory Commission, many old politicians became "jobless." However, some, holding a high position as "senior former leaders [yuan lao 0337 5071]" or being close to such high rank, continued to enjoy the right to keep their political influence. Some of them even kept their own offices. Four months ago, in late August 1993, the Political Bureau discussed whether to close the offices of Peng Zhen, Yang Shangkun, Bo Yibo, and Song Ping. At that time, Peng Zhen, Yang Shangkun, and Wan Li expressed their support. Jiang Zemin also informally expressed his opinion through internal channels. Some people proposed that only the offices for Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yuan be maintained. However, no final decision was made on this issue, and the political participation of the old guard did not come to an end. When a final decision was to be made on the documents of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Political Bureau still invited some retired old leaders to attend the relevant meeting and to participate in the decisionmaking. Song Ping, Song Renqiong, Yao Yilin and others still delivered seven proposals to the Political Bureau and the State Council in the name of their offices, including "A Six-Point Opinion on the Socialist Market Economy," "Problems Existing in the Current Economy," and "Central Authorities' Macrocontrol Is the Foundation for Ensuring the Healthy Development of the National Economy." At the memorial meeting to mourn the death of Zhou Peiyuan on 4 December, the Yang Shangkun Office, the Bo Yibo Office, and the Song Ping Office presented wreaths. In late November, the Yang Dezhi Office, the Li Desheng Office, and the Zhang Aiping Office sent telegrams of congratulation to the units achieving outstanding results in the war exercises of the 2d Artillery Force. The Yao Yilin Office, the Song Renqiong Office, and the Gu Mu Office also dispatched investigation groups to Guangdong, Hainan, and Shanghai in late November to find out the reactions of the enterprises and institutions concerned to the reform resolution adopted by the Third Plenum of the Central Committee. The offices of the old guard were not disbanded. Now, a document has been issued, and the system of offices for the retired old leaders will be maintained. On 6 December, the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission jointly issued an important circular: According to the demand and proposal of most members and alternate members of the 14th CPC Central Committee and other people attending the Third Plenary Session, and also according to the opinions the Central Committee solicited from the party organizations, the democratic parties, and the mass organizations, the older generation of leading comrades who enjoy high prestige inside and outside the party and who are esteemed and admired by the people should continue to be able to participate in the formulation of major policy decisions and guidelines and to play a certain guiding and assistant role in the handling of important affairs, as they have accumulated valuable work experience in the years of revolutionary wars and socialist construction, although they have retired or left the party, government, and military leading bodies. In the discussions of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, people unanimously proposed that the work bodies, namely, the offices, of the older generation of the party, government, and military leaders be maintained. The document has been issued to all central party, government, and military organs and to the party committees of all provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, military regions, and military branches. The decision on keeping the offices of some old former leaders of course reaffirmed the maintenance of their political privilege. Reportedly, the offices of Peng Zhen, Yang Shangkun, Wan Li, Bo Yibo, Song Renqiong, Song Ping, Yao Yilin, Yang Dezhi, Li Desheng, Zhang Aiping, Gu Mu, and Yu Qiuli were maintained. It was said that the proposal on maintaining the office system for the retired old leaders was jointly put forth by Qiao Shi and Hu Jintao, members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, and Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, and Ren Jianxin, members of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee. At the group meetings of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, Guangdong's Xie Fei, Shanghai's Wu Bangguo, Shandong's Jiang Chunyun, and some members and alternate members of the Central Committee from Sichuan, Liaoning, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Hebei also raised similar proposals. When attending the group meetings, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi indicated that the Political Bureau was considering the issue of maintaining the offices for some retired old leaders. On another occasion, Li Peng said that the party Central Committee and the State Council continued to consult the comrades of the older generation on some major affairs of the party and the state and on the making of relevant policies and decisions. It was necessary to maintain the work organs for them. On 15 November, at a discussion meeting with some responsible people of the democratic parties, Jiang Zemin said: The Political Bureau will propose that retired party and government leaders at the central and provincial levels may maintain their work organs so that they may continue to participate in the making of major policy decisions. However, this should be approved by the Political Bureau and the Central Secretariat. Reportedly, the offices for retired old leaders will be subordinate to the Central Secretariat in the future rather than to the Political Bureau. This indicates that they will be "downgraded" in the hierarchy of power. An informed old cadre revealed privately that the continuation of the office system for the old guard was the product of a compromise between Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun. The purpose of keeping this system was to appease the old cadres, but more importantly, it may enable the old guard to help control the situation once Deng Xiaoping dies. Chen Yun's faction had another purpose. That is, it would enable it to bolster the Jiang-Li leadership structure and also control its orientation in order to prevent it from "drifting westward" (adopting capitalism across the board) and to maintain its socialist orientation. The purpose of Deng Xiaoping's faction was to reinforce the momentum of reform and preserve its own interests. Moreover, it wants to obtain greater decisionmaking power with the support of the military after Deng's death, and prevent the Jiang-Li structure from monopolizing power inside the party. The office system for the senior retired leaders is in fact a small-sized advisory committee. This part of the old guard is certainly satisfied with such an arrangement. However, most retired cadres are frustrated. Many of them are getting increasingly depressed and dejected, and some have even degenerated. Generally, they have lost interest in politics and do not maintain the party spirit. Some senior retired leaders are trying to spur these comrades on. Since early December, the proposal of Peng Zhen and Yang Shangkun on "five shoulds and five should-nots" has been relayed to retired cadres at the ministerial and provincial level, and the retired cadres were asked to exercise self-discipline. In early November, at an inner-party meeting with some retired old cadres, Yang Shangkun first proposed "four shoulds and four should-nots": 1) They should keep pace with the party Central Committee, and should not lag behind the situation; 2) they should take the initiative in safeguarding the party's leadership, and should not place themselves above the party; 3) they should conscientiously study and understand Comrade Xiaoping's theory, and should not conservatively stick to conventions and refuse to make new progress; and 4) they should continue to do something beneficial to the party's central task in their late years, and should not rest on their laurels. Peng Zhen added one point: They should take responsibility for educating their families and children and persuading them to be the people's public servants rather than doing corrupt and discipline- violating things. Recently, in a document about the activities of party organizations, Peng Zhen wrote an instruction: "Old comrades do not have the privilege of not abiding by the party's discipline and not obeying the party. They should regularly take part in the activities of party organizations, take part in political studies, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Only those who are weak and sick can be exceptions." The "five shoulds and five should-nots" proposed by Yang and Peng and Peng's recent instruction were aimed at the current problems. According to the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, only less than 40 percent of retired old cadres still continue to regularly take part in the activities of party organizations and take part in political studies. About 30 percent of retired old cadres in the central organs have not taken part in any activities of party organizations for from over six months to one year for reasons of health. More than half the former Central Advisory Commission members are often absent from party activities. However, the retired old cadres borrow meeting places to hold their gatherings more frequently than when they were still in office. In addition, only 20 percent of retired old cadres at the provincial level still regularly take part in party activities, and over 60 percent of the retired old cadres often ask for leave. Various signs show that the CPC has lost its vigor, and is getting looser. Communist ideals and beliefs have collapsed in the minds of most party members. In place of such ideals and beliefs, they have adopted individualism, hedonism, liberalism, and other noncommunist ideologies. With the lack of checks and balances from other political forces, it is inevitable that the party will become increasingly corrupt. The economic reform initiated by Deng Xiaoping will only alleviate the symptoms of the illness and will not be able to effect a permanent cure. Once Deng dies, the CPC will face its death if it fails to effect self-transformation.
