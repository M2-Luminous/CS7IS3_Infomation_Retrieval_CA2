The committee's work will conclude with a report also containing a thorough examination of the administrative decisions made by the Faeroese banks in the 1980's that contributed to the bankruptcy of the two largest Faeroese banks. The provincial government wants the committee to be appointed by 1 February so that the report can be finished by 1 July. According to a statement from the Faeroese Representative Council, the committee's members must all be independent from, among other things, the Faeroese banks, the National Bank, the Danish Bank, and the Financial Inspectorate.
