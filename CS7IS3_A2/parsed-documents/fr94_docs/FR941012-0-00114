FR941012-0-00114 FR941012-0-00011 OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that a greater hazard exists by keeping both hands on the saw in a particular situation. OSHA also notes that the limited exception involves a case-by-case determination by the employer. At paragraph (e)(2)(ix) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw operator be certain of his footing before starting to cut. This provision also requires that the chain saw not be operated in a position or at a distance that could cause the operator to become off-balance, to have insecure footing, or to relinquish a firm grip on the saw. This provision adopts requirements contained in the proposed rule. Commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;55), and there were no comments opposing this requirement. OSHA believes this work practice will help to reduce the number of slip and fall injuries occurring in the logging industry. According to the WIR survey, slips and falls account for 24 percent of all injuries and 13 percent of all chain saw injuries reported resulting from operators falling on the saw. At paragraph (e)(2)(x) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that prior to felling a tree the chain saw operator clear away brush or other potential obstacles that might interfere with cutting or using the retreat path. This provision adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. There were no comments opposing this requirement. OSHA believes this provision will help to reduce the number of injuries that result from loggers being hit by trees. According to the WIR survey, 24 percent of all injured loggers were hit by trees (Ex. 2&hyph;1). In addition, of employees reporting injuries, over one-fourth said that heavy brush, ground cover and hidden wood on the ground had contributed to their accident. At paragraph (e)(2)(xi) of the final rule, OSHA is prohibiting cutting directly overhead with a chain saw. This provision was contained in the proposed rule. Several commenters supported the proposed provision (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;10) and no comments were received opposing it. At paragraph (e)(2)(xii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be carried in a manner that will prevent operator contact with the chain and muffler. The proposed rule contained the same requirement. Evidence in the record suggests that this work practice already is being used extensively in the logging industry (Ex. 5&hyph;66). Some commenters said that for many years chain saw operators have carried the saw on their shoulder and used a felt and/or leather pad to protect their neck and shoulder from being cut by the chain or burned by the hot engine (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;63). OSHA notes that any other method of carrying the chain saw that prevents these hazards would also meet this requirement. In paragraphs (e)(2)(xiii) and (xiv) of the final rule, OSHA is specifying requirements for carrying a chain saw. In paragraph (e)(2)(xiii), OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be shut off or at idle before the operator starts a retreat after cutting a tree. This provision also clarifies OSHA's intent that these work practices apply not only to carrying the saw between cuts but also to retreating after a cut has been made. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. NIOSH supported this provision, and further recommended that OSHA should require the chain brake to be engaged when an operator is moving from one location to another, except while working on the same tree or log, regardless of distance traveled (Ex. 5&hyph;42). Another commenter also supported the NIOSH recommendation (Ex. 5&hyph;52). However, three other commenters opposed requiring saws to be at idle or shut off before starting a retreat (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;50, 5&hyph;66). One commenter said: The cutter may lose precious seconds worrying about compliance with the proposed standard, meanwhile a life could be in danger. Better to immediately remove the cutter from the base of the tree than worry about the saw (Ex. 5&hyph;50). OSHA believes that the requirement that chain saws be shut off or at idle before starting a retreat is necessary and can be accomplished without creating additional hazards for the operator. First, OSHA believes that carrying a chain saw with the chain moving may present a great hazard for the operator. The WIR survey indicates that a significant portion of chain saw injuries result from the operator falling on the saw, the saw chain contacting the employee, or the operator's hand slipping into the chain (Ex. 2&hyph;1).
