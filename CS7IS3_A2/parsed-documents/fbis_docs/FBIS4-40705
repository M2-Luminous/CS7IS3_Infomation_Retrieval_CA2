Aleksey Tkach, deputy head of the Republic's Interior Ministry explained the aim of the deployment for our radio station. [Begin Tkach recording] Yes, it is true that such an outfit was deployed. They are special forces from the 21st special detachment. The aim of their transfer is, generally speaking, the situation that has emerged in connection with the fact that the Crimean golden eagles [berkuty] are not carrying out their duties. Around a third of the Crimean golden eagles are busy guarding [Crimean President] Meshkov and [Crimean Interior Minister] Kuznetsov himself. They are not looking after public order. [end recording] [Marchenko] We asked the Crimean interior minister, Valeriy Kuznetsov, to comment on this statement by the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. [Begin Kuznetsov recording] There is no slacking. The Interior Ministry of the Crimean Republic is fulfilling its obligations. I will tell you one thing: They [Ukraine] are doing everything in their power now to dissolve the Interior Ministry of the Crimean Republic, which is against the Constitution of the Crimean Republic and even Ukraine's law on delegating powers. They are breaking a lot of the laws of both Ukraine and Crimea. [end recording]
