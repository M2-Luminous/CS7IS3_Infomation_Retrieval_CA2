It is exported to more than 10 countries and the needs for it are on a steady increase. Korea is one of the biggest magnesia clinker producers in the world. The country abounds in magnesite minerals needed for the production of magnesia clinker. Its deposits and quality rank first in the world. Magnesite is widely used not only as a fire-proof material resisting the temperature of more than 2,800 degrees centigrades but in the industrial domains for the production of metal magnesium, cement, rubber, paper, porcelain, etc. Its major producer is Tanchon in South Hamgyong Province. Deposits of magnesite in this area are estimated at several billion tons and its mining conditions are very favourable. The Yongyang mine called "white gold mountain" is mainly engaged in opencast mining. It was developed 50 years past. The Taehung general mining enterprise developed extensively in the 70s annually produces several hundred thousand tons of magnesia clinker, or nearly a half of the magnesite ore production of the country. Its production capacity is being expanded. There are modernly-equipped magnesite mineral processing bases in Tanchon, Kim Chaek, Chongjin and other areas. The state is increasing investment in the production of magnesia clinker.
