According to the latest Ifo economic climate test, the prospects for the next six months are better than they have been in a long time. The situation in the east is different; industry there considers the situation and prospects to be much worse. The only point on which companies in both parts of Germany agree is that they see increasing hopes of higher exports. Industry in Western Germany On the basis of the reports for its monthly test, the Munich-based Ifo Economic Research Institute has concluded that in the old laender, more orders were received than a month ago. While output remained the same, it was possible to somewhat reduce stocks. Hardly any companies are considering cutting back on production. Prices remained stable. The situation regarding producer goods worsened again, but the outlook for the future of exports improved. In engineering above all, production plans indicate that the recession is subsiding. The signs are that there will also be an improvement in the precision mechanics and optical instruments sectors. Manufacturers of producer goods in the electrical engineering sector remained skeptical, and manufacturers of delivery vehicles and trucks complained about declining demand. The situation is not quite as bad as it was for manufacturers of preproducts, and prospects were better for the chemical industry above all. In the case of hard goods, business remains bad, although there is more confidence about the future. Manufacturers of hard goods state that the current trend is a downward one. Industry in Eastern Germany Orders for manufacturing industry in the new laender just reached last month's level and no more. Companies continue to complain about poor sales, difficulties with finance, and poor technical equipment. In the case of producer goods, the situation has grown worse and expectations are more pessimistic. Only the shipbuilding industry is satisfied. The food, drinks, and tobacco industries are still experiencing a recession, and for the first time since 1993, those who take a negative view are in the majority. In the primary commodities and capital goods sectors, every fifth plant reports good prospects, but states that the overall situation is as bad as the end of the year. The consumer good sector described the situation as "almost satisfactory." Confidence regarding the future has somewhat declined. The Construction Industry There is confidence in the construction industry in both the old and the new laender. In the west, orders have somewhat increased compared to the previous year, from 2.9 months to 3.1 months. The upward trend primarily stems from surface engineering, from housing construction to be more precise. Nothing has changed in the construction of industrial facilities, and the state is placing fewer orders. In eastern Germany, the construction situation has worsened because of seasonal factors. Nevertheless, almost two-thirds of respondents were satisfied. The next six months appear to be more positive, and 20 percent are counting on good business. Capacity utilization stands at 67 percent, which is once again above the previous year's level. Companies in the surface construction field are pleased and optimism is spreading. In the civil engineering sector, negative views prevailed once again. In the prefabricated construction sector, the situation has become much worse once again, although a much more positive view is being taken of the future. The Wholesale Trade The situation is once again bad for wholesalers in the west, in January, just as in December, they failed to obtain the same level of sales as a year ago. The sector also expects demand to decline over the next six months. Only sales of hard goods were described as less disheartening, with only 20 percent of companies registering fewer sales than a year ago, compared to 40 percent in December. The business climate for the wholesale trade in the east grew much worse. Almost one-fifth of companies still want to reduce personnel over the next few months. However, there is a noticeable increase in confidence regarding future expectations, and the optimism is primarily based on the prospects for sales of raw materials, semi, capital goods, and food, drink and tobacco products. In the case of wholesalers of consumer goods, those that have been the worst affected are in clothing and footwear: 70 percent recorded lower sales than a year ago. The Retail Trade Consumer sales were bad throughout Germany in January. In the west, they were still somewhat more negative than in December and were "poor once again" in eastern Germany. Sales were markedly below the previous year's levels. To keep the decline in perspective, it should be borne in mind that this year many end of season sales will not take place until February. In the west, retail sales of consumer goods were somewhat less worse than a month ago and sales were not quite so far below the levels of a year ago. Sales were disappointing for hardware, glass, porcelain, ceramics, lighting, electrical goods, including audiovisual equipment. Sales were also unsatisfactory for watches, jewelry, and office equipment, although in the case of the latter, there are signs of an improvement. In addition to the furniture trade, the automobile sector also reported an improvement, although negative views were still in the majority. Following a drop in demand in January, retail traders in the food, drinks, and tobacco sectors now expect demand to pick up. In the east German retail trade sector, the situation for employees will continue to worsen: As in the previous month, one-third of companies want to reduce staffing levels.
