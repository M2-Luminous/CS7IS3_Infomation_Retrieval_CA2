The people are looking for the causes of the deterioration of our life and are inclined to see them in the sphere of monetary circulation and the work of the banks. They think the latter have caused their investments to lose value, they are "heating up" inflation, ruining the economy, etc. Money has become the measure of everything on earth, and nobody ever has enough of it. The banks are the main ones involved with money.... "In fact," says the republic's chief banker, Daulet Sembayev, "such an approach to the realities of the day is too simplistic." He was speaking before parliament at the plenary session on the morning of 16 June. And before that he "passed" through two committees of the Supreme Soviet--on finance and the budget and on the economic reform. The latter discussion with the deputies lasted four hours. The amount of attention paid to Daulet Sembayev is linked to the fact that the parliament had to approve the president's edict of 17 December of last year on his appointment to be chairman of the republic's National Bank. As we know, the previous members of the Supreme Soviet had approved Galym Baynazarov for this position for a period of six years. But after the parliament's authority was suspended he submitted to the republic president a request to resign because of health reasons. The president granted his request, placing Daulet Sembayev in the position of head of the National Bank. Every one of us is constantly dealing indirectly with banks. But many are unaware of the specific nature of their activity. And everything that has occurred in our former USSR has had a negative effect on their operation. First of all there was the collapse of economic ties and the destruction of the ruble zone. Additionally, our banking system, in the opinion of specialists, has remained immobile for decades and is the most outdated in the world. And now it must rise to the level of world standards almost all at once. Is this possible? Probably a lot could have been done during the past two or three years. It is up to specialists to analyze the reasons why this did not happen. But even today the National Bank has not yet entered the market age. It continues to perform many functions that are not properly within its realm. Forces are being dispersed and the normative base is in need of further improvement although, it seems, there are special laws on banks. Its possibilities of effectively influencing the monetary-credit policy are still limited. And nonetheless, in Daulet Sembayev's words, the National Bank is taking certain steps in the necessary direction. Today it is no longer working directly with economic agents and is not granting them direct credit but is concentrating its efforts on administering the state banking system. Credit auctions have become a regular event and payment relations are being arranged with the banks of the countries of the Commonwealth. More than 20 normative acts have been developed and will be enacted, work is proceeding on new laws, and measures are being taken to lower the inflation level to 12-15 percent by September and to 5-10 percent by the end of the year. We already managed to reach these goals in January-March of this year. The deputies were interested in the reports not only on the main directions of the banks' activity but also on more specific measures it has begun to implement. In particular, effective 1 July up to 40 percent of the credit resources will be distributed through auctions in the oblasts. The introduction of auctions--an element of the market in monetary circulation--is linked to the fact that only through them is it possible to establish the true value of money. The use of credit for its intended purpose is being monitored more closely. Effective 1 July a system of "mortgage credit" will be introduced whereby it will be possible to borrow money using securities, mainly government, as collateral. Three auctions have already been held for selling these securities. According to the logic of the transformations the republic National Bank should become a normal state bank that meets world standards, and all commercial banks should be executive bodies that preserve their authority as intermediaries that attract investments from the population and legal entities. The first version of this reformation has already been developed and sent to all interested parties for study. It earmarks the transformations of the branch banks, especially the Agroprombank, increases demandingness with respect to commercial banks, etc. As early as last year a supervisory department was created in the National Bank that was intended to protect the interests of the depositors. During the year it investigated the activity of 160 banks and 261 branches. For violations revealed during the course of these inspections 15 licenses were revoked and 200 million tenge in fines were imposed. The following detail is also of some interest: The structure of the apparatus in the National Bank has been reduced recently, and 143 jobs have been cut. A new form of wages will be introduced for employees whereby focus will be placed on bonuses for workers for their personal contribution to the institution's successful activity. Plans are being developed for training and retraining of personnel and the introduction of electronic equipment with future access to the consolidated computer network. In a word the National Bank is gradually making the changes demanded by life. But Daulet Sembayev's report did not satisfy all the deputies even though it was filled with information. The speaker was asked many questions and then the members of parliament exchanged opinions. The chairmen of the Supreme Council committees on finance and budget, Orazgeldy Baymuratov, and on economic reform, Orazaly Sabdenov, reported on the conclusions drawn at the committee meeting. Both sets of conclusions contained harsh critical remarks against the National Bank, but the former recommended that Daulet Sembayev be confirmed for the position and the latter abstaining. The same range of opinions existed among the deputies. Mukhtar Tyunikeyev, for example, was inclined to think that a certain amount of the blame for today's situation in the economy and finances lies with Daulet Sembayev personally, and Kazhmurat Nagmanov is convinced that it is wrong to blame the National Bank for all the problems because it cannot conduct an independent economic policy but carries out the will of the government and parliament. This range of opinions became more apparent during the voting. There were 95 members of parliament who voted in favor of approving the president's edict.
