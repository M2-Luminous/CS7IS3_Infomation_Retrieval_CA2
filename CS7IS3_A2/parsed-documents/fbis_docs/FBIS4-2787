It is China's only journal that caters to such a diverse readership. Founded on January 1, 1955, the quarto-format newspaper is run by the Dai and Jingpo nationalities autonomous prefecture in Dehong, southwest China's Yunnan Province. The area is inhabited by 930,000 residents, of which 51 percent are minorities of Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, Deang and Achang nationalities. When the four-page union news was launched, it was published in Chinese, Dai, Jingpo and Lisu, with each language taking up one page. The page in the Dai tongue, however, had to be handwritten because there was no print matrix for the language. Not until 1956, when the first governor of the prefecture made the steel matrix for the Dai language, did the newspaper begin to publish the four language versions separately. In 1989, this unique newspaper added one more version in Zaiwa, a branch of the Jingpo language. Being the only newspaper to cater to such a diverse readership in China, the unity news has a circulation of around 10,000. "This is a small number. It plays its role, though," said Li Xiangqian, editor-in-chief. He said that the paper symbolizes the unity of these minorities. The paper devotes most space to local news. It also carries short articles and pictures as well as international news from the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY. The newspaper has been used as a "textbook" by local primary schools and night schools. For nearly four decades, the paper has also served as a cradle for the growth of minority writers and singers. The publication caused quite a stir when its Dai and Jingpo versions made their way to neighboring Myanmar [Burma]. Some students of Zaiwa (the name of Jingpos living abroad) from Rangoon University even made trips to buy the paper. Now published three times a week in Chinese, twice a week in Dai and Jingpo and weekly in Lisu and Zaiwa, the newspaper has drawn attention from scholars in the United States, Japan and other countries, who have written to the editors requesting copies of the newspapers for their research.
