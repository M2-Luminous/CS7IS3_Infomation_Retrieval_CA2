[22 March] -- Malaysia and Singapore today signed the Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) on the multi-million ringgit [RM] Second Crossing Project scheduled for completion in 1997, to further spur economic growth in both countries. The new link -- a high-level box-girder 2 km bridge -- will connect Johor's proposed new township in Gelang Patah to Tuas in Singapore. Ninety percent or a length of 1.6 km to 1.7 km of the bridge will be built by Malaysia and the remainder by Singapore. There will be a dual three-lane carriageway under the integrated development package which will cost Malaysia about RM 1.6 billion and Singapore S$ [Singapore dollars] 400 million (RM 680 million). The Malaysian side of the project has been privatised while the Singapore Government will undertake its side of the project. Malaysia's package is divided into three components comprising the construction of the bridge, the two connecting expressways and the development of the Gelang Patah township. These have been awarded to United Engineers (M) [Malaysia] Bhd [Berhad -- private company] under a concession agreement. Upon completion, Malaysia will introduce the open toll system for those using the new link whereas Singapore has yet to decide if it would do the same. At present, the only link by land between both countries is the causeway connecting Woodlands and Johor Baru. "When completed, the new link and ancillary facilities on both sides of the Straits of Johor will help spur economic growth as well as alleviate traffic congestion at the existing causeway and surrounding roads," Works Minister Datuk Leo Moggie said at a joint Press conference at Carcosa Sri Negara today. Earlier, he represented Malaysia in signing the IGA with Singapore's Acting Minister for National Development and Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Lim Heng Kiang. [passage omitted]
