Policemen shot a woman and made numerous arrests. There was almost total absenteeism at places of employment due to a sudden work stoppage decreed by the Transportation Union in Anzoategui State. Neighborhood groups and student organizations of Eastern University (UDO), Puerto La Cruz branch, demanded that the Transportation Union and local municipalities reach an agreement on fares because an increase decreed in both cities exceeded the 30-percent mark, thus affecting the entire labor sector. The increase was approved by Barcelona Municipality in December but was revoked until three days ago in response to neighborhood committee protests. The neighborhood organizations' action resulted in the closure of principal roads, particularly an alternate road, all of which were obstructed by burning tires. The Metropolitan Police (PM) cleared the roads after 0900, while criminals who had infiltrated the demonstration tried to set fire to the Araguay gas station near the Santo Domingo housing area. Public transportation was suspended and thousands of workers were left stranded. The PM reported the arrest of eight persons, including students and neighborhood residents, who were traveling in a black pickup, license plates 383-BAR, loaded with used tires that the individuals intended to burn on various roads leading to public transportation routes. Bolivar and Sotillo Municipalities (Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz) decided to repeal the fare increase unilaterally approved by the Transportation Union in December. One woman was shot during the protests, and demonstrators set fire to a bus and a fuel truck while dozens of people were arrested amid veritable traffic chaos. The alternate route was most heavily affected by the protest, which included the participation of residents from more than 50 heavily populated neighborhoods along the route. Local residents began setting up barricades and burning tires to obstruct traffic in the early morning hours. Mrs. Rosa Blanco, 46 years old, was shot in Santo Domingo neighborhood when the PM arrived and indiscriminately began to set off a large number of tear gas bombs. Apparently a PM agent fired his regulation weapon and the bullet wounded the woman in the back. She was transferred to Las Garzas hospital where she underwent surgery. On the intercommunity highway, a group of demonstrators that included UDO students burned a tourism bus valued at several million bolivares that belonged to the Responsible Venezuela line. The demonstrators also torched a fuel truck owned by the SAET [expansion unknown] transportation company, license plate 754-AAR, as it was being driven in an area close to the UDO. To the south, residents of La Ponderosa and El Vinedo obstructed the highway to the coast and blocked traffic en route to the capital. By noon dozens of trucks and hundreds of privately owned vehicles were waiting for the highway to be opened. Cruz Bastardo and Arquimedes Barrios, leaders of the Neighborhood Federation, said the protests will continue until the Transportation Union discusses a more equitable fare system. The National Guard intervened at about 1100 after the bus was burned, and fierce clashes occurred between the military and the demonstrators, who had sought shelter at the UDO.
