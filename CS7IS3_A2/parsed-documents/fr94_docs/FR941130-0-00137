FR941130-0-00137 FR941130-0-00020 The American Society of Travel Agents filed a comment urging the Department to adopt the rule as proposed. The Air Transport Association reiterated the comment that it made in response to the ANPRM that it expressed no opinion about whether, or to what extent, the current Super Bowl rules should be made applicable to tours to other special events. However, ATA said that DOT should not make air carriers responsible for assuring that tour operators comply with the new rule. Concerning ATA's comment, the ANPRM and the NPRM did not propose, and the final rule does not include, any provisions that obligate direct air carriers to assure that tour operators comply with the rule. Except where an airline might choose to directly operate a Special Event Tour (i.e., to become the tour operator), a direct air carrier of a Special Event Tour will incur no greater or lesser obligations under this rule than it has in its capacity as a common carrier either certificated under 49 U.S.C. 41101 or holding a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49 U.S.C. 41301 (formerly sections 401 and 402 of the Federal Aviation Act). Of course, all direct air carriers will remain subject to 14 CFR 380.40 where charter air transportation is used, including charters that constitute Special Event Tours. Section 380.40 provides that a direct air carrier shall not perform a Public Charter unless it has made a reasonable effort to verify that all provisions of the Public Charter rule (14 CFR Part 380) have been complied with and that the charter operator's authority has not been suspended by the Department. We received identical letters from the National Association of Ticket Brokers and 38 individual ticket brokers. These commenters stated that the conditions of the proposed rule could not be met by either tour operators or ticket brokers. They said that in most cases the venue would not have the event tickets in hand sufficiently in advance of the event to make the proper distribution. They also commented that many venues will not deal with the ticket broker or tour operator directly, thus requiring the latter entities to procure tickets on the secondary market. They indicated that the proposed rule would have a chilling effect on the brokerage industry. Event USA, a ticket agency and tour provider, commented that the proposed rule is broad and over-reaching. The January 1994 Rose Bowl problem was an isolated instance and did not represent a trend, this commenter claimed. According to Event USA, for many events the tickets are not distributed until shortly before the event and there is no meaningful prospect for contracts. ``[K]nowing what orders the operator has, he can then determine what to buy as they are physically available, rather than buying those on a speculation basis.'' The commenter suggested that the rule be limited to the ``money back guarantee'' and a requirement for tour operators to have a contract for event tickets with ``established and reliable sources of tickets.'' The comments of the ticket brokers have not persuaded us to decrease the level of protection proposed in the NPRM. The rule does not require tour operators to have tickets in hand, as long as they have contracts (in the manner described in the rule) for tickets. In addition, the rule does not require a tour operator to have a contract for all the tickets it will ever need before it can begin advertising; advertising can commence as soon as the operator has contracts for tickets for ``a substantial number of seats on the tour.'' However, before a tour operator sells someone a tour that includes a ticket to the event, the operator must have a contract for the event ticket (or the ticket itself) for that individual. That is the entire point of the rule. It is designed to make clear that tour operators must end the practice of selling something that they do not have rights to at the time they sell it. This is consistent with Department deceptive practice rules (see 14 CFR 399.80 (c), (f) and (j)), as well as rules that prohibit the sale of air transportation until the provider has the required authority (see 14 CFR 201.5 and 14 CFR 380.25(a)). To that extent, the process described by Event USA is backwards; we wish to make clear the fact that we will not accept a situation where, on air tours that are promoted as including a ticket to a special event, the tour operator sells seats on the tour first and then attempts to find enough event tickets for those customers. Indeed, while the prohibition here is made specific to special events, such a deceptive practice has long been prohibited in a broad sense under current regulations (see 14 CFR 399.80 (c), (f) and (j)). We note that the proposed requirement for tour operators to have event tickets in hand or under contract was supported by the NCAA in its comments on the ANPRM. The Football Bowl Association (representing all 19 post-season college bowl games) and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, while not commenting specifically on the proposed requirement for firm contracts or tickets in hand, did not take exception to this provision and urged adoption of the rule.
