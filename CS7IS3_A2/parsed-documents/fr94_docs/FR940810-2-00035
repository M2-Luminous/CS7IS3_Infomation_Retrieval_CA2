FR940810-2-00035 FR940810-2-00023 Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement, Los Alamos National Laboratory AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Advance Notice of Intent to Prepare a Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement for Continued Operations of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. SUMMARY: The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is providing advance notice of its intent to prepare a Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement (SWEIS) for its Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Los Alamos, New Mexico, a DOE multipurpose research and development laboratory. The SWEIS will be prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq .], the Council on Environmental Quality NEPA regulations [40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508] and the DOE NEPA regulations [10 CFR Part 1021]. The SWEIS will analyze the potential environmental impacts of continuing to operate LANL and reasonable alternative operating envelopes. With this Advance Notice, DOE initiates a prescoping process to identify possible issues and alternatives to be analyzed in the SWEIS. As provided at 10 CFR 1021.311(b), this Advance Notice provides an early opportunity to inform the public of the SWEIS and to solicit early public comments. After this prescoping process, DOE will publish a Notice of Intent (NOI) which will identify the proposed scope of the SWEIS, including the proposed alternatives and issues developed through this prescoping process. Although schedules have not yet been developed, it is DOE's intent to start the full SWEIS process as soon as possible and complete the process as quickly as possible. The public is invited to comment on this Advance Notice and to attend public information meetings and workshops addressing SWEIS issues. DATES: Written comments on the scope of the SWEIS are invited from the public. Prescoping comments should be postmarked by October 31, 1994. The Department will again invite comments on the scope of the SWEIS after the NOI is published. The Department will hold public information meetings and workshops in conjunction with prescoping. These will be held at various places in northern New Mexico. The times, dates, and format of these meetings will be announced in the local press no later than two weeks prior to the meetings and publicized in other ways as appropriate. ADDRESSES: Written comments on the scope of the SWEIS or other matters concerning the SWEIS, or requests to be put on a mailing list for future information about the SWEIS, should be addressed to: M. Diana Webb, Los Alamos Area Office, U.S. Department of Energy, 528 35th Street, Los Alamos, NM 87544, Attn: LANL SWEIS, (505) 665&hyph;6353, Facsimile (505) 665&hyph;4504.
