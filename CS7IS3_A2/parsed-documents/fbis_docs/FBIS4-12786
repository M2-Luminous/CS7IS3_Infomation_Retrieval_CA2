Al-Amin, a pro-Syrian, warned ties between the two countries could worsen if the request was turned down and blamed "certain French cabinet ministers for being responsible for the death of Lebanese people because of their support for 'Awn." He did not name the ministers but told the London-based AL-HAYAH newspaper received in Beirut "they are trying to destroy what is left of French-Lebanese relations." Al-Amin, who last year headed the Lebanese branch of the Syrian ruling Ba'th Party, said the ministers' stance did not reflect official French policy. General 'Awn headed a military government in the late 1980s until he was driven out of the presidential palace in 1990 in a joint Syrian-Lebanese offensive. He was given refuge at the French embassy in Lebanon and was banished the following year to France, where he was given political asylum on condition he avoided any political activity, including political statements. But in a recent interview with AL-HAYAH, 'Awn blasted the Beirut government and voiced support for a federation in Lebanon.
