"The action authorized by the UN Security Council resolution at present is not guaranteed of cooperation and consent by the parties to the conflict in Rwanda," the spokesman said in the weekly news conference. "In view of this, China has abstained on the vote." He said that since the Rwanda crisis occurred, China has constantly followed the development of the events in that country. "At present the situation in Rwanda is continuing to aggravate and the humanitarian conditions in that country are becoming increasingly grim, and we support efforts of the international community to help end the crisis in Rwanda and remove the miserable plight of the Rwanda people as soon as possible. "In the meantime, it is our belief that it is an indispensable condition for the success of UN Peace-keeping operation to obtain the consent of the parties concerned, and to obtain the cooperation of the countries and regional organizations concerned," he said.
