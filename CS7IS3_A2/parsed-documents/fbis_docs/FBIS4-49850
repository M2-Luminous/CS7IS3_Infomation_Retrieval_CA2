Participants in the meeting, presided over by Premier Li Peng, decided that the draft regulations will be revised before being issued by the State Council. They agreed that since coming into force on February 22, 1992, the State Security Law has played a significant role in maintaining state security, defending the people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system, and ensuring the progress of the reform, opening-up and socialist modernization drive. The formulation of the detailed regulations is needed to enforce the law more effectively, they noted.
