Both the right- and the left-wing politicians agree in emphasizing that unemployment is not a matter of fate, and certainly not merely a result of economic policy, since action against unemployment can even be a priority. On both the Right and the Left, there is talk of a "social pact" or a "new social contract." Francois Mitterrand set the tone during his New Year's message at the beginning of the year by pleading, albeit in vain, for a social contract for employment to mobilize all parties, i.e, the state, employers, and trade unions, around the "most serious question facing us at the end of this century." With less than a year to go until the presidential election, there is nothing amazing about such convergent approaches, because it is most likely that the election will revolve around this issue. However, if we take a closer look, the consensus is only apparent. During the Conference on Social Transformation held in Rennes, Michel Rocard rejected any kind of timid or overly cautious action against unemployment. "The problem," he said, "is to stop the endless discussions and take strong and more powerful action than we have done so far." Above all, the first secretary of the PS [Socialist Party] wants to mobilize social forces in the field, reactivate political will, and revive the idea of reducing the workweek to four days. He did not, however, take the plunge by advocating an economic policy that is genuinely different from the one followed from 1988 to 1993, which was based on the defense of the strong franc and on maintaining the overall balance of forces within society. Only Lionel Jospin called for a "major change in our country's economic policy, which would give priority to the fight against unemployment and in favor of employment." One year after the death of Pierre Beregovoy, everything still leads us to believe that the Socialists, if they were to return to power, would be less orthodox in their economic policy and, in particular, less hesitant about the suitability of letting public deficits rise as long as they make it possible to revive economic activity and take action to promote employment. During the Convention on Labor organized by the RPR [Rally for the Republic], Jacques Chirac went further, supporting Edouard Balladur's economic and social policy, while at the same time letting it be understood between the lines -- but less harshly than Philippe Seguin -- that this policy was proving to be insufficient and that we must turn toward another policy. He emphasized that unemployment is not "one priority among others," but that it is "more important than anything else." Paradoxically, Labor Minister Michel Giraud agreed with Mr. Chirac "without reservation," thus pretending to be unaware that his statements included an implicit disavowal of his five-year law on employment, which he is having so much trouble implementing. At the same time, Edouard Balladur reiterated his desire to "build another society which would differ from the easy-growth or crisis society." For all this, the prime minister does not intend to change his economic policy, even if he knows that slowing down the growth of unemployment, or even some sort of haphazard stabilization, will not be enough to convince the French that his action against unemployment has succeeded. Shifting Into High Gear In order to combat the exclusion which, according to Jacques Chirac, "desocializes and alienates people," the politicians are all more or less aware that we must shift into high gear, but they still have some differences of opinion about how this should be done. There is agreement on the need to reduce labor costs, but each person favors his own method for doing so, since the debate on a minimum wage for young people and youth job training contracts has revealed a genuine gap between the Right and the Left. They are all talking about local community services, about making better use of the 500 billion francs currently used for unemployment benefits, and about flexibility and the new organization of work, but the same words do not always mean the same thing. Already, the debate on the 32-hour workweek, revived by the Right during the debate on the five-year employment bill, revealed the persistence of conflicting approaches with regard to reducing working hours, depending on whether or not it is accompanied by wage cuts. So, should the priority given to actions to counter unemployment be formally reaffirmed in a referendum, which would require an amendment to the Constitution's Article 11 to extend its scope to include social problems? That is [Assembly Speaker] Philippe Seguin's iconoclastic proposal. On Monday, 2 May he received the support of Jacques Chirac. However, if it proves "necessary" and even essential for politicians to renew their debate on the best ways to fight unemployment by placing it at the center of their policies, then it is hard to see what a referendum on "zero social exclusion" would contribute to the debate. Such a proposal seems just as contestable and demagogic as the one made by Bernard Tapie, who wanted to make unemployment illegal on the grounds that the right to work is enshrined in the Constitution. It is not necessary to hold a referendum to raise awareness. To become aware of the urgent need for a new approach, one need only observe the implosion of a society undermined by unemployment and exclusion, which is already operating at different speeds. And there is more than a risk of this happening, unlike what Mr. Chirac would have us believe.
