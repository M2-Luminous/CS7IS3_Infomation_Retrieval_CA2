FR941020-2-00044 FR941020-2-00032 To determine whether we should grant approved status to ASHI as a private, nonprofit organization for accrediting laboratories under CLIA for testing of human specimens in the specialty of histocompatibility as it requested, we conducted a detailed and in-depth comparison of ASHI's requirements for its laboratories to those of CLIA and evaluated whether ASHI's standards are at least as stringent as the requirements of 42 CFR part 493 when taken as a whole. In summary, we evaluated whether ASHI: •Provides reasonable assurance to us that it requires the laboratories it accredits to meet requirements that are equal to or more stringent than the CLIA condition level requirements (for histocompatibility) and would, therefore, meet the condition level requirements of CLIA if those laboratories had not been granted deemed status and had been inspected against condition level requirements; and •Meets the requirements of §493.506, which specifies the Federal review and approval requirements of private, nonprofit accreditation organizations. As specified in our regulations at §493.506, our review of a private, nonprofit accreditation organization seeking approved status under CLIA includes, but is not limited to, an evaluation of: •Whether the organization's requirements for its accredited laboratories are equal to or more stringent than the condition level requirements of the CLIA regulations; •The organization's inspection process to determine: _The composition of the inspection teams, qualifications of the inspectors, and the ability of the organization to provide continuing education and training to all of its inspectors; _The comparability of the organization's full inspection and complaint inspection requirements to ours, including but not limited to inspection frequency, and the ability to investigate and respond to complaints against its accredited laboratories; _The organization's procedures for monitoring laboratories that it has found to be out of compliance with its requirements; _The ability of the organization to provide us with electronic data and reports that are necessary for effective validation and assessment of the organization's inspection process; _The ability of the organization to provide us with electronic data related to the adverse actions resulting from unsuccessful proficiency testing (PT) participation in HHS approved PT programs, as well as data related to the PT failures, within 30 days of the initiation of the action; _The ability of the organization to provide us with electronic data for all its accredited laboratories and the areas of testing; _The adequacy of numbers of staff and other resources; and _The organization's ability to provide adequate funding for performing the required inspections; and •The organization's agreement with us that requires it to: _Notify us of any laboratory that has had its accreditation denied, limited, suspended, withdrawn, or revoked by the accreditation organization, or that has had any other adverse action taken against it by the accreditation organization within 30 days of the action taken; _Notify us within 10 days of a deficiency identified in an accredited laboratory where the deficiency poses an immediate jeopardy to the laboratory's patients or a hazard to the general public; _Notify us of all newly accredited laboratories within 30 days;
