Have you managed, since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, to obtain the extra concessions you were seeking? [Brittan] The date of 15 February did not simply mark the end of a technical stage: Each party had to officially make its offer by this date. We have used the last two months effectively to try to obtain more generous offers from certain of our partners, but we had no intention of reopening the negotiations held in the run-up to 15 December. The concessions made by all sides can still be improved until the very last moment, and that moment, as always in negotiations, has not yet arrived. I am nevertheless convinced that, in the long term, the European Union will obtain a result that will represent a real improvement over what was obtained on 15 December, especially in the area of textiles. [Paolini] Who, up to now, has not made the effort you would have hoped for? [Brittan] Japan. That country has already done a lot, we must admit it, but we have asked for a considerable extra effort in the sectors that concern a great many of our companies. However, it is true that to date we have not been very successful. [Paolini] Experts have relativized these initial Japanese efforts saying that Tokyo is only bringing its official customs duties down to the levels actually applied in recent years.... [Brittan] That is an exaggeration. However, as in all exaggerations, there is some truth. Indeed, the degree to which the Japanese market has opened up to date is not as significant as it might appear at first sight. [Paolini] This is a sentiment that is shared by the American authorities since, this weekend, Tokyo refused to make any commitment on import levels. What do you think of this failure and the risks of a trade war that it carries? [Brittan] I was not at all surprised by this failure. Neither do I favor the approach taken by the Americans, for two reasons. Firstly, I am convinced that this method would not have positive results. Secondly, if you believe in free trade and the market economy, you cannot go down the road to the carving up of markets. The Americans had, in a way, taken this path. [Paolini] You must admit that it has served them quite well up to now, especially when you look at the results obtained by the Community over the last 10 years.... [Brittan] For the reasons I have explained, I took a different approach. We set up a mechanism with the Japanese that lets us examine in detail the reasons for our trade deficits. This analysis should make it possible to take a fresh look at tariff obstacles, structural problems, and the lack of effort on the part of our own companies. Then, on this basis, we will try and define the measures we need to implement to remedy the situation. This analysis is almost complete, and I am fairly optimistic. I am not saying we will get immediate and concrete results in all areas, but I do think that come the spring we will have obtained more than the Americans. [Paolini] You took a similar approach with the Americans to persuade them to open up their public markets. The next stage depends on the results of a study that you commissioned with Mickey Kantor on the true extent of liberalization on both sides of the Atlantic. How far have you gone with this? [Brittan] We have had the results of the study for some time and now we have to digest its conclusions. We already concluded a partial agreement with the United States last year, and we will continue to negotiate on the basis of this study to try and obtain more. As in 1993, I am looking for a greater opening up of the American public markets while refusing any imbalance between the two sides. [Paolini] Who is the more protectionist according to this study? [Brittan] For the time being I will simply say that our concerns have been justified. [Paolini] On 28 February you will be in Beijing to negotiate with another important trading partner. Exchange, cooperation, etc. are all on the agenda, but so is the issue of China's candidacy for GATT membership. Will you go armed with a proposal? [Brittan] The decision has not yet been made, but the idea is still to open negotiations with this vast country -- the last one which does not have a market economy yet. Negotiations will be aimed at persuading China to accept the normal rules of international trade to which all the other GATT countries are subject. We must first have agreement on that basic point. Only then can we discuss the details and the measures that we and the Chinese are ready to accept. When I say "we" I mean the international community as a whole because, for example, the American position is not exactly the same as our own. Moreover, when I speak of "details," it must be clear that I do not mean unimportant matters. How could it be otherwise, when we are talking about child labor. However, that is as much as I am prepared to say for the time being. [Paolini] Returning to GATT, can you describe any recent progress in other aspects of the Uruguay Round? [Brittan] No, it is still much too early to say what the results are. For example, there are still two more years of discussions ahead of us on financial services and a little less than two years, I hope, for maritime transport and steel production. These are issues for which, to date, we have only established a general approach and which we must now conclude in detail. [Paolini] Should we fear that the interest shown by Washington in the relationship between trade, the environment, and working standards is aimed at slowing down the creation of the World Trade Organization? [Brittan] That is a baseless fear. Neither the United States nor any other country has set out preconditions for the creation of this organization. The international community is simply agreed that a working program should be set up to examine the links between trade and problems of the environment -- on this point and on this point alone. I do not think there will be discussions on these points when the agreement is signed in Marrakech. Your question reveals the impression the Americans could have given -- perhaps in some of the things President Clinton has said -- when they stressed firmly that the environment and working conditions must take priority in the next phase of negotiations. [Paolini] If we now leave the international scene and turn to the European Union, the overriding concern is the seriousness of the unemployment situation. What do you say to those people who put the blame for this on the choices made at Maastricht? [Brittan] The White Paper on Growth, Competition and Employment provided an in-depth and pertinent analysis of the factors of this crisis. One thing is clear: The cause of our problems does not lie in the fact that we have followed overly monetarist "Maastrichian" policies. The authors of the treaty did not consider strict monetarism to be more important than employment. Their analysis revealed that the precondition for a healthy economy is the reduction of budget deficits, and therefore this is a precondition to growth and job creation. It is not about choosing monetary orthodoxy at the expense of the real economy. I believe this analysis remains entirely justified. If we abandon it, it means we are prepared for more inflation. If we look at economic history we see that those countries that followed anti-inflationary policies obtained the best results. [Paolini] That theory does not go down too well with the unemployed. Are you not afraid of a social explosion in Europe? [Brittan] I am convinced the economic situation will improve. We are coming out of a recession. Not very quickly, it is true, but the signs should be clearer by spring. Having said that, the structural problems will remain. The white paper indicated the efforts the Twelve will have to make, both individually and collectively. The GATT negotiations showed us what the Twelve can achieve when they are united. We can tackle all the basic problems if we go about it in a realistic way and with long-term vision. As for the immediate risks of a social explosion, I cannot say they do not exist, but the situation varies from one member state to the next. If you think I am being rather optimistic, that's because I am can also see, parallel to the progressive improvement in the economy, the start of the implementation of concrete structural measures identified by the white paper. [Paolini] At the European summit meeting to be held in Corfu in June, the Twelve will appoint a successor to Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. Are you a candidate for the post? [Brittan] I would not use the word "candidate" because that implies an electoral campaign. Quite frankly, it is not a question of candidacy or campaigning. The president of the European Commission is appointed by the heads of state and government. However, I have been a member of the Commission for five years now, and I have done many things there. If the heads of state and government decide I can continue my work as president, I would be very honored and am prepared to take on the task.
