The plans concern all Estonia's regions and the conspirators have the necessary armament, Niklus told yesterday's traditional picket at the Russian Naval HQ. The intended date is not known yet, he admitted. Niklus added that subversive groups are located in several towns and they intend to present their actions to the international public as a civil war, which would justify the intervention of the Russian Army. Niklus also claimed that the evacuation of the Paldiski nuclear reactors will cost the Estonian taxpayers 10 million kroons and called for the suspension of granting residence permits to aliens until the completion of the troops withdrawal. Riigikogu [parliament] Vice Chairman Tunne Kelam later dismissed the call, explaining that the suspension would be an unreasonable act.
