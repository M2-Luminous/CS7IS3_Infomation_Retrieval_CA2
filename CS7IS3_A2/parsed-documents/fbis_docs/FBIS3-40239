Dozens of aid organisations operating in the war-torn country rely on protection from United Nations troops on the ground to deliver supplies. Even with this protection, Larry Hollingworth, who is responsible for all convoys organised by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Bosnia, estimated that they were only meeting 20 percent of the need. "We'll bring in in January, if we're lucky, about 20 percent of the needs. It was 17.9 percent last month and 10 the month before," he said. [passage omitted] "If the blue helmets leave, there will be certain chaos. All our foreign staff will leave because there will no longer be any security cover. To stay without them is totally out of the question," said Dominique Hopital, coordinator for Handicap International in Zenica, central Bosnia. Zenica has become the regional base for most of the non-governmental organisations trying to bring aid to the population. But the organisations warn that their already difficult job will become virtually impossible if the UN troops leave. "We can't do anything without them. The humanitarian (organisations) and the military are inextricably tied. Of course that raises certain ethical problems, but on the ground we have no choice," said Nathalie Lauriac also from Handicap International. From Zenica the UNHCR controls all aid convoys to Bosnia either via Sarajevo airport or by the so-called Diamond route linking the Croatian coast with central Bosnia. Hollingworth said: "I can't see the airlift surviving because it needs the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] to keep going. For the other kind of aid it would be possible but it would be difficult. "If the decision were taken for UNPROFOR to leave, it may be possible for UNHCR to stay on its own. But without the military on the ground, we would certainly feel more exposed. "The most important thing to remember is that there's a desperate need for food here. No matter who goes or who stays, if no one meets that need, then a lot of people are going to die." Other aid workers also said they would have no option but to close down their operations in Bosnia if the UN troops pulled out. Christophe Grange from Solidarites (Solidarity) said: "If everybody leaves, we won't stay." Added Pierre Dorbes from Pharmaciens sans Frontieres (Pharmacists without borders): "We would hope to be able to stay if conditions allowed it, but we have not come here to be killed ourselves. For the moment we cannot work without UNPROFOR. If they leave we wouldn't last longer than three to four days."
