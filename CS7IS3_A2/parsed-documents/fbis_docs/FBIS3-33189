As you know, this activity has prompted many different opinions on whether this activity should be allowed in this time of crisis in our country. Alejandro, your idea please. [Rodriguez] Yes, Juan Carlos. The self-employment activity as a labor system in the country was implemented some five months ago by Decree Law 141. But like anything that breaks the routine, anything that introduces something new, the self-employment issue has prompted a major conflict in our society. [Roque] There are many skeptics... [Rodriguez] Yes. And there are many aspects to discuss. But I will refer only to the extreme positions. There are those who propose an unrestricted promotion of that activity, without any control whatsoever. And there are those who are very suspicious, fearful, and take this activity as a change in the social and economic projection of our social activity. But I think we must put this activity on a scale. We must take this self-employment as a new activity joining the Cuban labor system. We must take it as a feasible alternative, something that will reduce the employment problem at this time of recession, and as a possibility, an alternative way of providing services and consumable goods to the people under severe economic conditions. [Roque] The people must understand that this is the first decree, the first measure being adopted, and that all measures have to go through several stages. The first stage is to prepare the measure and then to publish it. Then it must be implemented; the consolidation of the measure will come afterwards. This is important because consolidation cannot be achieved overnight. It is a process that takes time. [Rodriguez] I agree. But we must also take it in a good sense, as a great prospect. We cannot take all the measures being adopted in the Cuban economy as a partial solution, as a temporary patch-up solution to current problems, but as a prospect of how our economy will be designed for the future. I think this is very important. All these measures are qualitative changes. I am one of those who are convinced of the economic and political feasibility of self- employment, although it must be submitted to rigorous control and oversight. But I am also convinced that it must be submitted to other economic control systems, to discipline the work of these individuals who are self-employed. I also think that well established and well controlled self-employment as a social discipline is a useful activity and must be defended. Besides, I think the people will appreciate this activity because in the end we will all benefit from it. [Roque] Jose, you were just talking about the control that must be imposed on self-employed workers. Why? There are those who talk about the deviation of state resources. It is true, this deviation of resources is a common practice. But why are they deviated? [Rodriguez] The deviation of resources must not be related to the self-employment activity. Sometimes we mistake the images of things with the things themselves: the consequences with the causes. The deviation is one problem, a weak and vulnerable side of our economy that occurs in many areas of the Cuban economy. [Roque] Let us take this under the current situation. [Rodriguez] Of course, deviation of resources can also take place in the self-employment area. When there is no stable state supply of products to sell, these people could be using deviated or illegal resources.... [Roque, interrupting] But we cannot stop being objective. This is real. This is taking place, and we cannot avoid it. [Rodriquez] That is right. But what we have, we cannot.... [pauses] Since this harmful practice can be reversed, and since it can also become common practice, we cannot confront this problem in the final stage, when the man is already selling the product. I think the control problem affects all aspects of our economy; and that must be resolved at the root, at the place where the money is deviated. But it is also good to create justice, Juan Carlos. We must not be mistaken, because people often identify self- employed workers as individuals who only want to rob the people through dirty tricks, individuals who profit from the people's needs, and individuals who are deviating resources. [Roque] That is not always true. [Rodriguez] No. I know honest people and hard workers. And Decree 141 was made for those people, for those who want to make a living by honest work, perhaps a better living than average but a living supported by their work, by an honest and clean activity. [Roque] However, honest work demands clear and continuous control. How can this be achieved? Is the country prepared for strict control of self-employment? [Rodriguez] The first impression is that the country is not prepared. But this decree has been in effect for only five months. These changes are taking place in a very dynamic way; besides, this is a very decentralized activity. It will not be resolved by the state council or by any ministry. This will be solved at the level of the people's council, or at the municipal level. We already have some experience on this. There are provinces and there are regions. There are places where self-employment activity is more intense, as in Holguin, for instance. But this is the place also where it is more rigorously controlled, and where there is the greatest will to implement it because people are convinced that it is useful and is a way of solving many daily and social problems. But the role of the people's council is decisive. The council must decide on this activity in its territory. The measures are written, but they must be fulfilled. There are also other control elements. I an certain that in times of absolute shortage, of scarcity, it is possible that some people would be helping others to sell things, to use illegal resources. But there are other aspects as well. We must look at this activity in a realistic manner. To the extent that our economy is reactivated, as production increases, there will always be the possibility that self-employed workers will gradually be supplied raw materials and provisions purchased from the state. [Roque] What about the consolidation stage? This is an important stage. We can talk about advantages, about the negative and positive aspects of a given activity, especially when measures are adopted to solve this set of problems, and when a new activity emerges, such as the supply of staples by the self-employed. [Rodriguez] As for the consolidation stage, obviously there are also other control measures. A new decree on violations is under discussion. This decree will cover and punish all irregularities in this area. I believe a strong oversight body will be created. But there is another problem: economic changes and tax policy. The self-employed must now pay a minimum tax. But this tax is variable, and must be increased in accordance with the increase in their income. The income declaration is something new for us and is a way to control the self-employed. [Roque] We are now getting to the end of our program. Can you make a final analysis of the subject we are discussing? [Rodriguez] I simply want to stress the fact that among all the transformations taking place in the economic area, self-employment represents an alternative that supplements other activities. I think it is a useful activity and a way of seeking development. It is also an opportunity for a group of persons to develop their potentials in a decentralized, simple, and dynamic manner, to render services and goods to the people. But this activity, to prevent abuses, must be subject to strict social discipline and control. It must be demonstrated to society that this is an honest activity, and that individual initiatives must be promoted, though in a controlled manner, observing the rules of cleanliness and of service to society. Today I wanted to talk about the good and honest self-employed workers who seek to make a living through their honest effort, work, and initiative. [Roque] Everything you are saying creates an economic culture, an economic culture the country needs today more than ever. But we can also say that this economic culture has not been sufficiently assimilated, not only by the people, but also by those who are in charge of leading important activities like this. [Rrodriguez] Yes. I think we must strive for the development of this alternative, of this new activity. We hope it will grow healthy and develop well because it is also a way of providing alternatives to the people, alternative solutions to our problems, of coexisting with them without fear, because I am certain that it will not disrupt the current economic policy. It is only a necessary supplement of activities, which will make economic relations more dynamic. [Roque] Our appreciation to Jose Alejandro Rodriguez for participating with us in this program.
