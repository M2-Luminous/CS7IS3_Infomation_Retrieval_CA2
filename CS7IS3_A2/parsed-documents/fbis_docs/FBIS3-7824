My first question to you: Why did these attacks take place just now? [Woerner] That is quite simple: This was the first violation of the no-fly zone by area planes [Flaechenflugzeuge], which we have noticed throughout the year that have been carrying out this operation. We announced that we would act, or rather had to act, after we had issued warnings because we want this no-fly zone to be respected. In addition, our pilots were able to notice that these combat planes were in the process of dropping bombs -- that is, fighting against targets on the ground. [Van Kampen] Is there not the danger that the conflict will escalate now? [Woerner] I think the opposite will happen. One will learn to take NATO seriously, and one will learn to respect the no-fly zone and also to take other UN resolutions seriously, too. That means, I rather suspect, that the entire matter will lead to a calming down of the situation than to the opposite. [Van Kampen] What happens if the Serbs retaliate? There are already reports that towns like Tuzla, for instance, are being attacked more intensively now. [Woerner] I think there is no connection between the two events. Tuzla has been attacked repeatedly in the past few days. In addition, so far none of the three parties has claimed the planes. It would be very strange behavior if they were to retaliate. I do not think that this is going to happen because the entire matter is an operation that is fully covered by the United Nations. As I have heard, even the Russians have rather supported this action. [Van Kampen] Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary General.
