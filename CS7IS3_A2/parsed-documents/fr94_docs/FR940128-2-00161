ACTION: Notice of realty action; exchange of public lands in Jefferson County, Idaho. SUMMARY: The following described public lands have been determined to be suitable for disposal by exchange under section 206 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1716: Boise Meridian, Idaho T. 5 N., R. 39 E., Sec. 19, lots 23 and 24; Sec. 20, lots 13 and 19. The area described contains 36.90 acres in Jefferson County. In exchange for these lands, the United States will acquire the following described lands from Gary H. Rhodes: Boise Meridian, Idaho T. 5N., R. 39 E., Sec. 18, lot 5. The area described contains 32.33 acres in Madison County. DATES: The publication of this notice in the Federal Register will segregate the public lands described above to the extent that they will not be subject to appropriation under the public lands laws. As provided by the regulation of 43 CFR 2201.1(b), any subsequently tendered application, allowance of which is discretionary, shall not be accepted, shall not be considered as filed and shall be returned to the applicant. The segregative effect of this notice will terminate upon issuance of patent or in two years, whichever occurs first. ADDRESSES: Detailed information concerning the exchange is available for review at the Idaho Falls District Office, 940 Lincoln Road, Idaho Falls, Idaho 83401. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of the land exchange is to allow BLM to acquire riparian land which is in good condition and identified as prime bald eagle habitat. The public land selected by the proponent would enhance his livestock operation and is currently difficult for BLM to manage because of the land pattern. The exchange is consistent with the Bureau of Land Management land use plans, and the public interest will be well served by making this exchange. The exchange will include surface and mineral estates. The federal and non-federal lands were appraised at equal fair market value. The exchange will be subject to: 1. All valid existing rights, including any right-of-way easement, permit or lease of record. 2. A reservation to the United States of a right-of-way for ditches and canals constructed by the authority of the United States under the Act of August 30, 1890 (43 U.S.C. 945). For a period of 45 days from the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register , interested parties may submit comments to the District Manager at the above address. Objections will be reviewed by the State Director who may sustain, vacate, or modify this realty action. In the absence of any objections, this realty action will become final determination of the Department of the Interior. Dated: January 12, 1994. Richard G. Murua, Acting District Manager.
