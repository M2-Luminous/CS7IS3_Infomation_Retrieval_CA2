The party is headed by Klaus Kinkel, a politician whom party colleagues and opponents alike consider to be overstrained. Things are not easy for Klaus Kinkel. Each week brings a new disaster. The FDP chairman still had not recovered from his party's election defeats in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein when he was confronted with new problems: Next weekend, the expansion of the European Union [EU] might fail for the time being. While flying from Moscow to Paris last week, domestic horror reports reached the foreign minister. If elections are held in Potsdam in June, then his party will face the next fall below the magic 5 percent. Rumbustious Ventriloquist In the view of leading FDP politicians, Kinkel is responsible for many crises. Under Genscher, the disaster in Lower Saxony would have been avoided. "Genscher," one of the politicians says, "would have guided the Lower Saxons toward a social-liberal coalition right from the beginning. With the slogan of preventing a red-green coalition or Schroeder's solo government, they would have entered the Landtag. However, turning half-heartedly toward the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] eight days before the elections just looks like opportunism." Genscher led the party, even when Lambsdorff was already chairman. But Kinkel, the accusation says, does not lead, but just lets business run along. When he reacts, he is rambunctious. "A rambunctious ventriloquist," a Foreign Ministry official says mockingly, referring to the appearances of his supreme boss. Some top officials have already asked for transfers to German embassies abroad. They dislike the German foreign minister's inclination to pursue policy more with his guts than with his mind. Kinkel likes pounding the table. Last Wednesday [23 March], he elevated the return of the cultural assets captured during World War II "to a test" of German-Russian relations and energetically threatened with "unfavorable" strains on "overall relations." Quickly Offended The German foreign minister often threatens: He wanted to force the Serbs to their knees; he wanted to break the neck of the Spanish if they delay the accession of the new members of the EU. Later denials are ineffective. What emanated the modest charm of youthful recklessness at the beginning of his term of office is just embarrassing now. The man is quickly offended, especially about the press' scolding of politicians, but also by other countries. He had the French ambassador summoned to the Foreign Ministry because of some critical remarks and thus inflated a comment by a diplomat into a German-French affair. Christian Social Union [CSU] and Christian Democratic Union [CDU] politicians are ridiculing the "foreign minister's old fashioned Swabian ways." SPD Bundestag Group Chairman Klose politely recommended speaking German and not Swabian at international negotiations because the dialect is a bit coarse. On top of everything else, Kinkel yesterday had to apologize in the French newspaper LE MONDE. Two years after assuming office, the foreign minister has largely gambled away his party's most important asset -- namely the FDP's foreign policy reputation linked with the name of Genscher. Certainly, Genscher left a lot of unsolved problems to his successor. However, in contrast to Kinkel, Genscher had ideas and visions that went beyond the specific day. They were often indefinite. Genscher loved to keep as many paths as possible open, to let developments mature and then give them the final kick. Kinkel, who is a doctor of jurisprudence, on the other hand, looks for legal positions in the political business. Where Genscher knew how to implement German interests with as little noise as possible, Kinkel is loudly calling for a German seat on the UN Security Council. Quarrel About Rau At Whitsun, when the German president will be elected in the Reichstag building, Kinkel will be facing the next crisis. The FDP chairman wants to vote for CDU candidate Roman Herzog on the third ballot. In contrast, the strong North Rhine-Westphalian FDP wants to vote for Rau. Leading FDP members also expect FDP candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher to give a restrained recommendation for Rau. For instance, she could recommend her electors after the second ballot to make their decision independent of the yoke of coalition discipline. Thus, she would speak for Rau. By voting for Herzog, Kinkel wants to give a signal for the FDP's reliability as a partner for the CDU/CSU. His opponents in the party clearly want to stress the party's independence. The election will give a signal in any case -- that of Kinkel's weakness as a leader. The old liberal Gerhart Baum criticizes the FDP for often lacking inner independence: "In the FDP, there are so-called coalition liberals, who can only imagine a coalition with the CDU/CSU." In the inner circle around Kinkel and Bundestag Group Chairman Solms, the decision has long been on a coalition statement in favor of the CDU/CSU. At least, upon Genscher's urging, Kinkel seems to have decided not to have the coalition statement for the CDU/CSU adopted at the next party congress in Rostock in June. Genscher has always been proud of keeping his changing chancellors at least a bit uncertain. The old fox wants to keep the FDP open as a partner for both big parties as long as possible. The honorary FDP chairman was the first one in the party to say that the CDU/CSU and the chancellor cannot be expected to achieve much anymore. However, all that need not bother the party chairman. No one will replace Kinkel -- not in the election campaign and not afterwards either, because the fear of a red-green coalition, which will increase until autumn, will once again drive the FDP over the 5-percent threshold in the Bundestag. Scharping will save it. He prefers a coalition with the government-experienced FDP over a red-green coalition with all its uncertainties. Business circles are already supporting the FDP in order to place it at Scharping's side if the SPD wins. Thus, the FDP has every chance of remaining a government party. Sacrifice There is something else, however, that indicates favorable prospects for the liberals on the political scene. Liberal values, such as individual responsibility, a turning away from "Father State," and market economy are gaining weight and are as undisputed as hardly ever in Germany's past. However, Kinkel is not the man to seize this opportunity. Kinkel's problem is that he has not really accepted his new office. How else could one explain that he still speaks of having almost concluded a contract with an industrial company in 1990? Why is he not embarrassed when he embellishes his dream of being a manager with the remark that he would have earned more money in industry? And, of course, he also has to mention that his family advised him against politics at that time. So much talk in this form shows that Klaus Kinkel sees his rise to the top offices of the republic as a sacrifice. Genscher enjoyed being a politician. A Bit of Adventurous Spirit Kinkel's monomania of leading his party only out of responsibility -- and not because he enjoys power -- is a hindrance for him. In this super election year, Kinkel would at least have to open his party's door a little bit for changing partners -- as Scheel and Genscher did before him. However, a change in partners requires courage, imagination, and a bit of adventurous spirit, as well as a bit of a gambling nature. The upright Swabian is lacking all that. "He has gotten used to the jogging pace of government work," an FDP insider says. "This provides a special artificial security removed from the real development. The slogan is: Everything continues in Bonn's government business. Why should it not do so after the elections?"
