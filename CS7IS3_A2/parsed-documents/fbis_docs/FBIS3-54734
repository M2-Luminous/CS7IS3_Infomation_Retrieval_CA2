No-Nonsense Struggle Is Under Way Under the Christmas Tree," incorporating "Prerequisites" subhead by Sergey Vedeneyev and "postscript" by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] [Text] Judging by reports from reliable sources, the reform of the Russian Government is going to be drastic. The institution of vice premiership is to be cut down to five posts: two first vice premiers (Oleg Soskovets and Yegor Gaydar) and three plain vice premiers. In fact it is in the second echelon of vice premiers that the main struggle over titles is expected to occur. The constant haggling over the posts is beginning to produce some curious results: It appears that the carefully prepared reshuffle which will be announced on 5 January should toss overboard two radicals from Russia's Choice (Boris Fedorov and Anatoliy Chubays) and two "moderates" who have displayed relative disloyalty -- Aleksandr Shokhin and Sergey Shakhray (Party of Russian Unity and Accord) [PRES]. This should be regarded only as a tentative prediction because the decisive battle for the seats has not begun yet: At yesterday's session of the government presidium -- marked by the absence of the finance minister -- instead of the announced agenda, a ceremony was held to express collective best New Year's wishes to first-echelon officials. Therefore so far the main intrigue is developing not in the government itself but around it. The lineup of forces in the government remains so shrouded in mystery that it is even impossible to say whether the Economy and the Finance Ministries will be merged to "suit Gaydar" or whether the deck will be reshuffled differently: On one hand, the first scenario is more logical if one proceeds from the president's assurances and Gaydar's self-assurance. On the other, yesterday it was planned to "give hell to Urinson" following his presentation of a reform program, which has not as yet happened. Intrigues around the government last week came through in a number of statements by Yegor Gaydar and Oleg Soskovets. The main point of contention was still over the necessity or uselessness of financial stabilization. Meanwhile the financial stabilization intrigue, with the present condition of the Russian economy and with the current composition of the parliament, is a unique case of intensive care measures being administered to a stillborn baby. Moreover, it is becoming clear today even for "practical workers" that even theoretically the struggle against inflation by limiting demand will not only provoke social upheavals like the miners crisis (only of a general character) and further slackening of industrial activity, but neither (sic!) will it stop inflation. Yegor Gaydar's statements in the "Moment of Truth" [TV program] with Andrey Karaulov to the effect that Russia was so close to financial stabilization in 1992 and what a little way it has to go to reach it today were obviously of a "provocative" character and did not correspond to reality. Which posed observers the dilemma: Either Gaydar is mistaken or he is telling a lie. The most feasible is the version of "eyewashing" the president (who is not an economist) and provoking Viktor Chernomyrdin. With the emerging "president-premier" standoff, Gaydar, mindful of the president's promise to keep him in the cabinet, is apparently targeting his strike against his radical colleagues, which will cause the replacement of the Fedorov-Chubays combination with Shokhin-Shakhray. The brilliant game played in public is apparently doomed to success. This success, however, will remain purely internal and will hardly affect the cabinet's performance. This in fact underlies the hopes that the elimination of reformers from the cabinet will be less painful for the country because with the exception of Shakhray there is no one to deal with regional policy; and, with the exception of Shokhin, no one to conduct balanced talks with the EC. Moreover, the departure of the PRES leaders from the government will not have a stabilizing effect on government-parliament interrelations. At the same time, the replacement of those radicals who have assumed responsibility for botched (economic and political) reforms can moderate Gaydar's appetite for far-reaching confrontational transformations, while except for him, the president does not trust any other economist. Prerequisites As the scheduled date draws near, when the renewed structural and personal composition of the government will become widely known to the public, there is natural impatience and a growing wish to find out the consequences of particular figures' appearing at the head of the executive branch. Anyone lucky enough to attend a conference of a narrow in-circle at 1100 on Tuesday, 28 December in Volynskoye near Moscow, could have satisfied his natural curiosity. It discussed in particular the composition of the future government. It is hardly reasonable, however, to rely on such guesswork even if coming from the most well-informed in-people. In the end the decisions will be made by a person with fine political intuition that has never failed him so far at the most responsible moments. The president has always fully understood the importance of cadre work, personally deciding many questions related to appointments. As for the general trend of the upcoming (and already proceeding) cadre reshuffle, it is apparently based on the following prerequisites. Balance. The need for a balanced approach conditions the aspiration to achieve such a correlation of leading cadres in political posts which would most fully reflect the emerging balance of political forces and allow him to consider himself the president of "all Russians," at the same time guaranteeing a consistent continuation of reforms -- even if with certain adjustments. Such an approach leaves no room for radicals or extremists of any description in the Russian leadership and opens the way for more moderate leaders. Reliability. The need for guarantees of future mutual understanding explains the choice of people who are personally known and devoted. As the previous course of events has shown, these may include some fairly unexpected figures (for example, those well known in the process of past work in party bodies). Professionalism. This quite reasonable demand is very hard to implement in practice. First of all, it ill matches the previous criterion. Second, the type of professional leader in statesmanship has not as yet taken proper shape in Russian organizational culture. Continuity. No matter how one might wish, it is extremely difficult and not really necessary to replace everybody simultaneously. This process acquires a gradual character and therefore the question of priorities in the effecting changes arises. Shooting the Losers [otstranennost]. The supreme interests of self-preservation inevitably call for scapegoats and fall guys to be found. They will be found because they provide an easy opportunity to absolve oneself of responsibility for failures and shift it on the part of leadership that is replaced, which can and should be sacrificed. Subjectivism. The logic of the president's thinking is hard to explain since many of his decisions are of an intuitive character. He also quite confirms this himself. Let us recall, for instance, his famous interview with E. Ryazanov ("Does it not seem to you that your are being led from somewhere up above?" -- "Yes, indeed, it does.") P.S. According to some reports, Vladimir Kvasov, chief of the Russian Federation Government apparatus, has been accorded the rank of minister. It should be noted that Mr. Kvasov was elected to the State Duma in the 112th Orekhovo Zuyevo constituency in Moscow Oblast. Some sources report that the following alignment of forces in the cabinet is quite probable: Viktor Gerashchenko gives way to Boris Fedorov who will in turn be replaced by Yegor Gaydar. Such a figure as Yuriy Luzhkov is also being considered but according to some behind-the-scenes strategists, his time will come later -- in presidential elections because Luzhkov, in their opinion, can become a good match for Zhirinovskiy.
