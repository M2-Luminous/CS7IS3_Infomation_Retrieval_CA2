However, it is unclear how much it will cost to decommission the plant and close the energy gap that will arise as a result. The Ukrainian Head of State, Leonid Kravchuk, who is currently in Luxembourg to sign the partnership agreement with the EU member states, believes that between $6-8 billion will be required. The European Commission, meanwhile, is talking of costs of about $1.5 billion, and wants other European states to contribute toward the expense. Eight years after the Chernobyl reactor catastrophe, two reactor blocks are still in operation. By 1998, Ukraine wants to build another three nuclear power plants that are up to Western standards. Ukraine believes that the European Union should contribute toward the cost of building these plants by providing Euratom [European Atomic Energy Community] loans. The definitive closure of the Chernobyl power station will probably result in a 35-percent drop in energy supplies. Ukraine wants to avoid becoming dependent on energy supplies from abroad. In the Council meeting, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos had warned against the danger of a repeat catastrophe. European Council President Theodoros Pangalos told the press that the closure of Chernobyl had not been made a precondition for ratifying the partnership agreement. On the other hand, signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty had been made such a precondition. Among other things, the partnership and cooperation agreement signed yesterday, which still has to be ratified by the member states and the European Parliament, provides for most-favored nation status. Special agreements still have to be concluded for coal, steel, nuclear, and textile products. In the past the European Union imported goods worth only approximately ECU1 billion from Ukraine, compared with exports worth more than ECU1.4 billion (0.3 percent of all EU exports). Within the framework of the TACIS [Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States] program offering technical assistance to the members of the CIS, Ukraine received a total of ECU120 million between 1991 and 1993 for the purposes of reconstruction. After signing the agreement, Mr. Kravchuk said that it marked the inclusion of his country in the process of European integration, which would in turn boost the process of democratization. The agreement also refers to guaranteeing human rights. Pangalos approved the Union aid to help the transition to a market economy. European Commission President Jacques Delors described Ukraine as a link between East and West. [passage omitted]
