The Riigikogu has issued a statement on increasing imperialist tendencies in Russian foreign policy. The Riigikogu voices resolute protest against the increasing imperialist tendencies in the Russian foreign policy according to which the Baltic countries fall within the Russian sphere of influence. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has consistently justified the continued Russian troop presence on the territory of the Republic of Estonia, against the will of the Estonian people and the norms of international law. Statements made against Estonia by Russian Government members are in conflict with the UN Charter and the provisions of the CSCE final acts, which Russia, too, has pledged to observe in its foreign policy. The Riigikogu draws the attention of the parliaments of all countries to the fact that in 1992, at a CSCE Helsinki summit, Russia took upon itself the obligation of withdrawing its troops from the territory of the Baltic states quickly, in an orderly manner, and completely, without setting any additional conditions. [Words indistinct] for this reason the development of relations between Estonia and Russia has run into a deadlock. The Riigikogu holds the position that for the purpose of developing relations between countries it is essential to proceed from the principles of respect for a country's sovereignty and equality, from those countries' legislative acts, and from the principle of mutual interest.
