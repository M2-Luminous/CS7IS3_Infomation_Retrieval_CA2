The adviser to the president of the self-proclaimed Republic of Trans-Dniestria, Stepan Kitsak, is taking part in the talks as an observer. Trans-Dniestria's Secretary of State, Valery Litskay, told Interfax's correspondent that the status of observer will not allow the adviser to Trans-Dniestria's president to interfere in the process of talks, but his stand remains unchanged -- the 14th Army can be withdrawn from Trans-Dniestria only when the region's political status is determined. The leaders of Trans-Dniestria believe that the decree issued by the president of the self-proclaimed republic, Igor Smirnov, to place the 14th Army under Trans-Dniestria's jurisdiction will not hinder the process of talks; it will only remind members of the official delegations that there is a third party. "Solution to this problem will require a lot of time and many rounds of talks yet. The trouble is that Russia, Moldova and Trans-Dniestria are seeking to accomplish different strategic tasks. They must join their efforts in the main direction -- determine Trans-Dniestria's political status -- and only after that begin to speak about withdrawing the 14th Army in concrete terms. The talks on removing the Russian army from the area will remain just talk without taking a cardinal decision on the status of Trans-Dniestria," Litskay told INTERFAX's correspondent.
