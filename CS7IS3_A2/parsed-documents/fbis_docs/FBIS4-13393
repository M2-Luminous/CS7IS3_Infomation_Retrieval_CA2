They said the Polish-flag Moniufzko, which had among its Jordan-bound cargo 30 tonnes of spare parts for tractors imported by the Iraqi government, headed for Port Suez to unload the consignment. "The inspectors ruled that the U.N. approval for the spare parts dated back to November 1993, and as such it was no longer valid," said one of the officials. The parameters that the inspectors apply to determine the validity of U.N. approvals were not immediately known. But, according to U.N. diplomats, there is little coordination if any at all between the inspectors and the U.N. Sanctions Committee. U.N. Security Copuncil Resolution 687 of April 1991 exempts food and medicine as well as items related to food and medicine from the sanctions the world body imposed on Iraq in August 1990 following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. As such, spare parts for tractors are exempt since they are used in the agriculture sector to produce food. Exemption certificates are issued by the Sanctions Committee, which comprises 15 members of the Security Council itself. The absence of coordination between the inspectors and the sanctions committee became apparent in several instances when the inspectors rejected the committee's certification saying they were forgeries. The authenticity of the documents was established in all cases, but not before ships carrying cargo covered by them were turned away from al-'Aqabah, leading to severe losses to importers. The Moniufzko, which is carrying nearly 500 tonnes of general cargo, most of it in 30 full containers, would return to al-'Aqabah after the "suspect" cargo is off-loaded at Port Suez, the officials said. The Moniufzko, operated by a Chinese-Polish joint venture, was the 14th ship to be intercepted and denied entry to al-'Aqabah this year by the enforcers of the sanctions against Iraq patrolling the Red Sea. In 1993, they turned away 20 ships. [passage omitted]
