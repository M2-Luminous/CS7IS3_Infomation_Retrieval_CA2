Russia imposed restrictions on flights over Siberia late last year causing hefty delays for many Europe-bound passenger flights from Japan and South Korea. Airlines experienced delays of over an hour to their scheduled departures from Narita Airport. Russian aviation authorities said the flight restrictions, sent as a formal "notice to airmen" on December 28, were a safety measure following a deterioration in the reliability of radio communications equipment and would last until March 27. The restrictions limited the number of civilian flights out of Japan and passing near Khabarovsk to a maximum of six flights per hour, one-third of the previous frequency. Between 40 and 50 flights use this route into and out of Narita each day but each was obliged to await clearance from Russian authorities even if all passengers were on board. As a result of the negotiations, the restrictions were eased from January 7, allowing six flights per hour from Narita alone and resulting in a 50 percent reduction in the average delay to between 30 minutes and one hour.
