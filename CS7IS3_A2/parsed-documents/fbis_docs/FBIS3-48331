The lackluster performance is attributable largely to the national economic slump, the two automakers said. Toyota, leader of the industry, said its exports of passenger cars, trucks and buses declined 9.4 percent from the year before to 1,539,005 units. Domestic sales also dipped 7.4 percent to 2,065,687, the company said. Toyota said its domestic production slumped 9.4 percent to 3,561,750 but overseas output surged 16.2 percent to 888,559. "Although exports to Asia and Oceania fared well, total exports were down because of a decrease in exports to North America, Europe and the Middle East," a company statement said. In December, the company said exports were down 14.3 percent at 113,114 while domestic sales slipped 15.1 percent to 135,636. Nissan said its exports of passenger cars and commercial vehicles in 1993 plummeted 27.4 percent from the preceding year to 684,088 while domestic sales were down 8.4 percent at 1,098,502. It was the second straight year that the company's exports had declined from the year before, the company said. Production overseas climbed 16.5 percent to 1,006,204 but domestic output plunged 14.5 percent to 1,811,591, the third consecutive year-to-year fall, the second-largest automaker said. "The sluggish economy worldwide and appreciation of the yen against foreign currencies badly affected Nissan's exports," the company said. In December, the company said exports nose-dived 47.9 percent to 44,463 while domestic sales dropped 12.9 percent to 72,865. Domestic production dropped 23.9 percent to 117,494 while overseas output fell 11.8 percent to 66,543, it said.
