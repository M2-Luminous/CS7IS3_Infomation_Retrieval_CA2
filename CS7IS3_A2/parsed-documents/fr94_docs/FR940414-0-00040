SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under section 107(d) of the pre-amended Clean Air Act (CAA), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) promulgated the carbon monoxide (CO) attainment status for each area of every State. For Minnesota the Duluth area was designated nonattainment for CO, see 43 FR 8962 (March 3, 1978), and 43 FR 45993 (October 5, 1978). The Duluth area was redesignated to attainment for CO, see 51 FR 45319 (December 18, 1986), and 52 FR 6548 (March 4, 1987). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 were enacted. Pubic Law No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. Pursuant to section 107(d)(4)(A), the City of Duluth was designated nonattainment for CO as a result of monitored violations of the CO National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) during the 1988&hyph;1989 time period, see 56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991. The City of Duluth was classified as a low moderate CO nonattainment area based on a design value below 12.7 ppm. On October 30, 1992, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted a maintenance plan and a request for the redesignation of the City of Duluth, Minnesota to attainment of the NAAQS for CO. The redesignation request was accompanied by a report containing information supporting the redesignation request. On November 10, 1993, the State of Minnesota transmitted the results of their public hearing and additional information. On December 22, 1993, the MPCA provided further detail on the schedule for implementing their maintenance plan.
