He also stressed the role of the peace forces in promoting a political solution to the issue. Responding to a question from correspondents, Mr. Arsenis stressed that the National Defense Ministry is in a state of heightened alertness and there is no reason for concern. However, the national defense minister did not rule out incidents and explosions in the Balkans since, as he put it, the peace process will take time. Commenting on the way in which NATO acted, Mr. Arsenis expressed the view that the process of decision-making within the organization's framework must be discussed at the spring meeting of the defense ministers.
