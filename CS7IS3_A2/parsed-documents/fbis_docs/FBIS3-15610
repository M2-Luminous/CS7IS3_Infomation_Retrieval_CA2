The announcement was made during his meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin who made a stopover in Baku on his way from Tehran. Adamishin told the AZERTAC news agency that his talks with Kuliyev focused on ways to settle the Karabakh conflict. He stressed that Russia favours Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and calls for the withdrawal of Armenian troops from all occupied lands and the return of refugees. Speaking about the future political status of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Russian diplomat said that this issue needs further consideration. It can be solved only after the war is over, all troops are withdrawn from the occupied territory and the blockade is lifted, he said.
