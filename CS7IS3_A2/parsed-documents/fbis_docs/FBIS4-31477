The plan sought to continue positive trends achieved under previous cabinets and to solve problems that had piled up and went unsolved. The present government had a different perception of many issues than its predecessors had had, was guided by a different set of values, and wanted to alleviate the social costs of transformations under way in Poland, Kolodko declared. The cabinet expected to create 350,000 to 400,000 new jobs by 1997, reducing unemployment by an equal number of people. A successful implementation of the plan will mean an increase in real wages by 11 percent over the coming four years, Kolodko added. Average old age pension will grow by 12 to 13 percent over that period. The expected growth in the GDP over four years till 1997 is 22 percent. Consumption will grow by 15 percent, investments by a higher figure. Exports are to grow twice as fast, which shows that the strategy for Poland assumes export-led growth assisted by strong investment component. The plan assumes stability in the economic system to ensure that government economic and financial policies are predictable and readable to both the business community and ordinary citizens. Kolodko appealed to the opposition parties to join in the effort of formulating solutions to major national problems, such as the reform of the social security system, reduction of the public debt, Poland's integration with the European Union, and transformation of the Polish agriculture. "These are not problems facing the government, or the opposition, they are national problems," the minister remarked. The strategy for Poland signals our determination to continue the process of reforms and charts their future course, Kolodko stated. Integration with the European Union is a historic process and we want to speed up its pace. We expect our partners in the West to honour their commitments and agreements signed with Poland.
