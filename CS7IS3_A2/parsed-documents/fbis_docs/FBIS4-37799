[Hidshri] The Berlin senior public prosecutor in connection with the "Mykonos lawsuit," and deputies from the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], the Greens, and the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]. [Dreger] That is to say, you did not have any contact with representatives of the government or the Foreign Ministry? [Hidshri] I asked for a meeting with Foreign Minister Kinkel, but I did not get an answer. I think that this is connected with the presence of Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati. Apparently, economic interests are more important to the FRG Government than human rights and support for democratic forces. [Dreger] Mr. Velayati was received by the chancellor, Foreign Minister Kinkel, and Economics Minister Rexrodt. If you had had the chance to also talk to these persons, what would you have told them? [Hidshri] I would have said: Your support keeps the inhuman Iranian regime alive. It enables the Islamic Republic to continue its hostile attitude toward world peace -- for example, toward the agreement between the PLO and Israel -- to support fundamentalist organizations, and to oppress its own people. Democracy in Germany has fallen victim to economic interests. [Dreger] You discussed the "Mykonos lawsuit" with a public prosecutor. What is your impression of this lawsuit? [Hidshri] I think that the real perpetrators are standing trial. However, I am convinced that Iran is trying to influence these proceedings by economic concessions to the FRG. An example is the visit of Fallahian, Iranian minister for security and intelligence services, shortly before the beginning of the lawsuit. Mr. Schmidbauer (minister of state in the FRG Chancellor's Office and coordinator of the German intelligence services, who received Fallahian in October 1993 -- the editors) admitted that Fallahian had pressed for the abandonment of the lawsuit. I am afraid that the clarification of the murder will be sacrificed to economic interests. [Dreger] Your two predecessors were murdered in Europe. Do you feel safe on this trip? [Hidshri] I do not feel safe anywhere. It is the policy of the Islamic Republic to eliminate its opponents all over the world. The leading persons of my party are sentenced to death. I have a copy of a letter from the chief of staff of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. In it, the order to murder two persons is given. One of them is Chao Hosseini [name as published], member of the Central Committee of my party and foreign representative of the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] -- Iran in Paris. In 1991 an attempt on my life was made with a bomb in Iraqi Kurdistan. My bodyguard died. All that is happening at a time when the FRG Government calls the Iranian leadership "pragmatic." [Dreger] How is currently the situation in Iranian Kurdistan? [Hidshri] There are more than 50,000 Iranian soldiers and Revolutionary Guards in Kurdistan. Since the founding of the Islamic Republic, Iranian troops have destroyed 300 villages. Our political work is done underground. Our partisans act as guerrillas. [Dreger] What are the chances of a Kurdish movement in Iran at present? [Hidshri] It can weaken the central government and motivate the people to put up resistance and to draw the attention of Europe and the neighboring countries to itself. However, it cannot force the leadership of the Islamic Republic to initiate democratization. It will struggle against any democratic movement to its last breath. [Dreger] How stable is the Iranian leadership? The economic situation of the country is bad, there have been riots. [Hidshri] All indications of stability are due to economic support from the West. [Dreger] What are your relations with the Iranian opposition? [Hidshri] We have good relations with all, except for the Mojahedin-e-Khalq and the monarchists. [Dreger] What is your primary objective: An independent Kurdistan or a democratic Iran? [Hidshri] A democratic Iran where our national rights and human rights are guaranteed. [Dreger] You have now arrived from Iraqi Kurdistan. What does this autonomous region, which has been in existence since the end of the second Gulf war, mean for the Kurds as a whole? [Hidshri] No matter in what part of Kurdistan the Kurdish people attain their rights, this has positive effects on the other parts. The founding of such a democracy in (Iraqi) Kurdistan is contributing to the democratization of the whole region. Exactly for this reason, the neighboring countries are trying to kill this democracy. For one year, Iran has been shelling Iraqi Kurdistan with grenades and it has sent terrorists to the region. [Dreger] For six weeks, however, not only Iranians have shot at Kurds, but also Kurds at Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan. What are the causes of this conflict? [Hidshri] Iran created the prerequisites for this war. Since the establishment of the Kurdish regional government in summer 1992, it has infiltrated its agents into the ranks of the two big Iraqi-Kurdish parties, the KDP and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. [Dreger] Is it not somewhat simple to say that everything comes from the outside? [Hidshri] The two Kurdish parties are not innocent. However, the Islamic Republic is the most important factor in this war. [Dreger] Do you see a chance to settle this conflict? [Hidshri] Iran will not stop sabotaging the Kurdish autonomy. In order to put an end to the war, both parties have to struggle against this main cause. [Dreger] The autonomous region is viable because aircraft of the Gulf war allies are circling above the area. Their mandate is prolonged every six months, but it does not offer more long-term prospects. What would have to happen to secure the future of the Kurds? [Hidshri] The allies should regard the Kurdish issue as a political, not a humanitarian question. In Iraqi Kurdistan, only humanitarian support has been provided so far. Of course, this has to be welcomed, but there is a lack of political support. [Dreger] Would that mean the recognition of an independent Kurdistan? [Hidshri] An independent Kurdistan is not at issue. The allies should see to it that the Kurdish regional government can establish itself in a federatal Iraq. Iraqi Kurdistan is today quite up in the air. This problems should be solved with the Iraqi central government in a federatal system. [Dreger] The conflict in north Iraq is nourishing the cliche of the Kurds being at variance. Can you envisage a joint state some day? [Hidshri] We are not talking of an independent Kurdistan. It is not in our program and today it is impossible to translate it into reality. It is not our problem that we have parties with different political orientations. One of our problems is that we do not deal democratically with each other. However, we are not to blame for it. Our people never learned democracy. We need a democratic atmosphere in which we can deal with each other. [Dreger] The Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] is the best known Kurdish organization here. What is your policy toward it and what do you think of the ban on the PKK by the FRG Government? [Hidshri] We are in contact with the PKK, but we criticize its course of action. I think that the ban is inappropriate. The world must understand that the PKK actions are reactions to the inhuman course of action of the Turkish Government against the Kurdish people. [Dreger] The Iranian Government has become notorious by Khomeyni's call for the murder of Salman Rushdie. What do you think of the conflict over Rushdie? [Hidshri] I condemn the call for his murder. But I also say: The regime that sentenced Rushdie to death murdered thousands of people, without anybody doing something against it. Europe seems to have divided the people into classes. Salman Rushdie as a European must not be threatened. Iranians, however, may be killed, their life seems to be worthless.
