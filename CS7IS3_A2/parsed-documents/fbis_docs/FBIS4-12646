He said that apart from its significant geopolitical location, the Arab world possesses sufficient human, technical, financial, and cultural resources to justify such a demand. 'Imran told MENA that a permanent Arab seat at the Security Council is necessary to defend Arab rights, particularly after the erosion of the Security Council's credibility as a result of its double-standard policies on more than one occasion. Citing the recent Security Council resolution extending sanctions against Libya, 'Imran voiced regret at the method in which the Council has been handling the Libyan-Western dispute. He added that the Security Council has double standards and allows itself the right to punish whom it wants but it does nothing about Israel's defiance of it and its resolutions. 'Imran said that maintaining the anti-Libyan sanctions clearly contradicts the provisions of the UN Charter which assert that a country has sovereignty over its territories and citizens. He pointed out that the Arab League will continue trying to explain the Libyan position. He stressed adherence to the recent Arab League resolution that called for putting the two Libyan suspects on trial before a Scottish tribunal meeting at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
