FBIS4-29280 "dreas116_d_94026" FBIS-EAS-94-116 Daily Report 14 May 1994 South Korea * Government Condemned for `Media Control' * Government Condemned for `Media Control' 942C00124A Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean 14 May 94 p 3 942C00124A Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN Korean CSO [Text] We are now witnessing a relationship between those in power and the media, so difficult to understand, that common sense would have one believe we have returned to the dark tunnel of past authoritarian times. One example is the suit for the incredible sum of 2 billion won against Hangyore Sinmun. It was published in an article on the disclosure made in a press interview by Chong Chae-chung---who alleged the president's son, Kim Hyon-chol, said that he was involved in the bribery scandal involving the lobbying money of an unlicensed oriental-medicines company. This was at the time of the 14th presidential election. Citizens from all walks of life uniformly applaudeding the courage of Hangyore Sinmum by giving statements, calling, or visiting the newspaper company, and criticizing this irrational attack on the press is also reminiscent of the atmosphere of society during the past era of authoritarianism. The "stubborn silence" of others in the media---who had been raising their voices on various events, but had to take care concerning this incident---also resembled the media of the past, ever servile before the powerful. Through an editorial about the lobbying-money scandal involving the government and the center of power, Hangyore Sinmun has already pointed out the excessive abuse of power and immorality shown by this response. To reiterate, the first thing the Blue House should do concerning this incident is to reveal the truth sincerely and in detail, apologize for what it should be sorry for, and punish those who deserve it. Yet, the response of those in power, at least in the eyes of the public, has been to make economic threats and force the one who made the revelation to withdraw it. This is done by bringing criminal charges against the one who divulged the scandal, by applying "pressure" to the media not to report the information made public through an interview, and, concerning Hangyore Sinmun's report of this, by filing a suit for an outrageous amount. Given this situation, no matter what words the Blue House mobilizes to explain itself, it will not be able to convince the public. According to the public's understanding of this incident, when Chong Chae-chung, just an ordinary man, stood against the powerful, criticizing the president's son, who is reported to have great political influence, he would not have told groundless lies. Holding an emergency joint meeting of the Seoul-Area Press Labor Union Chairmen's Group [Ollonsa Nojowiwonjangdan] last December, the National Alliance of Press Labor Unions [Chonguk Ollon Nodong Chohap Yonmaeng] [NAPLU] characterized the suit by Kim Hyon-chol as a "new media-control measure," and decided to oppose this head-on. This was a natural decision made out of deep concern for the arrogant posture of those in power and for a [possible] return to the government-media relationship of the past. The NAPLU announced that it would set out on a reporter-petition drive, demanding a Blue House explanation of the political-funding bribery incident and an end to the oppression of the media. The question of to what extent the labor union chairmen who made this decision and the reporters responding to the petition drive will be able to return each to their respective companies and realize the purpose of this resolution through the printed page will become the standard for measuring where we in the press now stand. The unified might of the media is truly a powerful weapon for beating back the oppression of the media by those in power and is the most certain ally of the true democratization and genuine reform of society.
