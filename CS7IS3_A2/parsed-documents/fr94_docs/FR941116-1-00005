FR941116-1-00005 FR941116-1-00002 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;126&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and &hyph;300A Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and &hyph;300A series airplanes. This proposal would require conducting closed loop tests to determine the setting of the underfrequency trip level on suspect generator control units (GCU), and either the correction of discrepancies or replacement of the GCU. This proposal is prompted by several malfunctions of in-service GCU's due to the effects of setting the underfrequency trip level too high. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to correct GCU's that may have the underfrequency level set too high, which could result in the unwanted shut down of an electrical generator; this condition may lead to loss of all generated electrical power on the airplane when other generator faults or failures occur. DATES: Comments must be received by January 13, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;126&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from British Aerospace Holdings, Inc., Avro International Aerospace Division, P.O. Box 16039, Dulles International Airport, Washington DC 20041&hyph;6039; and GEC-Marconi Aerospace Ltd, Titchfield, Fareham, Hampshire P014 4QA, England. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, ANM&hyph;113, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;126&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;126&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and &hyph;300A series airplanes. The CAA advises that reports have been received of several malfunctions of in-service generator control units (GCU). Investigation revealed that GCU's repaired or adjusted by workshops other than GEC-Marconi may have the underfrequency trip level set too high. The cause has been attributed to the fact that the GEC-Marconi Component Maintenance Manual does not recommend that the underfrequency trip level be checked during the closed loop test. (GEC-Marconi is the manufacturer of the subject GCU's.) Setting the underfrequency level too high could lead to the shut down of an electrical generator. If an electrical generator shuts down when other generator faults or failures occur, all generated electrical power on the airplane may be lost. Avro International Aerospace (a division of British Aerospace) has issued Service Bulletin S.B. 24&hyph;103, dated March 24, 1994, which describes procedures for checking the part and serial number on the data plate of each GCU to identify discrepant units, replacing the discrepant GCU with a serviceable unit, and conducting post assembly testing. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory. GEC-Marconi has issued Service Bulletin HGE 24&hyph;23, dated March 11, 1994, which describes procedures for conducting closed loop tests to determine the setting of the underfrequency trip level, adjusting the underfrequency trip level, and conducting post assembly testing. This service bulletin also describes the part and serial number of affected GCU's. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
