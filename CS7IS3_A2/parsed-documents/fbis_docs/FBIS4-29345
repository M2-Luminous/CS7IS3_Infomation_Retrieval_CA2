The official was briefing reporters after the end of the first-day session of two-day working-level telecom trade talks in Tokyo. Both sides avoided discussing the quantitative aspect of "objective criteria" in gauging the openness of Japan's telecom market, the official said. Friday's session will also refrain from addressing quantitative criteria, the thorniest issue under the bilateral trade "framework" negotiations, he said. Talks on improving U.S. access to the Japanese telecom market resumed in early June after a hiatus of three and half months following the Feb. 11 disruption of the summit talks between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
