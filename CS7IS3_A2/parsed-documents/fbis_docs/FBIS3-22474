A source close to the New Abirem Health Centre told the GRAPHIC that even though c300 is charged for the full treatment of the disease, the number of people treated is negligible. As a result, only 460 out of 5,871 cases of yaws detected in a recent survey conducted by the Ministry of Health in the district have been treated. The source said the superstitious belief of parents that injections would paralyse their children and poverty are the main causes for the low figure. The district which is among one of the least developed areas in the country has the highest number of yaws cases in the Eastern Region. It mentioned Mamago, Adauseua, Hhweakwae, Zongo as communities where the disease is spreading. The disease is caused by a spirochaete and can be fatal if left untreated.
