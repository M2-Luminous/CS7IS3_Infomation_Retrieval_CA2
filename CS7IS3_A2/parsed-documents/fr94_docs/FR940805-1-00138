FR940805-1-00138 FR940805-1-00014 (b) Public and assisted housing. (1) The plan must describe the number of public housing units in the jurisdiction, the physical condition of such units, the restoration and revitalization needs, results from the Section 504 needs assessment (i.e., assessment of needs of tenants and applicants on waiting list for accessible units, as required by 24 CFR 8.25), and the public housing agency's strategy for improving the management and operation of such public housing and for improving the living environment of low- and very low-income families residing in public housing. The consolidated plan must identify the developments in the jurisdictions that are participating in an approved HUD Comprehensive Grant program. Activities covered by the consolidated plan that are being coordinated or jointly funded with the public housing Comprehensive Grant program must be identified by project and referenced to the approved Comprehensive Grant program. Examples of joint projects are efforts to revitalize neighborhoods surrounding public housing projects (either current or proposed); cooperation in provision of resident programs and services; coordination of local drug elimination or anti-crime strategies; upgrading of police, fire, schools, and other services; and economic development projects in or near public housing projects to tie in with self-sufficiency efforts for residents. The annual action plan of the consolidated plan shall make appropriate reference to the annual revisions of the action plan prepared for the Comprehensive Grant program. (2) The jurisdiction shall include a description of the number and targeting (income level and type of household served) of units currently assisted by local, state, or federally funded programs, and an assessment of whether any such units are expected to be lost from the assisted housing inventory for any reason. (c) Homeless facilities. The plan must include a brief inventory of facilities and services that meet the emergency shelter, transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, and permanent housing needs of homeless persons within the jurisdiction. (d) Barriers to affordable housing. The plan must explain whether the cost of housing or the incentives to develop, maintain, or improve affordable housing in the jurisdiction are affected by public policies, particularly by policies of the jurisdiction, including tax policies affecting land and other property, land use controls, zoning ordinances, building codes, fees and charges, growth limits, and policies that affect the return on residential investment. (e) Institutional structure. The plan must explain the institutional structure, including private industry, nonprofit organizations, and public institutions, through which the jurisdiction will carry out its housing and community development plan, assessing the strengths and gaps in that delivery system.
