Chrysler Corporation, Docket 47414 On January 8, 1992, an Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision and order recommending that NHTSA's complaint seeking a civil penalty of $1,371,420 for Chrysler's failure to comply with the MY 1984 domestic light truck fuel economy standard be dismissed without prejudice. He concluded that NHTSA could not interpret the extent to which predecessors or successors are included in the term ``manufacturer'' without issuing rules pursuant to section 501(8) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972, but that Chrysler could not claim credits earned by American Motor Corporation, except under the terms of a properly adopted rule. Both parties filed Notices of Intention to appeal the initial decision to NHTSA's Administrator. On March 31, 1992, after a meeting to consider settlement proposals, the Administrator set aside the initial decision and terminated the enforcement proceeding, without prejudice, to permit NHTSA to prescribe regulations pursuant to section 501(8) of the Act.
