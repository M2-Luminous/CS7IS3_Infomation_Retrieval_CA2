Attending the meeting, apart from Geza Jeszenszky, were Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta, and Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas. Our country will hold the presidency of the CSCE for one year beginning in 1995. The minority question was given special emphasis at today's meeting. The issues to be on the agenda of the security conference in Paris in May were reviewed and agreed. In this regard, the CSCE had earlier taken a unified stance; the work of the high commissioner for minorities will still be supported, the reports of those in charge of monitoring minority affairs will be continuously processed, and the agenda of the Balladur conference will be shaped from the conclusions which are drawn. The foreign ministers consider it desirable that Latvia and Russia should agree at the presidential level on improving relations between their countries, and they welcome the agreement reached on the withdrawal of Russian troops and the Skrunda radar station, but they consider it desirable that these agreements should come into force as soon as possible. A similar agreement must take effect between Russia and Estonia too, because the Russian troops stationed in the Baltics are currently present as a destabilizing factor in Europe. The foreign ministers reviewed the most recent developments in the southern Slav crisis. U.S. President Bill Clinton will also attend the CSCE summit in Budapest in December, the foreign ministers confirmed.
