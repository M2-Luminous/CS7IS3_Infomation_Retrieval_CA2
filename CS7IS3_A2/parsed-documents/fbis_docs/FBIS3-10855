The moral revolution has begun in Honduras. Without any sort of experience, we have taken the moral revolution's first and most important step: We inaugurated a new style of government. As we said in our campaign, we shall tell the people the truth about the country's reality. Throughout the history of our country, politicians, using demagogic phrases to reach power, have convinced the people with pledges, only to govern against the country's interests. When I became president, I found an economy in crisis and worse still, a people who are tired of deceptions and unfulfilled promises. We found a huge foreign debt and a gigantic social debt. In the new style of government, we will call a spade a spade. No more hiding the truth from the country; no more mirages to disguise sacrifices. The state of the nation is worse than what we believed it to be before taking office. Our resolve, however, is firm in the face of the great task the people have entrusted to us. First, we were told the fiscal deficit would be 3 percent of the GNP; later, the previous administration confessed it was 5 percent. Now, we discover it is more than 10 percent. In the old style of government, tough decisions were put off. Certain points of elusive popularity were exchanged for those of lasting sacrifices by the people -- the current electricity deficit is just one example -- because proper measures were not taken; technicians' recommendations were not heeded at the right time, and today we are suffering unavoidable power blackouts because of the need to ration electricity. In the old style of government, Cold War tensions took precedence over feelings of fatherland and sovereignty. In the old style of government, the ideology of state affairs was above respect for human rights. In that old style of government, economic policies reflected more what foreign organizations wanted than the [word indistinct] interests of the majority of our people. In the old style of government, laws were bent when they blocked powerful interests or when it was suitable to carry out urgent business with quick profits. In the old style of government, a few were awarded privileges at the expense of the majority. In a nutshell, the old style took into account the next election while forgetting the next generation by disguising problems and putting off decisions. It submitted to foreign demands; at home, it was corrupt; it purchased more than it produced; it favored a few people while crushing many. The truth that was hidden in the past now appears with its load of problems -- all urgent and distressing -- but we are ready to face them and begin to solve them. In the new style of government, there will be no putting off difficult decisions; no more giving in to inappropriate pressures; no more inequities in the distribution and sacrifice of benefits; no more disregarding the human factor when dealing with the economy. As president of all Hondurans, I appear before the nation to seriously and responsibly explain the country's difficult situation and the measures to be taken. It is necessary to point out that just when the new government began its term, the inflationary pressures that had been removed during 1993 flared up. During the first two months of the current year, the estimated yearly inflation rate skyrocketed to more than 24 percent. This means the price of goods in the basic consumer basket has increased. The increase was mainly sparked by the fact that prices, which the recent past government had frozen by executive decree, were released at the beginning of February and took an upward trend. Another reason for the increase is the speculation carried out by unscrupulous merchants. Furthermore, [words indistinct] unwarranted measures that did not conform to the 1993 budget norms, prompted an increase of expenses, subsidies, and investments. Such measures were so detrimental that the former government's expenses exceeded its revenues by 2.3 billion lempiras, which is more than 10 percent of the GNP and five times the country's deficit. The former government should have acted with fiscal responsibility and, instead of thinking about electoral results, should have taken into account that their actions would have adverse consequences for most people. Another element that contributed to this inflation is the reasonable uncertainty about the transition period to the new government. However, in this case, the situation was magnified by concern over how the moral revolution government would react to such a difficult economic situation. I address all the sectors in the country -- workers, peasants, professionals, and businessmen -- to say that the government over which I preside will act with responsibility and will work with the necessary seriousness and diligence, to correct the serious imbalance in our public finances. To further this end, we have instructed the Central Bank to prepare a monetary program that agrees with the economic situation. We have also taken measures which, despite the minor margins in the available options, have already allowed us to rescue Honduras' credibility and obtain the necessary support from abroad to finance our commercial imbalance, which amounted to 2.18 billion lempiras in 1993. As president of Honduras, I have begun a fraternal rapprochement with Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria Figueres. We have agreed that Honduras and Costa Rica will prepare joint platforms to resolve our respective problems, especially those related to foreign relations, foreign financing, and the defense of democracy. This agreement anticipates excellent possibilities in the immediate future. The actions we have carried out up to now have generated a climate of prevailing trust and certitude. We no longer have room for speculation. Thus, we expect those who use such practices against society to abandon them immediately for the benefit of their own peace of mind and to further the superior interests of the majority. I hereby reiterate to the Honduran people what they already know from personal experience because they have suffered it during the past four years at the hands of the dehumanized neoliberals. I refer to the skyrocketing inflation rate, which reached an annual average of 19 percent in the past four years. True salaries have been reduced both in rural areas and cities. All of this has contributed to impoverishing the Honduran people even further, affecting mostly the middle and low-income classes. It should not be necessary for me to expand on what the people have already suffered. Inflation is the heaviest burden that any government could impose on a nation. Consistent with this, my government is determined to reduce the price hike rate. We will offer to the great majorities the enormous social benefit we have in store for them: prices in accordance with their true salaries. We will now discuss anti-inflation measures and the fiscal deficit. To counter this inflation process in the short term, we intend to reduce the fiscal deficit because, if public expenditures continue to be managed in the same way or in much the same way as the previous government managed them, the fiscal deficit would amount to 2.7 billion lempiras in 1994. With this in mind, and regarding expenditures, we have started a fiscal year of austerity by reducing the central government's expenditures by 10 percent. Apart from autonomous institutions, this reduction will not affect priority social sectors. Consistent with this goal, we are reprogramming public sector investment by establishing an order of priorities. Consequently, all the projects that have to be regarded as unpostponable because of their importance as economic and/or social development factors will be provided with the required funds. The highway network's permanent maintenance and expansion is one of these priorities. We will continue to allocate 35 percent of the country's budget to support social development programs and to combat poverty. There will be no more irregular subsidies, and we will only keep those we can afford, according to the law and our financial capability. The subsidy to the transportation sector is one of them. Regarding revenues, we will implement the following actions: We will send to the National Congress the tax code bill the implementation of which will allow us to improve the collection of taxes and their management. This tax code will include severe punishment for tax evaders and defrauders. Regarding this same topic, we will send the National Congress an initiative to increase the number of taxable products without altering the 7-percent sales tax currently in effect. As far as income tax is concerned, we will increase the minimum tax-exempt income to compensate the inflationary effect and we will abolish the 10-percent and 15-percent surcharge, to reduce that tax's marginal rate to 35 percent. We will endorse reforms to the provisional import law, and we will review public services tariffs according to the changes in their costs. With these measures, we hope to reduce the fiscal deficit, which, if we had continued to handle things the way the previous government did, would have amounted to 11.2 [unit of measurement not given] of the GDP for 1994. In this way we will avoid having to finance the deficit with disproportionate inflationary effects. Our efforts clearly show that, contrary to the course of the recent past, the government will be the entity that will have to sacrifice the most in correcting the fiscal imbalance, with the austerity program implemented. We will refer to the balance of payments. The balance of payments deficit is structural. It constitutes one of the most serious problems that we face. To solve it, therefore, requires time. It mainly deals with strengthening and increasing national production. In the short-term, the qualitative and quantitative improvement of the production sector requires foreign aid. In the medium-term, we propose to establish the necessary mechanisms and instruments to increase credit offers and improve technological conditions and marketing practices. We have a medium-term financial plan of approximately $700 million with rapidly disbursed external funds to support the balance of payments. The disbursement of these resources began in 1994, and we expect to cover the financial gap to prevent speculation with the foreign exchange rate. This will allow us to attain relative stability with the foreign exchange rate and protect the capability of our exports to compete. We must now refer to two critical problems which afflict the country and which we are looking into on a priority basis. One of them is the grievous food problem that afflicts the majority of the Honduran people. The government's action in the short term will concentrate on the availability of and access to credit for the agricultural production sector; organizing the marketing of these products; and granting technical aid to small and medium- level producers. We will have tariffs to protect production of basic grains, to render their price profitable for the producer and accessible to the consumer. We will provide a weekly report on the status of these prices. We will establish, according to our potential, a credit fund in commercial banks to provide financing for the production of these grains. We will establish rural savings and credit funds and 60 percent of the Banadesa [National Bank for Agricultural Development] credit line will be committed to supporting agricultural production activities. We will maintain a strategic reserve to prevent shortages. The other critical problem is the electricity sector crisis. We are aware of the vital importance of solving this complex problem so we have issued the necessary instructions. As a result of this, I can report that the 70-megawatt deficit we inherited will be reduced to 62 megawatts in April and 13 megawatts in May; and the generation of electricity in December will be equal to the demand. I assure my fellow citizens my government is adopting the adequate measures to prevent this deficit situation from recurring. As a result of this decision, my government will provide sustained support to the private production of electricity. We intend to establish a legal and administrative framework that facilitates the necessary procedures to render viable the private sector's participation in the production of electricity. We will also expedite the collection of accrued ENEE [National Enterprise for Electric Power] bills -- 190 million lempiras for the private sector only, as of 31 December. The government and the ENEE will maintain the compensation mechanism between that enterprise's debt and the government's energy consumption. Given its importance to the creation of jobs and its role in the construction industry, my government will adopt the necessary measures to guarantee a sufficient and timely supply of cement. My government knows it cannot limit itself to short-term actions once we have implemented the measures aimed at solving the problems we have outlined, and once their main effects have been countered. Instead, we must strive to achieve the country's overall development with realistic plans and programs, and the creation of a general strategy that renders coherent the public and private sectors' actions. A basic principle of our strategy is to fulfill social needs and drastically reduce extreme poverty before the 21st century begins. It has been proven throughout history that the general benefits of economic growth never extend automatically or spontaneously to poor sectors. That alleged spilling over of the benefits of growth also does not occur in the short term. This is why the state is duty-bound to exercise its function of maintaining a balance and of promoting the common good. We view this social development policy as part of the overall development strategy because it integrates the social and economic sectors, consolidating the democratic process and justifying the governments that emerge from it. On the basis of these guidelines, my government has decided to issue measures to immediately improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the social policies and expenditures through adequate coordination and technical management. The poorest sectors will have priority in these actions. It will promote access to employment through policies that lead to the massive creation of jobs in keeping with the best traditions of liberal governments. We are reviewing labor laws to make them compatible with the current demands of workers and businessmen, within the framework of a policy of equitable, dynamic, sustained, and highly competitive economic growth. We will support the national action plan for development, especially for human development, for children and youths, giving priority to the establishment of conditions that offer equal opportunities to women in all sectors of the nation's life. Honduras' educational problem has its roots in the historic negligence of governments. After the reform promoted by Ramon Rosa [19th century liberal politician], no government has viewed education as a true national priority. That grave historic error explains why in our country we have a shameful illiteracy rate while 5,000 teachers are unemployed. I promise to correct this situation in my administration, which will allocate to the education sector greater resources every year. I will immediately instruct the Education Ministry to incorporate into the education programs as soon as possible the civic, democratic, and patriotic dimension that should be taught to all Hondurans. In fulfillment of the commitment that I consider my most important campaign promise, I have issued instructions to the Education Ministry to begin a massive literacy program that will make sure that the next century will find Honduras without a single illiterate person. In this great task, we will incorporate all sectors of society, including the Armed Forces. I think all Hondurans have an unpostponable duty to be aware that the eradication of illiteracy in our country is the most honorable and productive goal we can establish. We must admit that illiterate persons are the victim of social indifference and that illiteracy is an affront to and a burden on all society. The moral revolution pledges to foster the spirit that will awaken consciences and instill determination to achieve such a beautiful goal. With strict observance of university autonomy ordered by the Constitution, my government will give special attention to higher education, aimed at improving its scientific-technological quality and thus incorporating it into the social production process. In the health sector, we aim to achieve the following: reduce infant, prenatal, and maternal mortality 26-30 percent with regard to the numbers registered in 1992. Likewise, we will reduce severe malnutrition in children under five and the number of infants with low birth weight. With the cooperation of friendly nations, we have undertaken the task of resolving the serious situation we found in the public hospitals. An order has been issued for the immediate supply of medicines, medical-surgical equipment, and all the supplies necessary for these hospitals to fulfill their humanitarian tasks in an appropriate and timely fashion. In the environmental cleanup sector for the 90's, we have adopted the goal established by the United Nations on a global level for the previous decade. That is, provide water and environmental cleanup projects for 50 percent of the population. With the fraternal aid of some nations, we will take the necessary steps to supply potable water to 2 million Hondurans in the mid-term. To achieve this, a dynamic and sustained growth process in production and jobs should be initiated as soon as possible. The government commits to reaching the goal of 5 percent true growth rate annually beginning in 1995. This would then generate a true increase in per capita income by 2.2 percent. To achieve these growth targets, substantially larger levels of private investment and local savings than those obtained so far are required. During the past four years, investment opportunities have been offered to private capital, however, the response to local investment has been very poor. This indicates that the private sector has not made the effort expected. We invite local and foreign investors to participate in the development of Honduras by increasing their investments in the sectors they are interested in. Consequently, we are offering to achieve and maintain a stable macroeconomics framework and a transparent and fair system of laws, as well as attractive returns, particularly in those sectors where Honduras has comparative advantages. One of these is the manufacturing sector, particularly the industrial processing zones. In less than four years, private investment can generate up to 100,000 jobs. In all areas of investment, my government will offer appropriate incentives, particularly in tourism, mining, forest exploitation services, and the export of traditional and nontraditional agricultural products. With the participation of the private sectors, we are certain we will achieve our goal of constructing 50,000 housing units in the next four years. We have already begun negotiating with construction and financing companies. We will promote and stimulate the private sector to revitalize the industrial sector, and we will support worker training programs. Because of its great importance, we reiterate that Honduras will establish favorable conditions for private investment. Those conditions will allow private investors to participate in providing public services, such as electricity generation and telecommunications. Regarding Hondutel [Honduras Telecommunications Enterprise], after we study all the possible forms of privatization, we will try to reach agreements with all the sectors involved. Once this has been done, we will make every effort to get the required approval from the National Congress to carry out the designated transaction. The privatization will be carried out in an exemplary and faultless manner. It must provide the people with clear benefits. Any way, most of the resources obtained from this transaction will be assigned to pay the social debt, which has been pending for such a long time. In the context of our development policy, we will give the necessary incentives to private investment so its contribution can reach significant proportions. We will also encourage the repatriation of capital, which is one of our basic goals. To this end, we will implement mechanisms that will expedite paperwork and offer investors' security. One of our medium-term goals is to ensure that the flow of capital closes the balance of payment gap, boosts international reserves, and contributes to foreign exchange stability. In order to increase the volume of investments the country needs, it is necessary to increase our domestic savings capacity in addition to maintaining currency exchange in stable condition. The government will modernize the national financial system to ensure that savings-account holders obtain a better yield. In this respect, the government will propose two laws to the National Congress: the National Banking and Insurance Commission Law and the Financial Institutions Law. Later, we will reform the Central Bank Law and the laws dealing with companies, insurances, and others. We will give equal or more importance to the modernization of the social welfare system, which can be a key factor in the development of capital markets. Therefore, we want a system in which each contributor can establish his pension fund according to his means. We will also evaluate the benefits of giving the management of those resources to the private sector. The government, however, would still be responsible for establishing minimum payments, providing savings incentives, and guaranteeing their security. The economic transformation of Honduras requires a modern and efficient government, one the people who save can have confidence in. One that offers guarantees to investors, and in general, offers security and equitable treatment to nationals and foreigners. To this end, the government pledges to immediately start reforming the public sector and will emphasize the following programs to further its objective: Public administration, controlling corruption, strengthening the state of law and civilian society, and reforming the judicial system. In addition, the government will continue its policy of commercial openness, and, among other benefits, it will promote the international investments we need to complement our financial and technological resources. The government will maintain its commitment to the Central American integration process as a platform to achieve high quality production. We will support initiatives to strengthen regional infrastructures, and thereby facilitate cooperation among Central American producers to face competition challenges in both regional and world markets. We will also support the harmonization of macroeconomics policies and public service costs in the region so as not to disadvantage Honduran businessmen with our neighbors. Already we are working hard to gain access to NAFTA markets and thereby multiply Honduras' attraction for foreign investments. My government, together with other regional governments, will encourage Central America's entry into NAFTA. We will continue negotiating with Caribbean countries, Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia, and will give priority to trade with Europe and Japan. Environmental protection is one of my government's priorities. Therefore, our development policies will incorporate the principles of sustained use of natural resources and environmental protection. In order to counter the accelerated and progressive deterioration of forests, we will give priority to the development of massive conservation and reforestation programs, as well as the implementation of the Rio Principles on Environment and Development. Given its special importance, I believe it is pertinent to reiterate that we have already recovered the government's credibility in all internal sectors. I reiterate, we will keep that credibility intact. We have also recovered our credibility in friendly countries and international organizations, which have already given us their support. I must stress that in my opinion the agenda of those international organizations for the 90's is very similar to my government's social agenda, which gives priority to human development. Compatriots, in order to reach our objectives in the areas of social and economic development, investment, and savings, we need the commitment and consensus of all sectors. I will dedicate my efforts in the next few weeks to this initiative. The signing of a social pact among all Honduran sectors is absolutely essential. The gist of that pact will be to defend our national interests and improve the quality of our lives. I take this opportunity to call a national forum in which we will all sign a national agreement for stability and economic growth with equity; a forum to reach a consensus and obtain the fruits we need for the benefit of the people. Compatriots, the old government style meant a setback for Honduras. We will emphasize moral aspects in our government style because without them corruption advances, the country retrogresses, and democracy is endangered. The government of the moral revolution thinks about the present and the next generation. It works to give future generations a greater fatherland. We are aware of the need to affirm our sovereignty over the territories recovered in Naguaterique, Dolores and other regions. It is a national goal that cannot be postponed any longer. Something that can never be forgiven is that as result of indolence or clumsiness, we avoided our obligation to consolidate our legal ownership and provide effective attention to our compatriots along the border through positive actions commemorating the judicial victory of The Hague. We are also interested in our youth. We want to offer and encourage the transition to a voluntary military service system. While the National Congress, however, independently decides to follow through with the required constitutional reform, we will seek a mechanism whereby the service will also include a greater educational content and the conscription process will not result in the same traumas it has caused in the past. I am aware that the next generation needs to feel proud of its ancestors. The next generation also needs its ancestors' names to be unblemished. It does not need its ill-gotten gains. Carlos Roberto Reina's descendants will receive a spotless name. The president of the republic will not intervene, in any way, in any type of business transaction or private association. There will no longer be any classified allotments in the presidential office, nor will we allow any in the government sector. My fellow countrymen, an investigation into corruption charges has already been launched. In this respect, we have appointed preliminary intervention commissions at the National Supply Agency for Basic Products, the Central Penitentiary, the National Social Welfare Board, as well as other public education institutions. Per an executive decree, we have established the Intervention and Supervision Commission [Commission Interventora y Fiscalizadora] with ample resources to investigate indictments, inquiries by private citizens, and commissions appointed for this purpose. The Intervention and Supervision Commission includes two government representatives, two COEP [expansion unknown] members, one representative of the workers, one representative of professional associations, one member of the opposition party, and a representative of the media. Following a 60-day period, beginning the day it is sworn-in, the commission will present a report on all the cases where there is evidence of corruption. Each case will be transferred to the appropriate courts subject to whatever legal action it may merit. These commissions are not instruments of retaliation; they are not courts to carry out witch hunts either. The commissions cannot and do not pretend to replace the justice system. Their responsibility is to prove whether or not there is sufficient evidence of corruption. Once this is determined, it is up to the judges to send the embezzlers to jail. We are not looking for scapegoats. We are looking for the real criminals who always hide in their mansions. In a legal state, criminals end up in jail when society is able to prove they have broken the law. We understand and share the population's concern with respect to a timely end to impunity and penalties for criminals. We are working hard to accomplish this. We already have evidence leading to the people responsible for certain crimes against the people and the national economy. The penalties must be implemented in a serious and objective manner as demanded by the law. One wrong or prejudiced step could encourage excuses or legal maneuvers to cover up the crime. Honduras' moral revolution will only be possible with your cooperation, with the courageous participation of every citizen who knows an official took or is taking money that belongs to all Hondurans. In the next 30 days, we will send a draft code of conduct for public officials to the National Congress so we can institutionalize technical principles to regulate the behavior of managers of the Republic. Fellow citizens, my government is firmly determined to take on the great deficits we inherited. Overall, the government has a coherent economic and social policy. The government has a clear vision and direction toward the future, but that decision, those policies, that direction, and that vision can only become a reality with the participation of all Hondurans. As a candidate, I offer [pauses] offered to launch a great national agreement. Today, as head of state, I propose the agenda for that great agreement. We need a meeting of and pledge from all active sectors in Honduras in connection with the vast national goal. We need a strong agreement, and that requires a strong civilian society, a strong private sector, and an equally strong state. A strong state is not a large state; it is a legal state, meaning a state which relies on the respect and trust of its citizens rather than weapons. A state that is sovereign rather than submissive in its dialogue with other states and with multilateral organizations. A strong state is the one which exercises strong leadership, assumes responsibilities, establishes goals, and achieves solutions. To achieve this we will accelerate the state's modernization. I hope to see the leaders of every sector together at a work table, reaching agreements on ways to sponsor the overall development of our homeland; jointly establishing, with a lofty, patriotic, and fraternal spirit, prices and salary levels with the humane goal of allowing salaried Hondurans of enjoying a better lifestyle; jointly establishing production and productivity goals to increase our country's capability to compete; and establishing fair and intelligent agreements on the procedures that will allow us to increase the offer of export products, both traditional and nontraditional. I hope the renewed and renewing spirit of a moral revolution imbues all Hondurans with a spirit that, like a votive candle, keeps alive the faith, decision, and courage to struggle and attain new levels of development, prosperity for all, and the moralization of the state's actions. All this can happen based on the firm conviction that only if we move forward, united, will we be able to overcome the obstacles we face, and only if there is fraternal solidarity will we be able to safeguard social peace and build a Honduras where equity and justice serve as the basis for prosperity. Fellow countrymen, this message to the Honduran people discusses only big problems that we must tackle right now. I will address the country again in a few months with regard to other aspects of my administration. It is necessary for the people to be constantly aware of the country's situation, its direction, and the main problems to be resolved. Knowledgeable people can better contribute to their own well-being. We are concluding the preparation of a plan to modernize the state and public administration. I will refer to this problem another time. In the 39 days of my administration, the moral revolution has been initiated. Positive steps, fundamental to the country's development, have been taken. The Supreme Court of Justice is composed of honest and competent professionals. The appointment of the nation's prosecutor general was a big step forward. The new style of governing has elicited respect in Honduras and for Honduras. It is possible to move forward and to improve; it is possible to produce more and sell more; it is possible to begin eradicating hunger and illiteracy; it is possible to control corruption despite its many disguises; it is possible to live better. All this is possible only if it is based on our own efforts as the prime mover of development. I greet the future with optimism. I am enjoying these first steps on our march toward a promising development. I know the people of Honduras will not fail. The president of Honduras will not fail either. Thank you.
