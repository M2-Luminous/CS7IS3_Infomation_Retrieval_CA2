Will it remain in the form the viewer is used to, or will it ultimately come under the power of commerce and bad taste? Is the state prepared to continue in the future to pay for its maintenance, or will these payments gradually decrease to zero over the next couple of years? Do we need state TV at all, or should it become exclusively private? Questions, questions, questions...they are being discussed at many levels, from the communal kitchen to the parliament. And with all the diversity of opinions the disputing parties, as a rule, agree on two points: The spiritual health of the nation depends largely on television, and television itself is seriously ill. In the most general form the condition of our TV screen reflects the condition of the economy, culture, statehood--society as a whole, with all the pains of the transition period when the old structures are rotting and collapsing and the new ones are being born into torment and filth. Perhaps the only difference with TV is that it is more on view for the country than anything else: What is beyond the mirror (excuse me, beyond the screen) directly affects the "picture," what television workers call the result of their labor--everything we see on the screen. A good deal has been said about the corruption that has been eating away at state TV, including by the leading masters of state television itself. We shall not repeat this. But if the discussion were only about who is putting the most money in his pocket, the subject of corruption in TV would hardly be worth a separate discussion. The more so since television journalists, like the rank-and-file television workers in our country in general, have never been paid as much for their labor as their intellectual property is actually worth. So is it such a great sin for them to be paid more now, actually in keeping with their labor and their talent? The problem (or blame) lies not with large amounts of money, and frequently not even with the means of obtaining it, which, as a rule, you cannot figure out. It is impossible to judge what is legal here and what is not as long as there is no law on television. Is it legal, for example, to split up the advertising service of that same Ostankino when the business--and the money!--is handled not by a helpless single owner but by a multitude of real owners of individual programs? The desire to earn money in and of itself can only be laudable. The blame (and the problem!) of those who are earning it lies in that labor and talent have nothing to do with earning money anywhere. Mr. Sheldon Markoff, our guest from American television circles, recently noted in the company of his Russian colleagues: "I have devoted half my life to television and let me assure you that our federal television broadcasting company defends only the interests of the public, the audience, and by no means those of the state and the broadcasters. Our license to broadcast is something like an oath of fidelity to the television viewers. It would be better for you to come and see for yourself than to see the monstrous American television product which I see in your country every day." And there you have it! Only the Third World has the good fortune to tirelessly watch a stern-looking man tastefully lighting a cigarette against an exotic mountain Indian background. Americans would simply not understand it if somebody tried to prove to them that Lucky Strike is real America. It seems that under Kennedy the first machine for computer translation from one language to another was tested in the United States. They asked the president to suggest some phrase in English and assured him that he would immediately hear how it would sound in Russian. "All right," said the president, "here is a phrase for you: The spirit is strong but the flesh is weak." The machine grunted and spit out: "Vodka keeps well, but the meat has spoiled." It must be that the creators of the machine had automatically put into it ideas about Russians that are typical of the "mentality" of the average American: Where there is Russia there is vodka. And regarding meat, it was a real prophecy. Our own rots, but on the screen there is "Knorr".... Advertising tobacco and alcohol on television is prohibited in our country by the law on protection of the health of Russian citizens. But neither the law nor the corresponding order from Ostankino chief A. Yakovlev is being obeyed. The money is more valuable! But what is more valuable than money? It is thought that inducement is. And the main national "inducement" is that the new Constitution guarantees to citizens (Article 44): "Everyone has the right to...access to cultural values." If one keeps in mind that the lion's share of these values are concentrated in the two Russian capitals and several other large cities, it becomes clear that the right to access to them can actually be provided only with the help of television. But sociologists attest that never before has the percentage of programs that are called serious been as low as it is today. Air time has been clogged with a flow of "soap operas," simple-minded competitions and quiz shows, and concerts of pop and rock music. It would be all right if it were good "soap," but our television bureaucrats have given preference to low-grade Latin American "operas." And the main place among the game shows and competitions has been taken by those in which the viewers' imagination is struck not by the creative devices of their authors but by the amounts of the prizes. It is no wonder that on one of these programs, instead of toys on the Christmas tree there were $100 bills. There is no need to even talk about the tasteless and noisy television concerts: The lyrical songs of Soviet composers which we criticized mercilessly in the past for the banality of the text and music seem like true treasures by comparison. World experience shows that TV inevitably becomes a vehicle for mass culture. But some examples of it are better and some are worse. On our television, preference is given to the worst. The reason is simple: We select whatever is cheaper and can produce a rapid and the largest possible gain. Here, as distinct from food products, the food of the screen does not undergo even a selective expert evaluation. The only guarantee against a poor-quality product, both foreign and domestic, are the taste and honor of the television journalists themselves. But these remarkable qualities are always being subjected to a great deal of pressure. The main concern is how to survive. With a 40-fold increase in the cost of television programs, the cost of services of the Ministry of Communications, which puts out the signal, has increased 100-fold. According to the testimony of such authorities as the general director of VGTRK [All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company], A. Lysenko, and the chief of the fund for protection of glasnost, A. Simonov, today it is more advantageous to use foreign land transmitters and communications satellites than to apply for the services of the corresponding domestic departments. And there is no hope that these services will become any less expensive in the foreseeable future. The price of a kilowatt-hour, for example, is still less than the world price, and when they become equal (and this is apparently inevitable), it is difficult even to imagine how much the energy workers will be asking from the communications workers, and the latter--from the television workers. Radio broadcasting, naturally, is in a similar position. In the budget not only did they not account for this inevitable growth of prices but even the costs at the current rates were to be financed only partially (according to information from the deputy minister of finance, I. Molchanov, subsidies are being cut by half, and in the draft budget submitted to the Duma there is even less money). In the upper echelons of the television business they are quite seriously talking about cutting broadcasting by a factor of two, three, or even four. According to the prediction of Anatoliy Lysenko, then "Russian television viewers would be able to see only films from video rental stores slightly diluted with news excerpts." Unfortunately, searches for a way out of the impasse for a long time have amounted exclusively for searches for someone to blame. In turn and altogether they have been the energy workers who are raising prices, the communications workers who are threatening to strike, the government which is not providing money and is breaking its firmest promises to provide at least some...of course, it is absurd when one state structure, in this case, communications, gets something from another one that is equally a part of the state by striking. That is like the story where the right arm says: I will not cut hay until the left one gives me a scythe, and the left one answers: I will not give it up until you put a sleeve on me, and the right one says: I will not put it on until...and so forth. It is pointless to look for a scapegoat. And even if after digging you manage to find unjustified rate increases in some stage, this will not save us. Everyone involved in the problem, regardless of whether they have economic or political views, seems to agree on a simple idea: The state is incapable of carrying such an immense monster as the present state television and radio. The state is unable not only to feed this monster, but even to provide the minimum necessary control of this structure. Today state broadcasting includes 93 television and radio companies (three federal, one in Moscow, and 89 regional ones). In terms of the volume of broadcasting and the audience reached, it is still the predominant one. But in terms of potential energy, both human and material, state TV is clearly falling behind independent TV. There are already 321 private companies in operation, and this is not counting the cable studios that are sprouting up like mushrooms. On the Ostankino channel, which is still the most powerful, 80 percent of the programs are made by independent producer services (ViD, NTV, Eksperiment, ATV, etc.) and only 20 percent are made by state television employees and journalists, of whom, according to estimates of experts, there are clearly too many. (Here, true, it is necessary to make a significant reservation: The word "independent" which is used to designate nonstate companies is, to put it mildly, imprecise--they are even very dependent on their supporters, frequently more so than state companies are on the state, which, as Aleksandr Yakovlev correctly noted in an interview on Radio Liberty, no longer interferes in the work of television journalists.) But destatization of television and radio is only one of the paths to economic support for broadcasting. Moreover, it involves costs. At a recent meeting of the television community in the House of the Journalist where this problem was discussed, one of the representatives of the regional companies told how the creation of a joint-stock company out of the broadcasting center was proceeding in his city. He asked not to give his name because "I have to live there." The lion's share of the stocks went to the local administration of the State Committee for Administration of State Property and also local communications workers--who are now in charge of the center. All the journalists could do was scrape together enough to buy thousands of vouchers, which gave them the right to...3 percent of the stocks. This kind of "privatization" of air time can lead to only one thing: The monopoly of the center will be replaced by a much more destructive and selfish monopoly of local authorities. The situation was exacerbated especially after the Ministry of the Press was transformed into the Russian Committee on the Press and the Federal Television and Radio Service was created: Licensing of air time, which for better or worse was still handled by the corresponding administration of the Ministry of the Press and Information, was actually terminated. It is not included in the functions of the state committee, and the federal television and radio service was created only de jure. Moreover, its specific authority was not prescribed in the presidential edict on its creation. It must be concretized in the Statute on the Radio and Television Service, a draft of which was recently made known to the journalistic community. Information on the "parents" of the draft is going about, but, judging from its content, the "parents" have little in common with the authors of the president's edict: The draft interprets the federal service as an institution in charge of domestic air time even more strictly than the former Soviet State Committee for Television and Radio. The colleagues who gathered a couple of days ago in the House of the Journalist (and they were representatives of state and private television and radio companies, journalistic legal protection organizations, the Union of Journalists of Russia, and the judicial chamber for information disputes) think that the state (or, more precisely, social-legal) television and radio broadcasting is necessary--it can consist of one or at most two channels which exist at the expense of the budget or by direct payment made in some form by the viewers and listeners themselves and therefore do not depend on commercial interests. In order for nonstate broadcasting to develop on a healthy basis it is necessary, first, to destatize television and radio companies, and especially broadcasting centers, and this should be done in such a way that the people actually in charge of air time are the professional journalists themselves, who know how to work in the interests of the audience and not broadcasting bureaucrats; second--as soon as possible it is necessary to have a law on television and radio broadcasting which would place the commercial, political, and other aspects of TV work on a firm legal foundation. But until there is a law, the Federal Television and Radio Service should be assigned strictly limited functions, and in no case should it be made into a supervisor of air time. Its work is to carry out licensing and to check as strictly as possible on the observance of its conditions (so that poison is not advertised, there is not too much porn, stolen goods are not circulated, etc.), for which it should have a data base of license holders and the quality of their work. A new broom should sweep things clean. But no censorship! No "ministry of truth"! Only the law! As for money, society will be able to pay for its own public television if it becomes the kind the cultural, civilized majority of the nation want to see.
