The statements I have made recently are not the result of any extemporizing or turnabouts, but the continuation of proposals or initiatives pursued consistently over the past months. It would be very helpful to be able to explain this once again. Let us begin with my request for a clarification from Mr. Ciampi. Immediately after the approval of the electoral law, I maintained that the institutional reform was still very much incomplete, because we needed a system that would grant citizens the opportunity to choose not only a majority but also the individuals that are to lead the government, similarly to what happens in the case of mayors. This is why I proposed the direct election of the prime minister, and I still maintain that this -- or another reform that will in any case grant voters the power to choose the individuals who will lead the government -- should be one of the most important things to be achieved in the next legislative term. The situation has not permitted the approval of such a reform. Therefore, many people have put forward the idea that the reform should be implemented politically right now, that is, that it would be useful and desirable for each alignment to specify not only its program but also the individual that it will put forward as candidate to the premiership. I agree with this idea, which I consider consistent with the thinking behind the referendums. I believe it would contribute considerable clarity and innovation to the coming election campaign. I believe it is well liked by the citizens, who welcomed the major innovation of the direct election of mayors. This is why I agreed to be put forward as the candidate for prime minister by the liberal-democratic and reformist alignment that is forming around the Pact. Everyone may form whatever opinion they like of this. I consider it an act of openness. I want those who vote for the Pact to know not only what we will do but also who will govern them. I want -- at last, after an ambiguous system that has lasted for a long time -- the next elections to be conducted with cards on the table. It was precisely because we made this decision that we are entitled to demand that the others place their cards on the table, too. This is why from the very first day I demanded that the other groupings name their own candidates. Of course there is no legal obligation. But I am sure that there is an obligation from the viewpoint of clarity. If any alliance is unable to do this, it should state so openly, admit its inability to do so, or its decision not to put forward its own candidate. This is legitimate. But it is also legitimate that the voters be informed of this and be able to form their own judgment. Occhetto's left-wing coalition seems to have a problem in this regard. It knows that any decision would cause splits or encounter unpopularity. This is why it cunningly cites several names, often including Mr. Ciampi's. In this way it is trying to benefit from the prestige enjoyed by the prime minister, without paying the price that this option would entail. This conduct on Mr. Occhetto's part must be openly condemned, and we will do so consistently. But precisely because what is at issue is the clarity of the elections at such a delicate time, it is necessary to demand that Mr. Ciampi too contribute to this clarity. Mr. Ciampi cannot be unaware that it is not enough to state that he is not standing as a candidate for the lower house or the Senate, in order to rule out his standing as someone's candidate to the premiership. He cannot be unaware that again yesterday, after his remarks, [Democratic Alliance members] Barbera and Ayala cited him as the progressive front's candidate. He cannot be unaware that, if an election were to take place in such a situation, many Italians would believe that he is the left's candidate, or one of its candidates, to the premiership. Of course, if such an option were to be taken openly, we would combat it politically, but it would be perfectly legitimate. What is necessary it that matters be clear. And it is precisely because of the esteem in which I hold Mr. Ciampi that I urge him not to permit such a misunderstanding to exist. Let us move on to the second part, that is, to my opposition to the tax decree. Allow me to go back over what I have been saying for some months. Back in October, at the People's Reform group conference in Naples, we raised the issue of taxation as the crucial problem in Italy's life, and stressed three things: that fiscal pressure had reached a level that was intolerable to the public and dangerous to the production system (your newspaper reported yesterday that it has reached 43.7 percent, the highest level in Europe); that the tax authorities' inefficiency posed serious problems of equitability; and that the complexity of the tax system has created a dangerous attitude of rebellion among the citizens. The proposals explained by Augusto Fantozzi were anything but demagogic. We did not (and do not) in any way propose an immediate reduction of the tax burden, in the knowledge that this is something that a country with a public debt like ours cannot afford. We proposed instead a curb on tax pressure, with an immediate commitment to fight the financial reform battle on the expenditure front. We also proposed a number of measures which, by rapidly enhancing the efficiency of the financial administration, would permit a reduction of tax evasion and therefore a reduction of tax levels. Only within such an outlook, and with incisive action to cut public spending, did we put forward the proposal -- drawn up by Baldassarri and taken up again yesterday by Tremonti -- of a constitutional limit on tax revenue. We did not wait for Berlusconi to introduce these ideas. But I do not see what is demagogic about focusing the political debate on an issue such as taxation, which is now crucial to our nation's life, and about putting forward not the destructive proposals of tax revolt but ideas that could make it possible not only to balance our accounts again but also to establish new relations of trust between state and citizens. And it is certainly no South American-style method, which is the charge that Occhetto has leveled at me: If anything, that charge would apply to a lax spending policy. These objectives are held partly by the government, too, which promises for next year a 1.7-percent reduction in tax pressure (which shows how undemagogic our ideas are). But the deeds seem to us to conflict with the stated aims. This, because the objective of reducing taxes seems to lack credibility at a time when taxes are being increased and at a time when there seems to be a prospect (not envisaged by the Finance Bill but not denied by the government) of the need for another and more substantial tax package immediately after the elections, thus providing grounds for the anxieties that the promised 28 trillion lire worth of cuts will be partly nullified. This, especially since on the public employment front a number of measures -- such as the doubling of administrative staff at local health centers and the transfer to various ministries of management personnel from the dissolved Agensud [Agency for financing projects in the South] at much higher pay levels than other categories -- operate in the opposite direction. Of course the battle to cut spending is a complex one, much more difficult than the gradual increase of the tax burden that has been pursued hitherto. I will confine myself for the present to recalling what I said the other day when I criticized the tax decree -- that is, that to aim to cut the planned inflation rate to 2.5 percent in 1994 and to base the negotiation of public employment contracts on that is a means of achieving a reduction of the deficit without raising tax pressure. If the government keeps the planed inflation rate higher, it risks failure. One final reply to your postscript. It should be unnecessary, because in recent days I have constantly repeated that my only concern is to build the Pact. You ask me about any accords with Fini. I have always ruled them out, whether before or after the elections. I fear that Occhetto is about to give the opposite reply with regard to Communist Renaissance. I hope, however (and I hope also that I am not among the poor innocents to whom you refer) that our friends in the Democratic Alliance will stand firm by their commitment not to ally with Communist Renaissance.
