It is an attempt by the Iranian regime to mislead and conceal facts from the Iranian public opinion through false allegations. The source said that talk about Iraqi citizens is ridiculous and illustrates the Iranian regime's insistence on meddling in Iraq's internal affairs that runs counter to a sincere desire on the part of Iraq to settle pending issues.
