Kozyrev said that in Geneva, there is every opportunity to settle the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina by political means. A second meeting of foreign ministers will be held soon to make a new step towards the settlement of the conflict, Kozyrev believes. If Bosnian Serbs opt for peace, he stressed, they can count on Russia's decisive support. On the territorial issue, they would be able to count on getting 49 per cent of the territory, although this part is populated by approximately 30 per cent of the republic's overall population. They would be able to count on Moscow's support on the issues of lifting sanctions against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia, the country's return to the global community and the restoration of its war-ravished economy. And then again, said Kozyrev, Bosnian Serbs may be stubbornly rejecting sensible compromises and holding onto the 70 per cent of the territory they have seized by force of arms, which will hardly help settle the conflict. The Russian foreign minister said he believed in Bosnian Serbs' common sense and hoped they would opt for peace. In case they do not choose peace, they would not be able to stake on Russia's support. In his turn, Radovan Karadzic stressed that Serbs have highly valued Russia's support on all stages of the effort to attain a peaceful settlement in Bosnia. Serbs and Russians have maintained traditionally close ties of friendship for centuries. "What we want is an impartial approach to the issue of Bosnian settlement," Karadzic said. "We are tired of the many years of war and want peace in order to build a free, democratic society like Russia's," he noted.
