Compared with the first quarter of last year, production dropped 38 percent, and in some industries even 45-59 percent. The production of consumer products shrank 39 percent; food -- 28.7 percent; nonfood products -- 45.1 percent. The production of light industry goods and domestic appliances declined by more than half, resulting in a one-third decrease in all kinds of transportation. Against the backdrop of general economic collapse and chronic delays in payments of salaries, the 5-percent drop of inflation, touted by the Zvyahilskyy government as a sign of economic recovery, looks more like the gradual stiffening of a dead body. Apparently, the overheated body of the economy was treated to blood-letting until all the blood drained out. However, ranking officials insist that since harsh credit policies applied to state-run enterprises almost stopped the growing prices and fixed the karbovanets exchange rate, the credits should be kept back even further. Ukrainian inflation has one nasty feature -- it is largely caused by excessive spending by the state, primarily, to keep afloat state enterprises, most of which have been operating from one government's credit to another for two years now. Since they pay salaries and for raw materials with borrowed money, and not from their profits, they would be paralyzed if left without regular state support. Step by step, those credits build up to form a huge state debt. State revenues from taxes, customs duties, and exports are catastrophically insufficient for everyone willing to receive cheap credit or subsidy. This is when the frenetic printing of new money is initiated, which is nicely called emission. What happens after the emission is nicely called inflation. So it does not come as a surprise that after the Ukrainian Government and National Bank stemmed the outpouring of credits, inflation actually decreased. But this also stopped state enterprises and dramatically reduced production. This is why in spite of the government's decisive "stop," life inevitably demands "more" -- workers want their salaries, and enterprises their credits. Many workers were left without means of subsistence and the hope to earn it somewhere. The government makes the situation even worse, stepping up repressions against the private sector. Commercial structures groan under excessive taxes and the self-will of state bureaucrats. Finally, they start to work illegally, that is, to move their operations into the underground economy. Favorable conditions for the private economic sector would relieve the burden of inflation even under the present conditions in Ukraine. Of course, unprofitable state enterprises will be forced to shut down in any case, but they could be replaced instead by alternative structures which would create more jobs and production. However, the authorities did their best to encourage the unemployed workers to seek protection from unemployment in racketeering and petty speculation. After the recent "victory over inflation," the ranks of the underground economy will certainly be swollen by a cheap labor force, while people's standards of living will plummet.
