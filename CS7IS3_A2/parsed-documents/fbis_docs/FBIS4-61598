According to data received by SNARK from the Karabakh Defence Army press service, today Azerbaijani troops took offensive on Omar pass in the north of Kelbajarskiy region. However, Karabakh forces, keeping under the control all important hills, beat off the attacks of Azeris, who lost more than 100 people. According to the same source, till evening of 6 May there were battles in the north-eastern (Mardakertskiy) and eastern (Agdamskiy) sectors of the front. After beating off the attacks of Azerbaijani troops, Karabakh forces began counter-attack in the direction of Leninavan village of Mardakertskiy region and Hovsepavan village of Agdamskiy region and, as a result, Azeris were forced back deep into their positions. The observers in Stepanakert consider that the activation of offensive military actions by Azerbaijan should be connected with its uncompromising position at the negotiations in Bishkek, where, as it is known, official Baku frustrated the peace-making initiative of the CIS.
