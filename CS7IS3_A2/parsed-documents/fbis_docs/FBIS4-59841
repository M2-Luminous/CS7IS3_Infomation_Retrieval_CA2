The Afghan side understands the feelings and concerns of the leadership and the people of Armenia. Your Excellency, president of the Republic of Armenia: The Islamic Government of Afghanistan has experienced the bitter taste of occupation and interference by the old Soviet Union. For two years this country has been dealing with the negative impact of foreign occupation and various interference. Afghans are peace-loving people and do not have any interest in interfering in other countries' affairs. The presence of a number of Afghans participating in the war between your country and Azerbiajan has no connection with the Islamic State of Afghanistan and the war-torn Afghan nation; and those who have taken part as mercenary soldiers do not have any jehadi background and have not been in the ranks of Afghanistan's mojahedin. Mr. President, it is with regret that I have to inform you and through you the Armenian nation that a number of warmongering groups have, on the instructions of foreigners, acted to promote political and social instability in Afghanistan and have employed a number of Afghan workers for financial purposes to seek financial sources to support the militias associated with the old Soviet Union, and have dragged them to take part in the war between your country and Azerbaijan. [sentence as heard] [passage omitted] Your Excellency, the presence of a number of mercenaries and dealers in the name of Afghanistan's mojahedin in the war that you have mentioned cannot spoil the relations between Afghanistan and Armenia. The Afghan side is striving to halt as soon as possible these inhuman dealings of a number of rebels, whose profits have been and will be used for activities against national security and political stability in Afghanistan. Taking this opportunity, I wish health, long life, and success to your excellency, and the welfare of Armenian people. [Signed] Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of the Islamic State of Afghanistan
