Participants at the meeting heard a speech given by a responsible person from the committee for planning and construction in the capital on opinions concerning the study, publicity, and implementation of the State Council's important written reply and the arrangements for "Beijing's overall urban plan." Chen Xitong gave a speech. He said: Beijing's former leaders formulated the "initial program for Beijing's overall urban construction plan" as early as the 1950's, enabling Beijing to score great achievements in construction and development. After the "Great Cultural Revolution" started, Beijing was forced to stop implementing the "overall plan," and urban construction was bogged down in chaos. After the 10-year turmoil, we reformulated "Beijing's overall urban construction plan" based on the original plan and new conditions, which was approved in principle, with an important written reply attached, by the CPC Central Committee and State Council in 1983. Practice in the past 10 years proved that this plan is correct and has yielded great results and brought about great changes in Beijing's urban and rural outlook. However, this plan was drawn up under the condition of the planned economy, and some aspects have failed to suit the new situation and need to be revised and developed due to the political, economic, and social development of the capital and the growth of its population. Chen Xitong pointed out: A prominent characteristic of the new overall plan is the strengthening of tertiary industry to meet the needs of the socialist market economy. In the past, Beijing's lack of markets brought many inconveniences. Tertiary industry has been expanded over the past years, but this is still not sufficient and helpful to the development of the city, and people still have inconveniences in living. We should attach great importance to the development of tertiary industry. The new overall plan also gives prominence to the strategic gradual transfer from downtown areas to outer suburbs in urban construction and the strategic shift from expansion by building new projects to adjustment and renovation in the construction of the downtown areas. This conforms with Beijing's reality. Party and government leaders, people's congress standing committees, committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and people across the municipality should all conscientiously study, publicize, and implement State Council's important written reply and "Beijing's overall urban plan," make concerted efforts, and strive to build Beijing into a fairly modern international city by 2010.
