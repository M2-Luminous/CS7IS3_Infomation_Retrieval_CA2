FR941117-0-00128 FR941117-0-00011 §22.655 Channel usage. The FCC is redesignating the public mobile channels in the 470&hyph;512 MHz range from trunked mobile operation to point-to-multipoint operation as the demand for trunked mobile service decreases. (a) The licensees in each market shall measure channel usage at least once every 3 months. These measurements shall be reported to the FCC within 30 days. Measurements shall be taken during the busiest 12-hour periods on 3 days (within a 7-day period) having normal usage. The information must be reported separately for each of the 3 days selected, must be reported by dates, and must disclose the following: (1) The number of mobile units in service during each of the days specified; (2) The number of calls completed each hour; (3) The total number of minutes during each hour that the channels were utilized for communications by the mobile units; (4) The average channel usage for the busiest hour for the 3 days measured; and (5) Any additional information that more accurately reflects channel usage. (b) If the measured probability of blocking decreases below 25%, the FCC will redesignate channels not needed to maintain blocking at 25% or less. The number of channels needed to maintain blocking below 25% will be determined from the channel usage reports and the Erlang C tables. (c) Although two or more channels are necessary to provide trunked service, the FCC may, pursuant to this section, reduce to one the number of channels assigned. In such cases, the licensee may provide non-trunked two-way public mobile service on the one remaining channel. §22.657 Transmitter locations. The purpose of the rules in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is to define the areas in which the 470&hyph;512 MHz channels are allocated for public mobile use. The purpose of the rules in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section is to reduce the likelihood that interference to television reception from public mobile operations on these channels will occur. The protected TV station locations specified in paragraphs (d), (e)(1) and (f) of this section are the locations of record as of September 1974, and these do not change even though the TV stations may have been subsequently relocated. (a) Base transmitter locations. Base transmitter locations must be within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the designated locations in this paragraph. Mobile transmitters must not be operated at locations more than 129 kilometers (80 miles) from the designated locations in this paragraph. ␣ 1Urban area 1N. latitude 1W. longitude Houston, TX 29 ○45 ’26 ’ ’ 95 ○21 ’37 ’ ’ New York, NY&hyph;NE NJ 40 ○45 ’06 ’ ’ 73 ○59 ’39 ’ ’ (b) Mobile area of operation. Mobile transmitters must not be operated at locations more than 48 kilometers (30 miles) from all associated base stations. (c) Protection from intermodulation interference. Base transmitter locations must be at least 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the current main transmitter locations of all TV stations transmitting on TV channels separated by 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8 TV channels from the TV channel containing the frequencies on which the base station will transmit. This requirement is intended to reduce the likelihood of intermodulation interference. (d) Adjacent channel protection from mobile transmitters. Base transmitter locations must be at least 145 kilometers (90 miles) from the applicable protected TV station locations specified in this paragraph. This requirement is intended to provide a 0 dB minimum desired to undesired signal strength ratio at the Grade B contour of an adjacent channel TV station.
