Against this background, Japanese Government officials reportedly began closed-door discussions of "economic sanctions" against the DPRK on March 22. The non-existent "nuclear issue" of the DPRK is not a matter to be discussed by the United Nations Security Council. The attempt to take such "sanctions" through the United Nations against the DPRK on the charge of its refusal to accept an unwarrantable "nuclear inspection" is unjustifiable and unreasonable from the legal point of view and is a gross violation of the UN charter. This is nothing but an offspring of such perfidious act of the United States as wholly reversing the agreed conclusions reached between the DPRK and the United States at the New York contact and its trite hostile policy toward Korea. Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries, obtrusively enough, are showing extra zeal in "economic sanctions" against the DPRK, while adding fuel to the U.S. criminal scheme to take this step through the United Nations. This is an intolerable, grave challenge to the DPRK. It is only too clear that they are seeking to isolate and stifle the DPRK at any cost by setting the "international cooperation system" in motion and, at the same time, add wings to their ambitious scheme to become a nuclear power, charging the DPRK with the "nuclear issue." While keeping mum about their criminal design to turn Japan into a nuclear power any time, they are trying to take even unjustifiable "economic sanctions" against the DPRK, labelling this peaceloving nation as a "nuclear offender." This is a criminal act which may entail a perilous situation. We have already declared that if seditious forces dare put unreasonable pressure upon us in the form of "sanctions," we would regard it as something equivalent to "a declaration of war." In that case, there will be nothing good for Japan, either. The Japanese reactionaries must properly judge the serious developments and promptly stop their reckless scheme of "economic sanctions" against the DPRK.
