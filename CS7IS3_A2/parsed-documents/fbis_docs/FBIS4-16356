Session of CIS Leaders' Council"] [Text] Describing the session's work, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk noted that the Commonwealth countries had found common views on the matters under discussion. "The main thing in today's talks between Ukraine and Russia," he continued, "is to make progress on resolving the Black Sea Fleet issue." Kravchuk announced that "agreement was reached today between the two countries' presidents for a meeting of delegations comprising the presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers, and defense ministers." In Kravchuk's opinion, "it is necessary to solve the Black Sea Fleet problem stage by stage." He proposes for the first stage to "separate the Russian and Ukrainian naval forces." "The two countries' naval forces should not have the same base -- this will always give rise to conflicts," the Ukrainian president said. He believes that the settlement of Russo-Ukrainian problems should begin with the resolution of this issue. As the second stage Kravchuk proposed setting up in Black Sea waters a naval base which would belong to Ukraine. "The two states would later hold talks on leasing part of the territory of the naval base to Russia." Kravchuk stressed that there is as yet no document which would define such a relationship between the two countries. This is why such a document should be elaborated. The Ukrainian president is convinced that Russia has the right merely to lease a naval base from Ukraine. As he put it, the two states must work out the international principles for the existence of such naval bases.
