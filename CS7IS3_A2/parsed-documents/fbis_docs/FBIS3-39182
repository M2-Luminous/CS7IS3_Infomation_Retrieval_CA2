"It was a little bit exciting," Grete Knudsen said after paying her maiden visit abroad in the EU [European Union] context. She sang her song in the dignified rooms of the British Foreign Office when she met her counterpart, European Affairs Minister David Heathcoat-Amory, for talks yesterday. "I was very frightened," she had to admit afterward. But encouraged by the extremely positive tone she encountered vis-a-vis Norway's negotiations with the EU and from the minister himself, she kept her courage. There is no indication of how the otherwise so formal British took this Norwegian song. But Whitehall is still standing. With Grete Knudsen in the international arena in the context of the EU, things have come full circle for the Bergen politician who, in the past, was in opposition in many areas to parts of the Labor Party system. Knudsen headed the Labor Party inquiry into Europe that led to the party's decision to submit an application for membership. And now the former "no to the EC" politician has thrown herself completely into the battle for an agreement, and by her own admission even with some degree of enthusiasm: "I expect that we will pull it off. Both the British and the Norwegian sides are putting their efforts into an agreement before March," she said at a news conference. There was no discussion of any scenario for what will happen if Norway falls behind in the negotiations. According to AFTENPOSTEN's information, the EU position paper on fisheries will not be ready before the end of this month. Spanish demands for access to the available resources are creating internal problems within the EU. Grete Knudsen left London yesterday in the knowledge that the British are warm supporters of Norwegian EU membership. But the question is whether all the positive vibes can be transformed into concrete action and movement on the difficult points in the negotiations. In the field of regional policy, Norway has run into difficulties about having all of northern Norway included in the Objective 1 category of the EU's regional support system. It was thought until recently that this issue was as good as solved, but Trade Minister Knudsen was told yesterday that the British side also fears a contagious effect within the EU if people are too kind about the support criteria. As far as agricultural policy is concerned, Britain has in the past had the greatest sympathy with Norway's demands for a gradual transition to the EU prices for agricultural products, but has given way inside the EU to the demand for EU prices on foodstuffs from day one. But the signal from Britain now is that it still has sympathy with the Norwegian demands and that it is paving the way for flexibility in the negotiations. The question has been raised in negotiating circles about whether the new trade minister in the final phase of the negotiations is mentally prepared to give way on some points in order to win on others: "I will not swap things for other things. We could end up in situation where we have to allocate priorities, and this is exactly what it is all about," Grete Knudsen said.
