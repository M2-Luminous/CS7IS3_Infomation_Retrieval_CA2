FR941021-0-00173 FR941021-0-00022 c. Out-of-band interference to ARNS/RNSS from secondary MSS downlinks in the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band. 138. The Committee also examined the potential for harmful interference to GPS and GLONASS from secondary MSS downlinks in the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band. It concluded that interference to GPS operations near 1575 MHz from these downlinks would be negligible due to the low power density level of MSS satellite signals at the Earth's surface and the large frequency separation between the MSS and the GPS frequency bands. 180 To protect GLONASS from interference, however, the Committee recommended that space stations that use the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band for downlinks not exceed a pfd of &hyph;141.5 dbW/m 2 /4kHz. 181 We proposed this limit in the Notice in rule ยง25.213(c)(3). 180 Committee Report, note 23, supra , at para. 3.3.8. 181 Committee Report, note 23, supra , at para. 5.2.2.6. 139. Motorola requests that we limit proposed ยง25.213(c)(3) to apply only to those frequencies that are used by systems operating in accordance with International Radio Regulation RR 732. Motorola contends that this would ``follow any changes in the frequency plan of systems, like GLONASS, operating in accordance with RR 732, and would also avoid restricting the operations of MSS systems in frequencies where there are no aeronautical radionavigation systems and hence no need for a more restrictive power flux density limit.'' 182 Motorola also asks us to clarify that the pfd limit refers to the pfd level at the Earth's surface. 182 See Motorola Comments at 56. 140. We believe that the pfd limits proposed in ยง25.213(c)(3) can be readily achieved by MSS operators using the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band for secondary downlink transmissions. We also believe that our intra-service sharing plan provides sufficient separation between the MSS downlink band and GLONASS operations below 1610 MHz so as not to create interference. Nevertheless, we have decided not to adopt the proposed rule containing out-of-band emission limits for secondary MSS downlinks. Adopting such a rule could be construed to imply that the secondary service has some protection rights relative to primary services in the band, which, by definition, it does not. 183 183 See note 21, supra . 141. We remind MSS operators that plan to use the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz secondary allocation for MSS space-to-Earth operations that downlink MSS operations shall not cause harmful interference to GLONASS operations in the 1598&hyph;1610 MHz band. 184 Further, MSS operators may not claim interference protection from out-of-band GLONASS operations. We also remind MSS operators of the obligation to coordinate secondary downlink operations in the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band pursuant to RR 731F. 185 184 See note 21, supra . 185 See ยง2.106 of the Commission's Rules. 3. Industrial, Scientific, and Medical Emissions at 2400&hyph;2500 MHz 142. The 2400&hyph;2500 MHz band may be used on a co-primary basis for Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) equipment applications. ISM applications include microwave ovens, door openers, high frequency lighting systems, industrial equipment, and other low power devices. The Committee was unable to reach a consensus as to whether ISM use represents a significant interference problem to MSS downlinks at 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz. 186 In the Notice, we stated that the record in this area was insufficient to propose specific MSS/ISM sharing rules and requested additional comment on this subject. 187 186 Committee Report, note 23, supra , at 3.4.9. 187 Notice, note 2, supra at para. 67. 143. In their comments, LQP and TRW indicate they conducted independent analyses of the potential for ISM operations to cause harmful interference to 2.4 GHz MSS downlinks. LQP concluded that MSS user transceivers operated in an urban environment with full signal quality in 98% of the instances it recorded. Further, it concluded that MSS signals would be usable 99.5% of the time. LQP also noted that because urban areas are usually served by terrestrial cellular networks, a dual mode transceiver could be switched to terrestrial cellular frequencies when very high ISM interference is present. 188 TRW states that its study generally corroborates LQP's conclusion that 2.4 GHz MSS operations should not be adversely affected by ISM transmissions. 189 188 LQP Comments, Technical Appendix at 32. 189 TRW Reply Comments at 86. In earlier comments, TRW suggested that the Commission reassess the permissible levels of unwanted ISM emissions in order to maximize sharing possibilities. 144. Consequently, we do not believe any further inquiry into the MSS/ISM sharing situation is warranted. Should sharing be more difficult than anticipated, affected parties may request that we revisit this matter. 4. Sharing with Fixed Services in the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz Band 145. Over 700 fixed terrestrial stations, including temporary fixed (transportable) stations, are licensed and operating in the United States in the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band. These stations are primarily used as links in microwave relay systems serving petroleum companies and as broadcast auxiliary links. Since 1985, however, the Commission has prohibited any further terrestrial licensing in this band. 190 190 Report and Order, Gen.
