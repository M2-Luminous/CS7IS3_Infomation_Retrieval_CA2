The present decision represents a major step toward the actual introduction of safeguards. Behind this is the fact that the textile industry is seriously distressed by the deluge of imports, and the shift in Japanese trade policy in line with efforts to lay down economic rules in preparation for the inauguration of the World Trade Organization (WTO). However, import curbs may result in further inflation of the current account surplus, and foreign countries are certain to apply stronger pressure on Japan to reduce its surplus drastically. The Western countries have implemented import curbs under the MFA for more than 20 years. The United States imposes restrictions on 80 percent of its imported textile items, while the European Union (EU) regulates 50 percent of these products. In contrast, Japan, in consideration of its export products creating economic frictions overseas, had not even considered conditions for invoking MFA safeguards. In the past, when the Japanese textile industry filed dumping charges and complained about their difficult position, MITI has always dealt with the issue in an ambiguous manner, engaging in behind-the-scenes contacts with the trading partners concerned, and asking them to implement actual self-restraint in exports. However, with the prospective establishment of the WTO, unilateral self-restraint in exports will be banned in principle as being a "gray measure." Japan, therefore, recently abolished its voluntary restriction on passenger car exports to the United States by the end of 31 March. If export restrictions are to be imposed on textile products, Japan will now have to negotiate with its trading partners, and reach a decision based on MFA rules. Already this spring China sent a letter to the minister of international trade and industry saying: "In consideration of the rapid increase in exports to Japan, we are studying appropriate measures," thus indicating it is considering voluntary export restrictions. Tough negotiations will now have to be conducted to coordinate this with MFA rules. Steps being taken by the textile industry in relation to import curbs are also being noted for their effect on efforts to determine future policy in this industry which has lost its competitiveness.
