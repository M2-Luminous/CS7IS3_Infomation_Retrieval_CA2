Disclosing details of the group's activities, Zainal Abidin Abdul Kadir, chief of the Islamic Affairs Division of the Prime Minister's Office, said the group has made a Petaling Jaya housing estate its headquarters from which to launch its activities. He said the group is carrying out its activities by conducting lectures in private houses, giving sermons in mosques, and distributing brochures about their faith to the public. "One of the campaigns the Shi'ite group waged called on members to practice contract marriages. They stressed that this type of marriage is justified in Islam because it was practiced during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. "This group has also used the Prophet's name to attract followers because they know that devout Muslims who worship their Prophet will follow their teachings," he said to an UTUSAN MALAYSIA correspondent during an interview in his office today. UTUSAN MALAYSIA today also disclosed remarks by Dr. Abdul Hamid Othman, deputy minister in the Prime Minister's Department, on the Shi'ite Muslim group's activities. These activities had earlier been limited to institutions of higher learning, but they have now begun to propagate their teachings to the general public in urban areas. Dr. Hamid noted the group's activities may split Muslims in Malaysia if left unchecked. [passage omitted]
