This was stated today at a joint news conference with Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Minister Anatoliy Zlenko by his Canadian counterpart Andre Ouellett who is in Ukraine on an official visit. He stressed that this aid package is part of the West's efforts to assist in ridding Ukraine of nuclear weapons, and of support for its adherence to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. "Canada undertakes to cooperate closely with Ukraine in strengthening international stability and security," the Canadian minister said. This package will help Ukraine to get rid of nuclear weapons by introducing the experience of Canadian experts in the sphere of such pressing problems as the skillful utilization of nuclear waste, the rehabilitation of the environment, and the development of civilian nuclear systems that are dangerous." Andre Ouellett said that the package of assistance in dismantling nuclear weapons is part of the Canadian program of technical and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. It has been created to support Ukraine's changeover to the market economy, to promote the development of democracy, and to expand trade and investment ties between Ukraine and Canada. To date, more than 60 projects in such priority areas as environmental protection, public health, strengthening the private sector, and the development of democracy have been approved. Andre Ouellett also said that he regards his visit to Ukraine as extremely successful. Important talks were held with Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, Foreign Affairs Ministers Anatoliy Zlenko, Oleh Slepichev, external economic relations minister, and Economy Minister Roman Shpek. A number of joint documents were signed determining the further development and expansion of political, economic, and trade relations between the two countries. In the course of the visit, several cardinal projects of Canadian aid to Ukraine were announced. Their total value is assessed at 27 million Canadian dollars. "The history of our relations is an excellent example of an international policy of mutual understanding and partnership," Anatoliy Zlenko stressed at a news conference. "Ukraine will also remember and highly value the fact that Canada was the first among the Western countries to recognize independent Ukraine and established diplomatic relations with it. We are grateful to Canada for its support for our state in the international arena. During our conversation Andre Ouellett and I discussed a wide range of issues among which: Nuclear disarmament, conversion, economic and trade ties, and the present-day political situation. It is pleasant to note that we reached mutual understanding on virtually all issues. The documents signed are proof of our resolve to continue developing mutually advantageous relations. For us it is very important to have in Canada a reliable partner. That is why we have signed perhaps for the first time in international practice a document entitled `Declaration on Special Partner Relations Between Ukraine and Canada.' We are looking with optimism to the future of our relations and believe they will benefit our two friendly peoples," Anatoliy Zlenko stated.
