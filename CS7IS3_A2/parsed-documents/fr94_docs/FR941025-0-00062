Section 75.1 is revised to read as follows: §75.1 Purpose of part. The purpose of this part is to establish standards with respect to the Director's determinations that a State's plan of self-insurance is adequate and satisfactory for the purposes of exempting such State, under the provisions of section 102(c) of the Act, from the requirement of purchasing flood insurance coverage for State-owned structures and their contents in areas identified by the Director as A, AO, AH, A1&hyph;30, AE, AR, AR/A1&hyph;30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1&hyph;30, VE, and E Zones, in which the sale of insurance has been made available, and to establish the procedures by which a State may request exemption under section 102(c). 19. Section 75.10 is revised to read as follows: §75.10 Applicability. A State shall be exempt from the requirement to purchase flood insurance in respect to State-owned structures and, where applicable, their contents located or to be located in areas identified by the Director as A, AO, AH, A1&hyph;30, AE, AR, AR/A1&hyph;30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1&hyph;30, VE, and E Zones, and in which the sale of flood insurance has been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, provided that the State has established a plan of self-insurance determined by the Director to equal or exceed the standards set forth in this subpart. 20. Paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(7) of section 75.11 are revised to read as follows: §75.11 Standards. (a) *␣*␣* (4) Consist of a self-insurance fund, or a commercial policy of insurance or reinsurance, for which provision is made in statute or regulation and that is funded by periodic premiums or charges allocated for state-owned structures and their contents in areas identified by the Director as A, AO, AH, A1&hyph;30, AE, AR, AR/A1&hyph;30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1&hyph;30, VE, and E Zones. The person or persons responsible for such self-insurance fund shall report on its status to the chief executive authority of the State, or to the legislature, or both, not less frequently than annually. The loss experience shall be shown for each calendar or fiscal year from inception to current date based upon loss and loss adjustment expense incurred during each separate calendar or fiscal year compared to the premiums or charges for each of the respective calendar or fiscal years. Such incurred losses shall be reported in aggregate by cause of loss under a loss coding system adequate, as a minimum, to identify and isolate loss caused by flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion. The Director may, subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, accept and approve in lieu of, and as the reasonable equivalent of the self-insurance fund, an enforceable commitment of funds by the State, the enforceability of which shall be certified to by the State's Attorney General, or other principal legal officer. Such funds, or enforceable commitment of funds in amounts not less than the limits of coverage that would be applicable under Standard Flood Insurance Policies, shall be used by the State for the repair or restoration of State-owned structures and their contents damaged as a result of flood-related losses occurring in areas identified by the Director as A, AO, AH, A1&hyph;30, AE, AR, AR/A1&hyph;30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1&hyph;30, VE, and E Zones.
