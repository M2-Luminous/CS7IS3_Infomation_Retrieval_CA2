FR941117-0-00182 FR941117-0-00012 (b) A grantee must have a current indirect cost rate agreement to charge indirect costs to a grant. To obtain an indirect cost rate, a grantee must submit an indirect cost proposal to its cognizant agency and negotiate an indirect cost rate agreement. (c) The Secretary may establish a temporary indirect cost rate for a grantee that does not have an indirect cost rate agreement with its cognizant agency. (d) The Secretary accepts an indirect cost rate negotiated by a grantee's cognizant agency, but may establish a restricted indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the statutory requirements of certain programs administered by the Department. (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e&hyph;3(a)(1), 2831(a), 2974(b), and 3474) 11. Section 76.561 is revised to read as follows: §76.561 Approval of indirect cost rates. (a) If the Department of Education is the cognizant agency, the Secretary approves an indirect cost rate for a State agency and for a subgrantee other than a local educational agency. For the purposes of this section, the term local educational agency does not include a State agency. (b) Each State educational agency, on the basis of a plan approved by the Secretary, shall approve an indirect cost rate for each local educational agency that requests it to do so. These rates may be for periods longer than a year if rates are sufficiently stable to justify a longer period. (c) The Secretary generally approves indirect cost rate agreements annually. Indirect cost rate agreements may be approved for periods longer than a year if the Secretary determines that rates will be sufficiently stable to justify a longer rate period. (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e&hyph;3(a)(1), 2381(a), and 3474) 12. Section 76.563 is revised to read as follows: §76.563 Restricted indirect cost rate_programs covered. Sections 76.564 through 76.569 apply to agencies of State and local governments that are grantees under programs with a statutory requirement prohibiting the use of Federal funds to supplant non-Federal funds, and to their subgrantees under these programs. (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e(a)(1), 2831(a), 2974(b), and 3474) 13. A new §76.564 is added to read as follows: §76.564 Restricted indirect cost rate_formula. (a) An indirect cost rate for a grant covered by §76.563 or 34 CFR 75.563 is determined by the following formula: Restricted indirect cost rate = (General management costs + Fixed costs) (Other expenditures) (b) General management costs, fixed costs, and other expenditures must be determined under §§76.565 through 76.567. (c) Under the programs covered by §76.563, a subgrantee of an agency of a State or a local government (as those terms are defined in 34 CFR 80.3) or a grantee subject to 34 CFR 75.563 that is not a State or local government agency may use_ (1) An indirect cost rate computed under paragraph (a) of this section; or (2) An indirect cost rate of eight percent unless the Secretary determines that the subgrantee or grantee would have a lower rate under paragraph (a) of this section. (d) Indirect costs that are unrecovered as a result of these restrictions may not be charged directly, used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements, or charged to another Federal award. (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e&hyph;3(a)(1), 2831(a), 2974(b), and 3474) 14. A new §76.565 is added to read as follows: §76.565 General management costs_restricted rate. (a) As used in §76.564, general management costs means the costs of activities that are for the direction and control of the grantee's affairs that are organization-wide. An activity is not organization-wide if it is limited to one activity, one component of the grantee, one subject, one phase of operations, or other single responsibility. (b) General management costs include the costs of performing a service function, such as accounting, payroll preparation, or personnel management, that is normally at the grantee's level even if the function is physically located elsewhere for convenience or better management. The term also includes certain occupancy and space maintenance costs as determined under §76.568.
