Deadline for Their Destruction May Not Be Met"] [Text] Saratov Oblast -- Around now a terminal was to have been built on the banks of the Volga in Saratov Oblast to strip out [peretarivaniye] chemical agents from their containers [yemkosti] and subsequently detoxify them. That at least is what the draft first stage of the state program for the destruction of chemical weapons envisages. However, local residents, worried by leaks at stores that have been here a long time, have sounded the alarm and are objecting to new installations with this kind of specialism. Russia's president signed the Paris Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons a year ago, in January 1993. According to the Convention, the first installation for the destruction of chemical agents must be tested within two years at most. Half this time has already elapsed and Russia still has no laws, no concept, no approved state program for chemical weapons destruction. Meanwhile leaks of poisonous substances from containers that have eroded have been recorded at the arsenal sited on the territory of Saratov Oblast. The village of Gornyy, where 690 tonnes of mustard gas, 225 tonnes of lewisite, and 210 tonnes of their compounds are stored, is not far from the Volga. The chemical weapons that have been here for ages, packed in metal barrels and railroad tankers, pose a potential danger. The strength of the harmful chemicals will be reduced by a factor of 1,000-10,000 when the chemical agents are stripped out at the new terminal. The plan is to reprocess the reactive matter obtained in Shikhany, 100 km from Gornyy, where the top-secret State Institute of Organic Synthesis Technology [SIOST], which developed chemical weapons in the recent past, is located. Doctor of Sciences Aleksandr Kochergin, the institute's director, said that several technologies have been developed for the destruction of the stocks from the arsenal in Gornyy. Whereas the situation is clear with regard to the mustard gas, a choice has not yet been made with regard to the lewisite and its compounds. In the opinion of SIOST scientists, the most preferable option is for this kind of chemical agent to be recycled [utilizatsiya] since it contains costly arsenic used in microelectronics, laser technology, optics, and pharmaceuticals. In other words, the recycling technology presupposes not only expenditure on chemical weapons destruction but also considerable income from the reprocessing of chemical agents into particularly pure arsenic, which Russia does not currently produce. This technology can also be used to recycle arsenic-containing adamsite -- an irritant chemical agent produced early this century, which has been shipped to Shikhany from throughout the former Union -- of which more than 8,000 tonnes have been buried straight in the ground at the testing range of the military institute next to SIOST. The huge Russian adamsite dump is a source of great worry not only to the public but also to scientists, who are voicing misgivings over the possible environmental contamination from these stocks. It may seem to the uninitiated that there are no particular problems with the destruction of the Saratov arsenal. It is only the choice of technology and the construction of a terminal and recycling installations that are holding things up. However, one must not forget that we are talking about chemical weapons, which are to be destroyed in densely populated areas right next to the Volga. This is a very sensitive subject for the residents of the area since the environmental background here is unfavorable enough as it is. In the city of Volsk, for instance, which is no more than 5 km from Shikhany as the crow flies, the arsenic content in the soil is already several times in excess of the maximum permissible concentrations owing to three local cement plants using so-called pyrite cinders, which contain arsenic, in their manufacturing process. People's disquiet is intensified by the constant rumors about the danger of radiological contamination of the area from the Balakovo nuclear electric power station 50 km from Volsk. Add to that atmospheric discharges by Balakovo's big chemical giants and you will understand the public concern, which is threatening to develop into an organized protest against the siting of chemical weapons destruction facilities bin these areas. This disquiet is intensified by conjecture and speculation due to the utter secrecy surrounding the facilities at Shikhany. I visited them, spoke with scientists, and saw that there is no intention of building any more production units here, the former technology used for the synthesis of chemical agents has merely been reversed. According to the findings of a special environmental and medical monitoring laboratory, the air in Shikhany is considerably cleaner than in Volsk, people live longer and have fewer illnesses. Choosing the technology is only part of the problem and by no means the most important part. Social and environmental questions are the main thing. Mikhail Yakovlev, Saratov Oblast Administration department head, briefed me on a Russian Government draft decree that the residents of the oblast have prepared on their own initiative. It enshrines their immediate demands without whose fulfillment the chemical weapons destruction process cannot be started. During the first quarter of this year the Committee for Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons under the Russian President and the Ministry of Defense, in conjunction with other departments, are asked to define a concept, prepare drafts of a basic law and a number of other legislative acts designed to form the legal base for the practical implementation of the Paris Convention, and guarantee safety, health, and social protection. According to civilized norms, the facilities for the storage and destruction of chemical weapons and the population centers around them should be given special status with all the concomitant guarantees, as is the case in the United States for instance. The demand for regular environmental and medical monitoring is also natural. During the first stage, before the experimental installations begin work, the intention is to study the state of the environment and carry out a comprehensive screening process involving residents in Volskiy and Krasnopartizanskiy Rayons, which include Shikhany and Gornyy, in order to determine the consequences of the storage and testing of chemical weapons on the environment and the population's health. The importance of the social and environmental aspects can be judged from the funding structure, where expenditure on monitoring and the social everyday sphere in Shikhany, Volsk, and Gornyy amounts to 67 billion rubles [R] of the R72 billion that the oblast administration deems it necessary to allocate for the entire first phase of the program, a phase culminating in the construction and testing of the experimental-industrial facility for the destruction and recycling of chemical agents and the creation of the requisite support infrastructure. Nadezhda Saratovtseva, head of administration of the settlement of Shikhany, has a better knowledge of the whole set of problems than anyone else. She takes part without fail in all the meetings and talks on this topic and has even addressed parliamentary hearings. "The state program for the destruction of chemical weapons has been in the process of being written and draft laws have been in the process of being harmonized since 1989," she said. "Presidents, governments, and parliaments have come and gone, but still there are no laws and no program. There is no concept and no funding. The SIOST has not been paid for three months and that unique institution is on the verge of stoppages. The social sphere -- the burden of which is borne entirely by the institute -- is going to pieces." Judging by the center's unhurried approach, one can confidently assume today that the schedule proposed by the Saratov administration in its draft government decree will also be disrupted. "You produced the chemical weapons, you destroy them," Saratovtseva was told by one highly-placed Moscow official. Meanwhile the chemical bomb planted almost on the very banks of the Volga may spring its surprise at any minute. In that case it would not only be the residents of Saratov on the Volga who would suffer.
