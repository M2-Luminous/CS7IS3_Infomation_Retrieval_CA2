This information collection sponsored by the Office of Family Assistance (OFA) of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is currently approved under OMB Control Number 0970&hyph;0118. ADDRESSES: Copies of this reporting document may be obtained from Edward E. Saunders of the Office of Information Systems Management, ACF, by calling (202) 205&hyph;7921.

Information on Document Title: JOBS Program Tribal Quarterly Report ACF Form 114. OMB No.: 0970&hyph;0118. Description: The Office of Family Assistance (OFA) of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) has granted funds to 76 Indian Tribes, Alaska Native organizations (including consortia of Alaska Native organizations) and consortia of eligible Tribes to operate JOBS programs pursuant to 45 CFR 250.71. Since Tribal grantees must require other agencies to track and report satisfactory participation and the use of JOBS funds pursuant to 45 CFR 250.95(e), the Secretary has determined that quarterly reports are necessary to properly monitor activity and success of Tribal JOBS programs. The information requested on Form ACF&hyph;114, on a quarterly basis, will provide sufficient programmatic and expenditure data to monitor, analyze and evaluate the degree to which Tribal members living in designated service areas are being assisted to avoid long-term welfare dependency and to achieve self-sufficiency. Form ACF&hyph;114 comprises Tribal JOBS program information on the number of participants and number of family members, AFDC family/case status, JOBS participant characteristics, services provided, JOBS activities and component assignments and education activities. The information guideline will also provide standardize definitions and instructions for collecting and reporting tribal JOBS program data.
