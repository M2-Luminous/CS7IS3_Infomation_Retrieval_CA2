This view is shared by other participants in today's second- stage signing ceremony in the Kremlin, during which Russia's major industrialists, agrarians, entrepreneurs and bankers put their signatures under the treaty on social accord. The main thing that prompted the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs to sign the document is renunciation of the use of force and any actions involving bloodshed, Volskiy added. He noted that so far the point at issue has been accord in the political sphere, but this is not enough for the economy. The next thing to do is to work out appropriate measures with a view to stop the current economic recession and output decline, the industrialist believes. "Unless we manage to pass this stage, unless we achieve economic accord, the treaty will become senseless", he stressed. Presidential Aide Georgiy Satarov told reporters that the country's business community had been amply represented at today's signing ceremony. Their role is especially significant now that the crisis is being aggravated, and they may become the principal force to help overcome this crisis, the aide emphasised. He reported that the next stage of the signing would take place on May 12. This will not be the last stage, since the document is open for further signing by any organization concerned and interested.
