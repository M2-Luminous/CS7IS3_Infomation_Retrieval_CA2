He reminded that, according to the resolution, all cases related to the August 19-21, 1991, May 1, September 21-October 4, 1993, in Moscow "should be immediately stopped." In the opinion of Isakov, "the State Duma should issue a separate resolution or explain the mechanism of the implementation of the amnesty resolution in one of its provisions." In this connection, he believes that all persons involved in the the State of Emergency Committee, the May and October events of 1993, "should be released, as it is indicated in the State Duma resolution, immediately after its official publication." In the meantime, the deputy chairman of the State Duma committee on security Vikor Mirnov claims that the State Duma resolution on political and economic amnesty "does not have any judicial consequences." In his opinion, the amnesty resolution was adopted in violation of the procedural rules, because it was not put on vote twice, first for the basics and then for the whole document, as required. Mironov thinks that the amnesty resolution will not be carried out, "the Communists and Zhirinovskiy supporters will not achieve their goals, and Rutskoy, Khasbulatov and other people involved in the October events will not be released." The deputy pointed out that he had voted against that document because he did not want "a civil war to be unleashed." In his opinion, "there are people interested in the release of Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, Anpilov, Terekhov, so that after the release they like dogs gnaw through a road for them to power."
