This new company will be stationed in Tuzla, where the Nordic UN contingent is located. The Swedish UN soldiers in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be moved to Bosnia, if they want to, but it might also be a case of renewed recruiting in Sweden. With today's decision, the number of Swedish soldiers in Bosnia will soon be just over 1,000.
