Cuba pointed out recent decisions by several international organizations and within certain circles in the U.S. Congress itself. The Cuban Foreign Ministry expressed its satisfaction for statements made to this effect at the last meeting of the Latin American Economic System (SELA) and at the Cairo meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Foreign Ministers. This is the first time SELA has ever approved a resolution rejecting the blockade. It goes even further than the resolutions issued by the UN, the ministry added, as it expressly calls for the lifting of the punitive measure. Referring to the NAM meeting, Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso said the ministers' statement is stronger than other resolutions previously approved by the organization. It specifically supports similar decisions approved by the UN, and with which the United States has yet to comply. Regarding what he called the increasingly evident international rejection of the economic and trade prohibitions against Cuba, Alfonso underscored the events that took place on 9 June in several U.S. cities, demanding an end to the policy. Lobby Day, as it was called, featured activities by a coalition of over 45 national and state organizations supporting a bill presented by Congressman Charles Rangel, who is calling for the lifting of the embargo. One of the main events was a round table discussion in the U.S. Senate, which addressed the current Cuban situation and relations between the two countries. Several members of Congress and other political, cultural, and media personalities were present. Alfonso, who met with local and international reporters, also mentioned recent statements by Latin American foreign ministers within the context of the last OAS meeting. The ministers called for the organization to change its policies regarding Cuba. It is this series of reactions, he pointed out, that make it increasingly evident that support for the idea of an alleged international isolation of the country is vanishing.
