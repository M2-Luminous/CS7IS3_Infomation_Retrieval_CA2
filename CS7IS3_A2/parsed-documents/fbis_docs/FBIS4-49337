FBIS4-49337 "drchi087_w_94011" FBIS-CHI-94-087 Daily Report 5 May 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong XINHUA Official on `One Country, Two Systems' XINHUA Official on `One Country, Two Systems' HK0505101194 Hong Kong TA KUNG PAO in Chinese 5 May 94 p 8 HK0505101194 Hong Kong TA KUNG PAO Chinese BFN [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Speaks on China's Consistent Implementation of the `One Country, Two Systems' Policy; Views Solution to the New Airport Issue"] [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch, yesterday said that there have been some contacts recently between China and Britain on the new airport issue. Some views are getting closer but it is hard to say if a final agreement can be reached, he added. In addition, he pointed out that China has never changed in implementing the "one country, two systems" policy; "one country, two systems" is a Chinese Government affair and China's policy and has nothing to do with the British side. Zhang Junsheng made these remarks when asked by a reporter during a seminar to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the May 4th Movement yesterday. Zhang Junsheng said: How will the specific problems concerning the new airport be resolved? We will know this after the Provisional Airport Authority holds a meeting. But we can say that there have been some contacts recently between China and Britain on questions concerning the airport. Some views are getting closer to each other but it is still unclear if a final agreement can be reached. In other words, it is still unclear whether or not the program proposed by the British side will completely correspond with the Memorandum of Understanding on the new airport. One reporter asked: "During a Legislative Council meeting, some legislative councilors raised a suggestion urging the Chinese and British Governments to earnestly implement the 'one country, two systems' policy. What is your opinion on this?" Zhang Junsheng answered: "One country, two systems" is a policy proposed by the Chinese Government to resolve the Hong Kong issue; the principles and policies contained in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law have very explicitly established "one country, two systems." He continued: "On China's part, the implementation of the 'one country, two systems' policy has never been a problem. It has been nine years since the formal signing of the Joint Declaration and our principles and policies on Hong Kong have been arranged in accordance with the 'one country, two systems' formula. 'One country, two systems' is an affair of the Chinese Government affair and China's policy. How can the British exercise `one country, two systems'?"
