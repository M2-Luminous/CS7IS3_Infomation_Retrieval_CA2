Hamas announced in a statement that Wednesday's shooting was the "first, swift response against continued Israeli arrests of its members." Israel has arrested nearly 500 Islamic fundamentalist suspects, according to Palestinian sources, in a bid to break up the Hamas network. About 240 were detained on the Gaza Strip alone this week. Meanwhile, clashes continued on the strip. Soldiers shot and wounded three Palestinians in Gaza City and two more in nearby Jabaliya refugee camp, Palestinian sources said. Military officials said two settlers driving a car near the Gush Katif settlement were shot by Palestinian gunmen on Wednesday evening. "Two of our fighters ambushed a car carrying two settlers ... the bullets of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam were awaiting them and our fighters opened fire on them using M-16 guns." 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam is the Hamas military wing. The typed message warned that the operation, carried out by the "clandestine unit number 7," will be followed by others "with the dawn of every day, until the end of all occupation of our land." HAMAS carried out two bus bombings this month killing 12 Israelis in retaliation for the Hebron massacre of 30 Moslem worshippers by a Jewish settler.
