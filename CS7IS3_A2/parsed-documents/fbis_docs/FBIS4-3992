The participants include experts from the Ministry of National Defense, the General Staff Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of State Security, and research institutes specialized in studies of strategy and world issues. Toward the end of last year, the Ministry of Defense called meetings in this category on two occasions, with topics including Sino-U.S. relations, the security of the Nansha [Spratly] Islands, the election of the new Russian parliament, and measures for the security of various peripheral countries in the Asia-Pacific Region. Based on the discussions at these meetings, this journal has sorted out an article on Sino-U.S. relations for our readers' reference. Since last May, when U.S. President Clinton announced the extension of MFN status to China for the 1993-94 fiscal year, Sino-U.S. economic exchanges have deepened and expanded further, with a rapid increase in U.S. investment in China. At the same time, U.S. media has given voluminous coverage to "China's miraculous economic growth," which created a positive climate of opinion for the Clinton administration to review its China policy in a comprehensive way and to improve Sino-U.S. relations. However, since the beginning of the third quarter, some troubles have surfaced in Sino-U.S. relations. For example: The U.S. implementation of "Category II trade sanctions" under the pretext of China's having sold M-11 guided-missile technology to Pakistan, the "Yinhe" incident, and the continued U.S. sales of advanced weapons and equipment to Taiwan. The United States Tries Hard To Mend Its Relations With China Reviewing Sino-U.S. relations over the past six months or so, it is not difficult to see that the United States has been getting impatient with waitng for China to make corresponding concessions in such arenas as human rights and weapon proliferation. In addition, an all-encompassing and consistent China policy on the part of the Clinton administration, as well as a continuous guiding principle in this arena, are not on the horizon. Thus, it has been impossible to effectively control the escalation of friction between the two sides, resulting in greater turbulence in the unstable bilateral relations. However, the United States has misgivings over the growing tension in Sino-U.S. relations. This being the case, the Clinton administration has taken a series of initiatives. For example, Anthony Lake, assistant to the President for national security affairs, submitted a comprehensive policy document to Clinton in mid-September last year, in which he proposed mending U.S. relations with China. In Seattle, the Chinese and U.S. heads of state finally accomplished their first meeting since February 1989. "Economic Security Equates With National Security" The factor prompting the United States to readjust its China policy lies primarily in the fact that focus of U.S. diplomatic strategy has shifted to the economy. While summarizing the six key points in U.S. diplomatic strategy, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said: "Economic security equates with national security," while stressing that the economy is primary among all diplomatic focal points, and emphasizing the importance to U.S. economic revival of U.S. participation and leadership in Asia-Pacific economic operation. He believed that "no other area in the world is more important than the East Asian and Pacific region." In recent years, bilateral trade between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region has increased, with an average annual growth rate of 9.1 percent. In 1993, the volume of trade between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region was $344.05 billion, accounting for 52 percent of U.S. general export volume. Over the past two years, China's economy has enjoyed a high growth rate, and has become a focus in the world, forcing the United States to renew its understanding of China, and to show concern for the ever-expanding U.S. economic interests in China. At present, the volume of Sino-U.S. bilateral trade approaches $70 billion. China is an important market for U.S. commercial aircraft, electronic equipment, and farm produce. In these three areas alone, 63,000 job opportunities have been created for the United States. U.S. Businessmen Urge the U.S. Government To Revise Its China Policy In the fourth annual survey of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 98 percent of those polled believed the prospects for investment in mainland China to be "favorable" or "very favorable." At the same time, 78 percent of U.S. companies believed that the disputes over MFN status would jeopardize their commercial activities in China. So we can see that with the expansion of U.S. investment interests in China, U.S. businessmen are urging the government to re-examine Sino-U.S. relations so as to ensure comprehensive U.S. participation in China's economic development. Apart from economic considerations, the United States also is calling for China's cooperation in handling global and regional security. In actual fact, because China is one of the countries having mastery of guided missiles and nuclear technology, the United States will have to rely on China in its "non-proliferation diplomacy." In particular, viewed from the angle of Asia-Pacific regional security, China has played a vitally important role in the UN peace-keeping plan in Cambodia, easing the tense situation and realizing a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, and promoting the building of a multilateral security mechanism in the Asia-Pacific region. At at time when the United States is attempting to "take an active part and play a leading role" in the Asia-Pacific region, it would be impractical to reject China's participation and support. Based on the new principle that "Sino-U.S. relations are one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world," the United States has started to establish new focuses in its China policy, namely: 1) To take the initiative into its own hand to restore high-level dialogues in various arenas; 2) To take a practical attitude toward the existence of China as a political and military power, and establish "normal military relations" with China, which are not aimed at any third country, but are conducive to world peace and stability, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as regional security; and 3) In areas where the differences between the two sides are comparatively great, for example, the human rights issue, the United States also has stated that it will not proceed from U.S. value concepts in "doing business with China," but will "reflect the commitments made by various countries according to the UN Charter," which shows that from now on, the United States will exert influence on China by relying more heavily on "international criteria." The United States Is Worried About the Shaping of the Sino-Russian Alliance Since July last year, the new trends in Russia's foreign policy have placed a renewed stress on the maintenance of the traditional national interests and sphere of influence. What worries the United States is that this change in Russia's foreign policy has taken place under conditions of a malignant growth of nationalism in Russia. At the same time, the United States has renewed its worries about the shaping of a Russia-China alliance, and was anxious about Russian Defense Minister Grachev's China visit. That being the case, while thinking of readjusting its policy toward Russia, the United States acknowledged: "The importance of China has been neglected over the past few years," and hoped that China would become a "friend" of the United States through so-called "contact strategy." To summarize, China's rapid economic development and growing comprehensive national strength, the integration of economic interests between China and the United States, and the concerns over Russia are the basic considerations pushing the Clinton administration to establish the axes of its policy toward China. Since President Clinton approved the "Action Memorandum" set out by the National Security Council in mid-September last year, quite a few high-ranking U.S. officials have visited China, one after another. Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Clinton met in Seattle in late November last year; in mid-March this year, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited China. All this shows that progress has been made recently in Sino-U.S. relations. Nevertheless, the improvement in bilateral relations is confined to elevating the levels of contact and expanding the areas, pending satisfactory solutions to substantial issues. During his recent China visit, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was somewhat relaxed about the linking of MFN status with human rights conditions; this brought about a silver lining to the cloud hanging over China's MFN status. However, a solution to this issue once and for all continues to call for the two sides' joint efforts. The ups and downs in Sino-U.S. relations in recent years were related to the readjustment in U.S. strategic focuses; now that the United States has seen the importance of the Asia-Pacific region, and has a renewed understanding of China's role, the Clinton administration has been active toward China, resulting in a change in Sino-U.S. relations. In view of this, it is advisable for China to have a comprehensive, long-range strategy toward the United States, as well as short-range measures for individual specific issues. To achieve this end, we make the following suggestions: Revise the Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques I. It is necessary to strive for the revision of the communiques on bilateral relations. The three existing communiques on Sino-U.S. relations were signed against the backdrop of the Cold War. The 1982 "17 August" Communique already has stood for 12 years, and many of its contents cannot reflect the new foundation and realities in Sino-U.S. relations. The problems surfacing in Sino-U.S. relations in recent years increasingly have revealed the fragility of bilateral relations founded on ideology. Today, it is imperative to find a new supporting point. It seems inevitable that economic cooperation will be the new tie in relations between the two countries. However, this point has never been touched on in the three past communiques. This being the case, a mechanism to standardize disputes is not on the horizon. For example, this important principle in handling issues involving economic relations and trade, as well as political matters, should be written into the new communique. II. The issue of human rights. The human rights issue will remain a thorny one in Sino-U.S relations from now on, and this has a bearing on the MFN status after 1994. To handle this issue, China may take the following measures: 1. To adopt a tough stance, fighting tit for tat: China should adhere to the principle of separating trade and political issues, while opposing the addition of human rights conditions to the MFN status. China should do more work in the U.S. Congress, in the U.S. Government, and among the U.S. public so as to win the support of more people. At the same time, China should take full advantage of the media to indicate the serious human rights issues in the United States. The Chinese Foreign Ministry should collect materials about human rights conditions in the United States: racial discrimination, violence, and murder, for example. These should be published each year, while a list of Chinese citizens suffering from violence and unfair treatment in the United States should be submitted to the U.S. side. 2. To agree to discuss the human rights issue, though it should not be linked to the MFN status. We may take into consideration making the international discussion of the human rights issue regular and institutional. Discussions can be conducted between governments, as well as scholars. The issues of human rights in China, as well as in the United States, can be discussed. According to a U.S. State Department official, this the minimum requirement of the U.S. side on the "human rights" conditions, the fulfillment of which will somewhat help the extension of the MFN status. Releasing Counterrevolutionaries 3. According to the revised penal code, some imprisoned counterrevolutionaries should be released in all at once. At present, the definition of "counterrevolutionary crime" is comparatively vague in China's current penal code, and it would be very difficult for the code to be compare with foreign penal codes, and to be understood and accepted in the world, so the code's revision seems imperative. Furthermore, this practice will enable China to have a law by which to abide when dealing with issues in this category, as well as sufficient legal grounds to deal with U.S. "human rights diplomacy," in contrast to the practice of releasing one or two political prisoners each year when the United States is set to discuss the extension of China's MFN status. 4. Further relax restrictions on emigrants: The United States regards freedom of emigration as one of the basic human rights. Although China has relaxed its emigration policy on several occasions, it is still impossible for Chinese citizens to leave the country freely. "Human rights" issues are derived from such conditions, which then are linked to the issue of the "imprisonment of political offenders," and used to deal with China. In Clinton's order to extend MFN status to China last year, he continued including freedom of emigration as a prerequisite, while requiring China to "permit Chinese citizens to emigrate overseas for political or religious reasons, without any restriction." This being the case, we suggest that the departments concerned further relax restrictions on citizens' crossing the border, so that legitimate emigrants many enjoy full freedom, and the United States' additional human rights condition thus lose its "legal grounds." 5. Further reveal the truth concerning U.S. exports of prison-produced products: Many states in the United States have prison factories, and the law permits the export of their products. The United States, however, is making a great fuss over products turned out by Chinese prisoners. China has failed to fully expose this unreasonable behavior, and seems to be very passive. China also should investigate and publish the conditions under which U.S. prison products are exported.
