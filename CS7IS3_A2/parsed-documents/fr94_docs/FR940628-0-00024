FR940628-0-00024 FR940628-0-00017 Changes : The regulations have been revised to reflect the limitation on loan forgiveness for public service. The Secretary notes that regulations reflecting this loan forgiveness demonstration program are being published separately. Section 682.200␣Definitions Co-Maker Comments : A commenter noted that there is an understanding throughout the FFEL industry that the Department is considering deleting references to ``co-maker'' and replacing that term with the term ``endorser.'' Discussion : The terms ``endorser'' and ``co-maker'' are not synonymous and reflect different legal obligations. The Secretary will not be deleting the reference to co-maker, since it is a term used in the Consolidation Loan Program. ``Endorser'' is the term used in the Federal PLUS Program for borrowers with adverse credit. Changes : None. Disposable Income Comments : Some commenters suggested that in the definition of ``disposable income'' the reference to ``any amounts required by law to be withheld'' was unclear and recommended further clarification. The commenters noted, for example, that child support payments would qualify under this definition if the payments were made under a divorce settlement rather than a court order. The commenters believed that the Department should not treat borrowers who are subject to garnishment for private debts more favorably than borrowers who are making payments without the need for court intervention. Discussion : The Secretary clarifies that the definition of ``disposable income'' is that part of a borrower's compensation from an employer and other income from any source that remains after the deduction of amounts required by law to be withheld or any child support or alimony payments that are made under a court order or in accordance with a legally enforceable written agreement. The Secretary has also revised the definition to exclude payments made under a wage garnishment order. Changes : The definition of ``disposable income'' has been revised to clarify those payments that may be deducted from the borrower's compensation. Estimated Financial Assistance Comments : Some commenters expressed the same opinion raised during the negotiations that requiring aid officers to certify the student's estimated eligibility for the Federal Perkins loan or Federal Work-Study program regardless of whether the student applies for the aid is not reasonable. Some commenters believed that it is unjust to penalize a student who declines campus-based awards and that it is inappropriate to have the financial aid administrator determine what is an ``acceptable reason'' for declining aid. Discussion : After further consideration of the commenter's views, the Secretary agrees that financial aid officers should not be required to certify estimated eligibility for other aid that the student does not apply for or consider as estimated financial assistance aid offered but declined by the student. The Secretary believes that students and their families should have discretion in those areas not prescribed by law and that aid administrators should not be placed in the position of evaluating the merits of a student's reason for declining an award. The Secretary notes that this position is consistent with Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) Program. Changes : The regulations have been revised to delete reference to ``whether or not the student applied'' under paragraph (1)(vii) and paragraph (2) has been added to delete the reference to the declining aid for an acceptable reason. Nonsubsidized Stafford Loan Comments : A commenter recommended that the definition be revised to reflect that those loans are not eligible for special allowance under §682.302. The commenter suggested that confusion exists between the terms ``unsubsidized Stafford Loan'' and ``nonsubsidized Stafford Loan'' and the revision would clarify the difference. Discussion : The Secretary agrees with the commenter's concern that the regulations need to reflect a clear distinction between the two programs and has revised the regulations to clarify that a nonsubsidized loan does not qualify for special allowance payments. Changes : The regulations have been revised to reflect the comment.
