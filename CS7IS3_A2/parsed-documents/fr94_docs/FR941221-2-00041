This proposed settlement is intended to resolve the liabilities under CERCLA of 11 de minimis parties for costs incurred and to be incurred for response actions at the Old City of York Landfill Site, York County, Pennsylvania. DATES: Comments must be provided on or before January 20, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Suzanne Canning, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, Regional Docket Clerk (3RC00), 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19107, and should refer to: Old City of York Landfill Site, York County, Pennsylvania, and U.S. EPA Docket No. III&hyph;94&hyph;24&hyph;DC.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice of De Minimis Settlement: In accordance with Section 122(i)(1) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(i)(1), notice is hereby given of a proposed administrative settlement concerning the Old City of York Landfill Site in York County, Pennsylvania. The administrative settlement was signed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region III's Regional Administrator on September 23, 1994 and is subject to review by the public pursuant to this Notice. The proposed settlement has received the prior written approval of the Attorney General, United States Department of Justice or her designee. Below are listed the parties who have executed binding certifications of their consent to participate in the settlement: A.B. Chance Company/Emerson Electric BMY-Combat Systems Certainteed Keystone Colorworks Molycorp Root Corporation Schmuck's Cleaners SHC Liquidating York Hospital York International York Wallcoverings These 11 parties collectively agreed to pay $819,140.48 to the United States Environmental Protection Agency subject to the contingency that the United States Environmental Protection Agency may elect not to complete the settlement based on matters brought to its attention during the public comment period established by this Notice. EPA is entering into this agreement under the authority of Sections 122 (g) and (h) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622 (g) and (h). Section 122 (g) and (h) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622 (g) and (h), authorizes early settlements with de minimis parties to allow them to resolve their liabilities under, inter alia , Sections 106 and 107 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607, to reimburse the United States for response costs incurred and to be incurred in cleaning up Superfund sites without incurring substantial transaction costs. Under this authority the Environmental Protection Agency proposes to settle with potentially responsible parties at the Old City of York Landfill Site who are responsible for less than 1 percent of the total volume of waste at the Site and either sent trash-like waste that contained a relatively low concentration of hazardous substances, or sent very small amounts of waste mixtures containing solvents to the site. The de minimis parties listed above will be required to pay their per capita share of the past costs associated with the Site through November 9, 1993, subject only to ability to pay showings made by two parties, their volumetric share of the remedial costs incurred and to be incurred at the Old City of York Landfill Site, and a 200% premium on the remedial costs. The Environmental Protection Agency will receive written comments to this proposed administrative settlement for thirty (30) days from the date of publication of this Notice. A copy of the proposed Administrative Order on Consent can be obtained from Suzanne Canning, Regional Docket Clerk, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19107, (215) 597&hyph;8913.
