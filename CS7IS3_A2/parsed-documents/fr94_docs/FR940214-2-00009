FR940214-2-00009 FR940214-2-00003 Panel Decision On January 28, 1994, the Binational Panel affirmed in part and remanded in part the final affirmative injury redetermination made by the U.S. International Trade Commission on October 25, 1993. The Panel affirmed the Commission's remand determination with regard to imports from Quebec. The Panel remanded the Commission's redetermination in the following respects: (1) With respect to the Commission's causation determination, the Panel found that the information and analysis regarding the role of SPF in the U.S. softwood lumber market, and the regional price and import penetration comparisons, do not constitute substantial evidence of price suppression by reason of imports of softwood lumber from Canada or are not otherwise in accordance with law. (2) As to the Commission's price trends analysis, the Panel found that the analysis, in its present form, did not contitute substantial evidence and is otherwise not in accordance with law. The Panel further found that, should the Commission on remand rely on price trends data to support an affirmative determination, the Commission is to provide a full analysis and explanation of the underlying data and the methodology employed in the creation and presentation of the price trends analysis. The Binational Panel instructed The Commission to provide its determination on remand within 45 days of the panel decision (by March 14, 1994). Dated: February 8, 1994. James R. Holbein, United States Secretary, FTA Binational Secretariat. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3342 Filed 2&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;GT&hyph;M
