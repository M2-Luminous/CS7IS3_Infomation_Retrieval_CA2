A list of additional references for the Application Profile is contained in section 5, References, of the specifications. 7. Objectives. The objectives of the Application Profile for the GILS are to: _Enable users to identify, locate, and access or acquire publicly available Federal information resources, including electronic information resources. _Provide a uniform approach to providing information locator services to the public. _Enable every agency to establish standards-based network-accessible locator records. 8. Applicability. a. This standard is recommended for use by Federal agencies in the development and establishment of information locators, i.e., information resources that identify other information resources, describe the information available in those resources, and provide assistance in how to obtain the information. b. This standard is required for use by Federal agencies in those information locators that are established and maintained as part of the Government Information Locator System (GILS) pursuant to the requirements of OMB Bulletin 94&hyph; XXXX and other applicable, law, regulation, and policy. c. The GILS Core requirements of this standard apply to those GILS locator records which: _Describe information resources maintained by the Federal government, _Comply with the defined GILS Core Elements; _Are mutually accessible through interconnected electronic network facilities without charge to the direct user; and _Are designated by the agency to be part of the Federal government GILS Core, pursuant to OMB Bulletin 94&hyph; XXXX . 9. Specifications. The Application Profile for the Government Information Locator System, (affixed). 10. Implementation. The implementation of this standard involves three areas of consideration: development and acquisition of GILS implementations, validation, and interpretations of the standard. 10.1␣Development and Acquisition of GILS Implementations. This standard is effective June 30, 1995. 10.2␣Validation. Validation of GILS implementation is not required at this time. Testing for conformance to this standards is at the discretion of the agency. Agencies may select the tests to be administer4ed and the testing organization that administer the tests. 10.3␣Interpretation of this standard. Resolution of questions regarding this standard will be provided by NIST. Questions concerning the content and specifications should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: FIPS for GILS Interpretation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Telephone: (301) 975&hyph;2833. 11. Waivers. Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official designated pursuant to Section 3506(b) of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when: a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal computer system, or b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Governmentwide savings. Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required findings(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified, shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; Attn: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, Room B&hyph;154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899. In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the Federal Register . When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver determination must be published in the Commerce Business Daily as part of the notice of solicitation for offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice. A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any supporting and accompanying documents, with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552(b), shall be part of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency. 12. Where to Obtain Copies.
