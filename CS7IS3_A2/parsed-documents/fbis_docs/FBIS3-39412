The government is taking measures to prevent a new crisis in the market with the planned payment of 17 trillion Turkish lira in civil servants' salaries tomorrow and 27 trillion for the internal debt the next day. But the civil servants, over whose salaries a political storm has broken out, fail to understand the governments' concern. [passage omitted] The news of the issuance of 44 trillion has already started affecting the money markets. The dollar fell and interest rates rose. Most important of all, the stock exchange, which had been sliding for weeks, suddenly rebounded. [Begin recording] [Reporter] Today, investors were happy at the Istanbul stock exchange where for the last three weeks every 100 Turkish lira invested lost 52 Turkish lira in value. The index rose by 1,232 points and leveled at 15,096. The hope that part of the 44 trillion to be injected into the market tomorrow will flow into the stock exchange has already pushed prices up. [Muslun Demirbilek, president of the stockbrokers association] This atmosphere appears to be conducive for the stock exchange to reestablish its balance. Therefore, our advice to our investors is not to sell their valuable shares and take a long-term view, as time is working to the advantage of the stock market. [Reporter] The banks also supported the idea of keeping holdings in Turkish lira. IS Bank, TYT Bank, and Demirbank increased their interest rates for savings accounts 2-6 percent. The yearly interest rate rose to 105.5 percent. [end recording] Each person is making his own calculations in these critical days. On the one hand we have the dollar and on the other the Turkish lira. Where will the money flow? Measures have already been taken today to prevent the flow of money starting tomorrow from causing a new black Wednesday, as happened two weeks ago. Interest rates rose and the value of foreign currencies fell, and the Treasury and the Central Bank have gone into action. [Begin recording] [Reporter] The government fears the money could be converted into foreign currency and then hidden under the bed. The Treasury and the Central Bank will act together to prevent such a thing, which might lead to devaluation of the Turkish lira and then to inflation. These two government institutions will use the weapon of high interest rates to absorb the 17 trillion in salaries and 27 trillion in internal debt. The Central Bank will sell advance notes issued to it by the Treasury to the banks and collect the money. The Treasury itself will sell bonds at 125 to 130 percent interest to the people. Thus, the demand for foreign currency, a phenomena observed after each payment of salaries to the civil servants, will be stopped. In short, the government will try to prevent a new black Wednesday.
