Japan's intentions were notified in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor from Japanese Ambassador to Washington Takakazu Kuriyama, published the same day by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. In the letter, dated March 12, the day when the bilateral deal was struck, Kuriyama said the Japanese Government will "monitor and oversee completion of the actions described in the letter," referring to the agreement. If the actions called for in the agreement have not been implemented, Japan, in consultation with the U.S., "will take all available measures to ensure compliance with the letter by the next quarterly review." Under the bilateral agreement, Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) will take several steps to help improve access for Motorola Inc. of the U.S. to the Japanese market, including the establishment of 159 new relay stations for Motorola-formula telephone services by October 1995. The two governments agreed to meet every three months or on request by either government to assess implementation of the agreement. The accord came just in time for the deadline for threatened U.S. trade sanctions against Japan. Washington had accused Japan of breaching a 1989 Japan-U.S. trade accord meant to boost imports of U.S. cellular phones and set March 17 as the deadline for an announcement of sanctions over its trade disputes with Tokyo.
