The strongest European reaction to Saturday's shelling of a market in the Bosnian capital which killed at least 66 people came from Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. Speaking ahead of a meeting of EC foreign ministers here on Monday [7 February], he called on the United Nations to authorise air strikes on Serb batteries around Sarajevo. In Germany, the government said "the use of targeted military action, as NATO proposed to the UN on August 9, should no longer be ruled out." At the time, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which includes most EC countries, proposed mounting air strikes to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, which is surrounded by Bosnian Serb forces. But although the organisation has often repeated its readiness to use air strikes, if it got a UN go-ahead, the threat has not been implemented. The French Government called for a clear plan of action from the UN and NATO to end the siege of Sarajevo, including the possible use of air strikes. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, for his part, condemned the attack as a "barbaric act of violence" Sunday adding that the Bosnian people's "misery and suffering must end." Military intervention has been resisted by Russia and Greece, which have generally pro-Serb sympathies. Opposition to air strikes has also come from countries with large military contingents backing UN aid missions in Bosnia, particularly Britain, which fear reprisal attacks on their forces. Diplomats predicted that the mounting bloodshed in the Bosnian civil war, and the EC's impotence to stop it, would fuel a drive at Monday's meeting not only for military intervention but also for a rethink of EC policy. [passage omitted] Claes said ahead of Saturday's massacre that a greater U.S. role was necessary in Bosnia, particularly to reassure the Moslems that a peace agreement would stick, and to press the Serbs and Croats into accepting it. Another EC official said: "It seems clear the Moslems are raising the stakes and that all parties (Serbs, Croats and Moslems) seem completely confident they have more to gain from fighting than from negotiating." A spokesman for the EC's Greek presidency said on Friday that the Community was sticking to its peace proposals for the three-way division of Bosnia into Serb, Croat and Moslem republics. "We believe it is a good plan which can still work," he said, adding that Monday's meeting would include a "general review, an open debate" on Bosnia. [passage omitted] Some EC countries, notably France, have criticised U.S. reluctance to get involved in the Bosnian civil war since the Europeans rejected U.S. proposals last year to arm the Bosnian Moslems and launch air strikes against the Serbs. But the chief of the French Armed Forces Admiral Jacques Lanxade on Sunday warned against "simplistic ideas like a military intervention against the Serbs or a lifting of the arms embargo."
