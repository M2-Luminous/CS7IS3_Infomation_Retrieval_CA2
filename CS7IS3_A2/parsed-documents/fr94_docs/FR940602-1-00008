The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class E airspace at Nashville International Airport, Tennessee. Runways 2C and 20C have been extended. The Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface is proposed to be extended from a 10-mile radius to a 15-mile radius of the Nashville International Airport to contain IFR operations within controlled airspace for these runways. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designations of Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface are published on Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in CFR 71.1 effective September 16, 1993. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter than will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
