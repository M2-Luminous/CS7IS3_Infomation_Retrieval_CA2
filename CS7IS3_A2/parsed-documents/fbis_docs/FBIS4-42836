If they don't go, they will be repatriated to Vietnam. Tomorrow in Hanoi, the Netherlands and Vietnam are to sign an agreement determining the procedures for the return of this group, Foreign Minister Kooijmans told the Second Chamber. Some 350 people are involved. Vietnam has agreed not to persecute them on their return. That was the condition required by the Second Chamber before it would approve the agreement. The Justice Ministry has given the refugees six months to leave the country of their own accord, after which time they will be forcibly expelled. Asylum-seekers who return to Vietnam of their own accord can count on assistance from the International Organization of Migration and from UNICEF, the UN refugee organization. The group in question are Vietnamese who worked as contract workers in Czechoslovakia before fleeing to the Netherlands following the "velvet" revolution, for fear of discrimination. A total of 500 Vietnamese came to the Netherlands, about 150 of whom have since voluntarily returned to Prague or Vietnam. The Netherlands did not want to recognize them as refugees as Justice Minister Kosto did not believe there were any grounds for doing so. The Second Chamber found return to Vietnam undesirable as long as the Vietnamese Government had not guaranteed they would not be persecuted.
