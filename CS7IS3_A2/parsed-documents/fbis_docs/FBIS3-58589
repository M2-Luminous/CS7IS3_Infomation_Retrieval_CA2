The Swiss Foreign Ministry made the announcement without providing details, but an investigating judge says he is continuing enquiries, hoping for new developments in the affair. France reneged on previous extradition pledges and expelled the two wanted men last year. The expulsion caused a diplomatic row between France and Switzerland and the Swiss justice minister, Arnold Koller, said on Wednesday that Switzerland would raise the subject with the Council of Europe, if necessary. He said France should explain why the Iranians were not extradited as originally agreed. The two Iranians are wanted in connection with the killing of an Iranian opposition leader, Kazem Rajavi, in Geneva nearly three years [as heard] ago.
