FBIS3-43948 "drafr014_c_94013" FBIS-AFR-94-014 Document Type:Daily Report 21 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Press Review for 20 Jan MB2001125594 MB2001125594 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Electoral Commission on Voting Disruption -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 20 January in a page 14 editorial welcomes the Independent Electoral Commission's [IEC] message that "it will not tolerate attempts to disrupt voting during the election." However, "the IEC warning that it will exclude from the final tally votes from areas where disruption has taken place is understandable, but this may not be enough to discourage interference. Rather, it risks playing into the hands of those intending to halt the process through intimidation and violence." 'Wrong' To Dismiss Right-Wing Threats -- A second editorial on the same page says details "are scanty" of the Afrikaner National Front (AVF) plan to implement its own transitional authority on 29 January. "On the face of it, this 'implementation' looks like one more angry rally, another bit of right-wing theatre. Still, it would be wrong to dismiss as entirely empty the threats coming from the Right as the election draws closer." Public servants "have some potential to disrupt the country's administration. And it takes only a few crazies of the armed Right to cause more serious havoc." BUSINESS DAY Concern Over ANC Economic Statements -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 20 January in a page 4 editorial believes foreign confidence in South Africa's potential "is growing in line with domestic" confidence. However, the "diversity of opinion" within the ANC regarding its economic statements "has led to understandable uncertainty and concern over what the party can deliver while maintaining its appeal to a broad constituency if, as expected, it wins an absolute majority in April. For the present, strategy is focused on winning this year's election. Though attention has been paid to longer-term economic possibilities, electioneering has led to a significant element of economic populism forming part of the ANC's electoral platform. The question is, can sterile populism be dropped quietly after April and replaced with the fiscal policies, incentives and social stability needed if the present conditional optimism is to continue?" CAPE TIMES PAC Leadership Divided Over Armed Struggle -- "The PAC, which has come in from the cold to take part in constitutional politics, is running into heavy weather both at home and abroad because of its equivocal attitude to violence and the alleged terrorist operations of its military wing, APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army]," declares a page 4 editorial in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 14 January. The Tanzanian Government said it would no longer allow the PAC to "wage armed struggle from bases on Tanzanian territory," and now Zimbabwean President Mugabe "is under pressure to order APLA to close its training bases in Zimbabwe." CAPE TIMES says the Zimbabwean Government, "with its close links to the PAC, would do well to bring home to the confused and apparently divided leadership that they cannot have it both ways." ANC Mines Policy -- A second editorial on the same page says the ANC's proposals for state ownership of South Africa's mineral wealth "should not rekindle nationalisation fears nor various other alarms associated with centrally-planned economies." CAPE TIMES believes the "thrust of the ANC mines policy appears unexceptionable, ensuring mining operations are conducted to the benefit of all." Unfortunately, the ANC policy "begins to go wonky when it comes to the call for the mining industry to develop innovative ways of creating black-owned mining houses. In the 1990's it makes more sense for government and the market place to look after that one, hopefully through the benefits of a growing economy based on free market principles."
