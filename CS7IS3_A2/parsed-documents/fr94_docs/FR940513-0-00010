FR940513-0-00010 FR940513-0-00003 The FCC recommended that there be an additional exception in paragraph (g) of this section under which an otherwise prohibited transaction would be permissible if approved by the Standards of Conduct Official. Paragraph (g) of the proposed regulations prohibited lending transactions between directors and other directors, employees or borrowers, but excepts loans between family members, loans made in an official capacity, and transactions in the ordinary course of business, as defined. The commenter recommended that the suggested approval be based upon a determination that the transaction does not present any significant risk of impairing the director's (or employee's) ability to perform his or her duties with impartiality and in compliance with regulations. After considering the comment and the likelihood that the institutions themselves are in the best position to know what is in the ordinary course of business in the local business environment, the Board concluded that the suggestion had merit as a substitution for the ordinary course of business exception. However, the Board believes that there should be a regulatory standard against which such determinations can be evaluated that will provide a measure of uniformity among FCS institutions. The Board concluded that some relief from the prohibition is appropriate when the transaction is so insignificant in amount as not to create the appearance of a conflict in the eyes of a reasonable person or is an ordinary course of business transaction that is not on preferential terms. Therefore, in the final regulations the proposed ordinary course of business exception has been replaced by a provision that essentially allows the Standards of Conduct Officer to grant a waiver where: (1) The amount of the transaction is so immaterial that it would not cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question the impartiality or objectivity of the director in performing his or her official duties; or (2) where the transaction is in the ordinary course of business; provided the director recuses him or herself from any matter affecting the financial interest of the other party to the transaction. ``Ordinary course of business'' is defined to mean a transaction with a person who is in the business of offering the goods or services that are the subject of the transaction on terms that are not preferential or a transaction between two persons who are in business together that is incident to the business they conduct together. A ``preferential'' transaction is one that is not on the same terms as those available for comparable transactions with other persons who are not officers and directors of System institutions. The Standard of Conduct Official's determination that either of the circumstances warranting an exception exists must be documented and is subject to the recordkeeping requirements, unless the transaction falls within any materiality thresholds for various types of transactions or specific ordinary course of business guidelines established by the Board's standards-of-conduct policy. While not applicable, the Uniform Standards of Ethical Conduct for Executive Branch Employees may be useful as a resource in determining such policy guidelines. The Board believes that this change responds to the FCC's concern that a deferral of payment may be construed as a loan and the concern that the exclusion in the proposed regulation may fail to reach transactions between an elected director (or employee) who is a borrower and an institution's outside director. The FCC recommended that the FCA explain its rationale for prohibiting employees from being financially obligated with directors, other employees, and borrowers, but having no similar prohibition for directors.
