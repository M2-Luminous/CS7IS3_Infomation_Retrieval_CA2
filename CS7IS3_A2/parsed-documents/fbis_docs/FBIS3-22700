"Individual governments have to increase their input and intensify community involvement in the vaccination programmes," said Kebba Jobe, a Gambian participant, said. Speaking before the start of the seminar Jobe, who manages his country's expanded programme on immunization, said the Gambia had attained 69 percent immunisation for children aged below one year. He said donors must continue supporting Gambia to reduce the cost of vaccines and thereby increase the percentage of immunisation. A Mauritanian delegate, Dr. Pradbodh Munbodh, said managers of immunisation programmes in Africa should adopt private sector working methods to reduce bureaucracy. He told delegates from South Africa that by 1992, Mauritania had attained vaccination of between 75 and 80 percent of all pregnant women, 85 percent of children against measles and 90 percent against diphteria, whooping cough and tetanus. "Since you face an enourmous vaccination task in your country, the best thing is to motivate the paramedical personnel directly involved in the field," he told Ray Mabope, the African National Congress' (ANC) national chair on vaccination and immunisation and Bonginkosi Mhlanga of the Pan-Africanist Congress' (PAC) health directorate. Mabope said that with its three vaccine manufacturing institutions, South Africa should be able to vaccinate all its children within the next few years and become a vaccine supplier to countries in the southern African development community. This, he said, would entail rationalising the activities of the South African Institute for Medical Research, the State Vaccine Institute and the National Institute of Virology "to cut down wastage." Mhlanga said that although the South African Government claimed it had achieved 80 percent immunisation of its children, "we have to unify the country first before analysing the situation in South Africa, especially in the homelands, where the situation is not clear." South Africa is due to form its first democratic government after the country's first non-racial elections on 26-28 April. The four-day seminar, which has attracted vaccination experts from Africa, Europe and the United States, is to be opened later today by Cote d'Ivoire's health minister, Maurice Guikahue. The theme is: "To build a durable partnership for immunisations for Africa." It is the fourth of its kind, after those of Bamako in 1974, Dakar in 1981 and Niamey in 1987. South Africa, which is taking part for the first time, is represented by an eight-person multiracial delegation, including representatives of government and the former liberation movements -- ANC and PAC.
