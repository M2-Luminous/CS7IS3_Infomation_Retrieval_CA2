Finance Minister Julius Toth's decision became effective straight after the Wednesday [16 February] meeting of the Customs Union Council (RCU). Today the decision was discussed with Slovak customs authorities, the spokesman said. The documents specified in the agreement between the Czech and Slovak offices for normalization, metrology, and inspection will be required at the border after March 31. Toth's decision states that the two sides must agree on mutual recognition of testing procedures and certificates. Yesterday Slovakia withdrew from the sudden and unilateral requirement it made on February 11 according to which no food products could be imported into the country without a quality certificate issued by Slovak organs. Officials said the measure was inspired by concern to limit the import of poor quality food products.
