Granic met in Bonn with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel to discuss the involvement of Croatia's regular army troops in the fighting between the Bosnian Croats and Muslems in Mostar, a city in southern Bosnia, and in other regions. The UN Security Council has ordered Croatia to withdraw its troops from Bosnia by February 17 or face international sanctions. After the deadline expired, the UN secreatry general informed the Security Council that about 5,000 soldiers of the regular Croat Army remain in Bosnia. Following talks with Granic, Kinkel said there are hopes for a peaceful solution to the war in Bosnia especially after the favourable developments in Sarajevo, but he underscored that there are `several Sarajevos' in Bosnia. In an interview with the German radio Kinkel said that Russia's involvement in the peace process in Bosnia is extremely important and that there can be no resolution of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia without Russia. Granic told a press conference that the Croatian Government would do everything so that the problems in Bosnia and in the other parts of the former Yugoslavia are resolved in a peaceful way through political means.
