Ex-Khmer Rouge fighters spend eight to 10 weeks at this military-run re-education camp just east of the capital before graduating with the offer of a post, and possible promotion, in the Cambodian army. Some 600 defectors finished the first course of re-education in November but the figure was down to 198 in May and only 51 former guerrillas are currently enrolled. Much of the initial success of the programme was attributed to heavy publicity. Co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen made regular public appeals for guerrillas to defect and helicopters air-dropped leaflets with the same message into Khmer Rouge-controlled zones. Defectors at the camp, however, said that while they were still attracted by the government's call for national reconciliation, the centre itself had acquired a bad reputation. "We heard that people were not treated well by the military in the camp," one defector said, adding that some guerrillas had escaped back to the jungle and advised their comrades not to enroll. A human rights organisation which investigated the programme said it had been "marred by corruption involving top army commanders and cases of ill-treatment," but camp commandant General Say Khon dismissed the criticisms as outdated. "We did have complaints of bad treatment, fake defectors and corruption earlier, but since the end of the first course we have had no problems," he said. "The programme is going well," he added, but declined comment on the allegation that the number of defectors is down sharply. Defectors agreed that there were no longer any cases of serious ill-treatment but they complained of strict discipline and few perks. "We have no money even to buy cigarettes. Life in the jungle was easier than this," a former guerrilla said. The programme ran into controversy soon after the first re-education course started and it was discovered that several hundred participants were only pretending to be Khmer Rouge. Civilians and demobilised soldiers had bribed corrupt army officers or middlemen to be enrolled as Khmer Rouge defectors in the hope of landing a job with the national army. A number of the imposters complained to human rights groups of beatings and other humiliating punishments and more than 200 men, including several genuine guerrillas, later escaped. The programme was further discredited in January when a Khmer Rouge division commander, his deputy and some 92 other defectors were expelled as imposters. "Most of them were real Khmer Rouge and felt betrayed. They returned to the forest and rejoined the Khmer Rouge," said a human rights official who asked not to be identified. The programme now holds so little attraction that most Khmer Rouge who want to defect simply slip away quietly or surrender to local authorities, a defector said. "Most would prefer to return to their villages and families. Only those who have no alternative come here," he said. The Khmer Rouge control some 10 to 15 per cent of the country and continue to wage a guerrilla war against the government installed following last year's UN-supervised polls. Although government officials say some 3,000 guerrillas have defected since the amnesty programme started, the Khmer Rouge have still caused significant battlefield upsets for the government forces. The radical faction is also on a recruitment drive to further boost the strength of their forces, government officials said recently.
