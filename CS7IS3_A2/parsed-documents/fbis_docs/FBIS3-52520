Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin made this remark today, adding: Both Israel and the PLO have a vested interest in the resumption of the talks. The prime minister made the remarks during a farewell ceremony for outgoing U.S. Ambassador William Brown. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports from the prime minister's bureau: [Begin recording] [Segal] 'Arafat is trying to deviate from the agreement of principles, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said. We, for our part, are committed to the agreement and our stand is clear. We are exchanging comments and messages, the prime minister confirmed. The issue of the resumption of the Taba talks is being clarified, Rabin said, and will certainly be decided on within the next few days. [Rabin] Basically, however, they are still claiming that the matters discussed in Cairo are ad referendum [last two words as heard], that is -- pending approval. The scope of approval or whether there is approval at all is currently being examined. If for them it is ad referendum, for us too it is ad referendum. [Segal] The scope of approval was expressed in several additional faxed messages received at the Foreign Ministry over the past few hours. A senior Foreign Ministry source told us that the Palestinians understand our demands, and added: We are certain that the whole matter will be settled in a few days. Rabin also sounded optimistic. Speaking at the ceremony today, he rejected an attempt to portray the Oslo agreement as a dish that went sour: [Rabin] I believe it did not go sour. The dish is fine. It is a declaration of principles. The implementation of each stage of it requires a separate agreement. We adhere to the Declaration of Principles and intend to implement it. I believe that the other side wants this as well. It is only natural for each side to try getting the most for itself, based on its concepts. This is what negotiations are all about. We simply need patience. We should not get excited over such or other attempts, but proceed onward. [Segal] Rabin answered our questions at the end of a farewell ceremony for U.S. Ambassador William Brown, who ends a third, non-consecutive term in Israel. Brown spoke about Yitzhaq Rabin's courageous leadership, and in his congratulatory address he used some Hebrew terms he had learned during his long years in Israel. [Brown, in English] The next time we meet I will be an betafqid pensyoner [acting pensioner], but I can only ask, as a favor, that you extend that warmth, hospitality, frankness, candor, and generosity to my illustrious successor Ed Djerejian as you did to me. Thank you very, very much. [Segal, translates and continues] Rabin praised Brown warmly for his role as Uncle Sam's ambassador in Israel. [end recording]
