The forum, initiated by the Chinese Government, will be held from June 1-2 in Melbourne and from 7-8 in Sydney and will be joined by more than 100 representatives of Chinese industries, the largest business delegation ever to visit Australia. The forum was agreed by the two sides last October when Wu Yi, China's minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, paid a visit to Canberra. The event also follow the Australia-China forum held in Beijing organized by Austrade last year. Austrade's East Asia regional office manager Martin Walsh said in a release today that the forums will provide a unique opportunity for the Chinese Government and business officials to outline investment and environment policies for Australian business. He said that China continues to be of increasing importance to Australian exporters and the forums will offer outstanding opportunities for local firms to follow up with key contacts from China. "The forums will also give Chinese company executives and other decision makers a chance to witness first hand Australian technology, industry expertise and capability," he said. The two forums will mainly focus on sectors of building and construction, transport and telecommunications, food technology and manufacturing. China, the largest buyer of Australia's wool, is the ninth largest export market for the South-Pacific country, with a two way trade standing at three billion U.S. dollars last year.
