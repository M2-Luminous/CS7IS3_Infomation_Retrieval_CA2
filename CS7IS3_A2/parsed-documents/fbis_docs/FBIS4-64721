Did it promote solutions to our national problems? [passage omitted] It must be made clear that the prime minister has placed all, or almost all, of his hopes for help with the national issues on the United States. His references to the European partners were ironic and bitter. He did not neglect to blame the European Union's 12 equal parts exclusively for the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia. The PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government's decision to "play everything" according to the "U.S. card" has its risks. Only time will tell whether it will be "successful." The Ice Has Broken The visit had many sides, at least two of which were positive, one negative, and some neutral. We cannot predict the final outcome. 1. The visit "broke the ice" that was created during PASOK's first eight-year term when Papandreou was not invited to the United States either by Ronald Reagan or George Bush. According to one of his associates, it has long been clear that the prime minister "wanted like crazy to visit the White House at last." This visit helped enough to change Papandreou's "Third World" image in the transatlantic "friend and ally." The prime minister may have disagreed, in Clinton's presence, with NATO's decision to bomb the Bosnian Serbs if they did not retreat but all of his other positions and statements were far from those made during the eighties when the PASOK government said "no" or simply expressed "reservations." Much of the mass media may still continue their anti-Greek attacks (a lot could be written about the false and directed reports of some newspapers and journalists and the lack of Greek reaction) but a change can be seen in the handling of Greek positions. It cannot go unnoticed that Clinton spoke at least twice of an understanding of Greek sensitivities and concerns. It is also important that reports in major newspapers and magazines moved within the same spirit. Without being pro-Greek, the reports expressed accurately and objectively the situation in the Balkans and the Greek views. If there was no "thorn" in our relations with Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], certainly Greece could have played a very significant role in the area and influenced (although this is extreme) the U.S. policy. Something like this would not leave the major European countries indifferent. [passage omitted] 2. The most tangible outcome of the visit is economic relations. It was probably the first time in Greek history that a Greek prime minister gathered for a speech several hundred businessmen, including the leaders of giant concerns. There is U.S. interest in investment in Greece, especially in tourism (marinas, casinos), in the medical industry (medicine), in the food industry, and in high technology sectors (electronic calculators etc.). There is equally intense interest in establishing Greek-American businesses in the Balkan region, which is known to Greek businessmen. The Americans, who do not want to take risks in an unknown area (U.S. investments in countries north of our border are almost nonexistent) "place their bets" on the Greek experience. President Clinton made special reference to this issue. [passage omitted] Stagnation on Skopje 3. Those who expected that upon his return from the United States, the prime minister would announce a solution to the issue of Skopje were probably disappointed. After 10 days of meetings there is stagnation--the term deadlock does not express the reality. Although Greece was discreetly pressured to lift the embargo against the neighboring state, it was the first time that its concerns, which are based on historical facts, as Clinton said, were recognized so openly and so officially. Perhaps it is the first time that the United States has urged the neighboring country to change "the angle from which it looks at the problem," according to the U.S. President's expression. We must not overlook that all the negotiations are being held while the Greek embargo applies, despite the Skopjean Government's original position that it cannot negotiate under pressure. It is also clear that the United States has accepted the Greek embargo as part of the negotiations and despite discreet objections that are being expressed publicly by some U.S. officials, it sees the embargo as a measure that can speed up the solution to the problem. Of course this does not mean that the Greek side has achieved a triumph. There is no such prospect and everyone has accepted it. An "honest compromise" is being sought, which is not visible right now as both countries "estimate" the cost of making the first move. Many people believe that if [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov did not have elections next October he would have agreed to the proposals of UN mediator Cyrus Vance and U.S. Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz: To agree to change his country's symbols (He has already agreed to an explanatory statement that the Constitution does not include any irredeemable pursuits against neighboring countries). The question that is being raised now is: How long will these negotiations involving New York, Athens, and Skopje last? And what will happen in the second phase (if and when relations are smooth) when the name issue is discussed? We cannot discuss this now. "Solve the Problems" But How? 4. Greek-Turkish relations probably represent the only point in the talks that the Greek side would have wanted to avoid. Clinton's urging, not to say demand, toward the Greek prime minister was more than clear and can be summarized in five words: "Solve the problems with Turkey." The reason is the neighboring country's escalating domestic problems (dramatic economic situation, the Kurdish issue). Greece still holds Turkey's "European passport" but it is unknown how long it can. The difficulty is becoming more obvious if someone considers the importance of the Islamic danger, which threatens the neighboring country, for Europe and the United States. 5. There is no development in the Cyprus issue other than Clinton's "personal interest." U.S. officials did not rule out the possibility of upcoming developments in light of the above evaluations. The results of a visit must not be magnified and the visit itself must not be downgraded, because some results are not immediately visible. The statement made by the prime minister as he left the United States is true: "Developments will depend greatly upon our strategy, tactics, and handling."
