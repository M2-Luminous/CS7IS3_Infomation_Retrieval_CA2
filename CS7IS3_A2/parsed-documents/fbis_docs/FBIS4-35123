This selection is due, to a good extent, to the potentials of the internal markets of countries participating in free trade areas, such as Brazil and Argentina. It is also due to the fact that these countries have a sufficiently developed infrastructure to permit the existence of powerful economies, but are not developed enough to take full advantage of all their market potential, that is, the potential of their population and territory. The recognition of Brazil's potential derives also, as was recognized by Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown during a recent interview (he visited Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and is today in Brasilia), from the fact that South America is in condition to become, within a short time, a more attractive market for the United States than Europe, particularly as it is open in terms of competition. The U.S. Government's selection of Brazil and Argentina is not the kind of decision that is written on a piece of paper and delivered to whomever might be interested. If there had been a time for that kind of U.S. Latin American policy, it has now become obsolete. U.S. internal problems, particularly the creation of jobs -- as was stressed by Brown during his interview in Rio de Janeiro yesterday -- have become part of the U.S. foreign policy agenda (no matter how commercial they may be). In order to solve this problem, the Clinton administration has not hesitated to play all the trumps at hand, even at the risk of implementing an overly aggressive foreign policy. The Brown mission, carrying both private and public interests in the same bag, is visiting a country that has so far been characterized by the strong predominance of the public sector's bureaucratic mentality over business interests. For this reason, he risks getting involved in a conversation between deaf people, or of being coldly received, despite the zeal with which he champions his viewpoints. We should not forget, however, that these viewpoints are those of a great power. The U.S. secretary of commerce is pursuing two important objectives in Brazil and Argentina. One objective is commercial and the other is political. The latter contains a great challenge for Brazilian authorities, both for the members of this administration, witnessing a sad end, and for those who will become the Brazilian authorities in the upcoming administration. The challenge implies an acceptance of the classification of "large emerging market," and acting in accord with the norms the United States want to apply to countries with less power than itself. It will mean sealing an economic alliance with deep internal social and economic consequences and speeding up the great transformation of our industries and services, a process that has been going on since our foreign trade began opening up. It also means agreeing on the need for deep constitutional reform, including not only the possibility of privatizing the communications and energy systems, but also withdrawing the privileges granted to Brazilian companies formed with national capital (an extended definition to cover all state companies) in contracts involving the public administration. But that is not all. It also means giving foreign companies without subsidiaries in Brazil the possibility of participating in public biddings and competing with Brazilian public companies. The first objective, the commercial objective, also has political aspects. One example is the U.S. effort to win the bidding for the Sivan [Amazon Region Surveillance System] system to monitor the Amazon region, with advanced technology and possibly not using exclusively national software. The previous positions taken by Brown, in defending the participation by foreign companies without branches in Brazil in the biddings involving Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc.], give us a pale indication of the emphasis of his mission, which concludes today after official meetings in Brasilia. In the Federal District, Brown will without a doubt discuss the most delicate issue affecting Brazilian and U.S. diplomatic relations: the patents law, the terms of which do not satisfy the U.S. Government. It cannot be established with certainty when the Senate will finish analyzing the bill, which will have to return to the Chamber of Deputies for further examination after the Senate votes on it. This slow pace, which is, nevertheless, a procedure established in the Constitution, will be slowed down even more by the deadline (which will undoubtedly be delayed as well) for ratification of the GATT agreement, which in some aspects conditions parts of the patents law. The delay in the Brazilian Congress is sometimes annoying, but it is a routine the that U.S. Government must understand, even with Super 301 in hand to punish what it calls unfair trade practices. In the end, the resistance the Clinton administration is beginning to find in ratifying the GATT agreement show that legislative powers still have weight in democratic regimes.
