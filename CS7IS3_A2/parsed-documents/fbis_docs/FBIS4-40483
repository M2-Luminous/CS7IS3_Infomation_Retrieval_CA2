[signed] A. Pecherskaya, Krasnoyarsk. As we were told at the Russian Federation Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety [Gosatomnadzor], there are 49 nuclear research installations on the capital's territory. These include the research reactors belonging to the Kurchatov Center, which is located in a densely populated part of the city. The amount of radioactive waste stored both at the center's own site and at other establishments is in excess of 200 tonnes. The Gosatomnadzor inspectorate for the capital believes that all this waste represents a threat to the safety of the city's inhabitants. However, the government has not allocated the resources for removing the radioactive waste and dismantling the reactors. It will cost around 15 billion rubles.
