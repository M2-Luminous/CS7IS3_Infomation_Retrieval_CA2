The enterprises involved a total of 42.9 million U.S. dollars of foreign investment, up by 117 percent over the previous year. Altogether the province has 816 foreign-funded enterprises so far. Government officials attribute the investment boom to the improvement of its investment environment. The province fully upgraded its telecommunications and power facilities last year. The officials say that more foreign investment is flowing into the province's remote mountain regions and areas inhabited by minority nationalities to tap rich natural resources. The investors, coming from 23 countries and regions, are expanding their businesses to industry, real estate development and everyday services for residents. Last year, foreign trade of the foreign-funded enterprises hit more than 38 million U.S. dollars, taking up half of the province's total.
