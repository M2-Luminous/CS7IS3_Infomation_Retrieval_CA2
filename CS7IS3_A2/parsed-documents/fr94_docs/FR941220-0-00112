FR941220-0-00112 FR941220-0-00014 (a) Subject to the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section, an employer may place H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at worksite(s) (place(s) of employment) within areas of employment not listed on the employer's labor condition application(s)_whether or not the employer owns or controls such worksite(s)_without filing new labor condition application(s) for the area(s) of intended employment which would encompass such worksite(s). (b) The following restrictions shall be fully satisfied by an employer which places H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at worksite(s) (place(s) of employment) within areas of employment not listed on the employer's labor condition application(s): (1) The employer has fully satisfied the requirements of §§ XXX .730 through XXX .734 of this part with regard to worksite(s) located within the area(s) of intended employment listed on the employer's labor condition application(s). (2) The employer shall not place, assign, lease, or otherwise contract out any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) to any worksite where there is a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the same occupational classification(s) as the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s). (3) For every day of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's(s') placement outside the LCA-listed area of employment, the employer shall pay such worker(s) the required wage (based on the prevailing wage at such worker's(s) permanent work site, or the employer's actual wage, whichever is higher) plus per diem and transportation expenses (for both workdays and non-workdays) at rate(s) no lower than the rate(s) prescribed for Federal Government employees on travel or temporary assignment, as set out in 41 CFR Part 301&hyph;7 and Ch. 301, App. A. (4) The employer's placement(s) of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at any worksite(s) in an area of employment not listed on the employer's labor condition application(s) shall be limited to a cumulative total of ninety workdays within a three-year period, beginning on the first day on which the employer placed an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant at any worksite within such area of employment. For purposes of this section, ``workday'' shall mean any day on which one or more H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants perform any work at any worksite(s) within the area of employment. For example, one ``workday'' would be counted for a day on which seven H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants worked at three worksites within one city, and one ``workday'' would be counted for a day on which one H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant worked at one worksite within a city. The employer may rotate such workers into worksites within such area of employment or may maintain a constant work force. However, on the first day after the accumulation of 90 workdays, the employer shall not have any such H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at any worksite(s) within such area of employment not included on a certified LCA. (c) At the accumulation of the 90 workdays described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the employer shall have ended its placement of all H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at any worksite(s) within the area of employment not listed on the labor condition application, or shall have filed and received a certified labor condition application for the area(s) of intended employment encompassing such worksite(s) and performed all actions required in connection with such filing(s) ( e.g., determination of the prevailing wage; notice to collective bargaining representative or on-site notice to workers). (d) At any time during the 90-day period described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the employer may file a labor condition application for the area of intended employment encompassing such worksite(s), performing all actions required in connection with such labor condition application. Upon certification of such LCA, the employer's obligation to pay Federal per diem rates to the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) shall terminate. (However, see XXX .731(c)(7)(iii)(C) regarding payment of business expenses for employee's travel on employer's business.)
