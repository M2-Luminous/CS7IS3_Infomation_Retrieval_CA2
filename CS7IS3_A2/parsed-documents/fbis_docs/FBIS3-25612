Reporter Yvette Biregou asked him how he responded to yesterday events: [Begin recording] [Abessole, in French with superimposed translation into English] I say that it is Bongo and his armed bandits who are continuing to follow with their logic. They want to exterminate all differences and to remain the sole master on the boat. I think the Gabonese will not accept this. I am demanding all Gabonese to stand and to get rid of this tyranny. I would also like to hail all the democrats at the international level, to bring us their support and so that there will be a responsible and humanitarian democracy. [Biregou] The government has ordered its troops onto the streets. How do you respond to that? [Abessole] Well, you know, it is the people who are reacting and this is what I had said when Bongo's election was acknowledged by his constitutional court. I said that the people themselves would react. I am only an element of the people who were elected. The people are organizing themselves. I do not know what it is capable of doing in a few days. What I know is that they will react. [end recording]
