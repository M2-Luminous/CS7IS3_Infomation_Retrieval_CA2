FR940223-2-00212 FR940223-2-00101 The Department reads Title VI consistent with other statutes and Executive orders addressing the special needs and history of HBCUs. In particular, the Department notes congressional findings of discrimination against black students that are the basis for enhancement efforts at HBCUs. Additionally, the Department interprets Title VI to permit limited use of race to avoid an anomalous and absurd result, i.e., penalizing HBCUs and students who seek admission to HBCUs, and putting HBCUs at a disadvantage with respect to other schools precisely because of the special history and composition of the HBCUs. The use of race-targeted aid by HBCUs that the Department is interpreting Title VI to permit under this provision is narrowly tailored to further the congressionally recognized purpose of enhancement of HBCUs. HBCUs may not discriminate on the basis of race or national origin in admitting students. They may not create their own race-targeted financial aid programs using their own institutional funds unless they satisfy the requirements of any of the other principles in this guidance. Nor may they accept private donations of race-targeted aid for black students that are limited to students at the institution unless otherwise permitted by the guidance. Because HBCUs have traditionally enrolled black students, it should not subvert the goal of enhancing the institutions to require that they not restrict aid to black students if using their own funds or funds from private donors that wish to set up financial aid programs at these institutions. However, because the applicant pool that is attracted to HBCUs presently consists primarily of black students, HBCUs would be placed at a distinct disadvantage with regard to other colleges in attracting talented students if they could not participate in financial aid programs set up by third parties for black students. Thus, the Department interprets Title VI to permit an HBCU to participate in race-targeted financial aid programs for black students that are created by third parties, if the programs are not restricted to students at HBCUs. The participation by HBCUs in those race-targeted aid programs will be subject to periodic reassessment by the Department. The Department will regularly review the results of enhancement efforts at HBCUs, including the annual report to the President on the progress achieved in enhancing the role and capabilities of HBCUs required by Section 7 of Executive Order 12876. If an HBCU has been enhanced to the point that the institution is attractive to individuals regardless of their race or national origin to the same extent as a non-HBCU, then that institution may participate in only those race-targeted aid programs that are consistent with the other principles in this policy guidance. Transition Period The proposed policy guidance would have provided a four-year transition period for individual students to ensure that they did not lose their financial aid as a result of the guidance. Commenters pointed out that, in some cases, four years may not be a sufficient time for a student to complete his or her academic program at a college. In addition, commenters expressed concern that revising the policies and procedures used in recruiting minority students and in providing student financial assistance would require time to develop and implement. The revisions that have been made to the final policy guidance should result in far fewer instances in which colleges will be required to change their financial aid programs. However, the Department recognizes that colleges may need to conduct extensive reviews of their current programs and that in some cases adjustments to those programs may be necessary. As a result, the Department is expanding the proposed transition period. The Department is providing colleges a reasonable period of time to review and, if necessary, adjust their financial aid programs in an orderly manner that causes the least possible disruption to their students. Colleges must adjust their financial aid programs to be consistent with the principles previously set out no later than two years after the effective date of the Department's policy guidance. However, colleges may continue to provide financial aid awarded on the basis of race or national origin to students who had either applied for or received that assistance prior to the effective date of this guidance during the full course of those students' academic program at the college, even though, in many cases, this will extend beyond the two-year period and, in some cases, the four-year period identified in the proposed policy. Although some commenters questioned the Department's authority to create a transition period, such a period for adjustments is consistent with the Department's approach in the past under other civil rights statutes it enforces. See 34 CFR 106.41(d) (transition period to permit recipients to bring their athletic programs into compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972); 34 CFR 104.22(e) (transition period to permit recipients to make facilities accessible to individuals with disabilities, as required by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973). It is based on the Department's recognition of the practical difficulties that some colleges may face in making changes to their recruitment and financial aid award processes. The transition period also is consistent with the Department's policy, in approving plans for the desegregation of State systems of higher education, that students who have been the beneficiaries of past discriminatory conduct not be required to bear the burden of corrective action. For example, while the Department requires State higher education systems to take remedial action to increase the enrollment of previously excluded students, it does not require the expulsion of any student in order to permit admission of those previously excluded. See Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. at 282&hyph;85. Finally, the transition period is consistent with the Department's obligations under Title VI to seek voluntary compliance by recipients that have been found in violation of the statute. 42 U.S.C. 2000d&hyph;1. During the transition period, the Department will provide colleges with technical assistance to help them make any necessary changes to their financial aid programs in order to achieve compliance with Title VI.
