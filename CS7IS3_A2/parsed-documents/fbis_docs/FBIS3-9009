[Drzycimski] Good morning to you, and to you, ladies and gentlemen. [Woyciechowski] We know for sure now that on Tuesday [22 March], Prime Minister Pawlak will send the president a motion concerning the appointment of new Deputy Prime Minister Dariusz Rosati. What will the president do about the motion? Will he sign it, or not? [Drzycimski] You know, I am not sure whether it will happen on Tuesday -- that is the first thing. The other issue is that at the point when the president receives the motion, he will then definitely talk to the prime minister, and he will deliberate on the issue. But so far, there has been no official document submitted to the president, nor have there been any talks that would concern this whole issue in a substantive way. [Woyciechowski] But it so happens that the entire press is speculating on the issue. So let me put it this way: Does the president have any reasons not to sign the nomination? [Drzycimski] He does not have any reasons but he just has to take a good look at the man since so far there has been a candidacy which by the way was talked about by the media, but as regards the person who is the most concerned here -- that is the prime minister -- there have been no statements apart from a general statement that the president is familiar with such a candidacy. So I think that once the candidacy is officially presented, then the president will think about .... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Has it happened before that the president did not sign such a motion for appointment of a deputy prime minister or a minister? [Drzycimski] Well, yes, I mean not when it comes to a deputy prime minister but there was the famous case of the minister of culture. That happened in the past. The president did not sign the motion, and that caused a specific political situation. So when it comes to that, the president will also try to assess [words indistinct] [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But do you think he will tend to sign it, or not? Is he willing to sign it? What is the situation? [Drzycimski] You know, I never speak in terms of whether somebody could probably tend to do this or that since the decision in this case must be carefully deliberated by the president and therefore he has to have more information. We really do not know a lot about Mr. Rosati, I mean Professor Rosati. He is someone who is getting a lot of publicity currently from the mass media, he himself is outspoken, he presents his views. The issue requires a careful approach. The president never undertakes such things .... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean he never signs anything immediately but takes some time to think about it? [Drzycimski] I mean he never does things that have not been thought through. Sometimes he signs something right away but then it has been thought through. But when it comes to Mr. Rosati, we actually do not know much. [Woyciechowski] And what will he do [words indistinct] [Drzycimski] This is even more so since Professor Rosati was abroad for the entire period when the main transformations were taking place in Poland. And so it is difficult to say right away whether someone knows his activities. We do not know a lot about this. [Woyciechowski] And what about the budget? That is another document which needs to be signed by the president. And there are huge speculations going on as to whether he will sign it or not. [Drzycimski] That is [hesitating] one of the big problems created by subsequent governing teams. Parliaments and governments take quite an easy-going approach to this, and then they leave it to the president to make the final decision, and they are positive that he will make a judicious decision, and so forth. I must say that the budget is ....[Drzycimski pauses] Generally speaking, a situation of social tension has been created about the state budget, since the whole election campaign in September was under slogans like: It Doesn't Have To Be That Way, It Shouldn't Be That Way, The Budget Must Be Changed, in other words that the budget be pro- social. All these are election slogans. And in practical terms, the budget -- presented to the parliament and going through subsequent stages there -- has not changed much apart from a few minor revisions, in comparison with what the previous governments had established and worked out regarding the entire concept. So one can say that all these enormous social hopes that had been aroused, were not reflected in the budget. [Woyciechowski] You mean the budget is not a fulfillment of election promises? [Drzycimski] Yes. And so the president is asking the question: What is the situation? Are society's hopes to be frustrated once again? Is the issue to be approached light-heartedly again, something along the lines of election promises and their implementation by a specific political coalition? That is why this is a difficult problem for the president since he has to view it from two perspectives: In political terms, I mean in terms that society had a right to expect because society had been presented with a change of a certain economic concept, and that change was not implemented in practice. The president's other problem -- I mean sort of in reverse -- is that the president is familiar with the state of the country and its budget, and he knows that when it comes to this budget, one cannot make many radical moves, as it were. That is a dilemma for a politician who must make difficult decisions, and they are difficult also for him. [Woyciechowski] But that is a moral dilemma. What would happen politically speaking if the president refused to sign the budget? What are the consequences of [words indistinct] [Drzycimski] The consequences are that the budget goes back to the parliament, and then it can be voted through again, and then once there are two-thirds of the votes, then the president must sign it. There were such cases in the past where the president vetoed a law and it went back to the parliament, and that proves that the president pays attention ....[pauses] Let me remind you that the problem of Electoral Law for instance was vetoed by the president and there was a big debate whether he can do it or not. The law was voted through anyway, and one must pay attention to how this influences the current situation, with this kind of political configuration. [Woyciechowski] About Prime Minister Pawlak's Moscow visit. Is the president still surprised, and is he happy with the outcome of the visit? Has the prime minister presented a report yet? [Drzycimski] I mean, as far as I know, the prime minister has not paid a visit to the president as yet. I mean, I know for sure that he has not seen him, but whether he has called him on the telephone -- as far as I know, he has not done so yet, unless he did it very recently, but as far as late last night is concerned, that did not happen. The president was surprised by something else -- I mean generally he was aware of the visit -- but he was surprised that the prime minister failed to report to him personally on what the situation is, I mean in terms of the goal of the visit. When the prime minister goes on a foreign trip, political issues always come to the surface, and that is why the president stressed that when it comes to the supreme state agencies, there should be large-scale coordination. In every case concerning foreign policy, he has always consulted with Minister Skubiszewski -- it has never happened otherwise. And right now, he does the same with Minister Olechowski since the president thinks that of course he bears the constitutional responsibility for the general strategy as president, but when it comes to practical implementation, there is a specialized governmental agency to do that -- that is the Foreign Ministry which carries out the implementation. So the ministry knows about what is the best solution in terms of political configurations, timing, and selection of countries. That is very much observed by the president. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister -- I am sorry: Mr. Minister -- why did the prime minister not conduct any consultations? Did he just forget? Or did he rebel? [Drzycimski] No, no, that was simply regarded a bit like ....[pauses] Anyway, that was cleared up quickly. [Woyciechowski] So he forgot? [Drzycimski] It was regarded as something to be taken for granted. There is the ministry, and it transferred [sentence as heard]. But the president expects that in such situations, some mutual consultations be conducted, and this is even more so since the president always invites government representatives to participate in his every trip. I emphasize that he does not have to do that. [Woyciechowski] The prime minister did not invite representatives of the president's office... [Drzycimski, interrupting] No, that is not the problem. All I am saying is that the president wants everything that he takes care of in the state to be handled by specific ministries, specific ministers. They take, as it were, specific issues into their own hands and decide whether these or those solutions can be achieved. As a rule, the economic ministers are invited, but not only. In Ukraine, for example, the culture minister participated in the visit. It all depends on the character of the visit. However, the president always assumes that it is very good when there is close rapport between the president and the government, when there is no misunderstanding. The president believes that the government should see what the president discussed, which issues were tackled. Let us take the recent visit to India, for instance. The visit was rather scantily discussed by the Polish mass media; however, I must say that on that Indian subcontinent it really hit the headlines, both on television and in the press. During that visit the president was accompanied by three ministers: foreign affairs minister, industry minister, and foreign economic cooperation minister. Participating in the visit was also a group of ten entrepreneurs who represented the greatest commercial, economic centers which want to enter the Indian market, or which are already operating there. You know, there is an awareness that this is all conducted as a joint activity. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, how does the Belvedere evaluate the Moscow trip? Was it just a minor incident or have relations with Prime Minister Pawlak, which have so far been excellent, begun to deteriorate? [Drzycimski] Do we think so? [Woyciechowski] Yes. [Drzycimski] No, certainly not. [Woyciechowski] It was just a minor thing, was it not? [Drzycimski] It was a technical issue, all the more so because, as I said, during the visit that the prime minister paid to the president a day before his departure, these issues were... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] They were explained? [Drzycimski] Yes, they were explained. In addition, the prime minister presented very detailed main points of the visit; this was very important, because the prime minister decided that the visit and the talks should supplement the presidential agreements with specifics. This is what we really need: openness is everywhere, but we should get deeper into things, especially into the economic issues. I hear that a lot has been achieved in this area. I believe this will be a very important visit as it may open the Russian market. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, have you already read the 68-page report by the National Council of Radio and Television? [Drzycimski] No, I have not. This report is currently on the president's desk. I saw him going through it rather thoroughly. [Woyciechowski] What will become of the council? What do you think? [Drzycimski] The president delicately presented his stand. He presented his own remarks and concerns. As president, who feels responsible for what is happening in the country -- also responsible for the democratic transformations in the mass media -- he stated his views. He believed that certain decisions had been made too hastily; he did make that clear. It also seems that these issues will sooner or later be brought up again and again: Free mass media, free press, free radio, and free television. I believe that these issues will be brought up, that all the issues of social concern will be presented. The president had information which needed to be thought over. I do not... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] He recalled Markiewicz. Is he still certain that he had the right to do that? [Drzycimski] Did he have the right? [Woyciechowski] Yes. [Drzycimski] This is one of the loopholes of the law, and the president brought the issue up -- he realized that the issue would come up sooner or later. He thought that this problem had to be resolved, so that future actions could be taken within a specified legal framework. It was a loophole; the president showed that; and now we are quietly waiting for the Constitutional Tribunal to make a decision. At any rate, generally the president believes that, whenever he has any doubts, he feels he must speak out. He has done so in many other cases, in many far more difficult cases. He has some doubts, his conscience compels him to present it all. Now, whether this will prove itself remains an open issue. He did signal the problem, he did bring it up at a moment when decisions were being made too hastily; he decided to recall the chairman because he believed that the issues needed to be examined quietly -- all the more so because, according to the president, the decisions were in great conflict with the Law on Radio and Television, which clearly states that one broadcaster cannot achieve a dominating position; however, it seemed that there was such a dominating position, because if one broadcaster receives both the satellite... [pauses] The nationwide television and regional stations, then, well, there is not much left for others. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, today and yesterday the issue of those three presidential deputy ministers started to be discussed again. Today's papers carry reports that most probably Mr. Siemiatkowski will very soon be appointed deputy minister of national defense. Can you confirm that? Is this... [Drzycimski, interrupting] This is definitely an issue... [pauses] Generally, I want to recall, and I have already said that the president believes that if a minister is entrusted with the function of steering a ministry, then... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Then the minister selects his cooperators himself. [Drzycimski] Then the minister selects his cooperators himself. Such positions cannot be filled in line with the so-called political-party system. That is one point. Second, if the ministries need to be strengthened, it is decided by the minister, who makes his decisions after examining not their past membership, but their professional skills and expertise. The president will always defend decisions made independently by ministers, not made under political pressure. [Woyciechowski] In other words, we should not expect any important decisions today or tomorrow on the issue? [Drzycimski, interrupting] I do not have any information on that. [Woyciechowski] Another piece of information from today's press: The candidate of the Democratic Left Alliance for the post of deputy minister of internal affairs is Mr. Zbigniew Sobotko, or Sobotka, and Minister Milczanowski has not yet discussed that with the Belvedere. Do you know anything about that... [Drzycimski, interrupting] This falls under the same rule; I am speaking now about the rule, not about persons. If the ministers decide that these are persons who are professionally able to... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Then the president will not object to that. [Drzycimski] No, he will not. The president believes that it is an issue of decisions; however, he will keep stressing that the decisions are up to the ministers, who do not have to yield to political pressure. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, let us now briefly discuss the strikes. The Solidarity strikes. Today at 0830 [0730 GMT] Solidarity will begin picketing in front of the Sejm. Tomorrow Solidarity will hold talks with Prime Minister Pawlak. How do you evaluate the strike situation? [Drzycimski] Well, we partly discussed that while talking about the budget. People had a right to expect certain things. That is their way of expressing concern, which will grow deeper. Therefore, both the government and Solidarity must attempt to find some solution. People's expectations were increased and so they must ask the question. Now, here is another, very important remark. The trade union role is to exert pressure; however, they must also remember that there is a certain limit that cannot be exceeded. Many years ago the president said that trade unions, in this case Solidarity, are just like good bacteria on a living organism: They are parasites, quote unquote; however, they must remember that they cannot destroy the organism they live in. That is, trade unions must put pressure, fight, keep reminding, submit demands, and so on. Those are their inalienable rights; it is the most fundamental right, which must be implemented. However, trade unions must also remember that there is a certain limit, which is called the condition of the state. That limit is hard to exceed. Therefore, it is important that union people and government representatives sit at the negotiation table jointly, so that a discussion can be conducted over what can be done and to what extent. It seems that the resolution of the problem is going in that direction. Nevertheless, I would like to stress very strongly that it has been caused by the election campaign, where something entirely different was promised and the people are entitled to make demands. [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. [Drzycimski] Thank you.
