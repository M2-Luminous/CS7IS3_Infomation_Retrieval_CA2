Government sources said that another $25 million, equivalent to $5 million monthly for overdue interest from January to May, will be disbursed in three days. The amount is due before Friday. Two weeks ago, the Ecuadoran Government agreed to refinance the country's commercial debt of $7.5 billion over a 30-year period with a 15-percent write off with banks. This operation will make it possible for the country to refinance its debt with the Paris Club and other lending organizations. Ecuador's total debt borders on $13 billion, Latin America's largest per capita. The $13-billion debt is equivalent to $1,000 for each of the country's 13 million inhabitants. Shortly before reaching this agreement with the creditor banks, President Sixto Duran-Ballen paid $5 million in April as a gesture of good faith and seriousness, Finance Minister Cesar Robalino reported at the time. With this payment, Ecuador ended a 20-month delay in the payment of overdue interest, which had accumulated up to a total of $2.5 billion since 1987. As for the remaining principal, approximately $5 billion, the country will choose among several alternatives proposed.
