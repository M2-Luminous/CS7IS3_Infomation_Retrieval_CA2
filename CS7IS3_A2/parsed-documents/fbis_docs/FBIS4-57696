It went into effect against Haiti on the night of 21 May at 2359, that is, 0359 GMT on 22 May, following this country's military refusal to resign. Total calm reigns in the Haitian capital. I am a hostage of the situation and I am organizing myself to survive, a small shopkeeper said in summing up the reactions observed a short time before the embargo went into effect. The Port-au-Prince harbor worked until the last minute, unloading the hundreds of containers bringing, from everywhere, goods ordered from abroad intended to last for several months. The fuel-smuggling at the Haitian-Dominican border continued like in preceding days, done to survive by a destitute peasantry scurrying like ants, using empty plastic one-gallon containers once used to hold cooking oil. On 21 May, the government of provisional President Emile Jonassaint, which is not recognized by the international community, announced a special committee had been created to manage the sanctions. In point of fact, we are unfortunately accustomed to this tragic status quo. Therefore, [words indistinct] the owner of a small working-class restaurant comments with resignation, who like the man-in-the-street is convinced it is the poorest who will suffer the most, as usual. On the economic plane, it is the latest jobs in the subcontracting companies -- 8,000 to 10,000 according to the U.S. Embassy; 6,000 to 8,000 according to employers' sources -- that will disappear following this embargo. But the peasantry is going to be hit very hard by the halt in coffee and cocoa exports, the nation's second most important export activity after the subcontractors which brings in about $15 million at a time when international prices have risen. The OAS trade embargo instituted in October 1991 and intensified by a UN oil embargo in 1993 has already cost the nation 200,000 jobs. The unemployment rate in Haiti exceeds 60 percent. Decided by a 6 May vote of the UN Security Council, the total embargo aims to drive the military out of power and bring back President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown on 30 September 1991. Aristide is now living in exile in Washington.
