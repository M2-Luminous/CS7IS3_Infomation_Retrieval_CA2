One-fourth of the workers are without a job, practically. And these figures characterize not only the military-industrial complex, what is more, but also the production of consumer goods and food, of which there can be no question of a surplus. Enterprise mutual arrears are at the two-month output sales level. They have grown one-third and constitute almost R200 billion. This means that simple methods of influencing inflation (by way of a cutback in the issue of credit, for example) will not work. The enterprises are reacting to this with mutual commodity credit. There are no payments to the treasury here, no money for wages, and so forth. The unpaid wages are today approaching a month's arrears. Thus the pressure in the pot is growing. "Unfortunately, at the enlarged session of the government," Vasiliy Kiselev said, "I did not see specific mechanisms of a resolution of this problem. And unless a solution is found within two or three months, the entire Russian financial and economic system will explode. "But we have an opportunity for another version of events also," the vice governor continued. "I cannot fail to mention with satisfaction the actions of the Ministry of Finance. This most unitary department is engaging in clearly expressed federalist actions. I am sure that as of 1 April the Ministry of Finance will introduce to the system of transfer relations of the budgets of the territory and the federal budget [sentence as published]. This means that there will be the nonspecific, unstipulated transfer of funds from one budget to another for the purpose of equalization of budget and financial support for the territory. After all, it is obvious that the inequality of Russia's regions from the federal budget viewpoint could rupture the unity of Russia faster than any talk about separatism or unitarism. But why, tell me, did per capita expenditure in Novosibirsk Oblast in 1993 constitute R96,500, in Omsk Oblast R184,000, and in Kemerovo Oblast R294,000? The answer is clearly not economic!... So as of the second quarter of the present year this approach will, with the emergence of the appropriate prescriptive base, be eliminated. And it will not be necessary to crawl around offices of the capital and ask for budget handouts.
