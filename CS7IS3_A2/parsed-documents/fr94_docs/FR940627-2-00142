FR940627-2-00142 FR940627-2-00061 Federal Highway Administration [FHWA Docket No. 93&hyph;26] Options for Coordinating the Metric Conversion of Traffic Control Signs AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) DOT. ACTION: Notice of agency decision. SUMMARY: In this notice, the FHWA summarizes the responses to an FHWA notice titled ``Options for Coordinating the Metric Conversion of Traffic Control Signs,'' and announces the agency's decision to delay implementation of any national metric sign conversion until after 1996, or until further indication of the intention of Congress on this subject is received. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Charles W. Craig, Office of Highway Safety, (202) 366-2187, or Mr. Wilbert Baccus, Office of the Chief Counsel, (202) 366-0780, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 31, 1993, the FHWA published a notice in the Federal Register in which the agency requested comments on the three options it is considering for coordinating an orderly transition of distance, weight, and speed traffic control sign legends from English to metric units consistent with the Federal Highway Administration's five-year plan to convert its activities and business operations to the metric system, as required under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. 58 FR 46036. Option 1 involved making the conversion over an extended period of time (a maximum of 4 to 7 years) through routine maintenance replacement. Option 2 recommended a quick conversion of all signs over a short period (6 months to 1 year) through a concentrated effort. Option 3 encouraged a two-phase conversion process using dual posting of both metric and English messages for speed, weight, and distance signs in the first phase (complete by September 30, 1996). The second phase would involve the removal of all of the English units with metric units remaining. All comments were to be received by November 1, 1993. Comments continue to be received sporadically. As of January 12, 1994, the FHWA received 2,736 comments to this docket divided as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Received from the general public 2,592 Opposed 2,228 In favor 364 Option 1 (routine maintenance) 23 Option 2 (quick change) 224 Option 3 (dual units) 117 Received from various professional organizations 12 Opposed 1 In favor (mostly Option 2) 11 Received from Cities/Counties 82 Opposed 51 In favor 31 Option 1 3 Option 2 25 Option 3 & combination of options 3 Received from States (3 States sent 2 responses = 48 total) 45 Opposed 8 In favor in some form 37 Option 1 3 Option 2 (including various versions & combination of options) 37 Option 3 1 Two Congressional responses were received with both opposing any change.
