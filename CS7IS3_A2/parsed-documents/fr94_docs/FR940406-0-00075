FR940406-0-00075 FR940406-0-00005 (4) A few high value installations for which a ready market apparently exists may, nevertheless, not have generated any expressions of interest during the allotted 6 month period. Regardless, such installations provide an opportunity for private sector rapid job creation which should be pursued. In these cases, the Military Departments, based on completed appraisals or other estimates of the fair market value, shall inform redevelopment authorities that the property is expected to be offered for sale and an economic development conveyance should not be anticipated. Redevelopment authorities shall be so informed as soon as possible, but not later than 6 months after completion of the McKinney Act screening process. In making these determinations, airport, port, and school property may be excluded if it appears that they are likely to be converted to public airports, ports or schools under existing public benefit conveyance programs. The determination that an installation will be sold under paragraph (d)(4) of this section has 2 components: (i) The property must have a high value. (ii) There must be a ready market. Ready market means that offers to purchase at or near the estimated range of fair market value from the private sector covering all or most of the installation could be expected within 6 months of advertising the base for public sale. (5) Within 60 days of the announcement by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned of the intention to sell property in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) or (d)(4) of this section, the authorized local redevelopment authority may request, in writing, that this determination be reconsidered. The Secretary shall consider the request, provide a final determination in writing to the local redevelopment authority and announce this determination publicly. (6) Identification of an installation or property for sale under this section does not preclude a community's acquisition of property for the estimated fair market value. (7) The provisions of this section may not be appropriate for some of the 1988 and 1991 base closures and realignments because these bases are so far along in the property disposal process that certain actions have been taken or agreed to that are inconsistent with the new procedures. In cases of 1988 and 1991 closures where this new property disposal process is considered not appropriate, the Secretary concerned shall request a waiver from the ASD(ES) before proceeding with the disposition of the property. (e) Economic development conveyances. (1) Closing military bases often have a great deal of land that may not be readily developable or marketable due to its location. Additionally, closing bases often have buildings that may need to be demolished in order to encourage redevelopment and economic revitalization. Historically, the process of selling bases, or parts thereof, for fair market value has been time consuming and the proceeds from the sales of base closure properties have been less than originally anticipated. In the past, the law permitted the Department of Defense to convey property at a discount of up to 100% (free of charge) for specific public purposes such as health, aviation, recreation, and education_but not for economic development. The new process that follows permits the DoD to convey land and buildings to redevelopment authorities with no consideration, subject to recoupment, after it is determined that the base, or significant portions thereof, cannot be sold in accordance with the rapid job creation concept. Such conveyances may help induce a market for the property, thereby, enhancing economic recovery. Redevelopment authorities shall submit a simple written request containing four basic elements as described in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (e)(5)(iv) of this section. Generally, installations will be conveyed at no initial cost with a recoupment provision that shall permit DoD to share in any future profits should the base be later leased or sold. Bases in rural areas shall be conveyed under this authority with no recoupment if they meet the standards in paragraph (e)(6) of this section. The conveyance for economic development should be used by local redevelopment authorities to gain control of large areas of the base, not just individual buildings. The income received from some of the higher value property should help offset the maintenance and marketing costs of the less desirable parcels. In order for this conveyance to spur redevelopment, large parcels must be used to provide an income stream to assist the long term development of the property.
