During a news conference with radio reporters before the start of today's talks, EZLN Subcommander Marcos explained that Indian groups had to participate in this cogovernment to find adequate solutions to their problems. Marcos also proposed the creation of a dialogue verification commission made up of civilians. Commission members would be appointed by the EZLN and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. This commission would prevent solutions agreed upon at the talks from becoming empty promises and, in turn, avert the risk of another armed conflict. On 1 January, armed groups from the EZLN seized several Chiapas communities by force, attacked a garrison, and prompted the intervention of the Mexican Army. These actions resulted in nearly 100 deaths, numerous injuries, and the displacement of about 20,000 people. "We are aware of the difficulties in meeting our national demands, such as the reform of Article 27 of the Constitution (on land tenure)," Marcos stated, admitting that such issues "go beyond the work agenda agreed upon by both sides." The EZLN military chief, who was interviewed in San Cristobal de las Casas, 1,200 km to the southeast of Mexico City, admitted that it is not possible to force peace in Chiapas "to get the country to do what we want." [sentence as received] According to Marcos, the EZLN is not looking for power. Instead, it only wants peace with justice. He also added: We do not want to form a political party, so that later someone can say that we sold out. "However, we ask for the reform of the Federal Electoral Law in order that the upcoming elections (scheduled for 21 August) are observed and supported," he said. The Zapatist spokesman welcomed the role of Manuel Camacho Solis, the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, who has heard the Indian requests with an open mind conducive to finding solutions. Subcommander Marcos said two things can happen in this dialogue: The negotiations can further peace, or they can break down and engender another war. When asked whether he believed he was personally upstaging others involved in the peace process, Marcos explained, "The movement has utilized me because I am the only one who speaks Spanish. However, the proposals were ordered by the EZLN leaders. I simply have a military assignment."
