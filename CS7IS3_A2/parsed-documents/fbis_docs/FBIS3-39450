The Foreign Ministry had warned the city that the simultaneous invitation of the Dalai Lama and the mayor of Frankfurt's Chinese partner city of Guangzhou could lead to "problems." On Wednesday [16 February] the Dalai Lama's Swiss representative office declined the invitation that Frankfurt Mayor Andreas von Schoeler (Social Democratic Party of Germany) had extended to the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India. The 58-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is calling for the reestablishment of the autonomous status of Tibet, which is under Chinese sovereignty. The statement of the Tibetan office in Zurich says the Dalai Lama had been very sorry to hear that his acceptance of the invitation had led to problems that had been created without his fault "as a result of obviously political motives." He wants to spare the city and its population difficulties. He had been pleased with the invitation, it was stated. [passage omitted]
