This position, announced by NPFL radio, is diametrically opposed to that of the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), which has said that such institutions can only become functional once disarmament begins. According to the inter-factional peace accord signed by the IGNU, the NPFL and ULIMO (United Liberation Movement) on July 25 in Cotonou, Benin, disarmament should be carried out simultaneously with the setting up of transitional institutions. The NPFL also contested the presence in Liberia of the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] peacekeeping force deployed by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which -- assisted by the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) -- is to supervise the disarmament process. "Only the five-member State Council (the tripartite interim governing body) can provisionally authorize the deployment of foreign troops throughout the country," the NPFL said. "For UNOMIL and ECOMOG to be deployed throughout the country, an agreement between the legitimate government of Liberia and the United Nations and another between the government and ECOWAS must be signed," it added. "Only the State Council has the authority to order the parties to remove checkpoints, gates, and the actual physical disarmament of all parties." "Men, women, and ordinary citizens took up arms against the past government because it was not representative and did not address their concerns and grievances," said the NPFL, which was behind the rebellion that began on December 24, 1989, against the government of President Samuel Doe, who was assassinated in September 1990. "Now that they have decided upon a legitimately accepted government in which they are represented, they are prepared to peacefully and voluntarily surrender their arms to that authority," it said. "Give them their government and they will give up their arms." In the meantime, France on Friday condemned recent attacks against humanitarian organizations in northern Liberia, which forced them to withdraw from the area, calling on all factions to "show restraint." Lucette Michauyx-Chevry, the French minister in charge of humanitarian aid and human rights, demanded "that confiscated materiel and equipment be returned to the organizations, that civilian populations be protected, and that the security of humanitarian organizations' personnel be guaranteed." The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), and several other humanitarian organizations announced their withdrawal from northern Lofa County on December 27, citing harassment from the armed ULIMO faction.
