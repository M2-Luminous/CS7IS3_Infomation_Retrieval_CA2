During a meeting with a delegation from the Tunisian commission for lifting the blockade imposed on Iraq under 'Izz-al-Din al-Shabi, the vice president added: America's agents and slaves from among Arab and other rulers are suffering the same isolation. He stressed that the children of Arabism will avenge their nation and will punish those who turned Arab land, waters, and wealth into tools to strike at great Iraq and its independent revolutionary course. Taha Yasin Ramadan said that the blockade will be terminated thanks to the will of the Iraqi people, who set an example in willpower, patience, jihad, and construction. He praised the genuine pan-Arab stands of the Arab people in Tunis and everywhere in the Arab world. He commended their endorsement of the causes that Iraq has volunteered to defend and paid immense sacrifices for their sake. 'Izz-al-Din al-Shabi praised President Saddam Husayn's brave leadership, which has become a beacon exposing agents and traitors. He stressed the free Arabs' love for Saddam Husayn because his excellency has become a symbol of the Arab love for freedom, independence, and progress and rejection subordination and colonialism.
