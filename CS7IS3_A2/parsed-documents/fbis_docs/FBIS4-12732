However, it seems he is trying to attract the attention of international society, including the United States, by complaining that postponement of the military withdrawal is linked to worsening of the situation in the occupied territories. The remark is also a sign of Chairman 'Arafat's irritation, as he wants to regain the occupied territories and establish his authority in a hurry through election of a tentative government because the Palestinians in the territories are increasingly becoming dissatisfied. Following the invalidation of a deadline for starting the withdrawal, which was 13 December last year, it is becoming difficult for Israel to complete the military withdrawal even by 13 April. In the meeting, Chairman 'Arafat stressed: "The Palestinians in the occupied territories have not seen any concrete outcome (of the peace accord). Slaughters and violence are increasing. Not only that but also the people in Gaza district, where the living environment is very bad, are on the verge of starvation." However, the Palestinians in Jericho, where the support rate for the peace accord was high, are also feeling powerless and are beginning to doubt the possibility of realizing peace. Because of this, it seems the chairman made his remark while keeping in mind the Palestinians' dissatisfaction. Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories are calling on the PLO leadership for administration of a democratic organization. 'Arafat, who was forced to make concessions to Israel during the previous negotiations on the military withdrawal, knows he is a target of the Palestinians' dissatisfaction. Therefore, he is pressed by the need to show a firm stance to Israel and the United States. The United States is critical of the fact that the PLO's statement failed to criticize the suicide bombing by "Hamas," the Islamic extremist organization, in Afula. 'Arafat clearly stated: "I gave instructions on how to write the statement." In this way, he showed his intention not to act the way the United States wants him to. Noting the relationship between worsening public security and the delay in negotiations after the random shooting in Hebron, 'Arafat said "a failure to realize peace will create confusion in the most important strategic area in the world." He then stressed the "responsibility of international society." However, it seems the chairman's intention is to break the deadlock by calling for intervention by the United States.
