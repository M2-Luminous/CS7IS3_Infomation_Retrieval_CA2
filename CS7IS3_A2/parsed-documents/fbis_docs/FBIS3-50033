Mr. Papandoniou heads a government economic delegation from the ministry and representatives of Greek chambers of commerce, various firms, etc. Mr. Papandoniou, whose visit to Tirana is his first foreign trip since Greece took over the presidency of the EC, was welcomed at Rinas Airport by Selim Belortaja, Albanian minister for industry and trade. Khristodhoulos Tsalikis, ambassador of the Greek Republic in Tirana, was also present. Official talks between Belortaja and Papandoniou started this afternoon. In his speech, Mr. Belortaja stressed the special importance of this meeting, which he said was a chance to examine problems arising from proposals to further bilateral relations in the field of the economy, and also that, in Albania's foreign trade relations, trade and cooperation with Greece occupy a special place. He said that trade with Greece accounts for 14 percent of our foreign trade. Of course, such a level of cooperation is due to the historical relations between both peoples, the reciprocity of the economies of both countries, and the political goodwill on the part of both governments to further bilateral relations. In his speech, Minister Papandoniou said that he felt it his duty to reiterate the warm atmosphere of Greek-Albanian relations, which have their basis in the historical ties and cooperation between the two countries and which are being advanced a step further with the visit of Foreign Minister Papoulias to Tirana. As EC president, Greece has an opportunity to help Albania to pass through this difficult transition period, the Greek minister told his Albanian counterpart, promising help even after Greece's EC presidency is over. He also concretely specified fields of cooperation. Attaching great importance to bilateral trade, Mr. Papandoniou stressed that trade should be developed in the border areas and generally be advanced in the future. On agriculture, he presented Greece's great interest and that of Greek firms in increasing investment in Albania in this area and stressed the encouragement and assistance that the Greek Government would provide for them. The Greek National Bank would like to open a representative office in Tirana, while the Greek Agricultural Bank has already drafted two projects. Leaving the issue open, Mr. Papandoniou stressed that they would discuss it extensively in talks with experts. Electricity production was also of interest to the Greek side and would require broad discussion by both sides. In his proposals, the Greek minister focused on the possibilities of cooperation to improve Albanian ports, with the idea of creating a joint commission of experts to carry out relevant studies. He also briefed them on the EC project on transportation and within this framework he offered cooperation for joint road networks. To conclude, Minister Papandoniou expressed optimism for the course of bilateral relations, which, according to him, were conditioned by the existence of the Greek minority in Albania and Albanian citizens in Greece. Mr. Belortaja commented on the outline that his Greek counterpart had made about prospects for bilateral relations, stressing that the Greek offer of cooperation was very diverse. He also pointed out the special values of the joint commissions in agriculture, trade, etc., and told the Greek side that it should brief the Albanian Government on concrete issues, so as to take the necessary decisions, which will open the way to broader cooperation. The Greek Government economic delegation is continuing its working visit to Tirana.
