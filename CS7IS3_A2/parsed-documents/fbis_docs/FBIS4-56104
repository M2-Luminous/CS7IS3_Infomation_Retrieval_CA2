Before his visit he gave an interview to Slovak Radio Prague correspondent Daniela Galikova. [Begin recording] [Galikova] Do you think there has been a qualitative shift in Czech-Slovak relations since the split of the Czechoslovak Federation? [Havel] Shortly after the split some problems were very sensitive, burning, and painful. Much was written about them, and excessive emphasis was placed on their political aspect. My view is that they have probably been transformed into more matter-of-fact issues. [passage omitted] [Galikova] The new Slovak cabinet has been in office for over a month now. It is generally being perceived as the cabinet that has contributed to calming down the Slovak political scene. Do you think that now is the right time to discuss the issues pertaining to Czech-Slovak relations that remain unsolved, especially considering (?very tense relations) with the current Slovak opposition? [Havel] My view is that we are not in a hurry. It would be damaging if any hurried solution to those issues that remain open were to interfere with the pre-election situation in Slovakia or cause any unnecessary polarization. For various reasons I do not think that it would be a good thing if something that might be called the Czech card were to play a role in the Slovak elections. This would not be good. That is why I think it is better to work calmly and to make certain preparations. Once agreements are ripe for being concluded, we can conclude them. However, taking the elections into account, I do not think it would be good to hurry anything. [end recording]
