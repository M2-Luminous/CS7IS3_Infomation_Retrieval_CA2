The information that in connection with certain political events Vladimir Volfovich himself was planning to be in Vladivostok and take part in the rally came early Sunday morning from the Russian radio, which could not fail to increase city residents' interest in the planned event. It would be unfair to say, however, that people came ONLY to see Zhirinovskiy--those who gathered here were sincere, convinced supporters of Viktor Cherepkov and the former masters of the Vladivostok mayoralty. The absence of the promised LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader at the rally did not disappoint those present: The famous extravagant and original thinking of the latter was more than compensated for by the speakers, whose expressions far from always could be defined as parliamentary language. Which in turn may prompt another series of court hearings on cases "in defense of honor and dignity" of a number of high-ranking persons in the kray administration. After two hours of debates, a resolution was adopted, expressing the resolve to continue fighting for human rights in Vladivostok. The rally ended without incidents.
