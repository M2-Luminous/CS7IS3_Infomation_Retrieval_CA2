Asked about one of the resolutions aimed at establishing the percentage that banks, savings and loans associations, and currency exchange houses have to pay everyday to the BCH, he replied that this figure will increase from 0.50 percent to 0.100 percent; in other words, the BCH administration is authorized to handle 60-90 percent of the available foreign currency according to needs and thus avoid speculation and pressure on the Honduran currency. Pino clarified the doubts that have arisen on this among business and commercial sectors: [Begin Pino recording] Sincerely and unfortunately there has been a terrible misunderstanding on this decision. Why? Because the BCH sets a percentage to purchase from the banking system and for a long time this has been 30 percent. This is the rate at which the BCH has been purchasing. A week ago the BCH decided to increase the amount from 30 to 40 percent. But why did we decide to go to 40 percent? What does the BCH use this 40 percent for? First of all, it uses it to pay the foreign debt; often to pay for infrastructure and various projects that benefit society as a whole. Second, the BCH pays the oil bill -- oil that not only the government uses but society as a whole. Third, in view of the imbalances we have pointed out, the BCH has the obligation to increase international reserves to strengthen the national economy. I insist, it is not true that the BCH is purchasing 50 percent of the foreign currency. Right now we are purchasing 40 percent due to Honduran society's needs. It should be clearly understood that the measures adopted by the BCH are to attend to affairs that are vital to the national economy. [end recording] When referring to how the fiscal deficit will be reduced, which right now is at 11.2 percent, Pino explained: [Begin Pino recording] We have told the international organizations that such a reduction is practically impossible. Right now we are negotiating an intermediate point that will also allow us to reduce the fiscal deficit, because we are unable to finance it in full -- a balance between reducing the deficit and fulfilling needs such as health, education, and other programs that are definitely needed by the country. [end recording] Hugo Noe Pino said that interest rates for BCH repeat discounts [redescuentos] will be kept at 19 percent and this rate will be reviewed quarterly. The banking cash reserve [encaje] will be set at 34 percent of the fiscal income and establish the percentage that banks, saving and loans associations, and currency exchange houses are obliged to sell foreign currency to government banks every day. Regarding the banking cash reserve Pino added: [Begin Pino recording] The legal banking cash reserve, which is the legal percentage of deposit reserves that banks have to keep, by obligation, at the BCH, remains the same. The only thing we have done is that the 34 percent has also been applied to deposits by public institutions -- in other words tax deposits, ENEE [National Enterprise for Electric Power] payments by the public through banks and savings and loans institutions, payments by the public for other services such as SANAA [National Autonomous Aqueduct and Sewage Service], and Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise]. This means that all we have done has been to broaden the banking cash reserve base. We have not increased it but have said, you, the banking system gentlemen have these resources and in this case these resources will also be subject to the legal banking cash reserve system. [end recording] Regarding prohibitions that Congress may apply in the case of foreign currency auctions, Hugo Noe Pino explained: [Begin Pino recording] The BCH, as director of foreign exchange policies, should not have such a prohibition. In the event the BCH at a given moment decides to exercise this control, it will be announced publicly in advance. I want to emphatically stress that the BCH has not decided to hold any foreign currency auctions. I want to first of all reiterate that it is not true that 50 percent is being purchased, as I have already stated; we are only purchasing 40 percent. [end recording] Hugo Noe Pino concluded by saying that among other resolutions, the monetary program should be accompanied by other measures applied to the fiscal deficit, such as limiting banking system internal credit to the public sector to 1.11 billion lempiras and establish overall financing of about 1.36 billion lempiras. He also added that he will not resign at the first signs of rough weather and will remain in the post as BCH president as long as President Carlos Roberto Reina so desires.
