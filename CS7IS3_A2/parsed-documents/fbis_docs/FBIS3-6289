There had been speculation that delegates from the other G-7 nations might criticize Japan in connection with its employment and macroeconomic policies. Sakaguchi, leading the Japanese delegation to the meeting, told reporters that the ministerial meeting was highly meaningful as the first G-7 conference to discuss employment problems. Some foreign delegates told the meeting that the other industrial nations should learn from Japan's low unemployment rate -- 2.5 percent last year, Sakaguchi said. He also said there was no criticism against his statement that Japan is doing its best to stimulate its economy. U.S. President Bill Clinton, in a speech earlier Monday to the conference, urged Japan to increase domestic demand as part of more aggressive macroeconomic policies in the industrial world. Sakaguchi also suggested that employment will be an important issue at the G-7 summit scheduled to be held in Naples, Italy, in July.
