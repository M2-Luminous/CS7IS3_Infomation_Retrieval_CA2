Postscript to V. Chernomyrdin's Visit"] [Text] There is an extremely fine line between politics and economics because the former, as is known, follows from the latter. It is not enough to assess the visit solely on the meetings with B. Clinton and other leading figures. We must also take account of the meetings at which at first sight inconspicuous yet essentially very important work was done, as evidenced by the avidity with which the interlocutors hung on every word spoken by the guest from Moscow. To this should also be added the contribution made by the six leading Russian Federation ministers who came to Washington to participate in the third session of the Russian-U.S. Intergovernmental Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation (this gave observers cause to joke that an away session of the Russian Government was being held in America). The Americans seemed to be most interested in one thing: What was happening in Russia at this moment, and whether the guests would be so bold as to speak again about the allocation of aid, on which the limit, even the verbal limit -- this was not concealed in Washington -- has already been reached. Instead, advice was offered about "living according to our means" and about cooperation in the spheres of space exploration, nuclear power, and environmental protection. Portraying the present situation in Russia, Viktor Chernomyrdin strengthened the Americans' faith in the reforms being implemented in our country. At the same time he made it clear (unobtrusively) that the results might have been still more tangible but for "Cold War relics" -- restrictions of various kinds. Thus, the development of bilateral trade relations is being held up not so much by the uncompetitiveness of many Russian commodities as by obstacles in the United States in the way of high-tech products coming from Russia. The cause of this -- tough antidumping legislation -- was not only named. V. Chernomyrdin called for the repeal of the notorious Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Bill and also for the U.S. Administration to recognize Russia's status as a country with a transitional market economy. At the same time he stated this not just at the highest level. The premier ventured to do something that no Soviet or Russian leading figure has done before: to have a meeting with the leadership of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry -- the very body on whose initiative the Jackson-Vanik Amendment was, in fact, approved. The unusual approach was repaid with interest. The representatives of the "influential Zionist lobby" in the United States (this was what they were called under the totalitarian regime) listened to the premier with interest and promised assistance but, at the same time, did not conceal their concern about the growth of crime and acts of anti-Semitism in Russia. Chernomyrdin in turn promised effective government assistance in settling problems, while emphasizing, however, that political stabilization is inconceivable without economic stabilization, particularly the repeal of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. It would evidently be naive to think that the various kinds of unevenness in Russian-U.S. relations will be eliminated at once. A number of congressmen, for example, dislike the fact that almost 20 documents on bilateral cooperation signed in the United States include an agreement to include Russia in the international program to build the Alpha space station: They say that this will entail U.S. expenditure.
