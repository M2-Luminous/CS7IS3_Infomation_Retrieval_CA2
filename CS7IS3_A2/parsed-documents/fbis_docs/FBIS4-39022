The eight parties referred to are South and North Korea, Japan, the United States, China, Russia, the United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Russia, which appears to be treading an idependent diplomatic course by drawing a line with the Western camp since early this year, is concerned lest the DPRK question be resolved under U.S. leadership. Even though it basically has no intention of objecting to economic sanctions, it has not withdrawn from its position of calling for a meeting of the eight parties before taking that action. According to a Russian Foreign Ministry source, even within the ministry there are voices of self-reproach saying: "We have pushed the DPRK too far into a corner by approaching the ROK promptly following the collapse of the Soviet Union." Given the situation, there is no choice but for the country to be cautious about economic sanctions at this stage. It is also true that this issue draws little concern in parliament and among the public as compared to the Bosnian issue, wherein the problem of Slavic Serbs is involved. Besides, with economic ties with the ROK only growing, what Russia most likely wants to do most is to stay away from making decisive confrontations with the United States and the ROK over the DPRK nuclear issue.
