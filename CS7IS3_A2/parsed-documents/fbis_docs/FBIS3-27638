In 1993 the province maintained a good and speedy trend of economic development and made new breakthroughs in major economic indices, which manifested themselves in the following aspects: First, the aggregate economic volume increased to a new level and the national economy developed rapidly. Last year, the province's gross domestic product topped 100 billion yuan, to stand at 114.6 billion yuan, an increase of 12.6 percent over the previous year and the province's highest record since the introduction of reform and opening up. The province reaped a good agricultural harvest in the course of structural adjustment, and maintained rapid industrial growth. The fixed-asset investment increased by a wide margin, and markets grew brisk amid stability. Second, the province further improved its economic structure. This manifested itself in the structural change in primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. The rural production structure improved further. The investment structure was adjusted. Third, the economy developed comparatively rapidly. Taking the province as a whole, tertiary industries developed rapidly, town and township enterprises developed even more rapidly, and the individual and private economic sectors made more contributions to the province's economy. Fourth, there was good convergence between production and marketing, economic results improved, the economic order gradually returned to normal as a result of the implementation of state macroeconomic control and regulatory measures, and the economic environment improved markedly. Fifth, the income of people in cities and towns increased. Last year their per capita income amounted to 2,443 yuan, while peasants' per capita net income amounted to 851 yuan. Allowing for price rises, the former increased by 10.1 percent over the previous year and the latter by 2 percent. In 1993 the province registered good development in the national economy and in social undertakings, but there also were problems and drawbacks. For example, the shortage of funds for economic development still remained unresolved, commodity prices rose too rapidly, agricultural investment was inadequate, and social order needed further improvement. For this reason, the provincial government asked departments and governments at all levels to take positive and effective measures to bring about sustained, steady, and healthy development [chi xu wen ding jian kang fa zhan] in the province's national economy and social order.
