Of those interviewed who were willing to state their preference, 53 percent promised to vote for Rehn and 47 percent for Ahtisaari. This difference falls within the margin of error of 3 percent in either direction. In theory it is possible therefore that the state of public opinion is level at 50-50. The poll was carried out by Finska Gallup on 26 and 27 January. In a similar poll carried out the day after the first round of the election, Rehn led by 56 percent to 44 percent. Both polls interviewed around 1,000 people, 24 percent of whom were unwilling to state their preference or announced that they did not intend to vote. Of those interviewed last week, 11 percent had already voted. The Rehn-Ahtisaari balance among them was even. [passage omitted]
