Many of the proposals in the PT government program, which is still under discussion, directly contradict the Constitution and would entail making deep changes in nearly all its chapters. By way of example, the endorsement of abortions to be performed at state-run health care centers jars directly with Article 5 of the Constitution, which guarantees the inviolability of the right to life and thus bans abortion. Another example of conflict is the PT's proposal to guarantee the right of homosexual couples to get married at a registry office, to have access to social security benefits, or to share or bequeath their assets to one another. Paragraph 3 of Article 226 of the Constitution clearly recognizes the family unit to be the stable union between a man and a woman, thus excluding a union between people of the same sex. The PT wants the Armed Forces' role to be circumscribed to defense of the borders, while the Constitution in Article 142 provides for other duties, such as enforcing law and order and guaranteeing constitutional authority. The PT is campaigning for voluntary military service, while Article 143 of the Constitution stipulates that it is compulsory. The PT program proposes creating a Defense Ministry, to "guarantee cohesion in defense policy and reduce the corporate interests of each branch of the Armed Forces." Article 91 of the Constitution, however, takes the existence of the three military ministries (Army, Navy, and Aeronautics) for granted. The federal system of government does not escape from this conflict, either. The PT intends to decentralize power and financial resources so that they will be equitably shared between the federal government, states, and municipalities. This would require amendments to Articles 25-31 and to Article 145. The PT program jars with several points on the organization of the three branches of government as provided for in the Constitution. The PT program's defense of the principle of "a vote for each citizen," in referring to representation in the Chamber of Deputies, goes against Article 45 of the Constitution, which stipulates that all states are to be guaranteed a minimum of eight deputies and a maximum of 70. Other examples include the PT's proposal to eliminate the revisory role of the Senate, which goes against Article 65, and the items pertaining to party affiliation and parliamentary immunity, which go against the provisions of Article 55.
