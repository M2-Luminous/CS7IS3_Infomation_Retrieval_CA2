Over the 7-14 December period prices and rates for basic goods and services rose by 2.3 percent, including by 2.2 percent for foodstuffs and by 2.5 percent for nonfood items. Rates for paid services to the population rose by 2.6 percent. The greatest rates of price increases were registered in the cities of Western and Eastern Siberia--4.1 to 4.8 percent; the lowest in the cities of the Volgo-Vyatka and North Caucasus regions and in Kaliningrad Oblast--by 1.4 percent. The dynamics of weekly price increases over the past four weeks were as follows: 11/23 11/30 12/07 12/14 Rate of price 102.09 102.2 102.9 102.3 increases for goods and services including: foodstuffs 103.1 102.0 102.9 102.2 nonfood items 102.5 102.5 102.5 102.5 paid services for 103.6 101.3 105.4 102.6 the population Food Prices for basic foodstuffs rose by 2.2 percent; over the preceding week they rose by 2.9 percent. Over the elapsed week the greatest prices increases were registered with respect to eggs (by 6.0 percent), as well as fish and fish products (by 4.6 percent). Prices increased by more than one-third: for eggs--in Roston-on-Don, Orenburg, Vladivostok, and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk; for frozen fish--in Penza and Orenburg. Prices for macaroni items and cereals, butter, vegetable oil, salt, and vegetables rose by 3-4 percent. Price increases of a lesser magnitude--by 1.5 to 2.9 percent--occurred with respect to milk products, confectionery items, flour, bread and bakery products, and fruit. Price rises settled into a stable pace (no more than 1 percent a week) with respect to meat and meat products, sugar, and vodka. Nonfood Items Prices for these items rose over the week by 2.5 percent. This rate of price increases remained stable over the past four weeks. Over the week prices for sewn items and knitwear increased by 3.0-3.6 percent, and for footwear, cultural, personal, and household items, as well as fuel sold to the population by 1.6-2.0 percent. Services Fees for paid services to the population rose by 2.6 percent over the second week of December. The greatest price increase was registered with respect to notary services (by 48 percent). In 80 out of 132 monitored cities of Russia the cost of certifying a will by a notary public increased 1.9-fold. Fees for some varieties of paid health care services increased by 8-15 percent. Apartment rents remained at the same level in all cities except Berdsk. In Berdsk they increased 58.8-fold (from 17 kopeks to 10 rubles [R]). Industrial Production Over the first 10 days of December 1993 production of most varieties of products counted in periodic reports has declined, which may be seen from the following table: Total items Of Them: Production Declined As Compared To the Corresponding Period of Last Year As a Preceding As a Percentage Month Percentage of Total of Total Industry--total 152 137 90 91 60 including the following sectors: fuels and 15 11 73 6 40 electric power ferrous 2 2 100 2 100 metallurgy machine building 31 26 84 17 55 and metal processing chemical and 24 24 100 20 83 petrochemical timber, 10 10 100 2 20 wood-processing, and pulp and paper construction 9 8 89 8 89 materials light 14 14 100 10 71 production of 18 16 89 9 50 nonfood consumer items (without light industry products) food processing 29 26 90 17 59 In the fuels and power generation sectors, over 12 days of December of this year production of the main kinds of energy resources is characterized by the following data: In Real Volume Average Daily Production as a Since the Percentage of the Corresponding Beginning of the Period of Month Last Year Preceding Month Electric 35.0 98 106 power--billion kwt/hr Thermal 35.5 98 111 energy--million G-cal Coal--million tonnes 9.5 93 109 Natural gas--billion 21.7 99 99.9 cubic meters Oil--million tonnes 9.9 88 98 Over 12 days of December of this year, 7 million tonnes of oil were refined, which is 7 percent more than over the corresponding period of this year's November, including in the following associations: Omsknefteorgsintez--by 11 percent, Salavatnefteorgsintez--by 14 percent, and Bashneftekhimzavody--by 29 percent. The output of automotive gasoline increased over this period by 10 percent, and of boiler oil--by 7 percent. Overall, as compared to the level of 13 days of last year's December, the volume of refining increased by 2 percent. The increase in the volume of oil refining resulted to a considerable extent from the fact that greater quantities of oil previously intended for exports now are being delivered to oil refining enterprises. Out of 12 associations of the Gazprom RAO [All-Russia Joint-Stock Society], seven increased the volume of gas production as compared to the first half of the preceding month, including Surgutgazprom by 3 percent and Nadymgazprom by 2 percent. As compared with the corresponding period of this year's November, coal production has increased at almost all coal-producing enterprises with the exception of the Vorkutaugol association, where because of recent strikes it fell off by one-quarter. In ferrous metallurgy over 12 days of December the production of iron ore declined by 14 percent as compared to the analogous period of November, including at the Lebedinskiy (Belgorod Oblast), Kachkanarskiy (Sverdlovsk Oblast), and Korshunovskiy (Irkutsk Oblast) ore mining and processing combines by 20-30 percent and at Kostomukshskiy by 48 percent, which is due to restrictions on delivery of electric power to the aforementioned combines because of arrears in payments. Production of steel and finished rolled metal has declined as compared with the level of the analogous period of November by 2 percent, and that of last year by one-quarter; of steel pipe, respectively, by 9 percent and 55 percent. The data on the output of most important items in machine building are shown below: In Physical Average Daily Production as a Volume Since the Percentage of the Corresponding Beginning of the Period of Month Last Year Preceding Month Large electric 98 50 120 machines--units Metal-cutting machine 204 41 79 tools--units Excavators--units 288 129 90 Freight railcars--units 64 18 57 Automobiles--thousand units trucks 9.2 52 78 passenger cars 27.6 86 88 buses 1.6 102 125 Tractors--units 425 10 100 Over the elapsed days of December, there has been an increase in the average daily production of special, specialized, and component system machine tools, city telephone cables, and trolley buses as compared with both the corresponding period of last year and the preceding month. At the same time, with respect to most items the current level of daily production was below that for the corresponding period of 1992, including diesels and diesel generators, metal-cutting lathes, bridge electric cranes, trucks, friction-free ball bearings (declined by half), drop forges, mainline freight railcars, automotive trailers and semi-trailers, and tractors (by a factor of 6-10), which to a large extent is the result of a decline in solvent demand for products. In the chemical and petrochemical industry the current situation is as follows: In Physical Average Daily Production as a Volume Since Percentage of the the Beginning Corresponding Period of of the Month Last Year Preceding Month Synthetic ammonia--thousand 263 85 93 tonnes Sulphuric acid--thousand 203 66 93 tonnes Mineral 198 72 100.6 fertilizer--thousand tonnes Chemical filament and 7.0 57 99.8 fiber--thousand tonnes Automotive tires for 872 72 95 agricultural vehicles, motorcycles, and motorollers--thousand units As compared with the first half of last year's December, there has been a considerable decline in the output of calcinated soda, polyethylene, synthetic rubbers, and microbiological fodder protein (by 32-43 percent). Production of polyvynilchloride resin, pipe and pipeline components made of thermoplastics, polyvynilchloride-based plastics, and tires for agricultural vehicles amounted to less than half of last year's volume. The volume of average daily output of a majority of indicated, as well as other varieties, of products also was below that for the corresponding period of this year's November, with the exception of polypropylene, whose daily output exceeded November level by 13 percent, and movie film (by a factor of three); production of calcinated soda remained at the same level. In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry, over the elapsed 12 days of December as compared with the analogous period of this year's November, the average daily production increased with respect to practically all of the most important varieties of products (with the exception of wood-chip board and cardboard): In Physical Average Daily Production as a Volume Since Percentage of the the Beginning Corresponding Period of of the Month Last Year Preceding Month Sawn lumber--thousand 345 70 100.9 cubic meters Commercial 51.1 92 153 cellulose--thousand tonnes Wood-chip board--thousand 92.6 79 95 standard cubic meters Paper--thousand tonnes 89.0 80 100.1 Cardboard--thousand 38.5 74 86 tonnes The average output of commercial timber over the elapsed 10 days of December amounted to 198,000 cubic meters, which is one-third less than over the same period of last year. Cutbacks in deliveries of timber to sawmills and wood-processing plants has led to a decline over the period since the beginning of the month in the output of mine props (by 37 percent), wood-fiber board (by 28 percent), and matches (by 51 percent). In the construction materials industry over the elapsed period of December the average daily production of all varieties of products counted in periodic reports (with the exception of ground lime and dolomite) has declined over the elapsed period of December as compared with the analogous period of this year's November: In Physical Average Daily Production as a Volume Since Percentage of the the Beginning Corresponding Period of of the Month Last Year Preceding Month Cement--million tonnes 1.3 87 81 Construction 289 81 91 brick--million units of standard bricks Pliable roofing materials 14.7 79 78 and rolled insulation--million square meters Window glass--million 2.8 68 94 square meters In the cement sector, the average daily product output was the lowest over the entire elapsed period of the year--110,500 tonnes as compared with 127,000 tonnes over the corresponding period of last year's December. The average daily production of roof slate, high-grade asbestos, asbestos-cement pipe and couplers amounted to 60-74 percent of the level of 13 days of last year's December. At the same time, in the first half of December Rosstrom AO [Joint-Stock Society] enterprises, which produces two-thirds of the total output of decorative ceramic tile in Russia, increased their production by 6.5 percent as compared to the first half of last year's December. In the light industry over the elapsed period of December as compared with the analogous period of November there has been an increase in the average daily production of cotton and linen fabrics and sack cloth. However, as compared with the corresponding period of 1992, the output of all items counted in weekly reports has declined: of children's footwear--by 61 percent; woolen fabrics--by half; silk fabrics, jackets, and footwear--by 40-42 percent; knitwear--by one-third; and hosiery--by one-quarter. In the production of complex home appliances, over the elapsed period of December as compared to the corresponding period of November there was an increase in the daily production of television sets and sewing machines (by 2-14 percent), tape recorders, video tape recorders, and bicycles (by 24-31 percent). At the same time, the average daily production of refrigerators and freezers, washing machines, electric irons, and radio receivers declined by 11-19 percent; electric vacuum cleaners, by 28 percent; and motorcycles, almost by half. As compared with the analogous period of last year, production declined with respect to all categories of goods (with the exception of color television sets). There has been no production of radio receivers since the beginning of the month at the Mayak plant (Kursk Oblast) and the Irkutsk radio plant and of electric vacuum cleaners at the Omsk electromechanical plant. Production of basic foodstuffs over the elapsed days of December amounted to: In Physical Average Daily Production as a Volume Since the Percentage of the Corresponding Beginning of the Period of Month Last Year Preceding Month Meat, including 67.7 76 84 category I subproducts, total--thousand tonnes Butter, 7.5 80 80 total--thousand tonnes Whole-milk products 205 87 94 recalculated as milk, total, thousand tonnes The only item where an increase in production was registered as compared to both the corresponding period of last year and that of the preceding month was vegetable oil--by 21 percent and 24 percent, respectively. With respect to most varieties of foodstuffs, the daily output has declined as compared to the same period in November, which in a number of instances is due to the seasonal nature of production. For instance, with respect to commercial edible fish and canned fruit and vegetables production declined, respectively, by 20 percent and 26 percent; the output of granulated sugar fell off by more than one-third. As compared to the corresponding period of last year there has been a considerable decline in the production of bakers' yeast--by 20 percent, macaroni items--by 40 percent, and mineral water--by 44 percent. With respect to butter, canned meat, tea, and food concentrates neither the level of the corresponding period of last year nor that of the preceding month has been reached. Housing construction In January-November 1993 commissioning of housing in the Russian Federation was characterized by the following data: Commissioned, January-November Share in million square 1993 as a Percentage Total meters of total of 1992 Volume, in space Percents Enterprises and 22.8 101 100 organizations of all forms of ownership of them: state enterprises 11.8 96 52 and organizations joint-stock 5.0 116 22 societies As compared to the corresponding period of 1990 the volume of housing construction has declined by 40 percent. The private sector (individual housing construction and cooperatives) accounted for approximately one-fifth of the total volume of the housing commissioned. The pace of construction in this sector will increase by more than 3 percent as compared to the preceding year. Overall over 1993, it is planned to put into place more than 42 million square meters of housing. The volume of housing construction is expected to increase in a majority of regions in Russia; an especially high pace of housing construction is being observed in Tomsk, Ivanovo, Kostroma, and Ulyanovsk Oblasts and the city of St. Petersburg. Construction of Most Important Objects in the Agro-Industrial Complex Capital investment worth R3.2 trillion from all sources of financing was put into strengthening the material and technical base of the agro-industrial complex [APK] and improving the social and living conditions of its workers in January-November of this year, which is 28 percent less than over the corresponding period of last year. Money from the state budget of the Russian Federation comprises one-fifth of the total volume; it is directed mostly at construction of the APK's most important production objects in accordance with federal targeted programs. In 1993, construction of 910 such objects is envisaged at 709 construction sites in the Russian Federation. As of 1 December 1993, only 19 were actually put on line, including partial operation. The level of commissioning of the APK's most important production capacities and facilities comprised about 6 percent of the annual start-up program, which is seen from the following data: Quantity Objects Put on Utilization of Capital Line Over Investment Over January-November January-November 1993 1993 Construction Objects Total Billion Rubles, Sites Including for Start-Up Construction Objects Total Including Start-Ups in 1993 Total 709 910 348 19 119.8 50.4 including by program: "Development 73 73 12 -- 11.7 2.2 of the Baby Food Industry" "Russia's 65 119 36 1 16.9 5.9 Bread" "Sugar" 30 36 13 -- 9.7 2.1 "Fish" 92 115 63 -- 7.5 5.9 "Vegetable 8 11 5 -- 6.2 5.9 Oil" "Fertility" 39 40 18 5 3.5 2.1 "Rebirth of 252 349 134 10 44.1 19.7 the Russian Countryside and the Development of the APK" "Rebirth of 18 27 11 -- 0.9 0.5 the Russian Linen" Nonprogram 132 140 56 3 19.3 6.1 part As of 1 December 1993, work on 94 extremely important APK construction projects has not yet started; almost one-half of them are part of the "Development of the Baby Food Industry" and "Fish" programs. No construction is being done at a baby food plant in Kaluga, a baby food production department in Astrakhan, a city milk plant in Anapa in Krasnodar Kray, and a canned meat for babies production line at the meat packing combine in Neftekamsk in the Republic of Bashkortostan; reconstruction has not begun at Nikolskiy fish-breeding plant in Novgorod Oblast, at the production base of the Novyy Oskol zone-wide fish breeder in Belgorod Oblast, at the expansion of Ruyga fish farm in Tver Oblast, and others. Export Cargo at Border Points at Railroads and in Ports As a result of the uncoordinated work of enterprises and organizations participating in the transportation of export cargo, on average 13,000 railcars a day with export cargo were present in November of this year at border point and harbor-adjacent tracks of the Russian Federation railroads; 2,600 of them were railcars with timber, 1,700, with bituminous coal, and 1,300, with ferrous metals. Number of Railcars With Export Cargo in November 1993, thousands On Average Per Day As a Percentage of October 1993 Total railcars at border 13.3 82 point and harbor-adjacent rail tracks including the following railroads October 1.0 108 East-Siberian 0.4 109 North Caucasus 0.8 156 Transbaykal 2.1 60 Far-Eastern 9.0 83 The greatest number of railcars with export cargo were at the Far-Eastern railroad, 9,000 railcars (68 percent), including about 7,500 railcars destined for the ports and 1,500 railcars destined for border stations, which exceeded the established norms 2.1-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. As of 1 December of this year, 2.7 million tonnes of sea-bound export cargo have accumulated in the main sea ports in Russia, which is 37 percent more than on this date last year. The greatest remainders of this cargo were in the ports Nakhodka--561,000 tonnes (19 percent more than during the corresponding period of last year), Vostochnyy--480,000 tonnes, Vladivostok--282,000 tonnes, Vanino--246,000 tonnes (twice as much), St. Petersburg--354,000 tonnes (by 8 percent), and Kaliningrad--188,000 tonnes (1.7-fold). Overall, remainders of export cargo awaiting shipping in the main sea ports increased by 1.4 percent as compared to 1 November of this year; they decreased in the ports of St. Petersburg, Vostochnyy, and Novorossiysk (by 4-11 percent), and increased in the ports of Kaliningrad, Vanino, and Vladivostok (by 9-16 percent). Deliveries by Waterway Transport to the Regions of the Far North As of 1 December of this year, about 43 million tonnes of cargo had been shipped to the regions of the Far North and areas equated to them, which is 25 percent less than the volume of the cargo shipped as of the same date last year. January-November 1993 January-November 1993 as a Percentage of January-November 1992 Total cargo shipped by 42,999 75 waterways--total, thousand tonnes by sea 7,638 72 by internal waterways 35,361 76 including: dry cargo 29,805 72 by sea 5,268 70 by internal waterways 24,537 72 liquid cargo 6,964 78 by sea 2,370 77 by internal waterways 4,594 79 timber in rafts by 6,230 92 internal waterways As compared to last year, the greatest decline in the volume of sea cargo deliveries was to the following ports: Dudinka (by 38 percent), Magadan (by 27 percent), and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy (by 24 percent), to the ports of the White (by 48 percent) and Barents (by 27 percent) Seas, to Sakhalin (by 36 percent) and Chukotka (by 31 percent), and to the Eastern Arctic region (by 22 percent) and Eastern Kamchatka (by 21 percent). Less liquid cargo has been delivered to the ports on the Barents Sea (by a factor of 2.4), the White Sea ports (by a factor of 1.7), to the Kuril Islands (by a factor of 1.9), Sakhalin (by a factor of 1.6), and Eastern Kamchatka (by a factor of 1.3), to the ports of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy (by a factor of 1.3) and Magadan (by a factor of 1.2) than as of the same date last year. As of 1 December of this year, 22,000 tonnes of products and goods earmarked for coasting transportation (85 percent as compared with 1 December 1992) accumulated in the port of Vladivostok, which handles delivery of cargo to the northern ports that are open year-round; 22,000 tonnes were waiting in the port of Vostochnyy (136 percent), and 10,000 tonnes in the port of Vanino (63 percent). Collection of Ferrous and Nonferrous Metal Scrap In 1993 the volume of collection of metal scrap and waste by the Vtorchermet and Investortsvetmet organizations for supplying metallurgical production was characterized by the following data: Ferrous Metal Scrap Nonferrous Metal Scrap Million As a Percentage Thousand As a Percentage Tonnes of the Tonnes of the Corresponding Corresponding Period of 1992 Period of 1992 First quarter 1.9 55 67.7 55 Second 2.5 63 76.7 63 quarter Third quarter 2.0 65 53.7 56 October 0.63 63 18.3 60 November 0.59 61 16.8 61 Fourth 2.0 64 55.1 62 quarter (forecast) 1993 8.4 61 253.2 59 (forecast) Sales of metal scrap to the Vtorchermet and Investortsvetmet procurement organizations have declined everywhere in the current year, and especially in the regions with high consumption of metal. In January-November, the procurement of ferrous metals scrap in Kemerovo, Lipetsk, and Yaroslavl Oblast amounted to less than 50 percent of the last year's level; in Tula, Orenburg, Chelyabinsk, Saratov, and Kirov Oblasts and the city of Moscow--between 52 and 64 percent. Procurement of nonferrous metals scrap dropped by half in Maritime and Khabarovsk Krays, the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and Leningrad Oblast. Foreign Investment Joint enterprises and foreign companies' investment in the development of the Russian economy is characterized by the following data (in billion rubles): January-September As a Proportional 1993 Percentage of Share in the Total Volume for Russia Overall (in Percents) Capital 312.9 100 2.6 investment--total including: construction and 132.1 42 1.8 erection work equipment, tools, 122.9 39 6.1 implements other work and 57.9 19 2.4 expenditures Of the total volume of investment, R237.7 billion, or 76 percent, went into the construction of production facilities, including R102.4 billion (33 percent) into fuels industry, R17.4 billion (5.6 percent) into woodworking and the pulp and paper industry, R12.4 billion (4.0 percent) into transportation and communications, R32.1 billion (10 percent) into construction, and R45.3 billion (14 percent) into trade and public catering. Capital assets worth R108.0 billion have been put in operation, of which production facilities accounted for R105.2 billion (97 percent). Among the production capacities that have been put on line are those for production of 2,000 trucks (Lipetsk Oblast), for making R30 million worth of furniture (Perm Oblast), and for producing R725.7 million worth of equipment for oil prospecting and geologic survey drilling and the spare parts for it (Khanty-Mansy Autonomous Okrug).
