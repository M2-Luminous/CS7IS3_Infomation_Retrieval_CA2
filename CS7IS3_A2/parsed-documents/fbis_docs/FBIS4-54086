In the meeting, the ambassador conveyed greetings from the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il to Chairman Genaro Ledesma Izquieta. The chairman expressed deep gratitude for this and asked the ambassador to convey his heartfelt greetings to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. The chairman said as following: Recently, the Japanese reactionaries are clinging to anti-socialist, anti-Republic, and anti-Chongnyon [the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan] suppression in collusion with the South Korean puppets, instead of apologizing to the Korean people for its past criminal acts. The world should heighten its vigilance against the Japanese militarism. The Japanese reactionaries' any kind of maneuvers cannot frighten the Korean people who are following the leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. We will send invariable support and solidarity to the socialist cause of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean people's cause for reunification.
