Yilmaz received Hans Stercken, chairman of the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee, at parliament today. In a statement during the meeting, Yilmaz said that this decision by the German parliament offends Turkey. It is regrettable that Turkey's friends in the Bundestag did not exert efforts to block this decision, Yilmaz remarked. He added: Such a decision does not conform with the friendly relations between the two countries. The fact that this decision will not result in any action does not erase its poisoning effect on bilateral relations. The ANAP leader said that he expects Turkey's friends in the German parliament to undertake initiatives to rectify this wrong decision. He also expressed the hope that Turkish-German relations will be raised to their previous level and be purged of such errors in the coming period.
