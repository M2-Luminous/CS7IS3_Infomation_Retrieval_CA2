Several members of the National Assembly had suggested during the current session that Taiwan follow the example of South Africa in adopting a new flag and anthem. Li said, however, that the conditions under which South Africa made the changes aren't the same as those in Taiwan. The DPP [Democratic Progressive Party] in a statement issued late in the afternoon said that the existing national flag and anthem were adopted from the Kuomintang's flag and song without the consent of people in the Taiwan area, and thus represent neither Taiwan nor China. It said that a nation must change its name, flag and anthem following changes in its territory and population structure. Li also urged the DPP, Taiwan's leading opposition party, to "value the free and democratic system and dedicate itself to the solidarity and construction of the island." By so doing, he said, the DPP may win greater support than the ruling Kuomintang from the people. Though Friday was the fourth anniversary of Li's inauguration, he was attending the National Assembly session as scheduled to hear a national-affairs discussion and answer questions raised by assembly members. Meanwhile, according to National Assembly Secretary-General Chen Chin-jang, Li has agreed that after the end of the session, he will meet small groups of assembly members one or two times each month to solicit their opinions on national affairs. The National Assembly began its three-month special session on May 2 in Yangmingshan to consider amendments to the constitution and the nominations by President Li of grand justices and the head of the Judicial Yuan.
