FBIS4-59820 "drnes096_d_94003" FBIS-NES-94-096 Daily Report 12 May 1994 Libya Daily Asserts Visting Western Tourists Spies Daily Asserts Visting Western Tourists Spies LD1205142294 Tripoli JANA in Arabic 1200 GMT 12 May 94 LD1205142294 Tripoli JANA Arabic BFN [Text] Tripoli, 12 May 1994, JANA -- AL-SHAM has affirmed that any exchange of interests, tourists, and friendship is merely a cover being used by Western powers to sneak in caravans of spies and agents as well as to set up bases to be used for planning dirty operations and the gathering of information. It pointed out in an article published in today's issue that the latest of those who entered our country for innocent reasons was a German tourist. He entered Libya, but after being involved in a traffic accident he turned to be the director of a department at the German intelligence. This confirms that as soon as a Westerner is involved in an accident or if he dies in our Arab homeland his government swiftly announces publicly through various media organs that he is a spy. Under the header "They Are All Spies," AL-SHAMS says: Many Westerners have been entering our Arab region legally and for other public purposes. They are traders, tourists, commercial representatives, businessmen, diplomats, or workers in the so-called humanitarian agencies. They all claim that they are in love with the East. Arab countries open their doors for them by extending to them the renown Arab hospitality, the warmth of Eastern feelings, and a will to exchange with them friendship and interests. The paper AL-SHAMS affirms that, if true, this a required and desired logical thing. However, the West always reveals to us a different face of those tourists, traders, diplomats, and humanitarian organization officials. The West reveals their true identity when it happens that one of them becomes involved in a road accident, an aggression, a disappearance, or a kidnapping by unknown persons. Then the state of the person involved hurriedly reveals his true identity and announces that the person in question is a spying intelligence officer, or the head of a spying network for his country, or an official of an administration of this network. This happened in Lebanon, and everybody remembers the Western nationals who were kidnapped as civilians holding various functions. The Western news media themselves revealed their true identity as intelligence officers. Had this been a one-time incident, or related to just one Western country, we would have thought of good intentions and the matter would have stayed there. But the repetition of admissions of these repeated incidents involving several countries reveals a remarkable phenomenon that calls for thought and begs the following question: Why does the West send us only its intelligence officers and men? Americans entered Lebanon for apparently innocent and humanitarian causes, including religious purposes, and after their kidnapping, America announced that they were intelligence men on a spying mission. Frenchmen also entered Lebanon for the same reasons. Englishmen entered Iraq and then Britain announced, after they had disappeared, that they were intelligence officers. The last of those who entered our country for innocent reasons was a German tourist who entered Libya and was involved in a traffic accident, and lo and behold he turned out to be a department head in the German intelligence services. Thus, with every accident or death of a Westerner in our Arab homeland his state quickly offers an official admission from the government through various media to the effect that the person concerned was a spy. This frequency and repetition of the phenomenon confirms to us that all nationals from foreign states who enter our country are intelligence officers or agents for those states and that they move to achieve base objectives by carrying out acts of sabotage, sowing discords, spreading rumors, and affecting the morale of our nation. [Passage indistinct]...and the building of bases to plan the dirty operations and gather information. Can we now trust any Westerner who enters our country? And do we have the right to give them a friendly welcome and warm hospitality?
