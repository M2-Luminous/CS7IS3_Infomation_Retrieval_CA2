Following the protests "an order was sent down for strict rectification of all religious groups in Qinghai", said Father Li Zhixin, a 38-year-old Catholic priest in the provincial capital of Xining. "Their prime target has been Muslims, then Catholics, because most of them belong to the underground church." Father Li said that in addition to being watched by police, he had recently come under surveillance by the State Security Bureau, which handles cases thought to threaten national interests. They have branded him a counter-revolutionary. Police have warned him several times to stop celebrating Mass, and have told him he would be arrested if caught doing so. The latest threat came last week. They have also demanded that he turn over all money collected from followers. "I told them, it's my responsibility, I have to do my missionary work," he said. Father Li has been a priest since 1982 and has celebrated Mass daily in homes of followers. But in the past year, it has become increasingly dangerous. Father Li, who works as a deputy manager at a factory, said police last November raided a convent where he had just celebrated Mass. Thanks to a tip-off, he managed to leave before the police arrived. Another priest was arrested and held for a day, and five nuns were taken away in handcuffs and sent back to their homes. The state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association has one priest and at most about 200 followers in Xining, while the underground church, which in defiance of government regulations pledges allegiance to the Vatican has three priests and about 10,000 followers, according to Father Li. Last spring he was detained while celebrating Mass in Jiangsu province. Police handcuffed, beat and interrogated him in an attempt to get him to admit he was acting illegally and selling out China. Sometimes they made him sit on the floor and hold out his arms straight in front of him for two hours at a time. They hit him when his hands began to drop. The interrogations took place up to five times a week. He also was forced to break rocks. Police threatened him with up to seven years in jail for his missionary work, but to his surprise, he was released and sent back to Qinghai after two months.
