FR940119-1-00055 FR940119-1-00013 (g) The catching or retention of school, large school or small medium Atlantic bluefin tuna is prohibited except as allowed under paragraph (d) of this section. (h) In any year, if the Assistant Administrator determines, based on landing statistics and other available information, that the prior year's quota in any category, or as appropriate, subcategory, has been exceeded or has not been reached, the Assistant Administrator will subtract the overharvest from or add the underharvest to that quota for the subsequent year; provided that the total of allocations and the reserve does not exceed the annual quota determined by ICCAT. The Assistant Administrator will publish any amounts to be subtracted or added and the basis for the quota reductions or increases in the Federal Register . (i) Transfers between categories. The Assistant Administrator is authorized to make adjustments to quotas involving transfers between vessel categories or, as appropriate, subcategories if the Assistant Administrator determines, based on historical landing statistics, present year catch rates and effort, and other available information, that any category, or as appropriate, subcategory, is not likely to take its entire quota as previously allocated for that year. Given that determination, the Assistant Administrator may transfer, inseason, any portion of the quota of any fishing category to any other fishing category or to the reserve after considering the four factors indicated at paragraphs (f) (1) through (4) of this section, and the probability that any transfers between categories will not result in the total quota being exceeded. The Assistant Administrator shall file a notification of transfer of any inseason adjustment amount with the Office of the Federal Register before such transfer is to become effective. 4. Section 285.23 is amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: §285.23 Incidental catch. * * * * * (c) Longlines. Subject to the quotas in §285.22, any person operating a vessel using longline gear possessing an Incidental Catch permit issued under §285.21 may retain or land large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna as an incidental catch. The amount of Atlantic bluefin tuna retained or landed may not exceed: (1) One fish per vessel per fishing trip landed south of 34 ○00 ’ N. latitude, provided that for the months of January through April at least 1,500 pounds (680 kg), and for the months of May through December at least 3,500 pounds (1,588 kg), either dressed or round weight, of species other than Atlantic bluefin tuna are legally caught, retained, and offloaded from the same trip and are recorded on the dealer weighout as sold; and (2) Two percent by weight, either dressed or round weight, of all other fish legally landed, offloaded and documented on the dealer weighout as sold at the end of each fishing trip, north of 34 ○00 ’ N. latitude. * * * * * 5. In §285.26, the text preceding the table is revised to read as follows: §285.26 Size classes. Straight fork length will be the sole criterion for determining the size class of Atlantic bluefin tuna. For any Atlantic bluefin tuna found with the head removed, it is deemed, for purposes of this subpart, that the tuna, when caught, fell into a size class in accordance with the following formula: Total straight fork length equals pectoral fin straight fork length multiplied by a factor of 1.35. For this purpose, all measurements must be taken in a straight line along the middle of the lateral surface from a line perpendicular to the dorsal insertion of the pectoral fin of the beheaded fish to a line perpendicular to the fork of the tail (PF, see Figure 1). The pectoral fin straight fork length will be the sole criterion for determining the size class of a beheaded Atlantic bluefin tuna. Total straight fork length will be the sole criterion for determining the size class of whole (head on) Atlantic bluefin tuna. Atlantic bluefin tuna are deemed to fall into a size class according to the following table; approximate round weights are given for illustrative purposes only. * * * * * 6. Section 285.29 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §285.29 Dealer recordkeeping and reporting. * * * * * (a) Must submit to the Regional Director via both electronic facsimile (FAX) and the existing postal system a daily report on a reporting card provided by NMFS, within 24 hours of the purchase or receipt of each Atlantic bluefin tuna from the person or vessel that harvested the fish. A FAX of said card must be received at the NMFS NE Regional Office (FAX 508&hyph;281&hyph;9135) within 24 hours of the purchase or receipt of each Atlantic bluefin tuna. Additionally, said card must be postmarked and mailed within 24 hours of the purchase or receipt of each Atlantic bluefin tuna. Each reporting card must be signed by the vessel permit holder or vessel operator to verify the name of the vessel that landed the fish and must show the Atlantic bluefin tuna vessel permit number, metal tag number affixed to the fish by the dealer or assigned by an authorized officer, the date landed, the port where landed, the round and/or dressed weight (indicating which weight(s) measured), the total or pectoral fin straight and/or curved fork length (indicating which length(s) measured), gear used, and area where the fish was caught. * * * * * 7. Section 285.31 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(30) and (a)(37) to read as follows: §285.31 Prohibitions. (a) *␣*␣* (30) Fish for, catch, retain, possess or land Atlantic bluefin tuna from the Gulf of Mexico except as specified under §285.23 (c) and (d); * * * * * (37) Fish for, catch, retain, possess or land any Atlantic bluefin tuna less than 178 cm from a vessel other than one issued an Angling Category permit under §285.21, or a Purse Seine category permit and operating under §285.23(e). * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1185 Filed 1&hyph;13&hyph;94; 1:30 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
