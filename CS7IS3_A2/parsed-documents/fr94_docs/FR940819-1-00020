FR940819-1-00020 FR940819-1-00006 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [TX&hyph;20&hyph;1&hyph;5732b; FRL&hyph;5016&hyph;9] Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of Title V, Section 507, Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program for Texas AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Texas for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program. The SIP revision was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in the Clean Air Act (CAA), to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the CAA. In the Final Rules Section of this Federal Register , the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn, and all public comments received during the 30-day comment period set forth below will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received in writing by September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this action should be addressed to Mr. Thomas Diggs, Chief (6T&hyph;AP), Planning Section, at the EPA Regional Office listed below.
