The following is the story of the arrest, as told by of detainee 'Abd-al-Majid al-Majali to security men in the presence of witnesses: Last Sunday, a person from al-Zarqa' visited 'Abd-al-Majid in al-Qasr. The two knew each other. The visitor had a small carton with military hardware in it and asked 'Abd-al-Majid to guard it until he returned in a few days to carry out a commando operation against Jews from southern Jordan. 'Abd-al-Majid asked the person if the weapons were licensed. The visitor said they were not, so 'Abd-al-Majid refused to keep them inside his house but agreed to hide the carton elsewhere, It ended up in the storage room of a house facing a mosque belonging to a school for the Islamic Center Society. Working hours were over on that day and the school's guard did not know about it. The imam of the mosque refused to hide the carton inside the mosque, so 'Abd-al- Majid hid the carton inside a storage room that is separate from the house. After that day's fast-breaking meal, a group from the security forces came from Amman. They headed directly for the place where the military hardware was hidden. They searched the place and seized the carton of ammunition. Afterwards, they arrested the defendant who hid the carton. Full security procedures on the incident were taken. 'Abd-al-Majid confessed the entire story without any pressure and in the presence of many witnesses. When the security forces made inquiries, the school's administration denied any knowledge of the incident and stressed that the mosque is a public place frequented by many people. The incident did not answer the following questions: How did the first defendant from al-Zarqa' manage to tell the security forces where the carton of military hardware was hidden on that same day? Doesn't this indicate that he wanted to trap Islamic institutions by taking advantage of some simple people? Why weren't the weapons hidden outdoors or in one of the defendants' houses instead of being hidden in a public place? Why does this incident come now, closely following a wave of arrests on security issues? [passage omitted on the Islamic Center Society's social works]
