FR940930-0-00130 FR940930-0-00027 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 092794A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. AGENCY: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the Aleutian Islands subarea (AI) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the allowance of the total allowable catch (TAC) of pollock for the offshore component in the AI. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), September 28, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The allowance of pollock TAC for vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the AI was established by the final 1994 initial groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and a subsequent reserve apportionment (59 FR 21673, April 26, 1994) as 34,031 metric tons (mt). The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) has determined, in accordance with ยง675.20(a)(8), that the allowance of pollock TAC for the offshore component in the AI soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director established a directed fishing allowance of 32,831 mt after determining that 1,200 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the AI. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by operators of vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the AI effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., September 28, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may befound in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under ยง675.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: September 27, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
