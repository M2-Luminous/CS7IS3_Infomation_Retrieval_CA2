Three private organisations and two departments of the Commerce Ministry are to make the calculations, so that the ministry can ensure that legitimate tapes and discs are not overpriced. The application of anti-monopoly and price-fixing powers to tapes and discs was introduced after the current crackdown on piracy was launched last April. The government has described their use as a means of preventing the exploitation of copyright protection as well as giving officials a greater ability to track down whether products currently sold are legitimate or not. By making tapes and discs controlled products, officials have more power to monitor production and trade. Speaking after a meeting on Monday on intellectual property violations, Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said the crackdown has been effective, with only a small amount of piracy remaining. He said the International Federation of Phonographic Industries (IFPI), the Record Association of Thailand, the Traders' Association of tapes and video tapes, the Internal Trade Department and the Commercial Registration Department were asked to jointly assess the production costs of music tapes, compact discs and video tapes. The outcome of the evaluation which would be reported to the meeting body at the next session, would serve as a basis for determining the fairest and most suitable prices of these products for local sale, he said. "After the Government has applied serious suppressive measures against rights violations, it was reported that the prices of music tapes, compact discs and video tapes in Bangkok have not moved up much, according to a recent price survey conducted by the Internal Trade Department in both Bangkok and other provinces," the deputy minister said. "At some places which were notorious sources for the convenient purchase of pirated products, such as along Khao San Road in Banglamphu, the rate of violations has been reported to have dropped dramatically by half. The Record Association of Thailand claimed the rate has fallen by as much as 70 percent in these places," he said. "Despite the discrepancy, these figures reveal the same satisfactory trend -- a declining rate of violations." In view of the prices of these products in the other 47 provinces nationwide, it was found that the prices of music tapes had not changed much. However, video tapes sold in Chiang Mai and Phitsanulok have moved up to 350 baht from 270 baht apiece while rental rates of the products have risen by 12-15 baht each. In Lamphun the prices of music tapes have increased from 80 to 85 baht each, while in Songkhla tape prices have risen from 60-80 baht to 85 baht apiece. These prices, however, cannot serve as a median for the fairest of prices. Therefore, the three private associations are requested to report the actual production costs for further consideration by the Commerce Ministry. "Should it turn out that the margins are unreasonably high, regulatory measures will be imposed. Such requirements may include clear marking of prices, special authorisation in the case of price-raising, or controlling retail prices altogether," Mr Churin added. During the first half of this month the Intellectual Property Department, in cooperation with the Police Department, has investigated 62 cases of piracy and sent them for trial with 14,233 pieces of products confiscated. As for the suppressive measures targeted at mail order sales of the products, the Communications Authority of Thailand has cooperated very well. A special decoy unit to detect shops selling pirated products has also been in operation.
