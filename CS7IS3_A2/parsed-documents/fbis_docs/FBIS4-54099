A command spokesman said the UN Command plans to ask North Korea, which unilaterally withdrew from the Armistice Committee recently, to hold a senior secretaries' meeting of the committee soon to discuss the issue. North Korean Army Lt. Colonel Yu Yong-chol made the notification on Tuesday morning at Panmunjom, in his capacity as chief liaison officer for the newly organized mission, when he contacted UNC Lt. Colonel R. Flury, the command reported. North Korea, however, told the command that it would maintain its telephone lines at the joint duty officers' room at Panmunjom. North Korea unilaterally withdrew its representatives from the Military Armistice Committee on April 27, demanding the Korean armistice agreement signed in 1953 be replaced by a peace accord. Pyongyang also sought the withdrawal of the Polish representative from the communist side of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.
