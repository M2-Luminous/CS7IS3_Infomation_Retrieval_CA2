The total number of patients receiving treatment for hepatitis A symptoms this morning was 380. The range of food stuffs under suspicion is narrowing, epidemiologists says. The contagion is no longer thought to have originated from Kosice's water, dairies, bakeries, or from poultry, meat or fish producers. Public health officials are, however, examining produce sold at market. They will not yet name the producers under suspicion for fear of unjustly harming their trade. In view of the rapid spread of epidemic the City Council closed all primary and secondary schools on December 15.
