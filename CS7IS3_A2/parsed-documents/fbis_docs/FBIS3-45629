"The Chinese Communists are aggressively building up their arsenals and have never renounced their intent on the use of force against Taiwan," Chien said in an interview carried in the weekly's Jan. 22 issue released Thursday [20 January]. Beijing's unwillingness to renounce military action against Taiwan provides the rationale for Taipei's continued need of a strong deterrent capability, Chien noted. He also pointed out that Beijing's constant suppression of the ROC's international activities and its attempt to stop the world community from selling defensive weapons to Taiwan have pushed many Taiwan residents to lean more and more towards a total break in relations with the mainland. "The Chinese Communist regime has since its inception gone all out to suppress and squeeze US out of the international community," Chien said. "Ever since we declared our intention to participate in the United Nations, Beijing has become even more adamant in its attempts to downgrade our status and evade reality." Chien stressed that the ROC Government will dedicate all its efforts to expand room for diplomatic maneuver and build up friendly support in the international community. "We will also, in coordination with our mainland policy, urge the Chinese Communists to squarely face the objective fact that the nation is divided and ruled by two different governments, and that we must support each other in the international arena while working together for reunification," Chien noted. Prior to national reunification, Chien said, the basic rights of the 20.8 million ROC citizens should not be ignored. He said the ROC has launched a campaign to end its long stretch of international isolation. Key elements of this drive include efforts to gain membership to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the United Nations and the ASEAN regional forum. Chien further pointed out that Beijing's staunch opposition to the political reforms package brought out by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten clearly shows that the Chinese Communists will not allow Hong Kong people to enjoy full political freedom after 1997. "Therefore we firmly believe that Beijing's `One Country, Two Systems' policy towards Hong Kong should never be carried out here, nor should such a policy ever be taken as the model for China's reunification," Chien added.
