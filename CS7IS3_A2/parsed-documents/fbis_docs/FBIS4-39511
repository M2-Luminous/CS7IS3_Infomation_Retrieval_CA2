The plane en route to Tbilisi and Baku to deliver supplies for American diplomats in Georgia and Azerbaijan violated Russia's airspace and was landed at Sochi's Adler airport at 14:37 on Tuesday. Three hours later, at 17:46, when the incident was settled the plane continued the flight. "Before we had direct telephone lines with all nearest district centres and such an incident could have been settled much faster," Vyacheslav Isayev, duty officer of Sochi's airport, said. "There are no flights from Adler to Sukhumi (capital of Abkhazia) -- neither civil nor military. There is no communication. It is extremely hard to work in such conditions," he said.
