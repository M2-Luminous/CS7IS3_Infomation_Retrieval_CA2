The statement blamed the disturbances on the worsening economic situation with a pack of sugar selling for 13 Iraqi dinars. Rioting was said to have erupted during the distribution of chickens to fill quotas in the city of al-Fallujah in al-Anbar Governorate. Protestors raised placards calling for the overthrow of Saddam Husayn's regime. Forces of the regime cordoned off the market and a number of demonstrators were taken into custody. The statement also disclosed that the Baghdad regime is working on the formation of three military corps, whose recruits will be drawn from "the friends", and which will be incorporated into the Republican Guard. The statement noted that in the application forms the candidates were handed, the question asking whether they wished to join the corps was worded to elicit a yes or no response. This was intended to circumvent a UN Security Council resolution banning the addition of fresh military units to the Iraqi Armed Forces. Iraqis are, however, still herded into compulsory military service, the statement notes. The statement emphasized that special training camps, where entrants are to receive military instruction, are being prepared in Mosul, Nahrawan, and al-Kut. The exact locations are secret and off limits, save for the trainees.
