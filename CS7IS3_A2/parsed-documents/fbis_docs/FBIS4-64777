FBIS4-64777 "drweu089_e_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-089 Daily Report 8 May 1994 UNITED KINGDOM Evacuation Planned 9 May Evacuation Planned 9 May LD0805174494 London PRESS ASSOCIATION in English 1729 GMT 8 May 94 LD0805174494 London PRESS ASSOCIATION English BFN [By Heather Tyrrell, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] [Text] The Foreign Office is planning to evacuate around 150 Britons from the capital of war-ravaged Yemen on a civilian airliner tomorrow -- if fighting allows. The final go-ahead for a British Airways [BA] plane will be based on a "minute-by-minute" assessment of the safety by British diplomatic staff in the capital Sanaa, said a Foreign Office spokesman. If it is not deemed safe, military planes will be sent in later to evacuate them, he said. Around 700 Britons remain in the Arab country, five days into the civil war, and around 150 of them want to leave, he said. Some 100 Britons have already left the country -- many helped by the French navy or the U.S. airforce to the safety of Djibouti or Riyadh, where they have caught flights home to the UK. Scores arrived back today and spoke of land and air battles between Marxists in the south and the conservative and tribal North, which have included Scud missile attacks. One evacuee told BBC News: "I went out on to the balcony and saw flashes of light and explosions coming up from the airport and it was at that point that I thought: `This is it.'" Another said: "We were in a compound not 100 yards from the airport and there were bullets flying all over the place." A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are hoping to get a British Airways [BA] flight in tomorrow but we will not know until hours before -- we will do a minute-by-minute assessment from our Embassy. It is our hope and our intention to try and get one. If that fails, we will have to revert to a military option." Hercules transport planes from RAF Lyneham are available if necessary. The airport in Sanaa has been effectively closed, but attacks seem to quieten during daylight hours, and banks, businesses, schools and restaurants in the city are open. A BA spokesman has said that the airline has a plane on stand-by and is waiting for the go-ahead from the Foreign Office. "We would need assurances from the Foreign Office that it is safe to fly in and fly out," he said. The flight would pick up the remaining Britons who wanted to leave, and the 14-member crew of a British Airways DC-10 who flew into Sanaa last Tuesday [3 May]. Evacuee Wendy Carlick, 38, of Wickham Market, Suffolk, was critical of the lack of a British evacuation when she flew into Heathrow today, leaving her husband Brian, 44, behind in Yemen. She was accepted on one of four U.S. military flights from Sanaa to Saudi Arabia, after spending two nights in the basement of the home of her husband's boss at the communications firm Cable and Wireless. She was joined by evacuee Mrs. Kim Lee, of Plymouth, Devon, and her two children Andrew, four, and Thomas, seven today, the family of her husband's work colleague. "The British Embassy has not done a thing to help us. Kim's husband David took it upon himself to do something and said if there's going to be an evacuation, we should try and get on it," said Mrs. Carlick. "If the United States could do it, why couldn't the British? Even if there was not going to be any more danger, there has been enough. Their feeling was `Let's wait and see for 24 hours.' Our feeling was: `Get out as soon as you can while the runway is still OK.'" She was among the last 10 to be accepted on the flight, she said. The first they had known about the civil war was at dawn on Thursday, she said. "Three jets came over extremely low and dropped three bombs. We heard the jets, the bombs and immediately the anti-aircraft missiles going off. We were terrified. Me and my husband crawled along the floor and hid under the stairs. We live opposite a military base so the bullets were very close. They went on for half an hour. We decided to go to our general manager's house who had a big basement and for two days we made home there." Sanaa now had no power, water or petrol, she said. At home now with her daughter Tammy, 18, and son Matthew, 16, Mrs. Carlick said: "I am relieved to be here but still very, very anxious."
