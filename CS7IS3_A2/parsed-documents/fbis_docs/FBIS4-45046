The slogan "development" can be heard on the lips of every real person and legal entity at every social level and class. Although the descriptions are not that similar between the various economic, social and cultural levels as discussed by various people, but all the speakers and theorists acknowledge the point that specialist manpower plays a basic and fateful role in designing and advancing development programs. There is no doubt that the first step in the training of specialist manpower is recognizing the existing gaps and the nation's specialist needs, and then guiding the educational system to meet these needs. Thus, there is also the need to send students outside the country to study and gain skills and academic knowledge at higher levels that are compatible and appropriate for the nation's specialist needs. Otherwise, spending significant amounts of foreign exchange to send students abroad will have no result other than to waste the nation's capital. On the other hand, in fairness, a student who has passed the difficult stages of admission, testing, and selection and goes abroad to study will face many problems, despite having special resources not available to his peers. The headaches facing the Iranian student abroad include lack of familiarity with the system for registration and teaching at foreign universities, the difference between his own culture and that of the foreign culture, separation from family and friends, the timely arrival of foreign exchange stipends, problems with housing and settlement, unpleasant treatment by some professors at foreign universities, obstacles to spouse employment and problems educating children. Add to these things the requirement that scholarship students not work abroad, not being aware of events in the country, especially the academic and technical issues, and the weak connections Iran's educational and research centers have with those things, which are a problem because the Iranian student usually wants to write his graduate dissertation on a subject needed by his country. However, when his repeated letters to the domestic organizations to gain familiarity with Iran's research priorities go unanswered, it is not clear what will happen to his motivation to serve his country. In this report, KEYHAN-E HAVA'I will raise the questions and discuss the problems of Iranian students abroad, who make up a significant portion of its readership, and give answers from the relevant officials. Along with that, it will present the views of the experts on how to prepare a statement of procedures for sending students abroad. In preparing this report, we have sought to understand the problems of students and to discuss them with officials. Because the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education and the Ministry of Health Care, Treatment and Medical Education are in charge of sending Iranian students abroad, we will begin with them. The Ministry of Culture and Higher Education accepted our invitation with some hesitation and reluctance. However, KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's insistence on the need to study and discuss the problems of students abroad ultimately led to a conversation with Dr. 'Abdollah Afshar, general manager of scholarships and students abroad. He said the reason for this delay was the huge volume of current activity. In any case, however, during the interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's correspondent he willingly listened to an account of the study and living problems of students and finding a logical solution for them, and this spirit is praiseworthy in its own right. However, with regard to the Ministry of Health Care, Treatment and Medical Education, which is in charge of sending students abroad who study in the medical sciences, none of the interview formats proposed was accepted, whether in writing, in person or orally, and repeated telephone contacts to pursue these things got nowhere. Ultimately KEYHAN-E HAVA'I was unable to persuade this ministry's relevant officials that answering questions from the students under their mantle is a responsibility of theirs and a requirement for the successful performance of their duties. In the hallways of the second floor of the building of the Office of Scholarships and Students, you see a number of applicants with papers and documents who are either going from one room to another or waiting outside closed doors. This story is repeated here every day. It is a tale of minds filled with questions, hearts trembling with anxiety and eyes filled with hope and expectation. Sometimes an individual becomes offended with the repeated fruitless coming and going, forgets about being patient, and fills the hallways with his cries for all to hear. In the office of Ms. 'A., an angry man with a disturbed face addresses her sitting behind her desk. She repeats her daily experience--being silent and giving clients an opportunity to express their anger. He says: Madam! What is my brother to do, empty-handed in a foreign country? You sent him, you must also pay his expenses. Must I abandon my work and my life for several days and go up and down the stairways in this building to get someone to listen to me, to get an official to take the trouble to listen to me and believe me? When this man's rage gradually subsides, who is concerned about the fate of his brother living far outside the country, the experienced staff worker explains: Your brother changed his major without getting authorization, and according to regulations, the result of doing this is a cut-off of the regular foreign exchange stipend. The man, now speaking in a milder and humbler tone, answers: Dr. ...is familiar with the situation. In the university where he was accepted, this major is not taught. The foreign professor did not cooperate with my brother. He was forced... Before he finishes, Ms. 'A. interrupts him imperiously: In any case, your problem concerns Mr. S. In Dr. A's office, an agitated woman frantically tries to persuade Dr. A's secretary to permit her to see him for just two minutes. The secretary lady explains to her that client meetings with the doctor are absolutely impossible without a written recommendation from one of his assistants. Apart from this, your husband's file must be studied in the council. The answer is this: Dear lady, the file is in the council. Our problem will be solved with just one signature. My husband has been waiting for the council's answer in Canada for two months now. He calls me every day wanting to know what has happened. For the last 15 days I have been wasting my time morning and afternoon in this office. I do not even have that much time to submit my own final master's degree letter. We ask her, what is your problem? She says: My husband was accepted in the examination to be sent for the doctoral program in chemistry in Canada, but because of a delay sending him, the deadline passed for registration at the intended university, and if he is to wait until the next registration period, he will be delayed until next September (Shahrivar [23 August-22 September]). After two months, however, the relevant council still has not issued authorization for him to change universities. Then she immediately asks: Aren't higher education officials concerned about the budget money that will have to be spent through next September to support my husband in Canada for no reason? Here, one person is complaining about receiving foreign exchange without studying, another is complaining because he has no money to study! Failure of Foreign Exchange Stipends To Arrive on Time; Student Worries Dr 'Abdollah Afshar, the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education's general manager of scholarships for students outside the country, was asked about the fact that the failure of foreign exchange stipends to arrive on time sometimes brings students to the brink of expulsion from the university, and how long this problem will continue to plague the students. He said: We know that students are under pressure because of this, and perhaps 80 percent of the worries of students living outside the country have to do with the fact that their study expenses do not arrive on time. However, due to the complex mechanism and the crippling bureaucracy in higher education, there is not that much room to maneuver to change the existing situation, even though 20 percent of the time this problem may arise for students due to malfunctions in this ministry. Most of the problems, however, have to do with other organizations such as the Central Bank, the Plan and Budget Organization, the postal system, the foreign banks, and other organizations. For example, at the beginning of the year 1373 [21 March 1994] we were supposed to send a six-month foreign exchange stipend to the students, but it takes about three months for the budget guidelines for doing this to reach us and the Central Bank, and until these guidelines are given to the Central Bank, the banks will not be authorized to pay the foreign exchange. Dr. Afshar discussed the solution adopted to make up for this three-month delay procuring the needed foreign exchange. He said: We have selected a definite solution to the students' problem. We have allocated $1 million in emergency funds to the six student supervisory offices outside the country (Australia, England, Russia, France, Canada, and India). We have told the supervisory offices that they may solve the students' financial problems temporarily by paying them funds until the foreign exchange stipends are procured, and these funds will be deposited in the account of the supervisory offices to replenish the emergency fund. In practice, however, this insignificant emergency fund will not solve the problem of 2,900 scholarship students and 800 students receiving foreign exchange.

He said: A study report approved by the relevant supervisory office is examined by the ministry's academic consultants, and if the academic level is acceptable and if the documents are complete, a foreign exchange letter is issued and sent to the ministry's financial affairs office. Despite maximum effort by the departments involved in the ministry to issue the foreign exchange letter for the students in the shortest time possible, continuation of the task is the responsibility of other government organizations. The general manager of scholarships and students discussed the foreign exchange letter's movement through the administrative pipeline in organizations outside the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education. He said: One of our biggest problems is the slowness of student foreign exchange procurement in the banking system and the fate of many foreign exchange letters is tied to the volume of the work and the accumulation of current work in the draft-issuing branch of the bank. He said the delay of foreign exchange drafts in foreign banks is another factor in the foreign exchange reaching students late. He added: In many cases significant amounts of foreign exchange written as drafts for Iranian students remain in foreign banks for two to three months and reach the students after significant delays. One Student Living Abroad--20 Students Inside the Country With a thumbnail count and an accounting of the wages of professors and current expenses in Iran's universities, we come to the conclusion that the educational expenses of each doctoral student inside the country is one-twentieth that of a student abroad at this level. That is, with the budget that the government spends for the education of a doctoral scholarship student outside the country, one could cover 20 students inside the country. Based on the same calculations one can say that the living expenses of a student with spouse and children added to the university tuition, airline ticket, and other educational expenses of a student in a country such as America, Canada, or England at the doctoral level averages more than 20 million tumans. If this sum were put into the bank as a fixed deposit, its profits would permit the hiring of three university professors with monthly salaries of 80,000 tumans. In the interview with Dr. Afshar we also estimated the doctoral expenses at universities abroad and compared that with domestic costs. We reached the same conclusion, that the cost of going through a doctoral program outside the country is about 20 million tumans, and the same program inside the country is 1 million tumans. Concerning the enormous cost to the government of study abroad, Dr. Afshar said: We pay the tuition at foreign universities separately. In addition to that, in many cases we also assume the cost for the equipment and laboratory supplies the Iranian students use in the university laboratory, as well as student research expenses. Also on the expense row for students studying abroad is the annual payment of about $200 to $300 to buy books, as well as some money for student insurance. Due to the requirement of marriage, the foreign exchange stipend for a student includes the student's living expenses in addition to 60 percent additional for a spouse and 30 percent more for each child (up to three children), and all of these expenditures will be paid as of the beginning of the year 1373 [21 March 1994] based on 1,750 rials [R] per dollar. This sudden leap in the foreign exchange rate from R70 to R1,750 has brought great pressure on the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education. For example, a student residing in london, having three children, will receive a monthly stipend of 350 pounds, based on each pound being equal to 2,640 rials, will receive R2.310 million per month in stipends alone (or 231,000 tumans), and this is only part of the expenses of students living abroad. The expenses also include tuition, research, laboratory supplies, book budget, student insurance and round trip transportation. If we multiply these expenses by 2,900 scholarship students and 800 students receiving foreign exchange, we arrive at astronomical figures, which bear no relationship to the amounts committed and submitted as security deposits by the scholarship students. For this reason, under Note 40 of the current year's Budget Law, we must transfer some of them to the nation's domestic universities and for the others whose studies are about to be completed, we must convert their deposits and commitments. Note 40 of the 1373 Budget Law says: Authorization is given to the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education and the Ministry of Health Care, Treatment and Medical Education to transfer students receiving foreign exchange to domestic universities and institutions of higher education and to take the rial equivalents of the foreign exchange funds allocated each year to each student for tuition. The equivalent of the foreign exchange mentioned in this paragraph at R1,750 will be given to the relevant universities and institutions of higher learning. Sending Abroad Only for Doctoral Programs With a look at the statistical tables on the distribution of those admitted in masters and professional and specialist doctoral programs in universities inside the country, it becomes evident that admissions of students at the graduate levels have increased in recent years. Based on statistics provided by the Statistics Center of the Higher Education Research and Planning Institute, in the 1363-1364 [1984-1985] academic year, a total of 3,356 people was admitted in the masters and professional and specialist doctoral programs in the country's domestic universities and centers of higher education. Admissions of students for final studies in the 1370-1371 [1991-1992] academic year rose to 8,137 people in the six academic groups of medicine, humanities, basic sciences, technical and engineering, agriculture and animal husbandry and art and architecture, and this figure shows growth of about 110 percent. In view of the daily, increasing capabilities of the nation's domestic educational system, the basic question is, is the need to send students abroad still felt with the same with depth and intensity as in the past, or has this feeling begun to subside? Based on all the studies we have obtained in the course of preparing this report, the nation's experts and executive officials are leaning towards reducing the number of students sent abroad. This inclination becomes stronger each day for three major reasons: 1 - The heavy financial burden and the enormous budget required to send students abroad in the wake of the unification of the foreign exchange rate. 2 - Improved quality and increased capacity of the system of higher education inside the country. 3 - The undesirable consequences of the outrageous cultural difference between Iran and the host countries, especially in view of the fact that the requirement of marriage for sending a student abroad has caused the young children of Iranian students to be exposed to the bad effects of this cultural difference. Mohammad 'Ali Ramin has a masters degree in general mechanics. He recently completed his studies in Germany and returned to the country. He hesitantly evaluates the success of sending students outside the country. He says: Western culture, in proportion to the moral and behavioral capacity and assets of students, has negative moral effects on them. Therefore, in selecting scholarship students the greatest care and careful observation must be employed so that people will go abroad to continue their studies who have sufficient awareness and ability to face the cultural dangers. He advises students being sent abroad to take a comprehensive approach to studying abroad, to try to benefit from all the academic and research dimensions of the universities, and to avoid taking a one-sided, one-dimensional and limited view of things. He said it is undesirable for the student to get into a rut without being aware of the various aspects of an issue, and that the doing so is merely a quest for credentials, rather than knowledge. He added: In Iran the whole goal of sending students abroad can be summarized in one idea, and that is to procure faculty for universities. Some of Iran's students put all their effort and energy abroad into getting credentials, because they know beforehand that when they return there is a professor's chair waiting for them and that they will have to teach, rather than do research and experiments. Explaining his views, he said: If higher education is not related to the nation's various sectors, which are involved in work and applications, especially the industrial ministries, and if the student is not made to understand that he is being sent abroad to solve the problems of industry and to find the missing links in the production chain, the student will not benefit from his efforts or enjoy the fruits of the privations of exile, nor will the country benefit from his knowledge. Consequently, the costs and energy expended for this purpose will be wasted. We discussed this idea with Dr. Afshar. He said: In the goals for sending students abroad, priority goes to completing the faculties at universities. The universities under the mantle of the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education convey their academic needs to the ministry (the deputy minister for education) and the Student Evaluation Organization conducts the examination for sending students abroad with the country's needs in mind. We asked Dr. Afshar how the need for specialist and skilled manpower is met in the industrial and agricultural sectors, although we knew that the responsibility for answering this question is not with the General Office of Student Scholarships. However, we found it useful to ask this of Dr. Afshar because of his university teaching background and his executive responsibility's connection with the subject. He answered: Unfortunately there is the problem that there is no one body responsible for planning to meet the entire nation's specialist needs. The current procedure is that each organization and ministry estimates its needs, which may be exactly the same as the needs of another organization, and this estimate becomes the criterion for the work of the Evaluation Organization in selecting students. Sometimes some bodies and offices illegally send a scholarship student abroad directly after choosing people from among their employees, although the Law on Sending Students Abroad requires all ministries and bodies to do this only through the channel of the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education. Dr. Afshar discussed the negative consequences of the lack of a central committee or council to plan for sending students abroad and make decisions about all the nation's academic needs. He said: The consequence of the lack of centralization in identifying needs and existing gaps in the country is that we send so many students in some fields that we become saturated and have no labor market for them. On the other hand, we forget about some essential fields. In some cases we also send students abroad (based on the announced needs of the ministries) when there is sufficient ability and resources inside the country for their education in that field. The general manager of scholarships and students abroad presented statistics on students sent abroad in the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] based on the various educational groups. He said: Of the 600 people we sent abroad last year, 271 were admitted in the technical and engineering sciences, 131 in the basic sciences, 73 in agriculture, and 125 in the humanities, arts and architecture. He added: According to the plan, last year we were to have sent 900 people abroad. However, after the establishment of higher level programs inside the country in many university fields, we transferred 300 of the ones admitted to domestic universities, and they also welcomed this decision. He mentioned Canada, England, Australia, Russia, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, India, Germany, New Zealand, and Belgium as countries admitting students sent abroad in 1372 to their universities. Dr. Afshar discussed the procedure for selecting the country and the college and making the final designation of the field of study, academic concentration and the facilities created in this regard to send students abroad. He said: After the admitted students take language examinations and achieve the minimum scores, the students are sent to the Academic Consulting Center. He discussed the history of the formation and the responsibilities of the Academic Consulting Center. He said: The members of this center, who began their work about two years ago, are chosen from university professors and graduates in various fields from various countries in the world, so that in addition to having sufficient specialist knowledge to identify the specialist tendencies in the academic fields, they will have sufficient familiarity with foreign universities and their academic level so they can give all the needed information to the student. Dr. Afshar discussed the criteria used to select foreign universities from which to obtain admission. He said: The academic consultants have two criteria for selecting a university: First is the academic level and the quality of teaching, and the second is the extent of concentration of Iranian students at the university. Based on Dr. Afshar's comments, attention to the extent of concentration of Iranian students at the target university is important because a concentration of students of one nationality in a class creates an unbalanced atmosphere in the class and it is highly likely that side issues such as political matters will have a negative effect on the mastery of the subject by students of the majority nationality. Change of University, Major, or Academic Concentration Prohibited Opposite the Office of Guidance Experts Asian Department, we spoke with a woman who was waiting for authorization for a 40-percent airline ticket discount for her brother's permanent return from India. She discussed her brother's study situation. She said: He went to India to continue his studies after receiving his high school diploma in 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985] (before the enactment of the Law on Sending Students Abroad). After the enactment of the Law on Sending Students Abroad, he submitted commitments to the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education and sent his academic performance report and was grouped with the students receiving foreign exchange. After receiving his bachelor's degree in chemistry, he changed his major and took up the study of pharmacology. When he completed his bachelor's degree in pharmacology, he decided to return to the country after living in India for 10 years, due to the fact that his foreign exchange ration was cut off. When I said good-bye to that lady I wished her brother success in using his academic knowledge to serve the country, but I asked myself if it would not have been possible to obtain bachelor's degrees in chemistry and pharmacology inside the country, instead of this dear compatriot spending 10 years of his life away from his family and his motherland, spending enormous amounts of foreign exchange during that time. Here I did not think it was that fair of the woman to complain that her brother's study foreign exchange was cut off after he completed his bachelor's degree in pharmacology and he was forced to abandon his studies, because in Iran every year hundreds of participants in the national university admissions examinations are (continuously) admitted at various levels in the field of chemistry and in pharmacology doctoral programs. On the other hand, changing one's major from chemistry to pharmacology raises the question, wouldn't it be better if the students being sent abroad made a final decision before going about their future employment and study? Perhaps in answer to this very question, the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education set strict regulations prohibiting scholarship students from changing their university or major. It will no doubt be useful and enlightening to mention some of these regulations for Iranian students living outside the country: Permission to change the previously chosen university outside the country will not be given except in exceptional circumstances. The Ministry of Culture and Higher Education absolutely will not agree to changes in majors or academic concentration, because the country is in need of that same designated major and concentration. The scholarship student may not change his host country under any circumstances. The maximum period designated for the student's residence outside the country may not be extended except in special circumstances, with the agreement of the relevant supervisor and the approval of the Foreign Exchange Council. The subject of the thesis of students in the humanities must be chosen from among issues specifically pertaining to Iran. Theses: Solutions to Problems, or Useless? Now that the subject of regulations on theses in the humanities has been raised, it is not a bad idea for us to seek the views of a number of graduates of foreign universities. Dr. Hoseyn Gharibi, chief of the National Center for Documents and Academic Credentials, who studied in England, recommended a kind of balance and two-sided policy. He said: The view that the subjects of all graduation theses of students studying abroad must be determined from within the country and there should be no freedom for students living outside the country is of questionable benefit to the country, because on the one hand we need the new techniques and on the other hand we want new technology to determine the country's needs. Continuing, Dr. Gharibi discussed some of the consequences of requiring students to choose their subjects domestically. He said: One of the things a student living outside the country needs to do research on domestic subjects is statistics and information from Iran. In view of the fact that the student is working under the supervision of a foreign professor, sometimes it is not in our interest to send information about the country without controls. According to Dr. Gharibi, great care and delicacy must be exercised in sending out information for research to be done outside the country and using the views of a foreign professor concerning domestic subjects. In this regard Dr. Afshar explained that up until six months ago, the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education had no restrictions on theses. He said: After studying the theses of students living outside the country we concluded that much of the research, especially in the humanities, not only has no benefit of any kind for Iran, but also the situation is such that the theses are prepared with Iran's financial support and information and then, because they have nothing to do with the nation's domestic issues, are presented to the foreigners on a silver platter. While Dr. Afshar was talking about submitting Iranian student theses to foreigners, I remembered a friend's account of his memories of studying in a foreign country. He said: An Iranian student in my class studying library science wrote his thesis on how foreign students can better make use of the library's academic resources...in that country. However scientific, useful and new they may be, the results of this research will help only those who go to that library in that same country, and such research does not solve any of the problems of the thousands of book lovers and seekers of knowledge inside the country. Reciprocal Expectations Just as the officials expect, Iranian students take their country's priorities into account when choosing the areas of their research. Graduate students outside the country also expect not to have problems getting their academic credentials accepted inside the country. One of those reporting to the Office of Student Scholarships said that he took the examination to be sent abroad for the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990], with a bachelor's degree in physics from the Tehran Teacher Training College, and passed it successfully. He said: I began studying for a master's degree outside the country in the field the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education selected, and after that I went through the doctoral program with the academic concentration chosen by the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education's consultants. Now, however, after returning, this ministry's Office of Graduates refuses to accept my academic credentials. He asked unhappily: Why is there no coordination among the offices affiliated with a single ministry? Why are they saying the credentials in the field they themselves chose for me are not accredited? We asked Dr. Afshar the reason for this lack of coordination. He confirmed the existence of this malfunction and said the reason is the adoption of separate and individual policies by two general offices affiliated with the ministry. He gave the good news, however, that with the formation of the Scholarships and Foreign Exchange Council, which has decisionmakers from both offices as its members, this lack of coordination will go away. He added: The members of the Scholarships and Foreign Exchange Council identify and designate accredited and acceptable universities, and on this basis students are sent only to countries where the academic credentials of their universities are accredited with the Office of Graduates. The formation of the Scholarships and Foreign Exchange Council to coordinate the designation of fields of study and the evaluation of academic credentials is praiseworthy, but it appears quite necessary that a council be formed to coordinate the sending of students with the missing links in the chain of production aimed at self-sufficiency. This is an important and fateful step upon which Dr. Afshar insisted in his interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I. It is a step that could take us to a place where in the nation's Five-Year Plan we could design a model organization made up of the needed experts, and we could send students abroad to fill the empty slots in this model organization.
