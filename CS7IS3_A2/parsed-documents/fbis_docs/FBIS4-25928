This March, the Korean nuclear issue, which had been going in a positive direction, began to take a sudden change due to the differences in views between the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the DPRK regarding the replacement of fuel rods. On 10 June, the IAEA decided to suspend its plan for technological coordination with the DPRK on investigating plutonium and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. On the other hand, the DPRK side announced its decision to immediately withdraw from the IAEA. Carrying out busy activities inside and outside the United Nations, the United States hopes that the UN Security Council will impose sanctions against the DPRK. People have not forgotten that the United States repeatedly [words indistinct] for this purpose. However, the U.S. assertion failed to win recognition from the international community. Many in U.S. political and social circles disagree this view. The Chinese delegation [to the United Nations] persistently opposed dealing with the Korean nuclear issue at the UN Security Council. It also opposed UN Security Council moves to adopt a resolution, including sanctions, regarding the issue. The Chinese delegation repeatedly indicated that the United States, the IAEA, the DPRK, the ROK should remove differences in opinion and solve problems through dialogue and negotiations. The Chinese delegation also indicated that threat, blackmail, and pressure would not help solve problems, but would bring about destructive consequences because they may intensify conflict. Based on such principles, when the chairman of the UN Security Council announced a statement regarding the Korean nuclear issue, the Chinese delegation, in view of the contemporary specific situation and proceeding from its constructive attitude, immediately clarified the Chinese Government's position toward the issue and expressed the hope that parties concerned should continue negotiations to seek reasonable ways for solving the issue. Facts prove that (?a series of negotiations) for solving the Korean nuclear issue, though faced with many difficulities, have eventually developed gradually into a positive direction. When the United States and the DPRK made a principled agreement in June last year, the DPRK side announced its suspension of the unilateral decision to withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT. As the DPRK achieved new success in negotiations with the IAEA and the United States, on 15 and 25 June of this year, respectively, inspections of nuclear facilites in the DPRK were conducted, and, accordingly, all duties were completed. Differences in views and difficulties have been created again now over the replacement of fuel rods. However, such differences in views and difficulties are only momentary. Therefore, a certain amount of room and and some possibility remains for a solution of the issue. In the Korean nuclear issue, China has persistently adhered to two basic goals, namely, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the preservation of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. This assertion has become the common recognition of the member states of the UN Security Council and won support from the international community. If relevant parties sincerely make constant efforts to acheive these two goals, they can remove differences in their views gradually and achieve mutual understanding. The most important thing at the present time is that relevant parties assume a prudent and patient attitude. There is a Chinese proverb which says "When one gets angry one should seek reason and when one is in danger one should observe (?decorum)." If one clings to sanctions and pressure tenaciously and uses rash threat by force of arms simply because of momentary (?difficulties), the positive success achieved in the negotiations of the (?three parties) will end in failure and tension will be aggravated again. The international community does not want to see the consequences that may result from closing the door of negotiations and will not accept them. The aggravation of the situation on the Korean peninsula will not only create a great shock in the Northeast Asian region, but also pose a threat to world peace and stability. The problem is very grave. Therefore, the parties concerned should prudently ponder over it and [words indistinct]. Sanctions and threat are, in actuality, of no use, and sincere and patient negotiations are the most reasonable measure. Dialogue is better than confrontation.
