FR940406-1-00061 FR940406-1-00017 48 CFR Part 31 [FAR Case 92&hyph;604] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Nonallowability of Excise Taxes on Nondeductible Contributions To Deferred Compensation Plans agencies: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). action: Proposed rule. summary: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to revise the cost principle concerning taxes. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993. dates: Comments should be submitted on or before June 6, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. addresses: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW, room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;604 in all correspondence related to this case. for further information contact: Jeremy F. Olson at (202) 501&hyph;3221 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite Far case 92&hyph;604. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Under the current FAR 31.205&hyph;41(b)(6), excise taxes on accumulated funding deficiencies or prohibited transactions involving employee deferred compensation plans pursuant to sections 4971 and 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, are unallowable. This reflects a long-standing Government policy that punitive-type excise taxes are not reimbursable costs on Government contracts. Over the years, subsequent legislation has added several new excise taxes to subtitle D, chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Service Code such that the Code currently lists 13 such taxes. The Councils have agreed that it is appropriate to revise FAR 31.205&hyph;41(b)(6) to insert a general prohibition on all excise taxes found at subtitle D, chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Service Code. Such a general prohibition will ensure that future legislative changes to subtitle D, chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Service Code will be automatically reflected in the cost principle. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles do not apply. An analysis of data available for fiscal years 1989 through 1991 reveals that, in the Department of Defense, the number of contract actions awarded to small businesses which required the submission of cost or pricing data averaged less than 1 percent of the total number of small business actions during the three-year period. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 92&hyph;604), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.
