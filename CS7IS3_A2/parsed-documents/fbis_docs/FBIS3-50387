The Presidency examined and adopted the report by President Alija Izetbegovic on his visit to Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. Examining the situation regarding peace negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Presidency supported the initiative for holding a Security Council session that would discuss the situation in our country. If such a session does take place, the Presidency assumes that the Security Council will reaffirm all its resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina adopted so far as well as the London Conference decisions. Mutual recognition of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro is being proposed, considering this to be a way to make a new contribution to solving the crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The report by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Army General Rasim Delic, commander of the General Staff of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the talks at Sarajevo airport was also adopted at today's session. Discussing the situation in the Bosnian Krajina, the Presidency decided to consider the initiative of a large number of former supporters of Fikret Abdic and to adopt an ordinance with legal power about an amnesty. According to this ordinance, no criminal prosecution will be instigated against members of Fikret Abdic's paramilitary formations, as well as members of parastate organs of the so-called Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia, who report to the legal organs of power of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina by 10 February. Regarding the crime in Zenica on which occasion a UNHCR member, a British citizen, was killed, the Presidency expresses its condolences and the resolution to have the people who committed this crime found and punished. Consent was given for the ambassadors of the Kingdom of Sweden, the Republic of Austria, and the Republic of Albania to the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Presidency adopted the decision on the election and release of a number of people holding posts in the judiciary.
