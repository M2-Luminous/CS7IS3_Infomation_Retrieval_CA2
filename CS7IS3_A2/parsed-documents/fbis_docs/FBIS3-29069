But Patten said that since he didn't come to Australia seeking Keating's support, he was not disappointed he did not receive it and was delighted with what he described as "an extremely satisfactory meeting." Talks lasting 75 minutes at the prime minister's official residence in Sydney ranged over bilateral trade links, regional issues such as the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) group and Hong Kong's future after the British colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Patten, who is on a six-day official visit at Keating's invitation, told reporters his visit was aimed primarily at persuading even more Australian businesses to use Hong Kong as a springboard to China. [passage omitted] Keating has never denied reports that he told Chinese Premier Li Peng in Beijing last June that Australia did not support Patten's push for greater democracy in Hong Kong. "Australia is not particularly impressed with Patten's modus operandi or his taking an interest in Hong Kong's political situation so late in the peace," Keating reportedly said. However, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans subsequently told parliament that Australia had consistently expressed to both China and Britain its "support for democratic reform" consistent with the terms of the 1984 Sino-British declaration paving the way for Hong Kong's handback in 1997. [passage omitted] An Australian government official said later that the meeting had focused on the importance of economic links, but he did not know if Keating had privately endorsed Britain's position. "The Prime Minister underlined the importance to Australia of Hong Kong's continuing prosperity and stability in the transition to Chinese sovereignty in 1997," the official said.
