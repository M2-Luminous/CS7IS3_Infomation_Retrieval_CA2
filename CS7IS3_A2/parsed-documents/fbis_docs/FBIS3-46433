Yet, in a joint press conference, neither elaborated on what the operating and management differences were. In a letter to President Bill Clinton this morning, Heymann, a Harvard law professor who headed the department's criminal division during the Carter administration, said: "The attorney general has concluded that our operational and management styles are too different for us to function fully effectively as a management team." Heymann is in charge of many of the operational functions of the department and is a key manager in coordinating operations among department agencies, such as the FBI, the drug enforcement administration and the immigration and naturalization service. The deputy attorney said he would stay on for a reasonable time so that a successor could be found. But he said he intended to return to teaching at Harvard University this summer.
