[Ucar] The operation was the most comprehensive air attack against us. Contrary to claims by the Turkish Government, Zhalah plays no role in "training and sending guerrillas to Turkey." The reason for exaggerating the importance of the Zhalah camp, which has a role of its own, is the impasse in the war. The aim is to create the impression that our struggle does not come from inside Turkey, but from abroad. That is why they decided to attack. Another factor in this attack is the new alliance forged between Turkey and Israel. This is an alliance forged by the forces of reaction in the Middle East. This attack is also a sign that Turkey has become a dangerous factor in the Middle East and that if need be it could attack the peoples of the Middle East with the support of imperialist and reactionary forces. We knew of the possibility of attack at any time, motivated by the ill-temper bred by war. So we took additional measures a few days before the raid. Our forces were constantly alert and always ready. The raid started at 0900. As reported, some 50 planes took part. The second raid came at 1400. This attack too lasted 45 minutes. With this attack, the Turkish Republic showed that it represents a threat, not only to our struggle, but to the entire Kurdish people. While attacking our positions, they did not forget to attack our people in southern Iraq and eastern Iran. Seven people were killed and seven others were wounded on our side. Four villages were bombed in east Kurdistan. There were nine to 10 dead and over 20 wounded. Some 50 animals were destroyed. They attacked every living thing in the region. Two villages were attacked in south Kurdistan, where five people were killed. Material damage was also caused to the villages in south Kurdistan. Claims that "an ammunition dump was blown up" are not correct. The smoke arose from our five to 10 barrels of fuel. Some of our tents were destroyed by shrapnel. Normal activity is continuing in the camp. [Avsar] Is it true that the leaders' headquarters and communications room were destroyed? [Ucar] Our radio broadcasts and wireless communications are continuing uninterrupted. As for the destruction of leading cadres: The Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] leading cadres never stay together in the same region or spot. They are in areas were fighting is taking place. Besides, the PKK's leading cadres exist in every locality where we are active. [Avsar] What was the reaction of the people of south Kurdistan against the operation? [Ucar] This is an important issue. Our people around the camp in south Kurdistan acted with intense dedication. They acted in a spirit of national unity and solidarity. The people of south Kurdistan acted in great solidarity fearing that many of our people might have been hurt. Some 5,000 people gathered in front of the hospital, where our wounded were taken, to give blood. Soon after the attack, a convoy arrived to carry our wounded and martyrs. This attack once more proved that the more the Kurdish people are attacked, the greater the unity and solidarity that will be forged. [Avsar] Why was Zhalah selected for the raid? Did Zhalah take the place of al-Biqa'? [Ucar] As you know, the Turkish Government came to office making great promises. Intense psychological propaganda was launched: "We will crush the PKK. We will wipe out the PKK by March 1994." All the tools in the hands of the special warfare -- including the press, General Staff, president, and the special governor -- tried to mislead the public by claiming that the special warfare was succeeding. They also gave clear guarantees to international forums that they would crush our struggle by March 1994. But we are close to March and the Army hasn't struck a blow to our forces nor have the Kurdish people left Kurdistan, despite the torching of hundreds of villages. They created the impression that a great blow had been dealt to us with the closure of our associations in Germany and France. And recently, they tried to divert attention from the struggle inside the country by stepping up the propaganda about the Zhalah camp. By claiming to have destroyed Zhalah, which they asserted has supplanted al-Biqa', they actually aimed to shore up their image before the elections. Zhalah camp can never supplant Mahsum Korkmaz Academy, the PKK's camp in the al-Biqa' valley. It has assumed no such function. [Avsar] The press reported that the operation coincided with the devaluation of the Turkish lira. Do you think it was mere coincidence for these two events to follow each other so closely? [Ucar] The operation was due to be launched much earlier. But it coincided with the devaluation in Turkey. But that's not all. Despite major scandals and failures in the government, virtual national unity and covenant, which will last until the elections, has been forged against our struggle. On the eve of the election, the regime has surrendered to the military. The National Security Council makes decisions on the instructions of the General Staff. Little time remains before the chief of the General Staff's term expires. All these factors coincided, that is, the need for the government to raise its morale before the elections, the intention to draw the people's attention abroad, and the major economic turmoil were all factors leading to the operation. [Avsar] Will you respond to this operation? [Ucar] Our war, with all the attacks launched so far, has given the necessary reply. We have no intention of making a special reply. We will respond by perpetuating, developing, and intensifying our war. [Avsar] You told the press that you shot down two warplanes. What will you say on this subject? [Ucar] Yes, many Turkish planes were hit during the attack. We saw one plane fall near the camp. A search is under way to locate the wreck. There are also claims that helicopters also took part in the operation. These helicopters too are searching for the wreckage. Another plane reportedly fell on the Iranian side, but we are not sure about that second plane. [Avsar] Reportedly, other operations are also taking place near Kanimasi and troops have been brought to Dahuk. [Ucar] We have some information in this regard. We have received reports that tanks and troops have been massed in Kanimasi and that the Democratic Party of Kurdistan will participate in these operations. We have made preparations to retaliate.
