The Hong Kong Broad Mind Computer Company (BMC) has filed a suit against Beijing Hai Wei Electronic Engineering Company and Beijing Hai Wei Computer Technology Company for pirating firmware of their CT110 Chinese and English terminal. The hearing, scheduled to be held in Beijing's intellectual property court on Friday, will be the first case of this kind involving Hong Kong businessmen since China joined the Berne Convention. Beijing acceded to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Work and the Universal Copyright Convention in September 1992. Sunny WS Cheung, BMC's managing director, said they discovered pirated versions of CT-110 when their mainland sales of CT-110 dropped from 5,000 in 1988 to only several hundred in recent years. They could not take action in 1989 because there was no relevant legislation to protect against computer software piracy. But in October 1991, Beijing started to implement a regulation to protect computer software copyright. BMC then registered in Beijing their CT 110B software, which was an upgraded version of the original CT-110. Yang Shaokun, managing director of the Hai Wei company, said he was confident the judiciary would be impartial. He said BMC knew Hai Wei produced CT-110 as early as 1989 and they did not take action at that time. The usual statute of limitations for filing a civil law suit in China is two years. While BMC said they could provide evidence to prove they were the original owner of CT110, Cheung said he was worried Beijing would intervene administratively in the case. The U.S.-based Business Software Alliance last week named China as one of the world's main offenders against intellectual property rights. And the vice-chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce, Steven Senderling, last week said China's growing counterfeiting problem could jeopardise its attempt to enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and he blamed a lack of enforcement.
