Jibril al-Rujub, head of the PPSS in the West bank, announced: "Today, we officially started functioning as a security service." Later he added that this was only the official announcement. "In fact," he said, "we have been operating for several months." [passage omitted] Al-Rujub made another, quite official statement: "The PPSS was established to provide for the security of Palestinian civilians and to defend their freedom." Explaining the PPSS policy, he stressed: "There will be no cooperation between the Palestinian intelligence services and the Israeli security services. We signed the Gaza and Jericho agreement, which speaks of security coordination, and there will be coordination." [passage omitted] The second principle guiding the PPSS, according to al-Rujub, will be to safeguard democracy: "We will disqualify no democratic struggle and will not rule out any opposition that operates democratically. It is every man's right to express his opinion, but we will allow no one to impose his stands and will on anybody else. If, for example, some body or group should call for a strike, they are free to do so. If, however, they use terror to impose a strike, we will not let them do so." The third principle governing the PPSS is the territorial scope of its operations throughout the territories, "including East Jerusalem, because it is occupied territory." Al-Rujub further said that the first goal of the PPSS will be to settle accounts with Palestinian collaborators. His remarks on this issue sounded a bit apologetic: "Unlike other nations under occupation, the phenomenon of collaborators here was not that terrible. It is a dangerous matter, and we must deal with it." Al-Rujub promised that they will deal with the matter while examining each case on an individual basis. "We will treat each person in accordance with the gravity of his crime. As of today, we will not allow collaborators among us," he said. [passage omitted]
