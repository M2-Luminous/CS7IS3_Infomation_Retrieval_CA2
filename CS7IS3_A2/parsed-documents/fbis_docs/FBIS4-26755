To adapt themselves to this new change, all localities have taken positive measures, based on ensuring the implementation of the new regulations, and tried to mitigate the impact on developers through screening the imposition of irrational real estate taxes and applying to the central authorities for exemption of certain special projects. They have continued to step up measures to attract foreign investment in real estate. According to analyses by economic experts, as the central government is determined to levy land gain taxes and the provisional regulations promulgated earlier in the year will be considered new regulations, there should be no doubt as to the seriousness of this basic principle. For this reason, it is imperative that the regulations be put into effect this year. As for detailed issues that do not involve the principle, consideration will be given -- to the extent possible -- to the views and proposals of foreign investors so that the problem can be handled flexibly. As for local governments, on the one hand, they gradually have come to realize the authority of the new regulations. They know that legislation and explanation of the land gain tax lies with the central government. Hence, it is unlikely there will be any change without authorization. On the other hand, all localities had to face squarely the problem of the slow-down in real estate investment by foreign firms, which were taking a look-and-see attitude toward the new regulations, and make limited adaptions in taxation. Indications over the past few months show that while getting ready to implement the detailed regulations for land gain taxes, all localities have planned countermeasures and adopted rational moves to ensure the enthusiasm of foreign investors. The general practice is: Abolishing or merging the irrational portion of the local taxes previously levied on real estate developers in a bid to alleviate their burden. In addition, the domestic housing projects built on land obtained through auction, as well as projects encouraged by the central government, should be exempted from taxes if the return is under 20 percent. Take Fujian, for example: Real estate developers had to pay more than 50 kinds of taxes, which now have been reduced to some 30 after screening. Fuzhou abolished six kinds of taxes in April and lowered the rates of eight kinds of taxes, which relevantly lowered the investment cost of real estate developers by around 5 percent. Other cities like Jinan, Zhuhai, and Shanghai recently promulgated new measures to attract foreign capital and encourage foreign investors to increase their investment. As for the real estate developers, experts say that readjustment is necessary to adapt to the changes, but over-nervousness is unnecessary, as it may result in loss of new investment opportunities.
