Speaking of the negative reaction to the proposal to extend the powers of the president and deputies, Shumeyko said from what he had read in yesterday's newspapers it was clear that those who wanted no stability were making the sharpest statements and distorting the situation. Shumeyko said his statement did not mention the president, while PRAVDA maintained that he had done all this for the president. He said he concluded from response of Sergey Baburin, Mikhail Gorbachev, SOVETSAKAYA ROSSIYA and PRAVDA that he was not backed by those who did not want stability. He said this was proof that his statement had hit the mark.
