That is why I even received an "entry ban" for a time, as if I were a worse sort of person than mafia bosses and drug dealers from other countries who are evidently viewed by certain forces as providing a valuable contribution to social life, people from whom one does not have to be cut off in the same way as one has to be cut off from me. So I find it difficult not to write in a satirical vein about some German decisionmakers who emphasize national sovereignty vis-a-vis Russia and myself on the one hand, and even conduct a form of verbal gunboat policy, while on the other hand, they bitterly fight any sign of national self-awareness on the part of the German people, and want to give up every last trace of German national independence vis-a-vis the Western powers, that is to say, they are prepared to kowtow to foreign countries in a way that I find incomprehensible. Against Any Kind of Interference Second, the uproar about my supposed interference in German affairs is being fanned by media that do not shrink from playing the part of guardian and censor of the Russian nation. It is certainly of no benefit to Russo-German relations to condemn what has been decided by the Russian people, who have placed the greatest degree of trust in my party and in myself. Since the parliamentary elections last December, which saw my party become the strongest political force, irresponsible media demagogues in the FRG have interfered in Russia's internal affairs in an insolent manner on numerous occasions. In any event, it would not occur to me to attack the chairman of the strongest political force in Germany in the offensive manner that I have had to accept from certain gentlemen in Germany for months now. At the same time, I cannot imagine that they speak for the majority of the German people, who, I assume, deeply desire Russo-German reconciliation and accept the democratic decision made by the citizens of my country. Third, the charge of interfering in Germany's internal affairs leveled against me is factually inaccurate. How the Germans deal with their internal affairs is solely a matter for the Germans. We Russians urgently request that there be an end to telling us what to do. As a Russian politician, I have enough to do without having to worry about Germany's internal affairs. There Are More Options However, as a Russian politician, I do feel responsible for Russo-German relations, if only because bilateral relations with the strongest economic power in Europe are of substantial interest to us, and because I have arrived at the following conclusion, having studied the history of both our peoples: The outcome for both my nation and for the Germans was always bad when we opposed each other or even used force against each other. By contrast, close cooperation has always a blessing for both nations. With this in mind, I have made a series of suggestions about the future form of Russo-German cooperation. I do not want to tell the Germans what to do. Germany may like my suggestions or it may reject them. It is for Germany to decide freely and independently whether it wants to accept the hand that I have extended in friendship or not. That is because, despite being familiar with the mutual advantages that good Russo-German relations yield, there are also other options for my country, which is the largest state in the world. I would like to play the German card should I become president. However, I cannot continually explain to people in Russia why I am offering the Germans trump cards, when the answer that I always receive from there is a rejection. More German Than the Germans? I would like mention some instances of hypocrisy: I am continually being attacked by certain German forces, and the more I offer the Germans, the more I am condemned (when I put forward the solution to the question of Koenigsberg, one that was based on agreement, there was an enormous outcry in the German media!), and then there is outrage when I -- out of a feeling of responsibility for my country -- test various possible options for foreign relations. I ask of the Germans that they understand that, despite my great affection for that great people in the heart of Europe, I am a Russian and a Russian politician first and foremost. To expect me to be more German than the Germans is, to put it mildly, completely unrealistic. The fact that many Germans view the world through foreign eyes does not mean that one can conclude that this illness is widespread outside the borders of the FRG. In print runs that are probably larger than those of the Grimm Brothers' fairy tales -- incidentally, I value their works very much for reviving German national consciousness at a time when the nation was being forgotten, and their stories are much loved in Russia -- it is being said in Germany that I want to destroy the FRG with nuclear weapons, and without batting an eyelid, this accusation is often made in the same breath as the assertion that I, as a kind of "junior partner," want to seek world domination along with the Germans. It would, of course, be "logical" that I should want to turn the Germans into millions of skeletons first of all and then, in a joint formation with those skeletons, seek to conquer the world. It is also just as "logical" that, while maintaining a friendship with Dr. Frey, whose person and policies stand for a strong Germany, who, in accordance with the national anthem, loves "Germany above all else," I should want to kill the German people. Both of these assertions are total nonsense. Both my supposed intention to want to destroy Germany with nuclear weapons as well as my supposed desire to achieve Russo-German domination over the world. The Recipe Is Understanding It is true that in the event that I become president, if need be, I would not hesitate to use all the weapons available in my country against an aggressor, regardless of where he should happen to come from. Over decades, it has been sought to impress upon the Germans that nuclear deterrence against a potential aggressor represented the highest degree of wisdom in statesmanship. I am surprised that I am now supposed to be the big bad wolf in the world, because I am following the deterrence doctrine of the Western powers in general, and West Germany in particular. Whoever wishes us no evil can sleep in peace. However, we do indeed want to cause fear among those who are hoping to be able to carve up my country into pieces and to condemn it to slavery. As for wishing to dominate the world, in the event that I become president, I would be far from inclined to copy the U.S. head of state, who, on assuming office -- like his predecessors -- literally laid claim to "leadership of the world" for his state. In no hemisphere other than its own do I want Russia to play the first violin -- in what is hopefully a peaceful concert -- accorded to Russia by history and power. Despite all the attempts at sabotage made by irresponsible circles, I am firmly convinced that in the long-term, those forces that support Russo-German understanding, Russo-German cooperation, will gain the upper hand. The Germans will not fail to seize the opportunity when it arises, to quote Bismarck, whom I deeply admire.
