Deputies Lacked a Mere Trifle To Conduct Effective Work"] [Text] It turned out that only the absence of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy can affect the course of law-making in Russia: Yesterday the State Duma's work was unprecedentedly effective. First of all, the deputies succeeded in their third attempt to pass the law on the status of deputies, in which the Liberal Democratic leader was particularly interested. In addition, the law "On the Procedure for Covering the Activity of Government Authorities in the State Mass Media" was adopted in the first reading. The absence of the Liberal Democratic leader allowed the Duma to adopt a law regarding the status of a deputy without the imperative mandate, that is, one that would not give faction leaders the right to deprive a subordinate of a deputy's mandate, something Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had been persistently seeking. After a long break the State Duma approved a draft law on ways of dealing with the activity of state power authorities and state means of mass information. Under the draft, the press must publish materials by Russian Government authorities and Federation components under contracts to be financed by money from the budget. The money is considerable: If the law were already in force, newspapers and magazines would have been paid around 35 billion rubles for what they published in March. Radio and television will be less costly for the budget because semi-official reports will not be given that much air time. In a three-minute information program no more than 30 seconds can be devoted to the parliament. A program of more than 30 minutes is instructed to spend at least four minutes on Federal Assembly coverage. Information on the activity of government authorities should be reported as a separate block at the beginning of news programs without any comments. It was proposed that a deputy elected in a territorial district be given a chance to speak on regional radio and television once every two months for at least seven minutes. When presenting the draft, Mikhail Poltoranin said that he would guarantee the equality of rights of all branches of power to distribute information on their activity. At the same time, there will no longer be any need in the "Parliamentary Hour"-style programs, he said. Although the deputies passed the law in the first reading, they did not appear to be entirely certain of "information equality." Literally several minutes later they passed a decree on setting up the State Duma's television service, which will prepare daily programs "on the activity of Russia's representative branch."
