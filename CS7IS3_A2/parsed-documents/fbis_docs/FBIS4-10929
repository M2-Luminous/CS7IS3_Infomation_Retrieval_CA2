Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino has said a protest note was sent due to the U.S. charges the Panamanian Government has links with drug traffickers. He has said although the note was sent last week, there has still been no reply, but he excused the United States by saying it is possible the letter is being studied. [Begin Mulino recording] As I have said many times, I have not said no crimes are committed. An economy such as ours, due to the openness with which the service and banking sectors are handled, could well be used for criminal acts. What I cannot accept is to say the authorities are behind this. In the cases where crimes have been detected, we have taken action according to the law. If there are other cases about which someone knows or if some government has information a certain bank might be involved, it is their duty to report this at the highest level--like, check this out; this is what is happening; correct it. Briefly, this is what the note I have sent the United States says. [end recording] Mulino expressed his desire to hold a meeting in Panama, which he requested in the note, to speak broadly about the topic and at the highest level.
