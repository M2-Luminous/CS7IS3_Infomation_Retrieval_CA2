Mr Tharin said the revision was necessary because of higher exports and stronger growth, which will cause inflationary pressures. "We want the two agencies to control inflation within the earlier target of 4.2-4.5 percent, because if it accelerates beyond that, the general public will be affected," he said. High food prices have contributed much to higher inflation. Prices of agricultural commodities including vegetables have gone up, particularly in the provinces, affecting the living standards of rural people. Higher consumption of electricity in the first quarter (up 18.2 percent on the figure for the same period last year) could also cause oil prices to rise, which is why the two agencies must study how to control the factors which contribute to inflation, he said. The two agencies yesterday presented to the Cabinet an assessment of the economic situation in the first quarter of this year when inflation was as high as 4.8 percent. The inflation problem needs to be tackled urgently, Mr Tharin said. The Cabinet asked both agencies to revise the growth rate based on three major factors: improving exports, government spending and investment in the provinces, and private investment particularly outside Bangkok. The two agencies have one month for the revision, which will then be submitted to the Cabinet for further consideration. Meanwhile, Roengchai Marakanon, deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand, said Thailand's inflation was tending to decline since credit growth is being sustained, thanks to the likely interest rate rises. Annual inflation is expected to average the projected 4.8 percent and will not exceed this level, he said. In the past month, exports rose to 16 percent, against the projected 14.8 percent, while imports stood at only 10 percent. The country's foreign trade for the month was also satisfactory, he said. Dr Olan Chaiprawat, president of Siam Commercial Bank, shared Mr Roengchai's view, saying rising interest rates would result in a sustained inflation rate in the long run. Dr Olan added that the country's inflation this year stemmed from rising food and petrol prices. If these two categories of goods are not taken into account, the country's inflation rate would not surpass 4 percent. Moreover, when comparing the projected annual inflation rate of 4.8 percent with the country's projected 8 percent growth, the overall economy is not unsatisfactory, he noted. "Inflation in countries like Italy and France is growing faster than that of Thailand. In those nations, the inflation rate is as high as 4.5 percent while the economy grows at only 2 percent," Dr Olan said. "Thailand is likely to be subject to high inflation only in the case of high global inflation." As for credit growth, which is usually viewed as a catalyst for inflation, he said that in commercial banking, it stood at only 15- 16 percent. It has not yet exceeded the alarming 20 percent level, he said. Nevertheless, when taking into account loans extended through the Bangkok international banking facilities (BIBFs), the figure may jump beyond 23 percent. Dr Olan concluded that he believed that this year, the Thai economy would expand steadily in a stable fashion. At present, Thailand almost tops the global list in the proportional-usage of gross domestic product (GDP) in investment. About 60 percent of Thailand's GDP is consumed locally, while 40 percent is used in investment. Korea uses 30 percent of its GDP for investment, he said. Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchapak said Thailand would try to maintain export growth this year at the high level of 22 percent through various means, including expanding the country's competitiveness in international markets. Dr Suphachai said Thailand's export growth rate in the first quarter was up 21-22 percent on the figure for the same period last year, against a target of only 15 percent.
