Local sources told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that two people were killed and 35 shops were destroyed in the clash, which began on Monday and continued until Tuesday morning. Sources said the fighting erupted with a PKK bomb attack on an armoured vehicle parked in the street. Witnesses noted that security forces had helped locals back to their houses before the clash began, telling them not to come out, for their own safety. Anti-aircraft guns, RPG rocket launchers, light anti-tank weapons and machine guns were used in the clash, during which a branch office of the Ziraat bank and several PTT buildings were hit. The Cizre office of the pro-Kurdish OZGUR GUNDEM was hit by two rockets. Witnesses said that if the security forces had not escorted residents back to their homes, there could have been many casualties. On Tuesday the OZGUR GUNDEM reported on its front page that a total of 16 civilians, two of them children, had been killed in Cizre over the past month. Locals suspect that there is a systematic campaign underway to influence the results of Cizre's polls in the upcoming March 27 local elections. In the past month, dozens of families living in the Cudi neighborhood of the town have reportedly been forced out of their homes by paramilitary village guards, who moved in. Other houses were torched so that they could no longer be used. On Monday, police raided the office of the Cizre reporter of SABAH newspaper, Ramazan Imrag. They abducted him and took him to a nearby government building, where he was beaten for hours. Imrag said he suspected that he was being punished for reporting on developments in Cizre to Sabah's private television channel, ATV. He was told that this was a "warning" and if he continued to do "what he had been doing," he would be killed. Recently, state forces in the region started a campaign along with influential tribe leaders to repopulate crucial settlements which are known to sympathize with the PKK. In Diyarbakir, there was a "march to condemn terrorism" this weekend, during which a total of about 250 people marched through the streets, shouting slogans against the PKK and in favor of the Army and police. They were protected by hundreds of policemen. About 10 days ago, another group marched through Cizre, shouting anti-PKK slogans. Both in Diyarbakir and Cizre, those appearing in the streets were Kurdish village guards, who are paid fixed salaries by the state to combat the PKK. Sources in Cizre told the TDN on Tuesday that village guards had recently started detaining and interrogating suspects as well, and that many locals placed under custody were not taken to the police station but directly to the house of the chief village guard, Kamil Atak. At least seven of those detained in this way are now reported missing. Sources say that, because of the state's new campaign, some 3,000 voters in this town are no longer eligible to vote, and this will seriously affect the outcome of the March elections. Democracy Party (DEP) deputy Selim Sadak on Tuesday confirmed the report stating that many voters were not registered in the area, whereas village guards were. He said this was [as published] undermined the credibility of the elections.
