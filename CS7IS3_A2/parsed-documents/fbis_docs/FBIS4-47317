I. Malinin; UDC 534,28:56.46] [Abstract] This paper experimentally studies the effect of the design parameters of the injector nozzle of a combustion chamber on the stability of the combustion process with regard to relatively transverse gas vibrations within the chamber. Independent parameters studied individually are: length, diameter, and shape of gas lines, and the transmission rate of the injector nozzle when other design and operating parameters remain unchanged. The transmission rate of the nozzle is the ratio of the total area of the gas lines in the nozzle to the cross sectional area of the cylindrical part of the chamber. The nozzles tested here have ratios of 0.134 and 0.255. Different gas line lengths lead to a significant change in the flow rate at which vibrations occur. The minimum flow rate at the lower edge of the vibration region for both nozzles was virtually the same, given identical line lengths. There are two distinct stability minima in the studied ranges of line length, 48-62 and 156-169 mm. The next minimum is at 250 mm. Maxima are clearly visible at 6-12, 100-120, and 210 mm. The stability of combustion is calculated as a function the Mach number and the ratio of the length of gas lines l to the wavelength of sound in the lines, _l_. At the best stability value, minima and maxima are separated by about 0.5l/_l_. At the worst stability value, they are separated by 0.25l/_l_. This is a key finding of his paper and indicates the acoustic nature of the effect of gas line length. Converging lines have advantages over cylindrical ones. Resonance properties of the nozzle lines are key in determining optimal length. The interaction of longitudinal gas vibrations in the gas lines and transverse (tangential) gas vibrations in the combustion chamber is studied. Figures 8; references 9: 6 Russian, 3 Western.
