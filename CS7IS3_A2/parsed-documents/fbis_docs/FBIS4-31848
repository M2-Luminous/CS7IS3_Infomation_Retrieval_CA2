The paper RILINDJA called on the authorities to change the title, claiming it imposes a name, non-existent in the international communication. The same paper, as MAKPRES reports, is a provocation by Skopje, similar to the one with the recent agreement on cooperation in agriculture, not signed exactly because of the name.
