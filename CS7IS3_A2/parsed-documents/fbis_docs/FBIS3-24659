Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-15FEB94-ALGERIA Regime, Islamists Call for Dialogue, But Doubts Persist SUMMARY Both newly installed President Liamine Zeroual and spokesmen for the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) have affirmed a desire for political dialogue to find a way out of Algeria's violent, protracted political crisis. Neither side, however, has thus far indicated a clear willingness to adopt positions sufficiently flexible to permit serious negotiations. In addition, pressure from both hardliners within the regime and the Islamist opposition as well as apparent divisions among militant Islamists further diminish the prospects for an easing of current tensions. END SUMMARY In his first major speech to the nation on 7 February, Zeroual evidently attempted to strike a balance between indicating his readiness to negotiate with Islamist opponents of the regime and reassuring regime hardliners that he will not back off from a nationwide campaign to crush violent opposition. Algeria's political crisis, he said, "can be solved only through dialogue and with the participation of the national political and social forces--without exception." He pledged broad reforms, saying that "radical solutions to the political, economic, social, and cultural issues are inevitable," but as has generally been the case in major speeches by regime leaders, he failed to go beyond generalities. Moreover, despite his implicit appeal to Islamists to negotiate with his government, Zeroual went on to vow that the government "will use all resources to contain violence and end the bloodletting" and "will never tolerate those who are trying to sow the seeds of sedition and chaos." "No religious, political, or cultural reason," he asserted, "can explain or justify the crimes that have been committed against people and property," and he warned that "political pluralism and democratic practice do not mean the weakening of the state." (Algiers TV). While clearly warning that the military-dominated regime will continue its fight against opponents whom it regards as terrorists, Zeroual nonetheless adopted a more accommodating tone toward Islamists than he did in the weeks preceding his installation as president on 31 January. For example, speaking in his former capacity as defense minister on 16 January, he acknowledged the need for reform but, in alluding to Islamists, repudiated the claims of some leaders to be seeking genuine negotiations with the regime, denouncing their "parasitic political tendencies" and the "blatant contradictions between the programs and ideas of some parties and their noncompliance with the terms of the Constitution" (Algiers TV, 16 January). Measured FIS Response Interviewed from exile in Germany, prominent FIS official Rabah Kebir reacted cautiously to Zeroual's 7 February speech, attempting to shift to the government the onus for making concessions to start negotiations. Kebir asserted that ''negotiations are the key to a solution in Algeria" but added that "we must wait for actual deeds" from the government and charged that Zeroual's speech contained "contradictions." "On the one hand," Kebir said, "Liamine Zeroual insists on using violence . . . while on the other he is insisting on dialogue." To prove its "serious desire" for negotiations, Kebir said, the government must begin by "releasing all prisoners," most notably the FIS' two top officials, Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj. FIS leaders, Kebir added, could reach a "final decision" on any regime offer to negotiate "once they are able to meet with their historic leadership," that is, prominent leaders imprisoned by the regime (London MBC TV, 8 February). Anouar Nasr-al-Din Haddam, identified as head of the FIS "parliamentary mission in Europe and the United States," echoed Kebir's cautious position in another interview. He first dismissed Zeroual as "just the other side of the same coin" and charged that the current Algerian regime, through Zeroual's appointment, "is trying to remain in power but with a new face." He went on, however, to voice hope that "this new face will focus on the basic factors behind the Algerian crisis and extricate the country from it." Haddam also hinted several times at quiet contacts between FIS and the government, saying in one instance "we always prefer that our contacts with Liamine Zeroual or others remain away from the limelight." Nevertheless, he insisted that the government must recognize "free popular choice as the basis for any political authority" and, lest there be any doubt, explained his allusion by recalling the FIS victory in the 1990 elections, which prompted the current regime to seize power. Haddam also warned that FIS would not be satisfied with a token release of prisoners, saying that "we are not primarily interested about one person or a small group of persons" (Paris Al-Watan Al-'Arabi, 11 February). A Regime Gesture to Islamists? In an interview conducted while he was in Brussels for a meeting of the European-Algerian joint economic council, a principal vehicle for European aid to Algeria, Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Saleh Dembri reiterated Zeroual's call for dialogue but hinted that the government is still not willing to deal with some fundamentalist leaders. Dialogue, he said, is "open to all the children of Algeria . . . without exception," but he added that "the only people excluded would be those for whom violence and terrorism are a way of achieving or maintaining power," a charge that the regime has at times leveled at Islamist opponents in general. Dembri answered "absolutely" when asked if the proposed dialogue would include Islamic fundamentalists, explaining that "Algeria needs all its children to get out of a crisis with many aspects." However, again seemingly excluding some Islamists from such a dialogue, he attached the ambiguous condition that "there were more qualified formulations concerning certain persons who had violated the laws" (Brussels La Libre Belgique, 8 February). On 9 February, the London-based Saudi daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat reported that Dembri had told the paper "a general amnesty will be issued soon for all political prisoners," but the paper provided no details. Islamists' Divisions Hamper Dialogue Even if the government were to make significant gestures toward Islamists, both the refusal of some militant fundamentalists to renounce violence and reported rivalries within various Islamist movements would seriously complicate any attempt at negotiations. For example: --The London weekly Al-Wasat carried an interview with Sayfallah Ja'far, identified as a leader of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), a shadowy organization linked with numerous recent terrorist attacks in Algeria, in which he denounced FIS leaders for having "sold out the cause" and even professed not to recognize the name of FIS. Ja'far vowed to continue "direct military action," including attacks on foreigners in Algeria, whom he branded as "part of an infidel, colonialist scheme" and "spies for the infidels in the Islamic world." Moreover, he explained, by "killing and fighting" foreigners, his organization establishes "practical evidence of the weakness of the infidel regime" [in Algiers] (24 January). --On 7 February, the French news agency AFP reported receiving a communique from the GIA announcing the "execution" of 70 members of another violent, underground Islamist organization, the Armed Islamic Movement (MIA). According to AFP, the communique accused the MIA of trying to "suppress" the GIA and accused its leader of being a "traitor and agent of the government services." --An article appearing in the London daily Al-Hayah may have shed further light on the reported GIA communique. Citing an unnamed source in the FIS, the paper reported differences between political and "military" wings of the organization, adding that some FIS members are planning a "serious" escalation of anti- regime violence. According to the source, FIS members have formed their own "Islamic Salvation Army" after resolving a dispute with the MIA and have successfully recruited "most members" of the GIA away from that organization (4 February). Implications It is unlikely that any concessions President Zeroual might offer will persuade many Algerian Islamists to abandon their opposition to the current regime. In particular, those actively engaged in violent attacks seem almost certain to remain unmoved. In addition, the regime faces a formidable task in rallying support among a broader, disaffected Algerian public, most of which probably does not embrace militant Islamic fundamentalism but which has also lost confidence in the existing government following three years of unfulfilled promises of reform.
