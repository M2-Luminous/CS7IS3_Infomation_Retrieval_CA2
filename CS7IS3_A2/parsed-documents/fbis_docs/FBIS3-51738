In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Robaina said that during the short time he was here, he felt as if he had returned to Cuba's cultural roots, in a fertile setting which would encourage to flourish further the historical links of brotherhood. At the airport terminal, Robaina was seen-off by his Zimbabwean counterpart, Nathan Shamuyarira, with whom he met on three occasions during the third and last day of his official visit. Their first meeting was for official talks, later for a reception honoring the 35th anniversary of the Cuban revolution, where both foreign ministers gave their respective speeches, and finally for a dinner reception. According to Robaina, on each occasion they both coincided on the international political situation and the willingness to develop bilateral relations. Shamuyarira told PRENSA LATINA that not just Zimbabwe but all of Africa was indebted to Cuba, a comment he repeated during festivities commemorating the Cuban national holiday and explained further today by making concrete propositions. "Now it is up to us to support Cuba in its struggle against the U.S. blockade and plans by the great powers to isolate it, not only in the international organizations but in any other possible sphere," he said. He said one significant way to do so is by encouraging mutual trade--especially with those countries on the Atlantic part of Africa that have more resources, for example, such as crude oil--and by being more able to offer sea and air transportation services. After embracing at the foot of the aircraft which transported Robaina to Lusaka, Zambia, for the last stretch of a trip through Africa, which will conclude in Namibia, the Zimbabwean foreign minister said he shares the Cuban minister's satisfaction with the meeting. During an intense agenda, the Cuban visitor also held meetings with the ministers of higher education and health, the trade and industry deputy minister, the ministers of the interior, agriculture and information, and the mayor of Harare, who also participated in the reception commemorating the Cuban revolution. Likewise, Robaina also met with several Cubans who work and live in this African country as well as with the board of directors of the Zimbabwe-Cuba Friendship Association. Undoubtedly, Robaina was able to explain that his country is working with tremendous difficulty, but with an unflinching spirit to preserve its independence and social accomplishments.
