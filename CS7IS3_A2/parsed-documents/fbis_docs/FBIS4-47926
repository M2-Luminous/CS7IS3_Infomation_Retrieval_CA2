It seems there are rows between the two sides over how many troops are actually turning up, disarming and demobilizing. There have even been reports that President Chissano has suspended the government's demobilization. Well, they have all been meeting about it today, and the United Nations is putting as brave a face as possible on it, as Barnaby Philips reports from Maputo: The UN special representative to Mozambique, Aldo Ajello, admitted at the end of tonight's meeting that there are serious problems between the government and Renamo, and nothing substantial had been resolved, but Mr. Ajello denied reports that the government had suspended the demobilization of its troops, and government ministers also said that these reports were not true. Ministers said the government did stop demobilizing for a period last week, but restarted again this Tuesday [3 May]. Nevertheless, Mr. Ajello failed tonight in his intended aims: Neither the government nor Renamo were prepared to commit themselves to a final date to end demobilization. Diplomatic sources say the government, in particular, is deliberately keeping back many of its best troops from the disarmament process. A further snag is the case of what has become known of the missing 12,000 Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] troops. The government is now claiming its army is in fact some 12,000 soldiers smaller than was previously believed. Renamo has been far from happy with this, believing the government may be massaging the figures in order to hide soldiers. Mr. Ajello flies to South Africa tomorrow to brief the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the situation. When asked if he would be taking an optimistic message to his boss, Mr. Ajello replied, it is obvious that a lot more needs to be done.
