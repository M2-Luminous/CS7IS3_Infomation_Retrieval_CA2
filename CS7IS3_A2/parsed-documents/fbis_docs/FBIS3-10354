Seleme's niece confirmed that on 3 March she was detained by a group of individuals, apparently policemen, who detained her for several hours while they questioned her about her aunt. A Bolivian radio station today reported that Susana Seleme had been arrested for alleged links with drug trafficking. Interior Minister German Quiroga did not want to either confirm or deny this report, and Seleme herself denied to EFE in a telephone conversation from her home that she had been arrested. Susana Seleme, together with some leaders of her party, the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), denounced before District Attorney Francisco Borenstein the kidnapping of her niece by a group of six armed men, and accused the antinarcotics police and the U.S. DEA of political harassment. Seleme said she feels harassed by the U.S. Embassy in La Paz over her old and excellent relations with the Cuban Government, and especially with Fidel Castro. Sources from the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) consulted by EFE in La Paz said that no orders had been issued to carry out an operation like the one described by Seleme, because any such procedure -- that is, an arrest -- is always carried out within the law. Other FELCN sources said that the role of the DEA is restricted to logistical support and the processing of information obtained from drug enforcement operations. The sources said DEA agents do not participate in this kind of operations, in compliance with bilateral agreements signed between Bolivia and the United States. Drug trafficker Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez testified before a dangerous substances judge in La Paz that Susana Seleme allegedly protected drug traffickers. Dominguez said that the MIR leadership met on several occasions with Isaac "Oso" Chavarria, allegedly the greatest drug trafficker in Bolivia, who was arrested last January by the FELCN, to discuss the financing of Paz Zamora's party campaign. Susana Seleme's niece today told EFE that during the afternoon of 3 March she left Seleme's house in Santa Cruz and got into a "radio-taxi," which was intercepted fewer than 100 meters from where she got into it by three vehicles, from which six armed men emerged. "They told me: Get out, Susana Seleme. I took off my sunglasses and told them that I was not Susana," Luisa Rodriguez said, adding that although the men did not show their identification cards they said they belong to the FELCN. The men, Rodriguez said, got into the "radio-taxi," ordered the driver not to communicate with his central radio system, and then began to question Rodriguez. Meanwhile, given that Luisa Rodriguez was taking a long time to arrive at her destination, Susana Seleme called the "radio-taxi" central, which with the aid of other taxis quickly found Rodriguez' car, Seleme said. Susana Seleme asked District Attorney Borenstein to accompany her to the place together with a police patrol, where they arrived a little while after the men returned her identification documents to her niece and told her that they had nothing against her or her aunt.
