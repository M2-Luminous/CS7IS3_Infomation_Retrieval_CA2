The engine, called a ``pre-combustion-chamber bottom-removable diesel engine,'' is an improved version of the pre-combustion- chamber injection engine that is mounted on diesel passenger cars. Most studies concerning minimum-pollution engines have attempted to decrease only one of the two pollutants mentioned above. In contrast, MEL's new engine is said to be able to reduce the emission of both pollutants. Combustion in a diesel engine takes place in two different ways: one involves direct injection, which is used for larger vehicles, and the other involves pre-combustion-chamber injection, which is used for passenger cars. With the former, fuel (light oil) is directly injected into the combustion chambers from the connecting ports located at the cylinder heads; the combustion moves the pistons. On the other hand, in the pre-combustion-chamber mode, a small chamber, called the pre-combustion chamber, is created outside the cylinder head, and fuel is first injected into this chamber to undergo ``partial combustion'' before being ejected into the main combustion chamber. Regardless of the combustion mode, black smoke is generated, although a smaller amount of NO[.sub]x[/] is generated by the pre-combustion-chamber mode than by the direct injection mode, because the mixing of fuel and air is more uniform. The new combustion method uses the pre-combustion-chamber mode, except that a protrusion of about the same size as the connecting port between the main and pre-combustion chambers is installed on the top of the piston. When the piston is raised, the connecting port is closed, and vice versa. Thus, fuel injection can be controlled both over and below the piston. Actually, when the piston is raised, there is a small gap left between the piston's protrusion and the connecting port; a small amount of the partially burnt fuel can be ejected into the main combustion chamber through the gap. This ``leakage'' alleviates the sudden heat generation caused by the combustion in the pre-combustion chamber (when the piston is raised), suppressing the formation of NO[.sub]x[/]. On the other hand, the combustion in the main combustion chamber (when the piston is lowered) becomes more efficient to re-burn the black smoke formed in the pre-combustion chamber to depletion. As the development project is still under way at MEL, Chief Researcher Akira Murakami, of MEL's Energy Department, says this: ``Our targets are the reduction of NO[.sub]x[/] to one-third, and black smoke to approximately one-half that of the direct-injection mode.''
