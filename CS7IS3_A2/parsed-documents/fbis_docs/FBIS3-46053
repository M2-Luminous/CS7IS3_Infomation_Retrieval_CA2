The Nanjing City Office for Social and Cultural Administration adopted this measure based on a circular which was only received yesterday. On 20 January, the Beijing Municipal Press and Publications Administration issued a circular to the press and publications administrations of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, saying that, in line with the relevant stipulation of the State Press and Publications Administration, "the book 'A City in Ruins' falls in the category of publications containing contents that are pornographic, vulgar, of low taste, and are harmful to the physical and mental health of teenagers."
