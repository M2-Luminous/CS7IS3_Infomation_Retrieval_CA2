Figures based on 1988 land satellite images show that thick natural forests with more than 80 percent canopy cover now constitute less than 10 percent of Zimbabwe. Forests were being destroyed to make way for fields, while wood fuel was being used for tobacco curing, burning bricks, household needs and the building of new homes in the resettlement areas. The Forestry Commission has stepped up efforts to make communities aware of the need for sustainable exploitation of forests.
