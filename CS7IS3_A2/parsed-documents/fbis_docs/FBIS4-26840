After the inspection, they pointed out: Efforts must be made to study and solve problems of logistics support for units stationed in remote areas where life is hard. The General Logistics Department should immediately send working groups to remote bases to investigate the problems of technical units' grass-root depots and stations and problems with housing, drinking water, bathing, heating, medical services, communications, transport, children's care, and schooling. The department should also earmark special funds to rebuild research facilities and improve the working and living conditions of scientists and technicians who have long been living in areas where life is hard.
