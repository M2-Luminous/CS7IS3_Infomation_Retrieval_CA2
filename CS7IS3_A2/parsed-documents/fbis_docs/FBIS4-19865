Mirko Tremaglia's loud remarks about the "nullification" of the Osimo Treaty and the review of the eastern borders caused a bit of a storm. [passage omitted] On Wednesday [27 April], the European Commission will discuss the framework within which the negotiations for Slovenia's association are to be approached. This is only the beginning of the procedure, but Tremaglia took the opportunity to ask that: 1) the government intervene vis-a-vis the Italian commissioners in Brussels; 2) Osimo be rediscussed, including the borders issue. "I believe that the move from historic revisionism to border revisionism is a particularly harmful game of chance," said Beniamino Andreatta, who yesterday handed over the job of foreign minister to Leopoldo Elia. "Revisionism concerning Italy's eastern borders also includes an inducement for revisionism concerning the eastern borders of Germany. My line has been to accelerate the process of integrating Central Europe into the European Union. To now put ourselves forward like the bandits of Radicofani [medieval border between Grand Duchy of Tuscany, Papal States] laying in wait for Slovenia's passage into Europe seems to me to be a little rough." [Correspondent] However, you too made it understood that Italian consent... [Andreatta] I too used the European prospect to induce Slovenia to abandon its protectionist laws. However, trying to link the revision of borders to the question of our veto, which is technically possible, means condemning Italy to complete isolation. Italy would then become a sort of Greece, which has a problem with Macedonia that no one understands. [Correspondent] What would you propose for the immediate situation? [Andreatta] I think that the European Commission's attention could be drawn to the fact that negotiations are under way (between Italy and Slovenia -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note), and it could ask the parties to reach a conclusion, especially one which respects minorities. However, these are people who want to show that they have arrived, and so they now have to make a big fuss. I wonder whether Europe can survive the arrival on the scene of new parties which do not have the patience or sense to make compromises on the foundations upon which Europe is built. [Andreatta ends] The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] has also attacked the proposal with the person responsible for foreign affairs, Piero Fassino ("the right has thrown down the mask") and with Secretary Achille Occhetto, according to whom Tremaglia's proposals are "evidence of just how irresponsible this majority is." There are also problems within the alliance. Forza Italia's official for foreign affairs, Livio Caputo, is putting a hold on the border issue and reiterating the need to have the matter "tackled together vis-a-vis the Community partners." League floor leader Roberto Maroni played down the matter: "This is an issue that does not concern me." [Correspondent] However, your allies have talked about it. [Maroni] The question of government action is not being raised. Everyone is free to think what they want. There are those who support Inter and those who support Milan [soccer teams]. Within five or 10 years we will have the Europe of regions, and the border issue will be irrelevant. [Maroni ends] However, the "critical League member," Franco Rocchetta, feels that the Osimo Treaty "must surely be revised, since it was drafted when Italy was in a period of psychological and political subjection." What about borders? "Any border can be changed, even though the price is always high or extremely high." Decidedly critical, Marco Taradash (of the Pannella List) said: "Any desire to review borders is an anachronism." As for the veto, "the decision will have to be entrusted to the next foreign minister and left up to his discretion."
