FR941117-0-00018 FR941117-0-00005 Proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(i) is identical to section 507(c)(1)(A) of SMCRA, with the exception that section 507(c)(1)(A) of SMCRA references the requirements for the determination of probable hydrologic consequences at section 507(b)(11) of SMCRA. Arkansas' existing requirements for the determination of probable hydrologic consequences at referenced ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2) are substantively identical to the requirements at referenced section 507(b)(11) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director finds that the requirements of proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(i) are substantively identical to and no less stringent than the requirements of sections 507(c)(1)(A) and 507(b)(11) of SMCRA. The Director approves the proposed requirements. c. ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(ii), Development of cross-sections, maps, and plans. Arkansas proposed to add a new paragraph at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(ii) that provides funding under SOAP for the costs of the development of permit application cross-sections, maps, and plans of land to be affected by a surface coal mining and reclamation permit. Arkansas proposed at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(ii) to (1) require that these cross-sections, maps, and plans shall be prepared by or under the direction of a qualified registered professional engineer or geologist with assistance from experts in related fields such as land surveying and landscape architecture, and (2) specify certain information that must be depicted in the cross-sections, maps, and plans. Section 507(c)(1)(B) of SMCRA provides funding under SOAP for the costs of the development of permit application cross-sections, maps, and plans of land to be affected by a surface coal mining and reclamation permit. Section 507(c)(1)(B) of SMCRA references the requirements for the development of cross-sections, maps, and plans at section 507(b)(14) of SMCRA. Arkansas proposed requirements at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(ii) that are, with one exception, substantively identical to the requirements for cross-sections, maps, and plans in section 507(c)(1)(B) of SMCRA and referenced section 507(b)(14) of SMCRA. The exception is that Arkansas' proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(ii) does not require that the cross-sections, maps, and plans be certified by a qualified registered professional engineer, or professional geologist as does section 507(b)(14) of SMCRA. However, in its regulations at section 779.25(l) of the Arkansas Surface Mining and Reclamation Code, Arkansas requires that all maps required by section 779.25, which includes those same features required to be depicted by the cross-sections, maps, and plans in proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(ii), must be prepared by or under the direction of and certified by a qualified registered professional engineer or professional geologist, with assistance from experts in related fields such as land surveying and landscape architecture and shall be updated as required by the Director. Therefore, the Director finds that the requirements of proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(ii), in conjunction with the requirements of section 779.25(l) in the Arkansas regulations, are substantively identical to and no less stringent than the requirements of sections 507(c)(1)(B) and 507(b)(14) of SMCRA. The Director approves the proposed requirements. d. ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(iii), Geologic drilling and statement of results of test borings and core samplings. Arkansas proposed to add a new paragraph at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(iii) that provides funding under SOAP for the costs of geologic drilling and the statement of results of test borings and core samplings from the permit area, including logs of drill holes; the thickness of the coal seam found, and analysis of the chemical properties of such coal; the sulfur content of any coal seam; chemical analysis of potentially acid or toxic-forming sections of the overburden; and chemical analysis of the stratum lying immediately underneath the coal to be mined. Proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(iii) also provides that its provisions may be waived by the Director of the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology with respect to a specific application by a written determination that such requirements are unnecessary. Section 507(c)(1)(C) of SMCRA provides for the funding of geologic drilling and the statement of results of test borings and core samplings required by section 507(b)(15) of SMCRA. Section 507(b)(15) of SMCRA requires that a permit application include a statement of the result of test borings or core samplings from the permit area, including logs of drill holes; the thickness of the coal seam found, and analysis of the chemical properties of such coal; the sulfur content of any coal seam; chemical analysis of potentially acid or toxic-forming sections of the overburden; and chemical analysis of the stratum lying immediately underneath the coal to be mined. Section 507(b)(15) of SMCRA also states that its provisions may be waived by the regulatory authority with respect to the specific application by a written determination that such requirements are unnecessary. The Director finds that the requirements of proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(iii) are substantively identical to and no less stringent than the requirements of sections 507(c)(1)(C) and 507(b)(15) of SMCRA. The Director approves the proposed requirements. e. ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(iv), Collection of archaeological information. Arkansas proposed to add a new paragraph at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(iv) that provides funding under SOAP for the costs of the collection of archaeological information and any other historical information needed to prepare accurate maps to an appropriate scale clearly showing all manmade features and significant known archaeological sites existing on the date of the application and the preparation of plans necessitated thereby.
