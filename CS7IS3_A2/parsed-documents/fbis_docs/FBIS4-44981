A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court today initiated suo motu "contempt of court" proceedings against Acharya Giriraj Kishore, joint general secretary of the banned Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Mr. G.K. Mahajan, editor, printer and publisher of Kabardar India (Hindi weekly) and Mr. Ravi Thakur, reporter of the weekly for publication of certain statements reportedly made by Acharya Giriraj Kishore (on the Apex Court) in the edition of the Hindi weekly dated April 11 to 17. The Bench, which made these orders after perusal of the affidavits concerned, however, said that there was no justification for proceeding against Mr. Vishnu Hari Dalmia, leader of the banned VHP. The Chief Justice, Mr. M.N. Venkatachaliah, Mr. Justice A.M. Ahmadi, Mr. Justice J.S. Verma, Mr. Justice G.N. Ray and Mr. Justice S.P. Bharucha were on the Bench. The Bench in today's orders said that appropriate notices shall be served on all the "accused" by the court registry fixing the next date of hearing for their personal appearance before the court to hear "charges" against them. The Bench, adverting to publication of certain statement attributed to Acharya Giriraj Kishore in Indian Express (Delhi edition dated April 10), said that, as regards printer and publisher, editor and reporter of the daily (respondents 4, 5 and 6), it (the court) proposed to examine the question -- whether in the matter of a proper balance of fundamental right (of free speech and expression including "freedom of press") under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution on the one hand and the need to protect the authority and dignity of the court on the other -- it (the Bench) should initiate similar proceedings against these three respondents particularly in the light of the fact that the respondents had carried out the publication pertaining to "press interview" along with a "caveat" commenting on the "impropriety" of such statements followed by an editorial condemning such conduct. This would be examined separately. The Bench appointed, Mr. Dipankar P. Gupta, Solicitor-General as a prosecutor. Earlier, Mr. F.S. Nariman, senior counsel appearing for Indian Express, contended that "An Editor/Publisher does not scandalise the Court when he reports accurately and in good faith what public figures say in public." He also submitted that it was important that the "right of citizens to know" what public figures said in public should "not be inhibited by the law of contempt" so long as "what is reported is accurate and in good faith". To balance the interest of a "free Press" and a "fair administration of justice", it was necessary to lay down as a principle flowing from Article 19 (1) (a) read with the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 that a publisher, printer and editor "do not themselves render liable for the criminal contempt of "scandalising" the Court where "what they do is merely report the public statements of a public figure, and where such a report is published with a caveat commenting upon the impropriety of such statements."
