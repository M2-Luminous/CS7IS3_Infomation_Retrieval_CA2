FBIS4-38094 "drnes124_s_94004" FBIS-NES-94-124 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 Iran Velayati Stance on Iranian Prisoners Criticized Velayati Stance on Iranian Prisoners Criticized NC2706094294 Tehran SALAM in Persian 16 Jun 94 p 2 NC2706094294 Tehran SALAM Persian BFN [Unattributed commentary: "Minister, Hope You Are Not Feeling Weary!"--punctuation as published] [Text] Citing our embassy's diplomats in Bonn after Foreign Minister Velayati's meeting with German officials, IRNA reports that German national Helmut Szimkus, who spied for Iraq during the imposed war and was arrested and sentenced to death, will be released soon. It is regrettable to hear this news, which has not been refuted. It is also surprising. While German officials are announcing their success in the imminent release of their citizen, there is no news or information citing an Iranian official on the release of innocent Iranian citizen Kazem Darabi, who has been through 60 contrived sessions of the German court and is in an extremely dire physical and psychological condition. Looking at the foreign minister's successful diplomacy in Germany in parallel with the outcome of the deputy foreign minister's visit to Paris, we can glean everything apart from the fate of the innocent, the ordinary Iranian Foreign Ministry employee who has been in France's dreadful prisons. The Iranian official heard everything and said everything but did not express concern over the fate of his oppressed employee. Zeyn ol-'Abedin Sarhaddi, an employee of the Iranian Embassy in Switzerland, was arrested in 1991. It is now June 1994! We still have no information on the charges brought against him and have not seen the documents the French authorities claim to have. It is precisely because of the absence of such documents and, more importantly, because of the absence of any motivation by the relative Iranian authorities that the French authorities are keeping Sarhaddi in prison under the worst psychological and physical conditions. We hope Iran will throw a morsel of bread their way so that they will show some clemency toward Sarhaddi. What have the families and friends of Darabi and Sarhaddi done to deserve seeing the release of everyone except their dear ones, who continue to be held captive without any hope of release? Are these two people suffering for want of friends and action? Minister, if you see the Arabs completely ignoring the vindication of the rights of Iranian citizens [taken hostage in Lebanon], you should at least do your duty toward your own ministry's employees. In a recent interview with an afternoon newspaper after returning from Cairo, the foreign minister discussed the duties of the Foreign Ministry, saying: "... the people definitely do not want the Foreign Ministry to just sit around and issue statements." Elsewhere the minister asked: "Do we want to betray these people? Do the people want the foreign minister and his associates to sit around and only make statements about every incident that takes place in the world without going to the scene and doing something there? The people are not satisfied with such a Foreign Ministry. The people want the Foreign Ministry to take risks!! and go and work within the framework that has been laid down by the system. They want the Foreign Ministry and its employees not to be idle ... and, even if our interests are in the mouth of the dragon, for us to put our hand in and pull out our interests." You can keep the risk and the dragon! Much has been said about the people's rights. We expect nothing from Mitterrand, who is now very busy with human rights issues in Bosnia and in Rwanda. But be assured that your forgotten employees are not at rest. At least issue a statement about them. This is the least the people expect! Was it not recently that two Iranian citizens were arrested in Paris--again on false accusations--and Paris was preparing the price of a transaction when public opinion and the press were sensitized and criticized this well-known method of policing by France, thus forcing them to respect our country's public opinion and to release these two innocent people? Was it not recently that the Germans demanded that Iran use its influence with the Hammadi family so that the two hostages they were keeping would be released? And did Iran not do so? Was a promise not given to Iran and the Hammadi family that he would be released immediately? Why did this not happen? Did the esteemed president not complain about the Western press during his recent news conference and say that for the release of the American hostages in Lebanon, the Iranian hostages being kept by the Zionist regime in Lebanon have been cast into oblivion? How many times must we experience the saying "Once bitten twice shy?" If, as claimed, public opinion on both sides is necessary to consolidate bilateral relations, the just rights of the citizens of the two sides concerned should also be considered. There should be mutual understanding between the people on both sides, who should definitely be regarded as equal! Why is this not happening? Why is it that everyone else always supports their citizens rights--even if these rights are illegitimate and unfair--while we do not? Some even believe that our citizens' rights disturb the success of our domestic and foreign diplomacy and yet we must listen to their babblings about human rights all the time. Here is the ball and the field. Here is the risk and the dragon. But concluding, and for the foreign minister's information as well as to remind him, we would like to recall the everlasting words of the imam, may his soul be sanctified: "Defending Islam and Hizballah is an indisputable principle of the Islamic Republic of Iran."
