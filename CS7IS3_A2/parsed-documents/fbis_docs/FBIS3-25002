With only days left for Nigerians to offer their ideas about the proposed national conference, two meetings -- one in Kaduna in the north, the other in Ibadan in the southwest -- have been far from mealy-mouthed in their offerings. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports: [Begin Odunfa recording] The two meetings in Kaduna and Ibadan this week are part of the nationwide search for what has been described as a more equitable framework for national unity in the light of the crisis which followed the annulment of last year's presidential election. The two meetings reflect the widespread disenchantment with both the Babangida military regime and military rule generally. The Ibadan meeting is an ethnic gathering by traditional rulers and so-called leaders of thought in western Nigeria to draw up a Yoruba memorandum for the constitutional conference. The Yoruba leaders are still smarting under the annulment of the presidential election believed to have been won by Bashorun Moshood Abiola, a Yoruba man. They are therefore insisting that Nigeria's political problems could be solved only on the basis of that election. A report from Ibadan today said that the Yoruba leaders were also proposing that Nigeria be turned into a loose federation of eight powerful regions with a weakened central government which will be responsible mainly for foreign affairs and defense against external aggression. On their own, the traditional rulers are requesting constitutional recognition of their status and the assignment to them of specific roles in national affairs. They said that they would submit their memorandum to the conference commission on Monday [7 February], three days to the closing date. The Kaduna meeting, organized by the Ahmadu Bello University, is being attended by political leaders and academics drawn from all parts of Nigeria. The key speakers are former military rulers, General Olusegun Obasanjo and Muhammadu Buhari, both of whom pulled no punches in denouncing the regime of their former colleague, President Ibrahim Babangida for bringing Nigeria to its present prostrate political and economic situation. The meeting is considering, among other issues, Gen. Obasanjo's suggestion that Gen. Sani Abacha should announce a definite tenure for his government and that the decisions of the constitutional conference should be subject to approval only at a national referendum. [end recording]
