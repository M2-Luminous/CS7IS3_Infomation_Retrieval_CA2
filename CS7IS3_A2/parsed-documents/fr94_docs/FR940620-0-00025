FR940620-0-00025 FR940620-0-00008 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;10] Amendment to Class D Airspace; Aurora, CO AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; withdrawal. SUMMARY: On May 11, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration published a final rule amending the Aurora, Buckley ANG Base Airport, CO, Class D airspace designation. It incorporated information concerning the control tower's hours of operation at the Buckley ANG Base, CO. The airspace designation was predicated on the new Denver International Airport airspace reconfiguration. Given the indefinite delay for opening the new Denver International Airport, the FAA is withdrawing this rule. EFFECTIVE DATE: The withdrawal is effective June 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ted Melland, Airspace and Procedures Branch, Air Traffic Division, ANM&hyph;536, Federal Aviation Administration, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, WA 98055&hyph;4056; telephone number: (206) 227&hyph;2536. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 11, 1994, the FAA published a final rule amending the Aurora, Buckley ANG Base Class D airspace to incorporate ``part-time'' information into the rule (59 FR 24344; May 11, 1994). The information would provide pilots with notice that the Class D airspace would not be effective during certain periods of the day. The Class D airspace amendment was to be established after the new Denver International Airport was commissioned. The official opening of the airport has been delayed indefinitely due to the automatic baggage system difficulties. Accordingly, the FAA is withdrawing this Class D amendment. Withdrawal of Rule Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;10, as published in the Federal Register on May 11, 1994, (59 FR 24344), is hereby withdrawn. Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1348(a), 1354(a), 1510; E.O. 10854, 24 FR 9565, 3 CFR, 1959&hyph;1963 Comp., p. 389; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); 14 CFR 11.69. Issued in Washington, DC, on June 14, 1994. Harold W.
