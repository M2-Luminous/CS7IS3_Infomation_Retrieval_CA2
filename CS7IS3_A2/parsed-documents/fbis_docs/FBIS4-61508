Sergey Dorenko outlines the scenario over video showing Russian troops loading their equipment on to trains, and says: "The Germans have finally contrived to offend the Russians: The Russians are given to understand, quite clearly, that their presence here, unlike that of the Western allies, is simply only tolerated." He goes on to ask what can be done about the situation, and suggests that maybe Yeltsin can do something. A video sequence then recalls the entry of the allied troops into Germany at the end of the World War II. Dorenko says: "All the armies were regarded as liberators. Now they are leaving Germany without explosions or counterattacks. But the Russian withdrawal resembles the shameful retreat of losers. The heart of the problem is that the farewell to the Russians is scheduled to take place in Weimar. It is planned that on 31 August, President Yeltsin and Chancellor Kohl will attend the ceremony in the local theater. But a week later, widespread festivities are planned in Berlin, the country's historical capital, at which all Germany will say goodbye to the Americans, British and French." Dorenko then traces the assumed reasons for this situation, saying that the Western allies were not just occupiers; they were seen by Germans as their defense against the communist aggression of the East, personified by the Russian troops in their country and in the former East Germany. Matvey Burlakov, commander of the Western Group of Forces, then presents his views, saying: "Probably the best thing would be a joint farewell to all the allied troops in the anti-Hitler coalition. And there are good grounds for this: On 7-9 July, a G-7 meeting with our president, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, will take place in Italy. It would be very good if, at that time, after the end of the meeting, the leaders of those states came to Berlin for a joint leave-taking -- in other words, they would eliminate the consequences of World War II. We want to have a farewell in Berlin. The war ended in Berlin. The Soviet troops too should depart from Berlin. Unfortunately, I think that it is the German leadership that has suggested a leave-taking scenario that is not very acceptable, or rather, is unacceptable to us. "First, as regards the venue, what is Weimar? During the war, the town of Weimar was liberated or captured by American troops. It is 350 km from the places where our troops are stationed. So they will have to travel all that distance, 350 km. We plan to invite a large number of veterans from the Western Group of Forces and from the war. Needless to say, transporting the veterans there -- six hours there and six hours back -- will not be much fun for them. "Second, near Weimar is the huge Buchenwald concentration camp, where 56,000 people perished, and a common grave was dug for the peoples of Europe or even the world. I think it would simply be sacrilege to dance on that common grave. So my personal view is that I reject Weimar." Dorenko then points out that no one wants to confuse relief at the Russian withdrawal with gratitude to the Western allies. The Russians are leaving not of their own good will, but because communism has been defeated. Maybe Yeltsin can reach some agreement during next week's visit. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev tried to clarify the situation. He said: "There are a few nuances on the German side as regards the troop withdrawal issue. Boris Nikolayevich is to pay an official visit to Germany 11-13 May. I will be present as a member of a government delegation. One of the questions to be tackled will be a final decision on the procedure for the withdrawal, the ceremonial withdrawal, of our troops from German territory. I am sure that the president and the chancellor are quite...[pauses] will find a correct, alternative...[pauses] not alternative, but correct decision on the withdrawal, the ceremonial withdrawal, of the troops." Dorenko then points to the difference between the American and Russian troops, saying: The Americans are taking nothing with them apart from their weapons. They will be replaced by U.S. firms, since the premises they occupy have been purchased from the Germans. The Russians are taking everything, even the toilets. Many soldiers know that no accommodation awaits them in Russia. Grachev comments again, saying: "What is being done? A great deal is being done. First, 7.8 billion Deutschmarks [DM] were invested in us initially, then a further DM550 million. With this money 32 military cantonments should be constructed by foreign firms before the end of 1995. That is with all the infrastructure. Thirty-two military cantonments with 34,590 apartments, of which three residential cantonments have been constructed so far, and the construction of 22 is under way; there will be 22 cantonments with between three and nine ready every month, but in practice this year a further 22 cantonments will be commissioned through the efforts of foreign firms, although foreign firms are basically to blame for the delay, but they cite the bad climatic conditions, the harsh winters and, in general, the vast expanse of Russia." Dorenko comments: "The officers in the Western Group of Forces recall that a considerable amount of the aid has been spent on putting up buildings in Ukraine and Belarus. One can lament as much as one likes now: It is clear that there are no apartments and no money, and that a further 32,000 military personnel and their families have to be housed somewhere." Toward the end of the program, Grachev says: "I sincerely congratulate all veterans, all frontline troops, on the great Victory Day. May the sacred day of 9 May be the start of our spiritual unification for the sake of Russia's prosperity."
