The analyst says: The decision of the South Korean puppets to increase military spendings with blood taxes collected from the people is an intolerable challenge to the entire fellow countrymen who are calling for peace and reunification. The Kim Yong-sam group is arguing for "the inevitability of sanctions" against the North and staging war games in and around the Korean peninsula almost every day while keeping the whole puppet army on "an emergency alert". It is not accidental that it has decided to largely increase military appropriations next year. It is clear that it intends to make a military adventure, come what may, under the pretext of the "nuclear issue" of the North. None of the successive South Korean rulers refrained from seeking North-South confrontation. But there was no such a warmaniac as the traitor Kim Yong-sam who is so maliciously and persistently kicking up the anti-national racket of confrontation and war. The Kim Yong-sam group seems to be hoping to get something from a war against the North, dancing to the anti-DPRK, anti-socialist tune of the U.S. masters. But, it is an act of an idiot who is woefully short-sighted. If the Kim Yong-sam group dare ignite a war, losing reason, it will meet a miserable end.
