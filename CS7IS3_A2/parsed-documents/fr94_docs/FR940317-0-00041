FR940317-0-00041 FR940317-0-00015 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Part 1 [T.D. 8533] RIN 1545&hyph;AS58 Accuracy-Related Penalty AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Temporary regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains temporary regulations relating to the accuracy-related penalty under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. These regulations affect all persons that file returns of income tax and provide guidance necessary to comply with these changes. These regulations are necessary to effect changes to the accuracy-related penalty made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David L. Meyer, 202&hyph;622&hyph;6232 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background These temporary regulations set forth certain changes made to the accuracy-related penalty in section 6662 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) by section 13251 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993). These changes eliminated the disclosure exception for the negligence penalty (section 6662(b)(1) of the Code) and raised the disclosure standard for purposes of the penalties for disregarding rules or regulations (section 6662(b)(1) of the Code) and a substantial understatement of income tax (section 6662(b)(2) of the Code) from ``not frivolous'' to ``reasonable basis.'' See section 13251 of OBRA 1993 and H. Rep. No. 213, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 669 (1993) (the Conference Report). The legislative history to OBRA 1993 indicates that this ``reasonable basis'' standard is a relatively high standard of tax reporting that is significantly higher than the ``not frivolous'' disclosure standard previously applicable to taxpayers under section 6662 of the Code and currently applicable to preparers under section 6694 of the Code. See Conference Report, at p.669. A position is not frivolous if it is not ``patently improper.'' See ยง1.6694&hyph;2(c)(2) of the Income Tax Regulations and current ยง1.6662&hyph;3(b)(3). The legislative history to OBRA 1993 also provides that the reasonable basis standard is not satisfied by a position that is merely arguable or merely a colorable claim. See Conference Report, at p.669. In addition to adopting the new reasonable basis standard as the standard that a disclosed return position must satisfy to avoid the disregard and substantial understatement penalties, Congress adopted the new reasonable basis standard as the standard that a return position must satisfy to avoid the negligence penalty. See Conference Report at p.669.
