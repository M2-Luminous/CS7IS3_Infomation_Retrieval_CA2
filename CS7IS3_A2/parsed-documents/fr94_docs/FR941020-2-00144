FR941020-2-00144 FR941020-2-00082 The Subsidiaries require short-term funds to meet normal capital requirements. It is proposed that the Subsidiaries borrow short-term funds from the Money Pool in amounts specified below (in million $$): ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Columbia Kentucky 19.0 Columbia Maryland 4.0 Columbia Ohio 240.0 Columbia Pennsylvania 88.0 Commonwealth Services 19.0 Columbia Gulf 19.0 Columbia Resources 30.0 Columbia Development 15.0 Columbia Propane 2.0 Commonwealth Propane 4.0 Service Corporation 10.0 Columbia Coal 2.0 n,s Total 452.0 Advances from the Money Pool will be limited to a maximum amount outstanding at any one time from January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996. It is proposed that the Money Pool, which was last approved by the Commission in the 1993 Order, be continued through December 31, 1996. All short-term borrowing will be through the Money Pool, with the Service Corporation as agent. Columbia may invest in the Money Pool but will not borrow from the Money Pool. When Columbia and the subsidiaries generate cash in excess of their immediate cash requirements, such temporary excess cash may be invested in the Money Pool. Columbia and investing subsidiaries would be investors (``Investors'') pursuant to a Money Pool evidence of a deposit. Loans to the Subsidiaries (``Borrowers'') through the Money Pool will be made pursuant to a short-term grid note. Such short-term grid notes will be due upon demand by the Investors but not later than April 30, 1997. The loans will be allocated to the Investors based on the proportion of their relative investment in the Money Pool. The cost of money on all short-term advances from, and the investment rate for funds invested in, the Money Pool will be the interest rate per annum equal to its weighted average short-term investment rate. Should there be no Money Pool investments, the cost of money will be the average Federal Funds rate for the prior month published in the Federal Reserve Statistical Release. A default rate equal to 2% per annum above the pre-default rate on unpaid principal or interest amounts will be assessed if any interest or principal payment becomes past due. CINergy Corp. (70&hyph;8477) CINergy Corp. (``CINergy''), 139 East Fourth Street, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202, a Delaware corporation not currently subject to the Act, has filed a declaration under sections 6(a), 7, and 12(b) of the Act and rules 45 and 54 thereunder. CINergy seeks authorization to issue and sell up to eight million shares of its common stock, par value .01, in one or more issuances, from time to time, prior to December 31, 1995 following the proposed combination of Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company (``CG&E'') and PSI Resources, Inc. (``PSI'') and the registration of CINergy as a holding company. The proposed combination of CG&E and PSI is currently before the Commission in file number 70&hyph;8427. CINergy is requesting authorization in the event that a contemplated issuance of eight million shares of PSI common stock is not consummated prior to the proposed merger of CG&E and PSI. CINergy proposes to sell the shares in one of four ways: (1) through the solicitation of proposals of underwriters or dealers; (2) through underwriters or dealers on a negotiated basis; (3) directly to a limited number of purchasers or to a single purchaser; or (4) through agents. In addition, CINergy requests authority to contribute up to $160 million of the net proceeds from the sale of such shares to the equity capital of its then electric public-utility subsidiary company, PSI Energy, Inc. (``PSI Energy''). CINergy states that PSI Energy would use the funds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of short-term indebtedness incurred for construction financing. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
