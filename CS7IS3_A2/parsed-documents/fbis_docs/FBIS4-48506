Speaking at a seminar in Lisbon under the theme: "Mozambique -- Attractive Investment Opportunities", sponsored by Ernest Young Company, Eneias Comiche stressed that Mozambique has a propitious atmosphere for foreign investment, particularly Portuguese investment. He also said the country was a "door to southern Africa." The Mozambican minister who was addressing over 200 entrepreneurs, said the southern African region where Mozambique is found, has a market of more than 100 million inhabitants. Eneias Comiche stressed the existing potential for Portuguese investors in the field of the reorganization of the state enterprise sector, particularly with regard to privatization. The minister said the Government gives priority to agricultural sector (particularly in the fields of cashew nuts, copra, and cotton) to attract Direct Foreign Investment. Eneias Comiche said this was an attractive sector because it deals with exports and other kinds of commodities which reduce imports and generate foreign exchange. He said other important sectors include the tourism and hotel industry, services, and the financial and insurance sectors. The minister said the banking sector will not be privatized right away, pointing out that a study will be carried out until the middle of this year. "Only afterward, will we examine the possibility of accepting private participation in the sector", he said. Comiche said Portuguese investors have expressed interest in the fields of banking, insurance, infrastructure, and mining.
