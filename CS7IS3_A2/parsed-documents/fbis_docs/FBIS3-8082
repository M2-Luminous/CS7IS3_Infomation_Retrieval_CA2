Last night Muslim forces based in a number of Bihac suburbs launched artillery attacks on Serb positions killing one Serb soldier and wounding four others in Barakovac [a village near Bihac], a SRNA [Serb news agency] correspondent has reported, quoting a communique issued by the command of the 2d Krajina Corps of the Srpska republic army. Members of the 5th Corps of the Muslim Army loyal to Alija Izetbegovic based in Zalozje, Carkici, Cekrlije, and Vinica have continuously been attacking Serb fighters' positions. Muslim units have been launching the fiercest attacks against Serb positions in Barakovac above Bihac. Fighters of the 2d Krajina Corps have successfully repelled all attacks. Due to their failures on the battlefield, the Muslim authorities of Bihac district tried to stage-manage another Markale [Sarajevo market place massacre in February] in Bihac for consumption by the foreign media. Muslim information media in Bihac said last night that a Serb artillery round killed 12 civilians. This news was denied today by the command of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] French battalion stationed in Caralici near Cazin, saying that the Serbs did not carry out any attacks at all yesterday. In addition, Muslim authorities in Bihac yesterday banned all humanitarian convoys bound for the western part of the Srpska republic from passing through the Cazin area. As a result, humanitarian aid will in the future travel through the territory of the republic of Serb Krajina [in Croatia], a journey that is several hundred kilometers longer.
