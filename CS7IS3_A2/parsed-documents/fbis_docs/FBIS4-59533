The telegram calls on the secretary general and the Arab member states to intervene, directly, effectively, and quickly in order to halt the fighting between the Yemeni military forces and secure towns and citizens from any acts of aggression. Also, it asks the League to pave the way for the political forces to hold dialogues about the implementation of the document of pledge and accord, considering that that document is the sole solution, and to seek a new formula for unity. The telegram said it was necessary for the Council of Coordination to address this direct call to the secretary general of the Arab League at a time when Yemeni weapons were being pointed at other Yemenis and when Yemen was being destroyed and its people exterminated after the achievement of unity.
