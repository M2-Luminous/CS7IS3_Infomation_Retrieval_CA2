This was made clear during consultations between the two countries here on Monday [24 January]. On the basis of mutual respect, equality and strengthening co-operation, the consultations were conducted between Zhang Hongxi, director of the Consular Affairs Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard. During the consultations, the Chinese side analysed main reasons for the emergence of smuggling and illegal immigration, reiterated China's consistent principled stand that the Chinese Government has all along been against smuggling and illegal immigration, and briefed on the unremitting efforts and resolute measures the Chinese side had adopted in this sphere. The Chinese side asked the U.S. to deal severe blows at "snake heads" -- people involved in organizing smuggling inside the territory of the U.S. The Chinese side pointed out that China is resolutely against and cannot accept that "political asylum" should be offered to smugglers who ask the U.S. for "political protection". Such people use so-called excuses such as that "the Chinese human rights situation is not good", or claim that they are "suffering from political persecution", or are against China's family-planning policy. The Chinese view is that wrongfully granting asylum in fact encourages smuggling and provides international smuggling organizations with opportunities. While combating smuggling and stopping illegal immigration, the Chinese side held that normal exchanges between people of the two sides should be actively maintained, hoping that the U.S. side can ensure convenience for Chinese people who are on business or for private affairs apply for visas from the U.S. The U.S. side said that the U.S. is formulating new laws so as to crack down on increasing illegal activities by international crime-committing organizations. Paying much attention to combating smuggling activities, the U.S. side is willing to strengthen co-operation with China in enhancing direct contacts between the two sides and exchanging information, and severely punish those criminals. The U.S. side also said that relevant U.S. bodies are ready to strengthen exchanges with relevant Chinese departments and enhance understanding between the two sides. The two sides agreed to establish an ad hoc consultation system, further strengthen bilateral exchanges and co-operation between law-enforcing departments, exchange information in good time, and take effective measures to severely punish the "snake-heads" and stop smuggling and illegal immigration. The two sides held that this effort is in conformity with the interests of the two countries.
