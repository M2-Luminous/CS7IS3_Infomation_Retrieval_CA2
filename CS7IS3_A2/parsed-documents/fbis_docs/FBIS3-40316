Thus, a new alliance between the Muslims and Serbs is possible. It would be a logical alliance, because the Serbs and the Muslims are to a certain degree natural allies since they have both a mutual enemy (the Croats) and a mutual long-term interest, which is an outlet to the Croatian sea [as published]. [passage omitted] This is why the pressure to obtain this outlet on the Croatian sea will become more pronounced and more intense. The sea has a mythical significance; it is an unavoidable element in the process of creating statehood. For the Serbs, it is indeed a century-old dream which today could possibly be achieved. In 1878, when Serbia was recognized as an independent state, it was still very far from the sea--it was separated from it by Sandzak, Montenegro, Kosovo and Metohija, Albania, and Macedonia (Turkey). The same year, Austria occupied Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Serbia lost the possibility of resolving the issue of access to the sea through this "Serbian land." Thus, the moment of Serbia's greatest affirmation (creation of the state) was linked to its greatest frustration, which Serbia has carried as an undescribable burden until today. For the Muslims, too, the outlet to the sea means a final affirmation of their statehood, and they will not renounce this goal very easily. [passage omitted] The Muslim-Serb alliance will thus receive a special momentum when the republic of Srpska, with the Muslims' consent, leaves Bosnia-Herzegovina. Then the Muslim-Serb conflict and problem can be viewed as resolved, which means a new possibility for their alliance. [passage omitted] This is why the Republic of Croatia and the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina must, above all, be decisive in not surrendering the sovereignty of their coast and must be ready to defend this sovereignty even with military force. Likewise, in the political sense, the Croats must, during the negotiations, be on the offensive, i.e. they must request part of Sarajevo, because "they need it," and, of course, that part of Sarajevo in which there are no Croats at all, just as the others are demanding a part of the coast where there are no Muslims or Serbs. Does this sound strange? No, not at all--it only sounds logical and just.
