FBIS4-53608 "dreas099__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-099-A Daily Report 22 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Firm Revokes Contract To Export Russian Subs Firm Revokes Contract To Export Russian Subs OW2305092094 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 22 May 94 Morning Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2305092094 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] It has been learned that a Japanese trading firm has rescinded a contract which it had concluded with Russia to export its decommissioned submarines through intermediary trade to North Korea for use as scrap. The Japanese trading company took this action after the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] asked it to stop the intermediary trade. However, Russia has resumed the export of its decommissioned submarines to North Korea without giving it prior notice. As a result, the uproar over the export of Russia's decommissioned submarines to North Korea has now subsided, leaving unanswered the question of whether the Russian decommissioned submarines are militarily useful. The Japanese trading firm in question is Toen Trading Company (based in Tokyo). It concluded the contract with Russia under which it was to buy 12 decommissioned submarines from the Russian Defense Ministry for export to North Korea for dismantling and reexport as metal scrap to China. The Japanese trading firm exported last January one of the 12 decommissioned submarines to North Korea. MITI, however, intervened in this intermediary trade, claiming, "The trade may violate the Foreign Exchange Management Law that prohibits Japanese companies from engaging in any intermediary export of weapons" and asked Toen Trading Company to stop the intermediary trade. In response, the company exchanged a letter of confirmation with the Russian side that "Russia will keep the contracted submarines in place as they are until MITI approves the intermediary trade." On 12 May, however, the NHK broadcast a video showing Russian submarines being shipped from Vladivostok to North Korea. Russia appeared to have embarked on direct deals with North Korea without giving prior notice to Toen Trading Company. The Japanese trading firm has decided to revoke the contract with Russia after receiving no answerers to its queries. After examining photographs submitted by Toen Trading Company, MITI has concluded that "Russia's decommissioned submarines in question are so badly obsolete that they cannot be used as weapons." It, however, has been cautious about approving intermediary trade by asking Russia to allow on-the-spot checkup of the decommissioned submarines in view of the controversial issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. Now that the Japanese trading firm has revoked the contract, MITI need not make a judgment on "the sticky issue" (says a senior MITI official). Although MITI still says "we need to ask the Russian side to confirm if the contract has actually been revoked and that the issue has yet to be resolved completely," it appears to be feeling no anxiety about the knotty issue.
