Xintian County takes three measures to guarantee the payment of teachers' salaries. First, educational funds are budgeted at the beginning of a fiscal year with appropriate annual increments according to needs, making very sure that funds for personnel are adequate. Second, when money is tight, top priority is given to teachers' salaries. Because Xintian County derives its revenue from flue-cured tobacco, all funds will have to go to the procurement of tobacco leaves in the first half of the year, and revenues will only be collected in the second half of the year when peasants sell their crops. As such, the county has established the following priorities for paying salaries: middle and primary school teachers first, grass-roots cadres next, and units directly under the county government last. Third, individual villages and towns having difficulties will receive the personal attention of the secretary and the county head. Because they have been affected by the financial and taxation reform, the county's revenues will be reduced sharply this year. What happens to teachers' salaries? After study, the county has found its way out of the situation by dividing the educational funds into three parts -- funds for organ and school personnel, projects, and funds -- with separate management.
