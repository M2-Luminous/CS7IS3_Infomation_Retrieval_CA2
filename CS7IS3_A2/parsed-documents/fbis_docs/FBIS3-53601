This meeting was arranged during a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Syria two months ago. After the U.S. guaranteed that the peace process would continue within the framework of the Madrid Conference principles, Syria agreed to the al-Asad-Clinton meeting in Geneva and to resume talks with the Zionist regime in Washington. America's agreement with the principles of the Madrid conference means the acceptance of the joint U.S.-Syrian pattern and the rejection of the Israeli pattern. Actually, the joint U.S.-Syrian pattern is manifested in the Madrid conference, which stipulates two points: peace for land and the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The Israeli pattern, however, emphasizes bilateral and separate talks and secret diplomacy, a good example of which is the Gaza-Jericho accord. The Syrians believe that with the non-implementation of the accord between 'Arafat and the Zionist regime, the Israeli pattern has been somewhat discredited; and the emergence of differences between representatives of the PLO and of the Zionist regime on the interpretation of each article in the pact has laid favorable groundwork for Syria to move the talks once again into the framework of the United Nations. Syria has strengthened its position prior to the talks. By hosting the conference of the foreign ministers of the six plus two countries [six Persian Gulf countries, plus Syria and Egypt] in Damascus, Syria mustered their support for its stances; and with its important role in Lebanon and in mobilizing those Palestinians who oppose the Gaza-Jericho accord, it can claim that it is playing a significant regional role in solving the Middle East crisis. Political observers believe that even though the United States agrees with the Syrian pattern and supports the implementation of the Security Council resolutions, nevertheless as long as Washington does not want to put pressure on Tel Aviv, the current talks in Geneva will yield no results. So far the Zionist regime has not agreed to implement Resolution 242 and to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Syria's Golan Heights. Thus, political analysts are not optimistic about the outcome of the meeting of the Syrian and U.S. heads of state in Geneva. But of course, a change in the U.S. stances on Syria at the Geneva talks could yield a different result.
