We believe this description has not aroused controversy in the United States or the world. The Result of Talking Irresponsibly The report vividly points out that Clinton seems to proceed without a "steady compass." In other words, he does not have an orientation in his work but fluctuates from side to side. This description is quite correct. Take his Haiti policy for example. Some people estimate that Clinton has changed it four times, and he is now pursuing his fifth Haiti policy. On Haitian refugees, for example, at first he said the United States would accommodate all Haitian refugees, but later pointed out that Haitian refugees should all be repatriated. Now he has changed his mind by saying that Haitian refugees should be screened at sea and only genuine political refugees will be accepted. If the current UN embargo does not work, Clinton will decide whether the United States should dispatch troops. It would not be strange at all for him to change policy. There are many reasons why Clinton's foreign policy is changeable. Before Clinton became president, he was the governor of remote Arkansas, without any experience of diplomacy. But during the presidential campaign against President Bush, who had rich diplomatic experience, he irresponsibly made one commitment after another to show that he had his own views on diplomacy. Facing the political realities of the country and overseas, he has now discovered that the situation is not as simple as he expected. It is only too natural for him to revise his policies after hitting a wall. His policies toward Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, and China are always changeable. An analyst summed it up: It is not hard to know what Clinton's next step is; if he makes a left now, he will make a right next. Several Tests He Will Face Some critics point out that Clinton is not good at diplomacy and is unwilling to spend time studying it. Naturally, he has made "a mess" of diplomacy. But in the weeks to come, Clinton is likely to have no alternative but to spend effort and time on diplomacy. There are some knotty problems, including China's most-favored-nation status, nuclear inspections in Korea, whether or not force will be used against Haiti, whether or not the embargo on Bosnia's muslims should be lifted, and how to reopen economic dialogue with Japan, all of which require decisions. Diplomacy is a time-consuming job. Next week, Clinton will go to Europe to attend the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings, and in July he will go to Europe again to participate in the G-7 summit. In the past, Clinton avoided conscription, but now he is going to Europe to attend a World War II commemoration as U.S. President. This has been criticized by people. People also compare his participation with Reagan's presence 10 years ago at the 40th anniversary of the Normandy landings. How many points he will get has drawn people's attention. More Than Half Are Dissatisfied With His Diplomatic Performance A recent public opinion poll suggests that only 40 percent of Americans find Clinton's diplomatic performance acceptable; 53 percent are dissatisfied. But this is not Clinton's worst aspect. He got his lowest approval scores for his character. After consecutive disclosures about sex and private investment scandals, only 56 percent of people said he had the loyalty and honesty required to be President. This was a 20 percent drop compared with the period just after he became President. But this may not be his lowest point. If the sexual harassment case filed by Paula Jones is pursued and the President stands in the dock, no one can dare say how much further his reputation will decline.
