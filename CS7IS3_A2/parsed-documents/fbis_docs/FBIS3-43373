Radio Mozambique learned that 600 Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] soldiers abandoned two confinement centers in Sofala Province. Faustino Igrejas reports: It is true that 600 Renamo men today abandoned their confinement centers in Chiramba and Magunde in Sofala Province, alleging logistical problems. The Cease-Fire Commission met in Maputo today and centered its discussions on the logistical problems facing the confinement centers. Major Eduardo Alexandre from the Cease-Fire Commission spoke to journalists after the meeting. [Begin recording] [Alexandre] We discussed mainly issues connected with food logistics in confinement centers. It has been observed that in certain confinement centers, Renamo troops are deserting. I refer to Magunde and Chiramba in particular. The meeting is therefore aimed at finding ways of halting these desertions. [Unidentified reporter] What was decided? [Alexandre] It was decided that the government would support its troops during the confinement period, providing them fresh products. [Reporter] Has Renamo already begun to withdraw from Dunda and Salamanga? [Alexandre] As a matter of fact, we shall discuss this problem tomorrow, from the technical viewpoint. It is a situation connected with distance. Renamo feels that it should withdraw only 700 meters, while the (?government) feels that they should withdraw further. [Reporter] Tomorrow's meeting is therefore aimed at discussing Renamo's withdrawal from Dunda and Salamanga? [Alexandre] Tomorrow we shall hold the biggest tripartite meeting to discuss the area Renamo should withdraw to from the area it presently occupies. [end recording] Radio Mozambique also asked Colonel (Sitela) from the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] if he would confirm that 600 Renamo men abandoned their confinement centers in Chiramba and Magunde. [Begin recording] [(Sitela)] Yes. I can confirm that from the information we received. [Unidentified reporter] Is it because of logistical problems? [(Sitela)] I do not know. We [words indistinct] the problem to the Renamo representative [words indistinct]. It is possible that it is because of logistical problems. [Reporter] It seems that the Unomoz had a responsibility, but the government says it has no responsibility? [(Sitela)] Well, I feel that we were able to coordinate views during the Cease-Fire Commission meeting that we have just held. We defined the manner to provide logistical assistance. [Reporter] What will be the manner? [(Sitela)] The government will continue to supply fresh food to its own troops in their confinement areas, including other staples which are already being distributed to the two sides by Unomoz. With regard to Renamo, Unomoz will have the duty of supplying fresh food to Renamo personnel. Thus, the two sides will (?be able to receive) a more favorable (?food supply). Unomoz will be responsible for providing the transportation of food for Renamo personnel, while the government will in principle be responsible for providing transportation of food to its men. If the government needs assistance in the process, Unomoz will do all it can to help. [end recording] An important thing is that the 600 men who abandoned their confinement areas in Chiramba and Magunde in Sofala Province today left without their weapons.
