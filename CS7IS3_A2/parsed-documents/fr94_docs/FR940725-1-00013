FR940725-1-00013 FR940725-1-00002 The FDIC's proposal provides that netting by novation arrangements would not be grandfathered under the standards if such arrangements do not meet all of the requirements proposed for qualifying bilateral netting contracts. Although netting by novation would continue to be recognized under the proposed standards, institutions may not have the legal opinions or procedures in place that would be required by the proposed amendments. The FDIC believes that holding all bilateral netting contracts to the same standards will promote certainty as to the legal enforceability of the contracts and decrease the risks faced by counterparties in the event of a default. The FDIC is seeking comment on all aspects of its proposed amendments to the risk-based capital standards. In addition, the FDIC notes that under current risk-based capital standards for individual contracts, the degree to which collateral is recognized in assigning the appropriate risk weight is based on the market value of the collateral in relation to the credit equivalent amount of the rate contract. The FDIC is seeking comment on the nature of collateral arrangements and the extent to which collateral might be recognized in bilateral netting contracts, particularly taking into account legal implications of collateral arrangements (e.g., whether the collateral pledged for an individual transaction would be available to cover the net counterparty exposure in the event of legal challenge) and procedural difficulties in monitoring collateral levels. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis The FDIC does not believe adoption of this proposal as a final rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities (in this case, small banking organizations), in accord with the spirit and purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). In this regard, the final rule would reduce certain regulatory burdens on banking organizations as it would reduce the capital charge on certain transactions. Banks that enter into bilateral netting contracts must obtain a legal opinion(s) on the enforceability of those contracts if they wish to net for purposes of calculating their capital ratio. A small institution may find it more burdensome to obtain a legal opinion(s) than a large institution. A small institution, however, is more likely than a large institution to enter into relatively uncomplicated transactions under standard bilateral netting contracts and may need only to review a legal opinion that has already been obtained by its counterparties. The benefits to a small institution of lower capital charges after netting will likely outweigh the burdens of obtaining the necessary legal opinions. Paperwork Reduction Act The FDIC has determined that the proposed amendments, if adopted, would not significantly increase the regulatory burden of state nonmember banks pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .).
