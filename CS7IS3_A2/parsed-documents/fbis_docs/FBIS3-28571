Ichikawa expressed the views at a press conference when commenting on Japan's existing security system in relation to Japan's plan to purchase the U.S.-made Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS). "In Asia, too, I think it would be better to establish an axis of collective security equivalent to NATO," Ichikawa said. This is the first reference by Ichikawa to collective security, an issue contravening the constitution which renounces Japan's use of military force as a means of settling international disputes. Ichikawa is known for his close relations with Shinseito co- leader Ichiro Ozawa, one of the main strategists of the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Ozawa also advocates a cooperative security system in Asia. Komeito, which is a member of the coalition government along with six other parties, has recently stepped up criticism of Japan's military policy as having a tendency to enjoy peace while refusing to help conflict-ridden countries. In 1992, Komeito joined hands with the then-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in enacting a Peacekeeping Cooperation Law that enabled the Self-Defense Forces to be sent overseas for the first time since the end of World War II on U.N. peacekeeping missions. "Considering the international situation following the end of the Cold War, we should discuss at this juncture how far it is possible to defend one country alone," Ichikawa said. Noting that NATO works as an military axis in Europe, Ichikawa said, "Asia has the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in the field of economy but it does not have a single axis in the security field." He proposed creation of a collective security system in Asia by integrating APEC and the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as its nucleus and asking the U.S. to join in as well.
