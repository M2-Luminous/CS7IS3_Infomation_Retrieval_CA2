After all, the white flag might at least put an end to the slaughtering and the further escalation of the inconceivable. Sometimes capitulation really is the last resort. But the wild attack on Gorazde by the Serbs cannot be compared with a "normal" war, and this shows the barbarism to which "civilized" Europe is in danger of falling victim. In the 18th century, there was a well-contrived war code that said: After so many hits, the commander of the fortress or city may honorably surrender, whereupon the conquerors march into the city with proper respect. Even in World War II, the "most total" of all wars, the right of capitulation was more or less respected -- see Rome or Paris. But Gorazde? Not capitulation that is followed by mercy, but destruction and expulsion are at issue. No other signal is given by the offensive, which will have soon lasted for three weeks and which does not even refrain from well-aimed shots at hospitals. The conquest of a strategic point is not at issue; the city is to be emptied as much as possible by murders and escape so it will become "Muslim-free." The people know this and that is why they are fighting so desperately for every meter. Capitulation does not promise mercy to them, but terror and death. What follows from it for the rest of the world? The so-called world community must understand that civilians are not murdered here by chance, but "purposefully." It must understand that unrestrained meanness in the form of Serbian tanks has driven the moral duty to the foreground of all considerations, no matter how weighty the strategic and political arguments against intervention are. For: He who does not prevent murder, although he could do so at justifiable risks, becomes guilty. And yet the "world community" seems to watch the horror as if in a trance. The latest Security Council resolution -- the Serbian gentlemen should withdraw from Gorazde -- must have made them laugh. For weeks NATO has been silent. And the Americans, who are playing the key role now as ever, are indulging in hints like in oracles, which everybody may interpret to his liking. Of course, the Germans must be the last to mock at that. For in 1991, they pursued the recognition of Croatia and Slovenia by using their elbows, while being comfortably aware that they -- protected by the self-imposed constitutional tie -- would not have to bear any responsibility. Since yesterday, Clinton's zigzag course has been pointing again to the preparedness to use force: NATO is to threaten with bombs in order to force the Serbs to withdraw heavy weaponry from the surroundings of the six protection zones. Can this intimidate the Serbs once more after their unhindered march to Gorazde? Sam Nunn, a powerful figure in the U.S. Senate, is right: "Pinpricks will not work any longer. We have to be prepared for escalation" -- if necessary, to Serbia. That is the way it is; this is the price of the disgraceful silence for three weeks. Those who shrink from the necessary in time will finally only have the alternative between even more violence and the white flag. The Serbs' call for subjugation is also aimed at the West.
