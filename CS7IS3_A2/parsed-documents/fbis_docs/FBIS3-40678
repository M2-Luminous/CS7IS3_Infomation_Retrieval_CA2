Hegde: "Far-Reaching Implications"] [Text] Extending intellectual property protection to agriculture and the possibility of introduction of patenting of seeds will have a far-reaching impact on the development of Indian agricultural sector and more particularly research concerning biotechnology. Further, in an indirect way, it will also greatly affect the preservation of biodiversity in the context of developing countries. The issues concerning the patentability of an invention is embodied in the "Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, including Trade in Counterfeit Goods," as Annexure III of GATT agreement. Article 27 (1) of this agreement specifies "..tents shall be available for any inventions, whether products or processes, in all fields of technology." This rule is, however, subject to three very important requirements, such as (a) it should be new; (b) it should involve an inventive step, that is, it should not occur in the normal course of its evolution; and (c) it should be capable of industrial application. The agreement does not define these requirements in any way. Accordingly, the assessments as to what factors should constitute these requirements are to be decided by the domestic legislation. A new technological advancement in the arena of automobiles, for example, should fulfill these requirements so as to become patentable. Newness or novelty, as it is called, is taken into account in the context of inventions made anywhere in the world. The efficacious search for novelty depends on the efficiency of a patent system in locating the latest additions of that technology. There is, however, no defined rule as to how a search should be conducted. In other words, the factors which influence an "effective search for novelty" are very highly subjective and contextual. Patent offices and the patent examiners play a crucial role in this regard. The Indian Patent Act, 1970, for example, provides for these criteria of patentability in a substantive manner while enunciating "opposition proceedings to a patent specification." Patent specification, it is said, describes the patentable invention in a best possible manner in such a way that a skilled worker in that particular area of technology should be able to understand it and work it. This gives rise to the following questions: What could be considered as the best possible manner of description of an invention in a patent specification? And how exactly should one define the scope of these patentability criteria in the context of a developing country where technological advancement might have remained at an infant state? Moreover the subjectivity inherent in the procedural aspects and its application will surely create gaps in the legislative standards of developing countries on the one hand, and developed countries on the other. The contents of Article 27(2) outline the contexts which provide for exclusion of patentability of inventions. These contexts relate "to protect public order or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment. "The evaluation of these contexts call for an extensive subjective assessment of these legal norms within a country. How to define situations which could cause serious prejudice to the environment? It is impossible to incorporate such probable situations in any domestic normative set up. Which authority will conclusively decide the necessity for exclusion of certain sectors from patentability? On what grounds a nation's perceptions to preserve its public order, morality and environment could be questioned? The implications of this provision when put into practice is too uncertain. Interestingly, there is no reference made in Article 27(2) to the issues concerning "national interest and security." On these grounds a country can always take measures which are appropriate; in this case, it may decide to exclude certain investions from patentability. Even though the agreement does not make any specific reference to these issues, a sovereign country can always invoke these as a golden rule. Even the GATT's Dispute Settlement Mechanism cannot overlook these factors on pure objective grounds. A perusal of the proposals submitted by a few developed countries, mainly the United States, Japan and European Community shows us that they sought exclusion of inventions from patentability on the grounds of "national security and public interest." The most controversial provision with long-term implications on the patenting of life is embodied in Article 27(3). It allows the exclusion of two categories of subject matters from patentability, namely (a) diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or animals; and (b) plants and animals other than micro-organisms, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than non-biological and micro-biological processes. A provision at the end of the paragraph, however, creates an exception by making it mandatory for the parties to "provide the protection of plant varieties either by patents or by any combination thereof." It also provides for the revision of this provision after four years of its entry into force. Before examining the implications of this provision, it may be worthwhile to recount its ramifications as elaborated by many specialists in the recent times. The Ministry of Commerce holds the view that the provision does not impose any compulsion regarding patenting of seeds or other propagating material. Sui generis protection, according to the Ministry, would imply a system which is different from other categories of intellectual property protection and is thus in a class by itself. In this regard, however, the Ministry of Commerce seeks to make a reference for guidance to outline the sui generis protection of plant varieties to the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, better known as the UPOV Convention. Further, in its view, the rights granted by the UPOV Convention of 1978 extend only to production for commercial marketing of the propagating material, whereas in the case of patents, it extends to production per se. In other words, plant varieties protected by patents would not allow farmers to retain even a part of their produce for sowing in the following season. Sui generis system envisaged by the UPOV Convention of 1978, on the other hand, allows the farmer to retain the seeds. A revised UPOV Convention of 1991 moves that system of plant variety protection closer to patent system by imposing restrictions on the right of the farmer to retain the propagating material even for use on his own holding. Another significant change in this Revised Convention relates to the extension of this right not to a few genera or species but to the whole plant kingdom. The UPOV Convention of 1991 outlines the scope of the breeder's right in almost absolute terms. The authorisation of the breeder is required as per Article 14 (1) for (a) production or reproduction (multiplication); (b) conditioning for the purpose of propagation; (c) offering for sale; (4) selling or other marketing; (e) exporting; (f) importing; and (g) stocking for the above mentioned purposes. In Article 14 (2) it is, however, made clear that "in respect of harvested material, including entire plants or parts of plants, obtained through the unauthorised use of propagating material of the protected variety shall require the authorisation of the breeder, unless the breeder has had reasonable opportunity to exercise his right in relation to the said propagating material." There are three exceptions to the breeder's Rights: (a) acts done privately and for non-commercial purposes; (b) acts done for experimental purposes; and (c) acts done for the purpose of breeding other varieties. The effect of these provisions in conjunction with Dunkel Proposals could be stated in the following way. For example, if a farmer gets a seed in the initial stages, he cannot legally sell that produce to a co-farmer. Therefore, every year each farmer will have to buy seeds. In order to overcome these difficulties in any system of protection following features should be incorporated: (a) free flow of genetic resources between public and private sectors; (b) compulsory release and certification of varieties even for public agencies to check spread of unadapted varieties; (c) companies to compensate the public sector for the use of genetic stock cultivated by them; and (d) the farmer's rights and breeder's rights not to be changed in any way. The apprehensions as regards the operative styles of multinational seed companies in India should also be addressed and proper legal mechanism should be formulated to check their uncontrolled growth. It is necessary in the interest of hundreds of indigenously managed seed companies whose priority is to supply uncontaminated and viable seeds. The system envisaged by the Dunkel proposal will inevitably force most of these companies to close down or be bought over by the big companies. The role of these small comapnies in collaboration with growing co-operative sector in the arena of farming and effective distribution of seeds should 'be considered in greater detail'. In the area of gene sequences, Ministry of Commerce has stated that it would not allow the patenting of "naturally occurring genes." On the other hand, genetic material which has been evolved by human intervention would be allowed to get the protection of patents. However, the Ministry should construe strictly the operational part of this mechanism while differentiating naturally occurring genes from artificial year. A condition should be strictly imposed by calling for payment in commercial terms for the uses of genetic resources extracted from the Indian territory. These resources constitute the source material for the development of biotechnology and other related fields. In conclusion, it should be stated that with the completion of these negotiations the global trade will enter into a new phase which may not be in the interest of developing countries. Multilateralism, for majority of the developing countries, seems to be a better option than the "walk alone" into an unknown and unspecified future. Acceptance of Dunkel proposals, on the other hand, may also not offer any better solution. In fact, it is no choice at all.
