Sassa; place and date not given: "Siberia Can Be Warm, Too: Refugees' Fate"] [Text] This service is located at Krasnyy Prospect, in the former national economic council building. It occupies just three small rooms on the fourth floor. The entire staff is six people. The problems the migration service is dealing with are many, however, and all of them are difficult, requiring a lot of hard work and human empathy. The Russian Federal Migration Service was set up recently, when the Soviet Union disintegrated, when tens of millions of Russians suddenly found themselves abroad and in a number of places deprived of elementary human rights. The word "refugees" entered our vocabulary. Our correspondent met with Yuriy Mikhaylovich Moshkov, the head of the Novosibirsk Oblast migration service, and Mikhail Sergeyevich Bakshin, his deputy. [Sassa] Tell me please, what is the trend in the migration process? Has the flow of refugees not diminished during winter months? [Answer] We also assumed that the cold Siberian winter would reduce the number of people coming here. We were mistaken. The same number--450-550 people--arrive every month as did in the summer. Last year our oblast accepted more than 40,000 refugees and forced resettlers. All in all, more than 2 million people arrived in Russia. The time of year and weather conditions have no effect on flow intensity. If people leave behind apartments, dachas, everything they have accumulated over the years, it means that they absolutely cannot live in these conditions. We talk to every person, listen to their sad, tragic tales, and therefore have a good idea of the situation in which our compatriots have found themselves. We see people who are barely clothed, semi-starved. Here, for instance, a young woman from Tajikistan. Not a kopek, head uncovered, no passport, no labor service book. Turns out that her home was hit by a bomb. We took her to the social protection department. They gave her a cap, jeans, some other things, and R5,000. The militia issued papers to her. Then they started looking for a job, which is very difficult now. Finally they found her a job as an attendant in one of the hospitals. She lives right there. Or a Georgian family--husband, wife, two children. They made it from Sukhumi to Moscow. No money to buy tickets to go from there. The woman sold the only valuable possession--her wedding ring. They called acquaintances in Novosibirsk, who sent the money. This was enough for three tickets. The mother and children came to our city. The husband is still in Moscow. [Sassa] So it is not only Russians who are coming here? [Answer] Most are Russians, of course. But there are also many people of other nationalities. There are many Armenians, Ukrainians, Tatars, Tajiks. Some Azerbaijani, Moldovans, Chechens, Abkhazians, Germans, Ossetians, Kazakhs, Turks, Jews, Chuvash... People of all kinds of professions, including doctors, teachers, and scientists. The telephone rings. Yuriy Mikhaylovich greets the caller, listens, and says: "No, no. You cannot delay the move. You absolutely have to be in place by March or April. Keep it in mind that potatoes and vegetables are planted in May here. And you absolutely have to have a vegetable garden--you have children. You know yourself what life is like... This is one of the farms in Moshkovskiy Rayon. There is housing, school, a cafeteria, running water. No money whatsoever? That is all right, we will help you with the move..." Our conversation continues. [Sassa] Does it not look like opportunities to house people and find jobs for them are dwindling? There are already unemployed and semi-unemployed in our oblast as well. [Answer] This is true. Nevertheless, we are still able to somehow help the people left without any shelter. Our service maintains contacts with the employment and social protection services, with enterprises and organizations, with oblast rayons, kolkhozes, sovkhozes, joint-stock societies. Right now there are 5,500 job vacancies in the oblast. The demand is mostly for skilled workers and construction workers. Fast development of commercial activities and the emergence of a large number of businessmen relieves some pressure. Many people found cozy jobs in commercial structures, they resell the goods bought from wholesalers. Some agricultural enterprises help to house and provide jobs for people. There is the Aleksanxdrovskoye Joint-Stock Society [AO] in Maslyaninskiy Rayon, which is headed by Valeriy Ivanovich Prikhno. They accepted 14 families. More than 30 resettler families received housing and jobs in Suzdalskoye AO, where Nikolay Nikolayevich Goryunov is the chairman. Iskitimskiy and Moshkovskiy Rayons build apartments and create jobs. [Sassa] Where do they get the money? [Answer] The Federal Migration Service helps. It does not have much money, but you can get some. If you knock on the door, they will open it. Take, for instance, the head of the Moshkovskiy Rayon administration. He personally went to Moscow, told of his plans, shared his troubles, and came back with R74 million "in a pocket." The Aleksandrovskoye AO was among aid recipients. We have to underline one important detail here. Many heads of administrations, and enterprise and farm directors do not use the opportunity to improve to a certain extent the situation of their collectives with the help of the migration service. There are many unfinished production facilities in villages and cities, as well as housing. If their construction is completed, it will produce new jobs and new apartments. But the owners do not have the money. This is where the migration service may become a magic wand. An economic manager submits a project for the facility to us, indicates how many new jobs it will create, and how many refugees he can accept and provide housing for. We send these documents to Moscow, and there is a good chance of getting positive results. A telephone call. Yu. Moshkov: "Fergana? What do you have? No, we do not pay for the move. We do not have housing. Why can you not live in Uzbekistan? Language... Well, the children should study Uzbek if you live there. Impossible to live... Well, you decide. If you come, you will get papers as refugees and temporary resettlers. What does it give you? The right to obtain a residence permit to live with relatives or acquaintances regardless of the size of their living space. Then you can get an interest-free loan for home construction. So you think about it..." [Sassa] The call from Fergana has interrupted us... Are there examples that will support that your offer is realistic? [Answer] Take the same Moshkovo. They are building 12 apartments there. By the agreement with the migration service, which has provided the money, the oblast migration service will get six apartments intended for refugees; three apartments go to local authorities, to be distributed at their discretion; and three are placed at Moscow's disposal. [Sassa] Moscow?! [Answer] Yes, they have a very difficult situation there. Four and a half thousand refugees live in hotels, room-and-board facilities, and pioneer camps. We visited one such room-and-board facility. It is Vatutinka, which belongs to the Council of Ministers' economic administration. There are 118 refugee families living there. It was decided to set up a rehabilitation center in this facility; equipment has been brought in, but they cannot install it. Refugees do not want to leave their temporary shelter. Moscow has to "unload" its refugees. Therefore, in the agreements the republic service puts in a clause that some apartments go to them. Two young men enter the office. They are from Kazakhstan, from Semipalatinsk. Both are construction workers, have families, apartments. But no job. There are no prospects. It is impossible to sell the apartments. And even if they do sell them, it will be very cheap and only for local money. What are they going to do with this money in Russia? Yuriy Mikhaylovich and Mikhail Sergeyevich tell of the situation in the oblast: that construction workers will find jobs here; that one can now buy a house in a rural area with yard structures and a vegetable garden, inexpensive by current standards--about R4-R5 million. But the men do not have these "lemons." If the apartments could be sold as a noncash transaction and Kazakh money converted into rubles through official channels... The interlocutors take time to discuss the feasibility of such an operation... The visitors leave with some hope. [Sassa] So you are saying that refugees get free of charge the apartments built with the help of migration service? [Answer] Yes, but under certain conditions. They do not have the right to sell or exchange the apartments, and must work in the organization to which the apartments belong. Because enterprises accept refugees in professions and skills they need. [Sassa] One can understand it when Russians move from Central Asia, the Baltics, the Caucasus. But why do Georgians from Abkhazia not go to Georgia, or Armenians from Azerbaijan not want to go to Armenia? [Answer] These people have learned what war is like; they have seen senseless bloodshed. They abandon everything they held dear and escape from hell to where at this point there is no shooting; where the situation is more or less stable; where they can save the children. The Russian people are great in their generosity, good-naturedness, and hospitality. Themselves impoverished, humiliated, and insulted, having become "occupiers" and "strangers" in those newest states that they had protected, made them strong and prosperous; they share the last with the people crippled by fate. They understand that it was not these ordinary people who started the competition of sovereignties. And so it became warmer in Siberia than in Central Asia or Transcaucasus. And what if, God forbid, shooting begins here? We have no place to run... Another telephone call. A young woman says: "Thank you, good people!" She and her husband came here straight from the train station. He has a Category II disability. Used to work as an explosives expert in a mine in Uzbekistan. Something happened: He got "pushed," with damage to the spine. Everything they had they have used up for food. Came here without a penny. Problems cannot be solved in one day. The arrivals spent the night at a train station. Then spent another day there. Meanwhile, people from the migration service were struggling to find a place for them to live. They talked a student dormitory superintendent into taking them in for just one night. Then they found the money to pay for one week in a hotel. Meanwhile, they were calling around at enterprises and organizations. Finally they found some gardening cooperative that hired the resettlers as watchmen. This means free room, electricity, a plot, and some pay. The gardeners helped with potatoes and vegetables. The woman confessed once: "I was on the verge on jumping in front of a train..." Yuriy Mikhaylovich, a kindest man, exploded: "Forget these idiotic ideas. Did you read Sholokhov's "A Man's Fate"; did you see the movie? Andrey Sokolov returned from war--everything has been destroyed, it lays in ruins. He has nothing but the clothes on his back. He took Vanyusha by hand and went to look for a new destiny... And you? You are still young!" I was listening to this tale, looking at the window sill in Moshkov's office. Two different flowers shared one pot. Yuriy Mikhaylovich perked up: "See, I found this bulb. Brought it here and stuck into the pot. Before you know it, a shoot came out. Leaves sprouted. A bud formed. And now look--it is blooming. It is holding to the soil by white threads, but what a beautiful red flower! I have to add more soil..."
