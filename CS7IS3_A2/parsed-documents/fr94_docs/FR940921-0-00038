Crankcase emissions are prohibited beginning with the 1998 model year. 2The NO X standard is 4.0 g/BHP-hr for all 1998 and later model year HDEs. 3For optional compliance prior to the 1997 model year this standard is 0.10 g/BHP-hr for the 1994 and later model year, except for urban bus engines. For urban bus engines the optional standards are 0.07 g/BHP-hr for the 1994 and 1995 model years, and 0.05 g/BHP-hr for the 1996 model year. The required standard for 1997 and later model year urban bus engines is 0.05 g/BHP-hr.
