The revolution is our guarantor and the struggle is the means with which to protect our people and regain our rights. The mosque massacre and all the enemy's massacres, practises, and policies explicitly prove it is impossible to coexist with this enemy, and that our people's only option is that of the revolution and struggle to defend our existence and rights. These crimes exposed for the umpteenth time the wretchedness and futility of the settlement course, and the suspect peace calls. More than this, these crimes offer new evidence as to the catastrophic dangers posed by this course and these venomous calls not only to the security of the nation and the people but to the personal safety of the defenseless citizen who is prostrated in prayer in God's places of worship. Masses of our Arab and Islamic nation, in wake of all this, will the supporters of the negotiations and of what is falsely termed peace repent, or do they relish telling lies, forging the people's will, conceding rights, reneging the martyrs, tampering with the nation's destiny under claims of rationalism and waging a struggle on the negotiations table, and competing to submit to the enemy under the excuse that there is no other alternative? Faced with the enemy's massacres and its plan to destroy us, can there be any other option than self-defense? Has treason and the course of capitulation protected anyone, even those who are performing prayers in God's places of worship? We call on the nation's masses and the Palestinian people to cling to the intifadah and armed struggle option, and to escalate, protect, and support the intifadah in a manner that would topple the Gaza-Jericho agreement and its symbols, led by traitor 'Arafat. Glory and immortality to the righteous martyrs of the Ibrahimi Mosque, and of our intifadah and revolution. Greetings to our people's heroic intifadah. Shame on the traitors and agents. We pledge to pursue the struggle until the attainment of all the our people's objectives of liberation and repatriation. Victory for the revolution and immortality for our martyrs. The odious bloody massacre by rancorous Zionist gangs devoid of human feeling, and thirsty for killing and destroying all that is Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim is a crime against our defenseless people and the groups of worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn on 25 February 1994. It testfies once again to the racist and sanguinary nature of this entity, and clearly exposes its persistence to carry out the policy of killing, persecuting, and destroying all that is Arab, Palestinian, and Muslim. At the same time, this reprehensible crime highlights the meaning, nature, and upshot of the Zionist-U.S. peace and the role of the Oslo conspiracy and the treasonous Gaza-Jericho agreement and its subsequent chapters. Masses of our Arab and Islamic nation, Yes, this is the accurate interpretation of the Zionist-U.S. peace. It consists of daily massacres, of persecution and starvation, and of destruction and eviction. While criminal Zionist Rabin and his traitor partner 'Arafat sign with one hand the documents and chapters of the conspiracy in Oslo, Washington, and Cairo, they hurl with the other hand bombs and open fire on the defenseless sons of our people in mosques, streets, and houses, emphasizing that the peace that is sought is one of surrendering to the Zionist butcher's knife, and defining the form of the peace they want with the blood of our people and sons. While the Zionists pursue their massacres against the innocent and the defenseless, the traitors persist with their betrayal of the people, the cause, and the martyrs, and continue to submit to the enemy, thus confirming to it that its methods are successful and encouraging it to pursue the policy of destroying our people. They did not learn lessons from their agreement with Philip Habib, when they opted for their safety and left our people in Beirut as prey for the Zionist and islolationist gangs, under Sharon. Our people at the time were massacred in Sabra and Shatila. They also did not learn lessons from Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, and al-Dawayimah, and from all the massacres the Zionist gangs committed to expel our people and force them to become refugees. They never learned the lesson and led our people from one massacre to the other under the mirage of settlements, lies, treason, and the falsification of facts as they had forged the people's will. Now, they impudently claim that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron seeks to foil the so-called Gaza-Jericho agreement, although Rabin and Peres have been announcing that they were negotiating with themselves and that they got all that they wanted. This means that the traitors threaten our people with more massacres if they do not condone their treason.
