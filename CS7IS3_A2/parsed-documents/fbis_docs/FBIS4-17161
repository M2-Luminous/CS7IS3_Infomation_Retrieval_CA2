He believes that "the public feelings in Chechnya, especially among the opposition to current President Dzhokhar Dudayev, are increasingly proving to the republic's aspiration for closer ties with Russia". In contrast to Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray, Filatov does not link the proposed talks to early elections in Chechnya. However, he still presses the republic for recognizing its status as a subject of the Federation and for concluding a bilateral agreement similar to that between Russia and Tatarstan. Chechnya has not yet clarified its stand on these two issues Russia lays down as the necessary condition for talks to get under way, the chief of the presidential staff noted. According to him, the Chechen side submitted its own draft of a bilateral agreement with Russia "which is on the whole quite acceptable for consideration in the course of talks", but remained rather inarticulate as concerns its status within the Russian Federation. Filatov said Russia had a "tough" and a "soft" options in settling its differences with Chechnya. The "tough" one provides, in particular, for shifting the Russian railway from Chechen territory, since crime and plundering on the railway exceed all bounds. "but before resorting to tough measures, we should try soft ones", he pointed out.
