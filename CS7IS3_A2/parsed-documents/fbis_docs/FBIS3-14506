According to a statement sent to AFP Monday evening by the opposition leftist Ettahaddi party, the president stressed that the "government is now waiting for the FIS to keep its promise to stop terrorism." The statement did not say what the government may have promised the FIS, which it officially banned in January 1992 after the army intervened to cancel a general election the FIS looked poised to win. Government dialogue with the banned party has been a point of controversy in recent days, since the Islamic Society Movement (MSI) released a statement, which the government contested, implying that FIS leaders were talking with the government. The MSI is a moderate Islamist rival of the FIS. According to Ettahaddi, Zeroual "assured that dialogue (with political parties) would not be exclusive," but that he would "leave out any who attack the constitution." He also said that the government would not discuss anything that "is not negotiable." The goal of the talks, which began last Wednesday, is to form a National Transition Council. The proposed body would have 200 members representing political parties, the government, unions and professional organisations. The organisation would be a quasi-legislative body in which the FIS would occupy around 40 seats. The council is scheduled to get underway by the end of April.
