It will be recalled that Lee Hamilton, head of the House Subcommittee on Europe and Middle East Affairs who defends the view that Turkey should allow the Kurds to establish a federation or a state of their own, claimed in the Congress two days ago that the Clinton Administration has violated the embargo on Iraq. According to Hamilton, the allocation of funds for the Kurds for the acquisition of oil from the Baghdad Administration constitutes a violation of the UN sanctions. Several sources in Ankara have described Hamilton's approach as aimed at justifying the plans that have been drawn up to fragment Iraq for the establishment of an independent state in the northern part of that country. The sources said that the export of oil from Iraq would be a violation of the UN embargo but, technically speaking, the transfer of oil by the Baghdad Administration from one part of that country to another cannot be regarded as a violation of the sanctions. An official has said that Hamilton may be right only if a Kurdish State existed in northern Iraq. He asserted: "The United States, European Union, and Turkey have provided humanitarian aid to the Kurds in northern Iraq. That applies to the need of the Kurds for fuel. They have used the funds the United States has made available to them to acquire oil from al-Mawsil. That cannot be described as a violation of the embargo because the oil remains in Iraq. However, any attempt to take the oil out of Iraq will violate the embargo. Hamilton wished to hint that a Kurdish State exists above the 36th parallel in Iraq. He believes that the embargo has been violated because a foreign state has purchased oil from Iraq with U.S. funds. It seems that he is convinced that Iraq has been divided into two parts and that anything that crosses from the south to the northern part of the 36th parallel is an exported commodity." Considering the fact that Iraq's territorial integrity is essential for the preservation of Turkey's territorial integrity, Ankara is convinced that the Clinton Administration has not violated the embargo from a technical viewpoint. However, officials have drawn attention to the following: Funds Have Been Transferred Technically speaking, the embargo may not have been violated. Nevertheless, funds have been transferred to Baghdad through the Kurds in Iraq. However, Turkey's plan to withdraw oil from the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline does not require the transfer of funds to the Baghdad Administration. The source that will be created through the withdrawal of the oil from that pipeline will be channeled to Iraq in the form of foodstuffs. The signs we have received from Washington indicate that Turkey and the United States may agree on that plan. In fact, Ankara expects the U.S. Administration to finalize its assessment during the next few days. The UN Security Council or the UN Sanctions Committee will most likely make the necessary "changes" to allow Turkey's plan to be put into effect. Meanwhile, it has been ascertained that the Kurdish officials in northern Iraq have proposed to Ankara that Turkey should move to prospect for oil in their part of the country.
