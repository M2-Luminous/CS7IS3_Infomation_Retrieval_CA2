FBIS4-7741 "dreeu066_h_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-066 Daily Report 7 Mar 1994 HUNGARY Parties Support, Condemn Radio Dismissals Parties Support, Condemn Radio Dismissals 94P20502A Budapest MAGYAR NEMZET in Hungarian 7 Mar 94 p 4 94P20502A Budapest MAGYAR NEMZET Hungarian CSO [Article by Fazekas-Sumegi-Varju: "Parties' Expressions of Support, Condemnation"] [Excerpt] In the "Sunday News" radio program, Sandor Lezsak, managing director of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum], answering questions from listeners about the dismissals at the radio, answered that the attacks related to the dismissals started immediately. Critics questioned the qualifications of managers and editors, he continued, who--having taken the places of the fired persons--have not had a chance to prove themselves. In his opinion, it is necessary to wait until the newly appointed editors show evidence that they are truly rendering a public service and consider providing unbiased information to be their primary task. Speaking to the reporter, he said: "I understand you people, you find it very difficult to work, but from what I've seen, work is continuing at the radio and the mood is good." Answering a listener's question about the MDF surpassing (to quote verbatim) the previous government's "villainy," Lezsak announced that it is symbolic of the degree of press freedom that such statements were being made into the "Sunday News" program's microphones. * * * The Executive Committee of the KDNP [Christian Democratic People's Party] judges the reduction in force, which is a necessary evil that seems to be inevitable for financial reasons and which was planned already before the system change, the same way that it regards the similar forced steps taken by any other institution. However, at other institutions workers do not have the possibility of representing their interests in the domestic and international press. The KDNP rejects the assumption that the dismissals were initiated by the government. It considers it unjustified and harmful for political parties to try to interfere directly in the internal affairs of the radio. In its opinion, the statement of the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] and the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats]--which noted that if they win the election they will rehire the fired workers--is a mockery of media freedom. The Christian Democrats hope that the time of direct party direction and intervention in the life of institutions has passed. "There must be no returning to the past!" ends the KDNP's statement. * * * Limiting freedom always begins with limiting freedom of the press, said Alajos Dornbach at the SZDSZ's political talk show on Saturday, kicking off their campaign. According to the National Assembly vice president, the government allowed its vassals to take these steps. They are afraid of a leftist danger, and at the same time they are centralizing mass communication so that people will not be able to choose among the various parties. Ivan Peto said that the government has ensured that the Democratic Charter's protest, which is planned for 14 March, will have plenty of substance. Gabor Fodor called the events a blatant political cleansing. In his opinion, once the new government takes over, Gabor Nahlik and Laszlo Csucs [acting presidents of Hungarian television and Hungarian radio, respectively] will be out in a matter of seconds. They have proved themselves to be politically biased and professionally unsuitable, so there can be no confidence in them. He also brought up the government's responsibility, saying that it pushes ahead using Csucs and Nahlik as battering rams. At the news conference after the meeting, Ivan Peto expressed the opinion that the people who were fired had played a much bigger role in creating freedom of information that the people who fired them. He called it regrettable that journalists must be afraid if they or their information sources say anything critical of the government. He added at the same time that no one has ever been able to win elections by such means. "However, we do not want the government to help the SZDSZ's campaign to achieve success by such means," he added with irony. The IDE [Youth Democratic Association], the SZDSZ's youth organization, notes with outrage the fact that political cleansing has taken place at the public-service Hungarian Radio. * * * At a news conference over the weekend, Istvan Csurka expressed the opinion that the firings at the radio were an important step toward creating freedom of the press. According to the chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIEP), if this step had been taken in 1990, the country would be in a completely different situation. Csurka also announced that with the support of 88 organizations and parties, the Hungarian Way Circles Movement is organizing a friendly protest in the interest of a free Hungarian press on 15 March at 1400 in Szabadsag Square. According to him, the reason they are not holding the demonstration at the Petofi statue is that Lord Mayor Gabor Demszky simply rented the square from midnight on 15 March to midnight the next day. The MIEP chairman dissociated himself well before the fact from any provocations that may occur, saying that in today's situation such an event can only be held amid great danger. In connection with the recent events at the radio, Zsolt Lanyi, chairman of the Budapest branch of the FKGP [Independent Smallholders Party], who supports the 15 March protest, announced that his party considers the radio to be too pro-government. MIEP Spokesman Bela Gyori announced that on Friday several people broke into Laszlo Csucs's office and, while he was in the government's office, they purportedly smeared his chair and desk with feces. According to Gyori, the perpetrators are known, but he was not willing to betray their names. * * * The Agrarian Alliance considers the dismissals at the radio to be the newest evidence of the mockery of press freedom and of the grinding into the dust of nonpartisan and objective information. With these steps the government and the vice president of the radio, who has full presidential power, have violated their constitutional duties. For this reason the Agrarian Alliance calls on Prime Minister Peter Boross to initiate Laszlo Csucs's immediate dismissal and to ensure personnel measures that will regain the people's trust. There is democracy in Hungary, but we will only have proof of this after the election, when it will become clear whether or not the political line that misuses its power suffers a failure, emphasized Republic Party Chairman Janos Palotas on Saturday evening at a citizen's forum in the country seat of Vas County. In his opinion, the chiefs of the national media cannot set their judgment above that of the nation; that is, if six or seven times as many listeners or television viewers want to listen to or watch a program than the number that do not, then no one can take this right from them. Those who were dismissed generally prepared such programs, he emphasized. Speaking of the dismissals at the radio, party Chairman Zoltan Kiraly stated at a meeting of the MSZDP [Hungarian Social Democratic Party] in Komlo that when dilettantes get into power--and this pertains not only to the radio but also to the television--it is clearly their aim, and it is also in their interest in terms of power politics, to get rid of talented people who are good at their jobs.
