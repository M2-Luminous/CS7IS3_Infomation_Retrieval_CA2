It stresses that this war, which is not in the interest of Yemen or its people, could have been averted. After explaining the effects of this war on Yemen's economy, AL- THAWRAH calls on the Yemeni leadership to rise to the level of its national and pan-Arab responsibility, and to respond to the homeland's call and the UN Security Council's demand to stop the massacres and destruction. The Yemeni people, who are concerned about unity, are certain that what is taking place is not for the sake of unity, which they chose and sought for their future so that they might enjoy safety, security, and progress in all walks of life. AL-THAWRAH stresses that the continuation of this war threatens the fabric of the Yemeni homeland by fomenting sedition and hostility among the sons of the one homeland. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: The Yemeni leadership must take into consideration the results of continued fighting in terms of casting doubts on the possibility of achieving Arab unity, and consequently, damaging the credibility of the principle of Arab unity, and harming the Arabs' image in the world.
