TSE President Dr. Arturo Zaldivar said the TSE has everything ready for a second round. Political party representatives who were asked, however, listed the inconveniences a second round would cause. Therefore, they have asked citizens to make every effort to vote on Sunday to decide once and for all their future. A second round would cause generalized uncertainty, directly affecting investments. Likewise, new elections would freeze bureaucratic work. Just organizing a second round would cost millions [currency not specified]. The parties would have to spend money on new propaganda. Citizens would be again exposed to partisan propaganda. Voters would have to face further discomfort. Zaldivar, on the other hand, rejected a possible FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] election challenge in Chalatenango Department. The FMLN are dissatisfied about concentrating four municipality voting sites in the department's capital. Zaldivar said it is not true that the UN is pressuring them to leave the polling stations in Arcatao, San Jose las Flores, Nueva Trinidad, and San Isidro Labrador. "We do not accept domestic or foreign pressures," the official stated. He said the FMLN has no possibility of challenging the elections there because the TSE is in compliance with the law. On this Zaldivar said: "Challenges are made when the law is disregarded. We are obeying the law." He added that the general rule is that voting should occur in the municipalities but the same law covers exceptions. It states that voting places may be changed due to unforeseen circumstances or in rare cases. Other voting places have also been changed, like San Francisco Gotera, which was moved to Cara Sucia, and Colon, which will be moved to Lourdes. "In these cases, nothing was said because there is simply no political interest," Zaldivar said.
