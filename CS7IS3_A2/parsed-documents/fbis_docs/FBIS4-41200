It is aimed at improving the work of the rayon link and reducing the number of officials in these structures. The city's administrative division has changed: Three rayons -- Admiralteyskiy, Kurortnyy, and Tsentralnyy -- have been organized on the basis of seven rayons. Work is under way on the formation of the concept of local self-management. For this a directive from the mayor has formed a working group consisting of workers from the city hall and rayon administrations and representatives of the public.
