On 14 June, this strike degenerated into acts of violence, during which the students molested the rector as well as his deputy, and ransacked the rector's office. Reacting to this situation, the government, through Higher Education Minister Rene Ndemezo'Obiang, announced various measures. It closed down the university as of this morning, expelled four students, and ordered all students to vacate the campus. The striking students, who belong to the Front of Radical University Students and Gabonese University Students Union, are considered the organizers of the recent acts of violence. The government has also decided to prosecute student leaders and revise the university franchise laws. These measures were taken to avoid the recurrence of such acts of aggression on the campus in the future.
