He urged public security organs to enhance their awareness, have a clear idea on what is important, vigorously carry out preparatory work to truly deepen the struggle and produce new results. He urged them to nurture a strong force to accomplish the arduous task of defending reform and opening up, and of safeguarding stability. Tao Siju said: Since the second plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission last August, the Ministry of Public Security, under the leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council; and public security organs in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, under the leadership of their local party committees and governments, have attached great importance to the anti-corruption struggle. With a strong determination, they swiftly swing into action. Thanks to the effective measures and a tremendous amount of work performed, they have achieved varying degrees of success in attaining the interim goals established by the Ministry of Public Security party committee on the basis of the three tasks set by the central authorities. Leading cadres at the departmental level and above, and county and city (district) public security directors and commissars have generally carried out internal investigation and rectification, and have enhanced self-discipline and integrity. Discipline was strictly enforced, and a number of cases of violation of law and discipline were earnestly investigated and dealt with. The unhealthy practice of public security organs in coastal areas taking part in smuggling and shielding smugglers has been effectively curbed. The unhealthy practice of wanton collection of fees has basically stopped. The question of public security organs going into business and setting up enterprises has been initially resolved. The practice of unfairness in enforcing the law, of breaking the law to seek personal gain, and of imposing fines instead of criminal punishment has been effectively checked. Tao Siju continued: Under no circumstances should we overestimate our recent achievement in combating corruption, nor should we take problems existing in our ranks lightly. We must not ignore the serious problems in our ranks simply because our ranks are good in general. If our ranks become corrupt, it would seriously damage our party and government images. In addition, we will not be able to discharge the heavy responsibility of safeguarding stability and we may even endanger stability. Public security organs shoulder a heavy responsibility in combating corruption; we must remain sober-minded. Tao Siju pointed out: Public Security organs must wage the struggle against corruption with reference to their characteristics and give due emphasis to important issues. They must give top priority to and earnestly investigate such abuses in the law enforcement process as breaking the law to embezzle money for personal gain, extorting confessions by torture, and abusing their power for personal gain in issuing licenses, certificates, and household registration cards. Efforts should be made to investigate cases of serious violation of law and discipline involving leading organs, leading cadres, and police cadres and men. Tao Siju stressed: Public security organs must strengthen leadership and establish a system of leadership responsibility in deepening the struggle against corruption. Beginning from the Ministry of Public Security, every public security organ shall be responsible for their subordinate agencies and report to their superior. Leading cadres at each level must attend to the building of the public security ranks while taking care of their work. We must strengthen management awareness and have the courage to enforce strict discipline in public security units. Leaders who pay no attention to the building of the ranks are not qualified to serve as leaders. When problems occur in the ranks, leaders concerned, as well as the parties involved, will be held accountable. To carry out the struggle against corruption, we must strengthen the building of a clean government on a long-term basis. This requires education and the establishment of a system. Public security organs at all levels must continue to educate police cadres and men to establish the goal of serving the people wholeheartedly and to educate them in the mass and legal concepts. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen rules and regulations and establish a sound supervision mechanism. It is particularly necessary to vigorously establish systems. Tao Siju concluded by asking public security organs' discipline inspection and supervision departments, as well as administrative departments, to strengthen work and create a situation in which everyone is involved in comprehensively improving public security, and successfully carrying out the struggle against corruption.
