(c) Indoor air quality (IAQ) compliance program . (1) All employers with workplaces covered by paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall establish a written IAQ compliance program. (2) The employer shall identify a designated person who is given the responsibility to assure implementation of the IAQ compliance program. (3) Written plans for compliance programs shall include at least the following: (i) A written narrative description of the facility building systems; (ii) Single-line schematics or as-built construction documents which locate major building system equipment and the areas that they serve; (iii) Information for the daily operation and management of the building systems, which shall include at least a description of normal operating procedures, special procedures such as seasonal start-ups and shutdowns, and a list of operating performance criteria including, but not limited to minimum outside air ventilation rates, potable hot water storage and delivery temperatures, range of space relative humidities, and any space pressurization requirements; (iv) A general description of the building and its function including but not limited to, work activity, number of employees and visitors, hours of operation, weekend use, tenant requirements and known air contaminants released in the space; (v) A written maintenance program for the maintenance of building systems which shall be preventive in scope and reflect equipment manufacturer's recommendations and recommended-good-practice as determined by the building systems maintenance industry. At a minimum, the maintenance program shall describe the equipment to be maintained, and establish maintenance procedures and frequency of performance; (vi) A checklist for the visual inspection of building systems. (4) The following additional information, if available, shall be retained by the employer to assist in potential indoor air quality evaluations: (i) As-built construction documents; (ii) HVAC system commissioning reports; (iii) HVAC systems testing, adjusting and balancing reports; (iv) Operations and maintenance manuals; (v) Water treatment logs; and (vi) Operator training materials. (5) The employer shall establish a written record of employee complaints of signs or symptoms that may be related to building-related illness to include at least information on the nature of the illness reported, number of employees affected, date of employee complaint, and remedial action, if any, taken to correct the source of the problem. (d) Compliance program implementation . Employers shall assure compliance with this section by implementing at least the following actions: (1) Maintain and operate the HVAC system to assure that it operates up to original design specifications and continues to provide at least the minimum outside air ventilation rate, based on actual occupancy, required by the building code, mechanical code, or ventilation code applicable at the time the facility was constructed, renovated, or remodeled, whichever is most recent; (2) Conduct building systems inspections and maintenance in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section; (3) Assure that the HVAC system is operating during all work shifts, except during emergency HVAC repairs and during scheduled HVAC maintenance; (4) Implement the use of general or local exhaust ventilation where housekeeping and maintenance activities involve use of equipment or products that could reasonably be expected to result in hazardous chemical or particulate exposures to employees working in other areas of the building or facility; (5) Maintain relative humidity below 60% in buildings with mechanical cooling systems; (6) The employer shall monitor carbon dioxide levels when routine maintenance under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is done. When the carbon dioxide level exceeds 800 ppm, the employer shall check to make sure the HVAC system is operating as it should. If it is not, the employer shall take necessary steps to correct deficiencies if they exist. (7) Assure that buildings without mechanical ventilation are maintained so that windows, doors, vents, stacks and other portals designed or used for natural ventilation are in operable condition; (8) Assure that mechanical equipment rooms and any non-ducted air plenums or chases that transport air are maintained in a clean condition, hazardous substances are properly stored to prevent spillage, and asbestos, if friable, is encapsulated or removed so that it does not enter the air distribution system; (9) Assure that inspections and maintenance of building systems are performed by or under the supervision of the designated person;
