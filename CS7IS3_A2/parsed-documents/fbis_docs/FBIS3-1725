The meeting decided to hold the Second Plenary Session of the ACJA Fourth Council in the near future; it also discussed the work report and the revised draft of the "Norm of Professional Ethics for Chinese Journalists," which will be submitted to the plenary council meeting for deliberations. ACJA Chairman Wu Lengxi presided over the meeting. Secretary Wang Zheren briefed the council meeting on the drafting of the work report. In discussing the work report, permanent members of the council maintained: Since the fourth council held its first plenary session in 1991, the ACJA, local journalists' associations, and special journalists' associations have done a great deal of work in helping, organizing, and pushing the press to vigorously publicize Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, reform, opening up, the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, and adherence to a correct orientation for public opinion, with economic construction as the center. They have made achievements in implementing the norm of professional ethics, opposing "paid journalism," commending advanced journalists and units, and cultivating and building up the force of journalists. They have also made significant progress in selecting and awarding good news articles, promoting professional exchanges, holding academic symposiums, pushing journalistic reform, and launching journalistic exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. Participants in the meeting noted: Last year, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee adopted a decision on several issues concerning the establishment of a socialist market economic structure; at a national work conference on propaganda and ideology held by the central authorities, Comrade Jiang Zemin called for "arming the people with scientific theories, guiding them with correct public opinions, cultivating them with a lofty spirit, and inspiring them with excellent works." These have further clarified the orientation and set the missions for the press in propaganda and building up its force. The upcoming second plenary session of the council should make the implementation of the guidelines of these two conferences its subject, unify and encourage the broad masses of journalists to thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and adhere to the correct orientation for pubic opinion to create a good press environment for reform, opening up, and stability; advertise the main theme of economic construction, reform, and opening up; and, in the meantime, make greater efforts to publicize the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. In the course of journalistic reform, we should avoid the practice of stressing economic returns only and ignoring social benefits, as well as the tendency of pandering to low tastes. We should continue to make building up the force of journalists our central work, strive to improve journalists' ideological and professional levels, strengthen professional ethics, and keep honest practices and self-discipline. Permanent members of the council noted: Being important social organizations of the press, journalists' associations should fully use their clout as mass organizations to conduct activities with their own characteristics, inspire the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of journalists, so that the work of journalists' associations will be more animate and lively. To suit the development of situation, it is necessary to make appropriate supplements and revisions to the "Norm of Professional Ethics for Chinese Journalists." Permanent members of the council discussed the revised draft at the meeting. The meeting agreed to recruit Yang Shangde, Liang Heng, Sun Yongren, Zhang Enhua, Wang Yunxiang, and Zhang Biao as permanent members to the council. Also attending the council meeting were ACJA vice chairmen Shao Huaze, Li Yan, Guo Chaoren, Ma Qingxiong, Ding Ximan, Zhang Cong, Yang Zicai, and others.
