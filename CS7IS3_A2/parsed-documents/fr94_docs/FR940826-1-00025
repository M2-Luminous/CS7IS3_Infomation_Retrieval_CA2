FR940826-1-00025 FR940826-1-00002 Statement of Consideration The provisions proposed to be revised are the supply plant shipping percentages for the months of September 1994 through February 1995. The proposed action would reduce the amount of milk that supply plants must ship to pool distributing plants by 10 percentage points. Currently, the order provides that for a supply plant to be considered a pool plant, a minimum percentage of the total quantity of milk received at the supply plant must be transferred or diverted to and physically received at pool distributing plants regulated under the order. The minimum percentages are: 40 percent for September, October, and November; 30 percent for December; and 35 percent for January and February. The Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order provides that the Director of the Dairy Division may increase or decrease the percentage delivery requirement by up to 10 percentage points if the Director finds that such revision is necessary to obtain needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. The revision was requested by Brewster Dairy, Inc. (Brewster), a proprietary handler who operates a pool supply plant regulated under the order. Brewster contends that in Fall 1993 the plant was unable to accept surplus distributing plant milk associated with Order 36 and still meet supply plant qualifications. Consequently, milk from a distributing plant located 10 miles from Brewster had to be diverted to a manufacturing facility 92 miles away. At the same time, Brewster had to procure surplus milk from greater distances to fulfill manufacturing obligations. Brewster contends that this situation represents inequitable and inefficient movements of milk for both supply and distributing plants, undertaken to meet order shipping requirements. Brewster asserts that the same inequitable and inefficient movements of milk are expected again for Fall 1994. Thus, Brewster contends, a reduction of supply plant shipping percentages is necessary to prevent uneconomic and inefficient shipments of milk. In view of the current supply and demand relationship, it may be necessary to reduce the supply plant shipping percentage requirements as proposed to provide for the efficient and economic marketing of milk during the months of September 1, 1994, through February 28, 1994.
