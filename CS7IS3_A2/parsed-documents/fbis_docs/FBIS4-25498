The four-meter two-ton statue erected in 1971 was the last statue of Chiang on horseback in Kaohsiung. Opposition protesters have vandalized the statue on several occasions. A spokesman for the Kaohsiung City Government said the statue was removed to ease off a traffic bottleneck at the circle, but he could not say why 180 police officers were mobilized at 3 am when the statue was being removed. The Chinese language UNITED EVENING NEWS said the statue was quietly removed, and police officers were ordered to the spot to avoid unnecessary trouble, such as protest. An opposition legislator has said there are more than 30,000 statues of Chiang Kai-shek across the island.
