It simply placed the matter in the hands of those whom it usually affects the most in other nations. Following this decision the so-called Parliaments in the Workplace became popular in Cuba. These are meetings among the workers in each workplace, summoned by the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), to try and find solutions to the difficult domestic financial situation. The system was launched last January and triggered an unusual process of consultation at the grass-roots level. More than 3 million persons took place in the almost 80,000 meetings that took place all over the island, until last March. CTC leader Pedro Ross explained that the meetings had the double purpose of finding ideas to increase the economic efficiency at each specific center, while seeking other more general solutions related to the national situation, as a whole. Ross, responding to PRENSA LATINA, affirmed that the reaction to these meetings surpassed all expectations. This was so, first, "because of the insight shown in the worker's presentations about the solutions that should be implemented to enhance the domestic economy and clean up the financial system." He added that another aspect, deemed to be highly positive, was the response to the summons. The meetings had an average of over 86-percent attendance of all union members. The first study to determine the measures needed to face the nation's difficult situation was carried out last December at the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]. There they decided to hold an extraordinary session to discuss only the country's financial situation. The situation shows a current money surplus of more than 10 billion pesos -- equivalent to the same amount in U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate -- a fiscal deficit of as much as 4.2 billion [currency not specified], and substantial subsidies for several sectors. These factors have negative effects on the Cuban economy, which is already suffering the sudden loss of its trade partners in the former Soviet Bloc in Eastern Europe and a tightening of the trade embargo the United States has maintained against Cuba for over three decades. Local authorities maintain that neoliberal economic policies will never provide solutions for these problems. A CTC report on the progress at the assemblies suggested that this process constitutes "a democratic exercise that quickly earned its place as a useful tool and a viable way for the people to participate in solving our vital economic problems." The fact is that the meetings that took place at the more than 80,000 work centers gave all Cuban workers, from the most humble to the highest members, the opportunity to voice their opinions and possible solutions to the economic difficulties. The decision originated from the principle expressed by President Fidel Castro that "without the understanding and disposition of the workers and the people, no problem would be solved and no measure would be any good." The magnitude of the process was also highlighted by ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon in statements to PRENSA LATINA. The workers parliaments -- Alarcon stated -- have served to jointly discuss possible general measures and for each worker to express their opinion and compared to others, in order to form a single plan. He also indicated that the workers parliaments have encouraged the rise of a national consensus in relation to the critical measures to resist the situation, since "the solution to the economic difficulties is the entire nation's problem." Financial reorganization and economic efficiency are not matters solely for a group of legislators, but a collective enterprise to be confronted by the entire nation, Alarcon emphasized. In other words -- he added -- we must conceptualize a people's government as it really is, that is, it is not an isolated parliament above the rest of society, but a parliamnent inserted into society. In this respect, Alarcon explained "we are legislating these issues from the moment every workers group meets to express their recommendations on this matter and, most of all, when they specifically agree on what to do at each work place and in cooperation with other enterprises." From this perspective -- he pointed out -- it has been possible to identify and explain thousands of proposals, thousands of specific measures, many of which are already being put into practice, and are already being implemented. Precisely, one of the CTC's first objectives is to find solutions to the proposals suggested by its members and linked to their respective work centers. Felix Jimenez, director of La Corona tobacco factory, told PRENSA LATINA that as a result of implementing proposals suggested by the factory's employees, output objectives are being met by 146 percent. He indicated that we are all trapped in a spider's web, and we are starting to shake ourselves out of it. We cannot let this die out. Another example cited by TRABAJADORES weekly magazine, is that of an agriculture company located in the western Province of Matanzas, where the number of workers was cut from 1,135 in 1993 to 217 in March 1994, a measure that enabled the company to save 105,000 pesos in wages. Despite the cuts implemented, the company expects an increase in productivity and expects to ensure income producing levels. With respect to discussions surrounding the national measures, these will be debated by the ANPP deputies on 1 May, international labor day. Ross insisted that on this occasion all proposals made by the workers will be taken into considerations.
