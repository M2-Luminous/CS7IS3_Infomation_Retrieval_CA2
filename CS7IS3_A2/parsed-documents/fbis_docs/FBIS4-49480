This is a major event in Hong Kong economic circles. According to an authoritative figure from the BOC, as a commercial bank, the BOC has issued Hong Kong banknotes in an orderly way according to local laws and current Hong Kong regulations for issuing currency. Moreover, after becoming a banknote issuer, the BOC will continue its operation in light of Hong Kong's financial laws, continue to support the status of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered Bank as Hong Kong's major banknote issuers. The BOC intends to enter into fair competition with other banks in Hong Kong and seek common development rather than replace them. Hong Kong people should set their minds at ease. As stated by an official in charge of the BOC: "We do not intend to take a larger share of the cake. Instead, we want to join others in making a bigger cake." As the second largest bank group in Hong Kong, the BOC in Hong Kong has always regarded the maintenance of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and Hong Kong's status as an international financial center as its fundamental interests. From the BOC's issuance of banknotes in Hong Kong, we can see the great significance of the move in Hong Kong's economy. Apart from consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial center, it will also be conducive to the continuity and smooth transition of Hong Kong's currency system. Hong Kong is one of the limited number of regions in the world where banknotes are issued by commercial banks, where there is no central bank, and where the functions of the central bank are jointly performed by the government departments, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and other commercial banks. Following the issuance of its banknotes, the BOC will become a member of these commercial banks. The move itself shows that the system of commercial banks issuing banknotes, which has prevailed in Hong Kong over the years, will smoothly continue after 1997. It also indicates the policy of the Chinese Government toward Hong Kong, that is, keeping prevailing practice unchanged. Second, it will be conducive to stability of the value and credibility of Hong Kong currency. The BOC is one of the large banks which ranks in the front of the list of world banks. With a solid foundation, the move of the BOC in issuing Hong Kong banknotes will be conducive to maintaining a strong Hong Kong dollar. The system of pegging Hong Kong dollar to the greenback, aimed at stabilizing Hong Kong's financial market and the economy as a whole, has played an important role. After becoming a banknote issuer, the BOC will show more concern for the system than in the past and make vigorous efforts to consciously maintain it. The BOC cannot make any commercial benefit from issuing banknotes in Hong Kong. Conversely, it has to undertake for the cost of the operation. Proceeding from the overall situation of maintaining Hong Kong's financial stability, the BOC, in compliance with the request of Hong Kong society, has vigorously undertaken a greater responsibility and issued Hong Kong banknotes. We hope that the BOC will seek practical results rather than undeserved reputation, carefully manage its business, and join Hong Kong banks in making a bigger "cake."
