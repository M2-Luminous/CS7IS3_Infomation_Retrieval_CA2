FR940127-1-00075 FR940127-1-00018 FDA is the Government agency charged with protecting citizens by helping to ensure that medical products, including human drugs, biologics, and devices, are safe and effective for their intended uses. To further this purpose, Congress established elaborate mechanisms for the Federal government to permit marketing of new drugs, biologics, and devices and to monitor the safety of these products after approval (21 U.S.C. 355(k) and 360; 42 U.S.C. 262). Pursuant to these statutory provisions, FDA has established an extensive regulatory scheme to monitor the safety and effectiveness of new human drugs, biologics, and devices (§§310.305, 314.80, and §§803.1 through 803.36). State and local rules of civil procedure, rules of evidence, and other laws and regulations that permit discovery of the reporters' and patients' identities are an obstacle to accomplishing this goal. Moreover, with respect to devices, such laws, regulations, and rules are different from the confidentiality requirements under the act and FDA regulations that implement adverse event reporting under section 519 of the act. Although reporter identities in voluntary adverse event reports contained in FDA records are not subject to discovery in State litigation, those reports that are in the possession of the manufacturer may be subject to State or local disclosure laws. The possibility of such disclosure will chill the willingness of reporters to share information with FDA, which may share details about a report with a manufacturer in order to investigate the report further. Preemption of State and local disclosure laws will remove an inhibiting influence on health professionals and will increase adverse event reporting. FDA has determined that such increased reporting outweighs the individual needs of plaintiffs to obtain information about the reporters and subjects of adverse reaction reports that are not about the plaintiff. The proposed regulation is narrowly drawn and focuses solely on protecting the identity of the reporter and patient and other individuals identified in the report. This proposed rule does not preempt State and local laws that require disclosure of the substance of adverse event reports. The agency does not believe that disclosure of the substance of the adverse event reports will impede its ability to collect this information. Indeed, FDA routinely releases the full substance of all voluntary adverse event reports to requestors after deletion of patient, reporter, and institution identities (§20.111(c)(3)(iii)). Nor will the regulation impede the ability of an individual plaintiff to obtain specific information about reports concerning his or her own reaction to a product when that plaintiff is involved in a medical malpractice lawsuit and a court grants discovery of records directly concerning the plaintiff.
