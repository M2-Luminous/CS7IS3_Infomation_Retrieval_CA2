Gaviria said in a message aired in Santa Fe de Bogota on Wednesday on the occasion of Caldera's inauguration: "The challenge of those who today received the Venezuelan nation's helm, as well as of those who shall receive the leadership of Colombia in seven months, shall be to preserve what has been achieved and to attain what we still lack." The Colombian president did not travel to Venezuela because President Caldera did not invite any foreign presidents to his inauguration. Gaviria noted that, now with Caldera as president, "Venezuela has a man of integrity, versed in public matters and with a vision and leadership recognized throughout the continent, whose serenity and experience will be the best guarantee that this new administration will achieve significant accomplishments." Upon insisting on the need to continue the two nations' integration process, the Colombian president said, "the two nations' futures are inexorably tied together. Never before has the possibility been so close to make reality the dream of that universal Venezuela that you and we respect so much -- Simon Bolivar, the Liberator." Gaviria acknowledged that the extensive shared border (2,000 km) creates frictions, "but what we must understand, Colombians, as well as Venezuelans, is that the closer our ties and the more extensive our cooperation, the greater shall be our possibilities in successfully overcoming all obstacles."
