That will mean an increase of about 3 percent over the initial 1993 budget, and represent a higher annual growth rate than that for the 1993 budget. But, in order to avoid issuing deficit-covering bonds, financial manipulations--like rolled-up repayment of loans from profits in the sale of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) shares--will be made, and expenditure not contributing to new projects will have to increase. As such, it will be a de-facto "belt-tightening" budget which will in effect fall below the initial 1993 budget. The reason for this is the expected fall in tax revenue in the year; it is likely tax revenue will be less than 58 trillion yen. The Finance Ministry hopes to raise expenses on public works projects while containing the total budget amount. The ministry also hopes that, in combination with a third 1993 supplementary budget, this one will stimulate the national economy. The government and ruling coalition parties plan to carry out a large-scale income tax reduction retroactive to January 1994 by revising the taxation system. Once a decision on tax reduction is made, the tax revenue estimate must be lowered by that much. But since government bonds will be issued to raise government revenue, the size of the general-account budget will not change much. The Finance Ministry will formulate the third 1993 supplementary budget while formulating the 1994 budget. The ministry is considering increasing public works projects in the supplementary budget. It can be said the ministry in fact aims to boost the national economy by formulating the two budgets as one unit (a budget for 15 months). What normally becomes a point of concern in formulating the revenue part of the general-account budget is the estimation of tax revenue. This fiscal year, because of the economic recession, the revenue from such sources as corporate tax has fallen. At the time of formulating the second supplementary budget, tax revenue amounted to only 55.68 trillion yen, falling short of the budgeted revenue by more than 5.6 trillion yen. Although tax revenue for fiscal 1994 will be estimated by using these figures as a base, the government is leaning toward ironing out differences of opinion on the basis of an idea to set an estimated economic growth rate in real terms at about 2.5 percent. It is likely the growth rate will be about 4 percent even in nominal terms. Therefore, it seems that overall tax revenue will be only some 58 trillion yen. This is the lowest level since the 58,004 billion yen posted in fiscal 1990 as far as initial budgets are concerned. Regarding revenue other than from taxes, national bonds will be issued to cover expenses related to public works projects. The government will also issue construction bonds, which will amount to a little more than 8.5 trillion yen, to cover occupancy expenses [setsubihi] and other costs. It is expected that nontax revenues, including Bank of Japan contributions, will amount to a little less than 3 trillion yen. However, following the rolled-up repayment of the loans from profits in the sale of NTT shares, the government will issue additional construction bonds, which amount to a little less than 3.3 trillion yen. Moreover, repayments by municipalities will be appropriated in the budget as nontax revenues. Therefore, the size of the budget will expand by about 4.5 trillion yen in total. Due to the shortage of financial resources, the rolled-up repayment of project loans from profits in the sale of NTT shares, will be used to secure the balance of amortization fund, which stops the withdrawal of fixed amount of payment from the general account. We can say that it is a desperate measure taken under the pressure of necessity to avoid deficit-financing government bond issues by issuing additional construction bonds. The actual size of the general account, excluding this special primary factor, will be some 70 trillion yen, which is about 3 percent less than the fiscal 1993 general account. Previously, the size of the general account was smaller than that of the previous year only in 1956 (it was 0.8 percent less). Regarding expenditures, the amount of grants from the national government to local governments [chiho kofuzei kofukin] designed to distribute a certain percent of tax revenues to local governments, will be a little less than 15 trillion yen as far as calculations on tax revenues are concerned. However, due to reimbursement of excessively paid local allocation tax and other reasons, the total amount of expenditures will be set at the 13 trillion yen level. Although the amount of roughly estimated budget request for amortization of government bonds, which is an expenditure for paying back national debts, is 16.58 trillion yen, it will be kept down to about 15 trillion yen. Moreover, 1.54 trillion yen is needed to cover the revenue shortfall of fiscal 1992. Therefore, it is necessary to keep down the growth rate of general expenditures to less than 41 trillion yen, which is a little more than the 2 percent growth of the previous year.
