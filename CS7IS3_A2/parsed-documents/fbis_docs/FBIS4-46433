In France, a further 10 people were arrested; they are linked to ETA's network of people taking in terrorists. A further 13 people had already been arrested. Four of them are suspected of belonging to ETA's (Kiruli) Commandos, and they are accused of murdering a Civil Guard in September, 1993 in Andoain, and of killing an employee of a Telefonica subsidiary they had mistaken for a policeman. According to Jose Maria Gurruchaga Zapirain, the civil governor of Guipuzcoa, four ETA commandos used the arsenal found yesterday in the Guipuzcoa town of Usurbil. He then went on to describe the operation as a big blow for ETA, because some of those arrested had been long-standing ETA members.
