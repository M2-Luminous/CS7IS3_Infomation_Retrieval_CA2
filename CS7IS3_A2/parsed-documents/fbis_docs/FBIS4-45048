Fatimah al-Barnawi is an activist who spent 121 months in prisons of the Israeli occupation. She is married to the activist Fawzi al-Nimr, who himself spent 15 years in the prisons of the occupation. The following discussion took place in an interview with Fatimah al-Barnawi. [Al-HAWADITH] When did you begin to be an activist? [Al-Barnawi] In my early childhood I used to see Israeli attacks on Palestinians. I had no explanation for them. In 1948, we migrated from Jerusalem to Jordan and lived in the camps with other Palestinian emigrants. After three years I could bear it no longer, so I returned to Palestine and stayed with my father. I learned nursing and worked with the relief and Palestinian refugee employment agency in the city of Qalqilyah, which in those days was in ruins after the tripartite attack on Egypt in 1956. The Palestinians who were under arrest in the police station died martyrs' deaths in the attack on the city. The city of Qalqilyah was attacked again in 1963, when they destroyed the wells because of their importance to a city dependent on agriculture. Orchards dried up and agriculture suffered. Israel attacked the city again in 1965, destroying the gasoline pumps to paralyze traffic and make an impression on the residents. Naturally, the solution was to turn to the United Nations, which merely criticized, while Israel continued its attacks. The situation is the same today; nothing has changed. [Al-HAWADITH] Was it the passivity of the UN resolutions that made you think of militancy? [Al-Barnawi] Faced with such a dark reality, I began to feel that I was wronging myself by not being politically educated. Our reactions were merely emotional. Without a militant organization we lacked political consciousness. My zeal increased when Israel attacked and occupied the Gaza strip in 1956. I wanted to perform any act that would be a reply to Israel's repeated aggression against our people, particularly since I saw the dead and wounded by virtue of my job as a nurse. So I joined a group of young people, and we began working together--secretly, of course. [Al-HAWADITH] Did you carry out any militant operations as part of this group? [Al-Barnawi] There were some Egyptian soldiers who had come from Egypt to help us. Some of them were wounded and were wanted by the Israelis. I, my sister, and three young people tried to smuggle them out of the city of Qalqilyah. We gave them clothes to replace their Egyptian army uniforms, which we burned, and we enabled them to escape. But an Israeli doctor at the hospital became aware of the operation and alerted the Israeli soldiers. After questioning, although I utterly denied the charge against me, I was dismissed from the hospital. I began to work with the Palestinian people under trees and in homes, nursing the wounded and giving aid. [Al-HAWADITH] How did you join the Fatah movement? [Al-Barnawi] I became acquainted with a group from the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, or Fatah, which was headed by Yasir 'Arafat--he was then called Abu-Muhammad--and I joined them. After they inducted and trained me, they asked me to carry out an operation involving planting explosives in a movie house called Cinema Zion. The choice of the movie house was not arbitrary. It was chosen first because it was in Jerusalem--for the symbolic significance of the city. Next, there was the attitude of the shows in the movie house, which presented films about the spurious Six Day War and sold cassettes pushing Zionist ideology and calling for strengthening and expanding the Israeli occupation at the expense of the Arabs. Before you ask about civilians being present in the theater, I say that the Israelis all are soldiers--even their civilians are reservists. Thus, we did not target civilians. The theater was full of the Israeli army. I carried out the operation in company with my sister, who was five years younger than I, but had joined Fatah before me. There was also brother Fathi Shahrur, who was an official in the organization. During the same night other operations were carried out, and they all succeeded. [Al-HAWADITH] How were you arrested? [Al-Barnawi] Although my dark complexion played a great part initially in making the operation successful and throwing the Israeli soldiers off the trail, they finally caught up with me. Thinking that I was an Ethiopian, they contacted the Ethiopian embassy and confirmed that no young Ethiopian girls were in the area. Meanwhile I had returned to Qalqilyah. When they went to the house and found neither me nor my sister who had carried out the operation with me--Abu-'Ammar had enabled us to escape--they arrested my mother and two of my other sisters. Of course they tortured them. It had not been hard to find the house, because Palestinians of African ancestry live in one neighborhood near al-Aqsa Mosque. They caught up with me two days later. They encircled the house where I was staying with a group of girls, because the Israelis thought I was a dangerous, muscular woman. When they saw me, they were surprised that I was young and slender--I was no more than 25 years old. The girls raged against them because they did not know what I had done. The soldiers told me to put on the shoes I had worn the day of the operation. I knew they wanted to get evidence to condemn me, so I changed shoes. They took me. In the prison they left me with a female guard whose daughter had been present in the movie house that the operation targeted. Although I was handcuffed and she was armed, she was afraid of me. I made movements to provoke her, so that she would become even more afraid. On entering the prison, I saw many dark-skinned girls standing waiting for the perpetrator of the operation to be brought in. When they saw me, they ran up to me saying, "Confess, because we are in prison because of you--and your mother, too." I answered them that every one had to bear her own responsibilities, and that I had nothing to confess. [Al-HAWADITH] Why didn't you run away after carrying out the operation? [Al-Barnawi] I lacked experience. When I returned to Qalqilyah, I did not know that the Israelis were searching for me. I couldn't even comprehend what I had done. Like other sisters, I had watched the struggle of Algerian women. We had seen the film "Jamilah." My entire hope was to make some response, even a small one, to the Israeli actions. I did not think of running away. Even when Abu-'Ammar sent a message to the house asking us to leave the place as a precaution, I was not present when the message arrived. Because the operation had been secret, I could not reveal what I had done to anyone so that they might advise me what to do or how to behave. [Al-HAWADITH] Tell us how they questioned you? [Al-Barnawi] First they tried to make an impression on me. They reminded me of my African ancestry, trying to convince me that I had no connection to Palestine--to mislead me, of course. I replied that I knew nothing about Nigeria; I knew only Palestine, where I had been born. I belonged to Palestine, not to a country I had never visited and about which I knew nothing. On the next day, they told me that I had been in the movie house and had been carrying explosives. I admitted that I had been in the theater, but denied carrying explosives. They did not believe me and threatened me, saying that they would make me confess everything. They summoned a powerfully built blond soldier carrying a whip. The fellow was roaring; he was no normal person. I asked them what was wrong with him. They told me that the poor fellow was of German origin. The Germans had killed his family, and I now wanted to kill him! I told him that I had never gone to Germany to kill him; rather, it was he who had come to take my house and attack me. Of course they tortured me. They tortured my mother in front of me to influence me. The rule was that if we were caught and forced to confess, we were to confess only against ourselves and mention nothing about others. If we confessed, we were to mention the reasons: we were to say it was because they had dispossessed our people and occupied our land, while we had previously coexisted with the Jews. [Al-HAWADITH] What about the trial? [Al-Barnawi] The trial was in a military court. It lasted a week. They appointed Zionist lawyers for us, who tried to convict us more than defend us. Instead of defending me, the lawyer would ask before the court about the depth of the impression the explosion had left. The lawyer had promised my father to get me out of the court. I rejected him. I said that anyone who lied to my father and promised him something he could not do could not be trusted with my case, and I rejected him. In convicting me the court relied on a discussion that took place the day I was arrested, when the girls became enraged with the soldiers who took me. To calm them, they claimed they were going to take me for only 10 minutes. I had replied to them, "Just say 10 years!" They insisted that if I had done nothing, I would not have expected 10 years in prison. Before that, they sent a lawyer to me to offer me release from prison in exchange for a confession before everyone, including foreign reporters and observers. I was to express my regret for what I had done, because I had been misled by the Palestinians and had been influenced without holding convictions. However, what happened was the opposite. Along with those who had carried out the other operations, I insisted that we were not guilty and not sorry, because we were in the right. Israel was the aggressor, and we had responded to it. They sentenced me to 10 years in prison for belonging to an illegal organization, life in prison for possessing weapons, and another life sentence for carrying out the operation. In other words, I was to die [in prison], wake up, and die again! [Al-HAWADITH] How was prison life? [Al-Barnawi] We were subject to a strict regimen. Although I was the first woman prisoner from Fatah, I found two Palestinian women prisoners who must be mentioned. One was imprisoned five years before me. She was working with the pro-Syrian al-Ard [the Land] group and was in charge of passing information to the group. This prisoner was a wonderful worker with her hands. When she refused to give the Israelis any information, they sentenced her to six years in prison. The second was the activist Nayifah al-Mawji. She was from the area of Galilee occupied in 1948. She helped me a lot. Although she was not in the same cell with me, she would raise my morale by writing a note and passing it to me when she went by my cell. She told me to be strong and patient. She also told me that there was no death penalty in Israel--the Israeli papers were publishing my picture with a noose around my neck to intimidate and terrify me and anyone who wanted to resist the Israelis. These newspapers would get into the prisons through the Israeli women prisoners. Because the Israelis refused to consider us political prisoners, they threw us in with women drug smugglers, thieves, and prostitutes--into a world of depravity and crime. They knew no fear. Whenever activists carried out any commando operation, the Israeli women prisoners, instigated by the women jailers, would take vengeance on us. My teeth were broken in one of the attacks. When I made a complaint against them, the woman lawyer Felicia Langer came. They accused me of attacking one of them and of having broken my teeth by biting her! There is also a work system in the prison. Anyone who refuses is forbidden to go out for sun and air. The jobs to be done were kitchen work, gardening, cleaning rooms and toilets, ironing the clothes of Israeli women soldiers, and embroidering clothes in the Palestinian style for sale. Since the latter amounted to theft of our heritage, we used to refuse to do it. I worked in the kitchen for eight and one-half years. It was hard, tiring work that went on without a break from eight in the morning to four in the evening. [Al-HAWADITH] Besides the newspapers, did you read anything else? [Al-Barnawi] We were prohibited from reading political and educational books. We were only allowed to read worthless sentimental books. However, a year and one-half after I entered prison, we were joined by some educated Palestinian sisters--about twelve activists who helped educate their less informed and less educated colleagues. We used to talk surreptitiously during the hour in the sun, and we would meet in furtive attempts to organize recreational and educational programs inside the prison. The Israelis tried to stop these programs. Whenever they saw one of us happy or glad, they would put her back into her cell before the hour was up. They wanted to see us always sad, worried, and depressed. When we protested about the shortening of the rest interval, they answered that they were not bound to a schedule and that we had to submit to their orders. [Al-HAWADITH] Did they talk to you in Arabic? [Al-Barnawi] They spoke Hebrew, and we had to learn it through the women jailers who had lived in Arab countries. Those women had maintained some Arab customs. Those who came from Iraq were devoted listeners to Nazim al-Ghazzali, and everyone had to listen when he sang. The Yemeni Jews hold their weddings in the Yemeni style. They would drum on a pot, use henna, and wear Arab clothes, just as if they were in Yemen. The Israelis do not have a unified culture. To go back to the women jailers from Arab countries--they were set to guard us precisely so that they could understand what we were saying with our families during visits. [Al-HAWADITH] How long did your mother and two sisters stay in prison? [Al-Barnawi] My sister was imprisoned for a year. My other sister and my mother remained without sentence for two months, just to take vengeance on me and pressure me. The Israelis usually destroyed prisoners' homes, but they were unable to destroy our house because it was next to al-Aqsa Mosque. My father died while I was in prison. [Al-HAWADITH] And after you left prison? [Al-Barnawi] They expelled me. They let me off at the Jordanian border, where there were brothers waiting for me. They did not inform the Red Cross. I returned to the revolution and contacted the PLO again to continue my activities. [Al-HAWADITH] Was your life sentence lifted? [Al-Barnawi] Exile is crueler than prison. Although we have been accepted and treated as guests by Arab countries like Tunisia, Algeria, Yemen, and Sudan, we yearn to return home. In Tunisia we were accorded every sort of hospitality by the generous Tunisian people, and we felt comfortable in this beautiful country. But that does not prevent us from thinking about regaining our land, rejoining our kin, and beginning to rebuild, even inch by inch. All expelled Palestinians feel that they are guests and that they must return to their lands that they left against their will. I take with me a good memory of Tunisia. It was here that I married another expelled activist who had carried out militant operations and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. [Al-HAWADITH] When did you go to Tunis? [Al-Barnawi] After leaving prison in 1967 and being banished to Jordan, I went subsequently to al-Biqa' and south Lebanon. I went to Tunis in 1983. [Al-HAWADITH] What is your position on the peace agreement? [Al-Barnawi] Our people have become weary as a result of the daily siege imposed by the Israelis and the prohibition on workers pursuing their jobs. We did not carry on these negotiations by ourselves: all the Arab brothers and all the Arab countries agreed to them and participated in them. Just as Israel occupied our land bit by bit, so we shall regain it in the same way. When we are on our land, we can struggle. The struggle of the Palestinian people can be considered one of the most difficult of struggles. Our Algerian brothers, for example, resisted French occupation from within, on their own land; but we are scattered and dispersed to all parts of the world. [Al-HAWADITH] What do you feel when you remember the 10 years you spent in prison? [Al-Barnawi] Ten years and a month! They were not in vain, but have begun to bear fruit. I do not consider myself to have given anything. Those who really sacrificed are the martyrs of Palestine. As for me, I was imprisoned and came out. Palestine is worth our giving our lives. If I gave 10 years of my life, I am not sorry. Returning to Palestine compensates me for my entire life. [Al-HAWADITH] How did you receive the decision of your appointment as chief of the Palestinian women's police? [Al-Barnawi] In fact, I knew about it because Faruq al-Qaddumi had spoken to me, saying: "A decision will be issued appointing you as chief of police. You are the only one capable of carrying out this mission. All the Palestinian leaders are happy about the decision. It is an honor for you, sister Fatimah." While I was away from Tunis, my husband Fawzi al-Nimr--by the way, he is an activist who has experienced the two most bitter things in Israeli prisons--contacted me and told me about the decision. My feeling was a mixture of joy and fear: joy at the confidence that Abu-'Ammar and the entire Palestinian people have accorded me, with constant telephone calls from inside and outside the occupied territories to congratulate me on the new position; and fear that the new task may be too great for my ability. However, with God's help, I will succeed and prove to the whole world that Palestinian women are capable of working and carrying on in all fields. I am now as happy as can be. I am very glad that I shall be serving the general good, the good of the Palestinian people. [Al-HAWADITH] Will your experience in Israeli prisons have an effect on your new job? [Al-Barnawi] Of course. The experience will have a positive effect. I have learned a lot from my prison term and how the women jailers treated us. I learned the meaning of mercy and humanity and how much they affect the spirit. I learned the meaning of injustice and cruelty. All this naturally will have a positive affect on my work. [Al-HAWADITH] Do you expect many young Palestinian women to show an interest in joining the police service? [Al-Barnawi] Yes, I get telephone calls every day from inside the country, particularly from young women expressing a great desire to join. [Al-HAWADITH] What qualifications must young women have in order to join the police? Do you intend to bring in women who have been released from Israeli prisons to work in the women's police? [Al-Barnawi] The idea of women's police usually implies women who are large, powerful, and mean tempered. We are an exception to this rule. We will choose educated young women and guides who have compassion and good characters. We will make the women's police service an educational school and put the right person in the right place. We will not be a police of repression or overbearing, but a security service in the civilized sense, so that we prove that we are fit for this job and others. [Al-HAWADITH] When will this service go into operation? [Al-Barnawi] It is not easy for us to begin from nothing. First, I have asked Yasir 'Arafat that there be contact with our Tunisian and Jordanian brothers, so that we can profit from their experience in this field. I am pleased with the young women who work in the security service, for I see them constantly. As soon as we enter Palestinian territory, we shall begin to accept young women and send some of them to enroll in the military academy in Tunisia, Jordan, or Egypt.
