L. 95&hyph;599, 92 Stat. 2689; 23 U.S.C. 127, 141, and 315; 49 U.S.C. app. 2311, 2312, and 2316; sec. 1023, Pub.

(a) The State shall submit its enforcement plan or annual update to the Office of Motor Carriers in the FHWA division office by July 1 of each year. However, if a State's legislative or budgetary cycle is not consonant with that date, the FHWA and the State may jointly select an alternate date. In any event, a State must have an approved plan in effect by October 1 of each year. Failure of a State to submit or update a plan will result in the State being unable to certify in accordance with ยง657.13 for the period to be covered by the plan. (b) The Office of Motor Carriers in the FHWA division office shall review the State's operation under the accepted plan on a continuing basis and shall prepare an evaluation report annually. The State will be advised of the results of the evaluation and of any needed changes either in the plan itself or in its implementation. Copies of the evaluation report and subsequent modifications resulting from the evaluation shall be forwarded through the Regional Director of Motor Carriers to the Washington, D.C., Headquarters office. 3.

The States must also certify that they are enforcing and complying with the ISTEA freeze on the use of LCV's and other multi-unit vehicles. The certification shall be supported by information on activities and results achieved during the preceding 12-month period ending on September 30 of each year. 4.
