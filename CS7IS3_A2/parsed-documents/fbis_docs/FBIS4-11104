The ranchers said the president pledged to restore order in the state and to prevent more land invasions. They will see solutions within a week, the president said. The cattlemen said they would not take up weapons as a group but added that they are willing to defend their lands. [Begin recording] [Jorge Constantino Kanter, president of the Regional Cattlemen's Union of Chiapas] The cattlemen of the state of Chiapas support dialogue and negotiation in favor of a worthy peace in Chiapas. Peace, along with a state of law, will be our best guarantee. That is what we basically told the president. We are willing to hold a dialogue with the governor, the peasant organizations, and the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] itself in an effort to find practical solutions to the current conflicts. A worthy peace will provide us the necessary tranquillity to contribute to coexistence among the people of Chiapas, to resume our productive activities, and promote the region's economy. That will be the basis of the new relations among the people of Chiapas. President Salinas' commitment is to find solutions through the agrarian reform secretary within a week. He will hold talks with the governor to provide realistic solutions for the problems we are experiencing in Chiapas. We have been very clear. We are not prepared to take up weapons, but there are people in the area who are willing to defend their land -- no matter what -- because of the difficult situation. This does not mean we are taking up weapons as a group. It would be too complicated for the state and for the country. If we are going to sit down and talk to peasant organizations is because we are going to reach an agreement. If it is a negotiation both sides have to give things up. It is that simple. We have said that we want to be treated fairly as Mexicans. [Unidentified reporter] What did the president ask of you? Did he urge you to be prudent? [Constantino] He did not do that because we have been prudent. He recognized the tranquillity and peacefulness of the cattlemen. I repeat, the situation of the cattlemen is Chiapas is very different from any other land invasion in the republic. On Monday at 1930 we are going to sit down in the government palace for a meeting between small landowners, the state governor, and peasant organizations. [Reporter] When can a meeting be held with the EZLN? [Constantino] We do not know. It would be through the peace commissioner. [Reporter] Was he there? [Constantino] Yes, he was there. [Reporter] [words indistinct] [Constantino] The state governor has done everything possible to solve things, but it is a very difficult, critical situation. We cannot ask for a quick solution to such a serious problem. We believe that if we are going to sit down to talk, we have to negotiate as intelligent people. If we do that I believe there is no need to take up weapons. We do not want to create problems, let alone create more problems for the country. [Reporter] Are you willing to wait? [Constantino] If we came here it is because we are desperate. We are supposedly going to sit down to talk and hold a dialogue. We have said that we believe in the country's institutions. We trust the president. If we did not trust the president, we would not be here. [Reporter] [words indistinct] [Constantino] There is an agreement. The governor was clear. Starting on 14 April there would be no more invasions, otherwise the authorities are going to start evicting people. I believe the government will help us out. We believe they will take action.
