FR940825-1-00116 FR940825-1-00009 b. Visibility implementation plan submittal deadlines. EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the provisions of section 169A or implementing regulations requiring the submittal of visibility implementation plans by specific deadlines. Under today's proposal, Tribes would be treated in the same manner as States for all other purposes under section 169A and its implementing regulations. c. Interstate air pollution and visibility transport. Commission plan submittal deadlines. EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for those interstate commission CAA provisions requiring the submittal of an applicable implementation plan by a specific date. See CAA sections 169B(e)(2), 184 (b)(1) & (c)(5). However, EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for all other interstate commission-related provisions under sections 169B, 176A and 184 of the CAA. Therefore, for example, Tribes meeting eligibility requirements for these provisions of the CAA would be treated in the same manner as States in identifying what areas should be included in ``interstate'' air pollution and visibility transport regions and in establishing commission membership. For eligible Tribes participating as members of such Commissions, the Administrator would establish those submittal deadlines that are determined to be practicable or, as with other non-participating Tribes in an affected transport region, provide for Federal implementation of necessary measures. d. Criminal enforcement. In general, EPA is proposing that the enforcement provisions of sections 113 and 114 of the Act apply to Tribes in the same way that they apply to States. This would include the ability of a Tribe to establish its own administrative enforcement program, so that the Tribe could enforce administrative as well as civil penalties. In both cases, EPA would have the authority to take necessary enforcement action if the Tribe did not take such action or did not enforce adequately (e.g. did not impose a sufficient penalty); however, it would be most prudent for Tribes to attempt enforcement in the first instance. It should also be noted that EPA has a general policy of consulting with Tribal leaders and managers prior to taking an enforcement action against Tribal owned or managed facilities. November 8, 1984 ``EPA Indian Policy Implementation Guidance'' at p. 6. Section 113(c) of the CAA provides for the imposition of criminal penalties. However, in certain circumstances Indian Tribes have limited criminal enforcement authority. Federal law prohibits Indian Tribes from holding criminal trials of or imposing criminal penalties on non-Indians, in the absence of a treaty or other agreement to the contrary. Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S. 191 (1978). In addition, the Federal Indian Civil Rights Act prohibits any Indian Tribe from imposing for conviction of any one offense any criminal fine greater than $500. 25 U.S.C. section 1302(7). To provide for the possible imposition of criminal penalties with respect to facilities located on Tribal lands, each Tribe seeking approval of a CAA program that requires such authority must enter into a formal Memorandum of Agreement with EPA, through which it would agree to provide for the timely and appropriate referral of criminal enforcement matters to the EPA Regional Administrator. e. Title V operating permit program submittal deadlines, implementation deadlines and other requirements. For the reasons stated in the introduction to this section of the preamble, EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the operating permit program submittal deadline set out in section 502(d)(1). Similarly, EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States under the provisions of section 502(d)(2)(B) that mandate the imposition of sanctions under section 179 when a State fails to timely submit a required permit program or EPA disapproves a permit program. EPA also is not proposing to treat Tribes as States for the provisions of section 502(d)(3) that direct EPA to promulgate and administer a Federal permit program if, within two years after the required submittal date, EPA has not approved a State permit program. Similar to the companion provision in Title I described above (i.e., section 110(c)(1)), EPA is proposing to exclude only those limited provisions of section 502(d)(3) that direct EPA action by a date certain (EPA would continue to be subject to the basic requirement to implement a Federal permit program within a reasonable period; EPA would give substantial weight to Tribal air quality needs in determining what is reasonable in particular instances). These provisions are inappropriate because Tribes are not in the first instance directed by the statute to submit their own programs and in light of the fact that the Tribal CAA program development efforts are at a very preliminary stage.
