FR941110-2-00171 FR941110-2-00115 The Department of Energy will also initiate a study of the life cycle costs of each environmental impact statement alternative. That study will also be considered, along with the final environmental impact statement, when the Department selects a strategy from among the reasonable alternatives. Invitation To Comment The Department of Energy intends to conduct a full and open process to define the scope of the environmental impact statement and is issuing this Advance Notice of Intent as a preliminary step in seeking public comment on the proposed action, the range of alternatives, and the scope of impact analysis. Written comments from all interested parties are invited in order to assist the Department in defining the scope of the environmental impact statement, including the identification of the likely alternatives and significant environmental issues. Written comments should be sent to the address shown at the beginning of this notice. Following the completion of this preliminary public comment period, the Department of Energy will publish a notice of intent to initiate the scoping process, including the schedule of public meetings to receive oral or written comments on the scope of this environmental impact statement. At this time, the Department is not scheduling any public meetings in advance of the notice of intent. If there is significant interest in holding earlier public meetings, however, the Department will consider any requests and would publish notices for such meetings prior to holding them. Background Uranium is a naturally-occurring radioactive element containing different isotopes, notably Uranium-238 and Uranium-235. The ability to use uranium for controlled fission in nuclear chain reactions in most nuclear reactors depends on increasing the proportion of the Uranium-235 isotope in the material through an isotopic separation process called enrichment. This process divides a single stream of UF 6 into two separate streams_one enriched in Uranium-235 and the other depleted in Uranium-235. The first large-scale enrichment process was developed by the United States through the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. The enrichment technology employed in the United States is called ``gaseous diffusion,'' which has continued under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Commission and its successor agencies including the Department of Energy. On July 1, 1993, general responsibility for uranium enrichment in the United States was transferred from the Department to the United States Enrichment Corporation. Gaseous diffusion was developed, on a large scale, first at the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee and later at plants located near Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio. Using UF 6 as feed material for the enrichment process, these plants produced highly enriched uranium for the defense needs of the United States, as well as low enriched uranium for use in making fuel for commercial nuclear power reactors. All diffusion operations at the Oak Ridge facility ceased in 1985, and that facility is awaiting decontamination and decommissioning.
