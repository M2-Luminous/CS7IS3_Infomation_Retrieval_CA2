He will probably propose an association of Southern Cone governments, in what could be called the resurgence of the "Condor Operation," to fight eventual subversive outbursts similar to that provoked by the Zapatist movement in Chiapas, Mexico. Argentine media sources commented on a meeting between [Argentine President] Carlos Menem, [Uruguayan President] Luis Alberto Lacalle, and Wasmosy in Punta del Este last weekend, during which the presidents reportedly expressed concern for the possible entry, through the Bolivian and Paraguayan borders, of alleged guerrillas who would attempt to destabilize local governments. Asked about the subject shortly before leaving for Buenos Aires, Wasmosy denied that the issue had been discussed during the Punta del Este meeting. He said, however, that the matter could possibly be raised this time around, adding that if this were the case he would propose the association of the three countries' armies and intelligence services. Asked about his government's proposal if the issue of guerrilla activities were discussed at the mini-summit, Wasmosy said: "An association. Let us hope all countries will join efforts -- armies as well -- to fight drug trafficking, money laundering, and crime in general. That is the objective. We had a meeting of general staff chiefs to discuss the matter recently. I think we have made progress."
