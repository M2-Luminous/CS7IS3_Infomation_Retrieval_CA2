This was noted by Virgilijus Bulovas, the head of the Lithuanian working group for negotiations with the CIS countries, in an interview with Lithuanian television, where he commented on a draft agreement on military transit received recently from Russia. As already reported, the negotiating group adopted a decision at its meeting that the draft submitted by Russia could be examined only after the Lithuanian Seimas passes a law on the transportation of military and dangerous loads through the territory of Lithuania. Bulovas noted that, in the opinion of Lithuanian experts, only military transit by rail can be discussed. Transit by road would be unacceptable to Lithuania; separate international regulations exist for air transport and permits for flights must be obtained at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the opinion of Bulovas, Lithuania therefore cannot sign a separate agreement on military transit with Russia. Regulations are the same for all countries, whether it is NATO or Russia, said the head of the working group. According to him, the working group is at present preparing regulations for the transportation of dangerous loads by rail through the territory of Lithuania. In addition, Bulovas noted, Lithuania has no two borders with Russia. Therefore it will be necessary to conclude either a tripartite agreement among Russia, Belarus, and Lithuania, or three separate bilateral agreements. Bulovas also noted that Russia has been lately making an extensive use of sea transit. According to him, this is confirmed by the fact that there are fewer transportations by rail than planned.
