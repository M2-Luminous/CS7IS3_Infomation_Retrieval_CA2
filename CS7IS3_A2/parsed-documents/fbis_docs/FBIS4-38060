I opposed such a move in the past, and I still oppose it, Rabin said. The prime minister reiterated that the stock market does not reflect the economy, which is growing. The stock exchange is not a casino but an institute for calculated investments. Our Tel Aviv economic correspondent Ya'ir Fiedel reports that Rabin said the economy is generally in excellent shape, except for certain areas, such as inflation and housing prices, which require pinpointed treatment. Rabin was addressing business leaders.
