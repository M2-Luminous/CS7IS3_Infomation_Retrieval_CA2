Its first stage is nearing completion. Have we been able to accomplish what we planned, and what kind of changes are happening in the army? It was to these pressing questions that an article by L. Bakayev titled "The Kind of Army We Need" in this year's 25 August edition of KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA was devoted. It illuminated a number of issues rather objectively, but I believe that there were some inaccuracies in conclusions pertaining to military doctrine. Having had the opportunity to participate both in the development of military doctrine and other legal documents and in implementing them in the interests of creating the republic's own armed forces, I would like to share some of my ideas. L. Bakayev writes that there are three contradictory principles in Kazakhstan's military doctrine. Leonid Nikolayevich sees the first contradiction in the presence of a theater of military operations (TMO) and the possible appearance of centers of military tension on one hand, and the assertion that there is no adversary on the other. What can I say? The obsolete notion that if you have an army, you must have an adversary as well, is firmly entrenched in our consciousness, especially among the military. But the situation of recent years has necessitated new approaches and new conclusions. Coexistence of states in the present stage is unique in that the old division of all countries and coalitions into enemies and allies has, from our point of view (that of the author's collective that wrote the doctrine), become unsuitable. Therefore Kazakhstan does not feel any country of the world to be its adversary, and it makes neither territorial nor any other claims upon them. This is what is new in the foreign political activity of our young sovereign state, as expressed in its military doctrine. It is an objective fact that Kazakhstan is located at the junction of three theaters of military operations--European, Near Eastern, Far Eastern. Naturally in the event of a military conflict in any of these TMOs, a threat of Kazakhstan's involvement in a war against its will may arise. But does this really conflict with our belief that no country of the world is our adversary? The second contradiction L. N. Bakayev sees is that "despite the presence of legislative acts prohibiting the use of Kazakhs in military contingents outside the state and participation of Kazakh servicemen in 'hot spots,' adherence to collective security is proclaimed." However, significant changes have occurred since publication of the Supreme Soviet's decree prohibiting the transfer of Kazakhs to other regions. A number of agreements and a treaty on collective security have been signed by the heads of Commonwealth states. This was preceded by consultations and meeting within the system of representative, legislative and executive power of the CIS. Consequently the military doctrine was approved in December 1992 and servicemen were sent to defend Tajikistan's borders in June 1993 by a joint decision of the Supreme Soviet and the republic's government. This is evidence that the Supreme Soviet, the sole supreme legislative body of the republic, does not consider its decisions, once adopted, to be dogma, and that the corresponding changes may be made in support of the interests of both national and collective security. And finally, if we consider that the main objective of collective security is to adopt effective measures by which to prevent any kind of conflict, primarily through political and diplomatic resources, then it becomes obvious that there are no contradictions of any kind in this case either. "Third," L. Bakayev writes, "it is proclaimed that nuclear weapons will not be used, even though Kazakhstan does not have its own nuclear forces, it does not possess the right to control them, and there are none located within the state." These arguments do appear justified at first glance. However, once again the advent of new legal documents determining both the right of ownership and the agreement on joint development of a unified nuclear policy are not accounted for. Presence of a an interlocking system in the hands of the leaders of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine allows them to participate in the control of nuclear weapons on one hand, and blocks the possibility for the president of Russia to single-handedly decide to press the nuclear button on the other. Under these conditions Kazakhstan's clear position, which is spelled out precisely in its doctrine, was met with the approval of the world community. Now about military personnel and military science. We have an extremely urgent need, writes L. Bakayev, "to undertake decisive practical steps" to train personnel. The main directions of solving this problem were spelled out back in April of last year at a conference with the president, and he approved them. We can now summarize some of the results. Some of the officers that had been discharged into the reserves have been returned to regular ranks, graduates of civilian VUZes who are also reserve officers have been called up into the army, and Kazakh officers serving in other regions are returning. The border and fire engineering schools were reorganized for the training of specialists with a higher education, and the Almaty Higher Combined Arms Command School was transformed for multiprofile training. A five-year agreement was signed with the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense for the training of specialists in Russian military VUZes. Several graduates of military schools are studying in Turkey. There are plans for sending representatives of the republic to other states for training. However, these measures are not enough to completely solve the personnel problem. It is especially difficult to predict the future, after the term of the agreement with Russia, mentioned above, expires. It would probably be pertinent here to recall the old saying "Put your hope in God, but don't make any mistakes yourself." One promising way of eliminating the shortage of national military personnel is to train them in military boarding schools. There are three such schools in the republic--in Almaty, Karaganda and Shymkent. They were opened in 1983, and they are still on the balance sheet of the Ministry of Education, even though the personnel are trained primarily for the Ministry of Defense. These schools need serious and urgent assistance. Experience tells us that we need to transfer them to the subordination of the Ministry of Defense. A proposal by some veterans who recommend establishing junior lieutenant training courses in Leninsk, Kurchatov, Priozersk and other cities deserves attention. As far as opening our own military academy is concerned, as I see it this is still an unreachable objective for us. But when it comes to forming military faculties under the military departments of civilian VUZes and at the Aktyubinsk Civil Aviation School, this is something we need to think about. L. N. Bakayev is absolutely correct when he proposes that we develop Kazakh military science, upon which the entire personnel training system is based. But the first thing we need to do is create the science. I feel that it has become urgently necessary to establish a special administration of VUZes, military science and nonmilitary training in the Ministry of Defense that could forecast and develop the concept of personnel training, and develop an extensive program of establishing and furthering military science. Now about the ways of solving the army's crisis. The facts L. Bakayev offers as evidence of the crisis do actually exist in the army. But I cannot agree with the opinion that "this crisis is one not of the soldiering masses but of their command": This can lead to the wrong decisions. Analysis shows that "dedovshchina" became widespread in the army in the early 1960s, when persons serving terms for criminal acts were called up into the army. As for "zemlyachestvo," its development is associated with events of recent years. Higher political organs that became absorbed with administration by injunction, window-dressing and demagoguery lost sight of the problems of education. All of this promoted transformation of "dedovshchina" and "zemlyachestvo" into an ugly, abnormal army tradition, and led to the revelry of violence and brutality and the army's demoralization. Termination of military-patriotic work and the repeal of all forms of conscript training also contributed to the fall in the prestige of military service. It is absolutely clear that criticism alone isn't going to solve anything. In our opinion the vacuum in educational work could be filled by establishing a new institution in the republic's armed forces. The president supported the initiative for its establishment by his edict of 18 January of this year, which introduced the institution of deputies for educational, social and legal work into the armed forces, from the defense ministry level down to company commanders and persons equal to them. As the president noted in the report he gave at the republic's ideological conference, we need to develop our own state concept, one which must be based on instilling Kazakh patriotism. The president's directives obligate commanders and leaders of educational institutions to clearly determine the forms and methods of such education. Consequently the problem will not be solved without a deeply thought-out concept and a detailed plan. The success of any reform depends not only on the preparedness of the personnel but also on proper statement of personnel policy. Authoritarianism and protectionism, which are abnormal phenomena in personnel policy, must give way to collective decision making and objectivity in deciding the fate of every officer. Analysis of military history shows that as a rule, when a commander is ungifted, this has a sharply negative effect on troop combat training in peacetime, while in wartime it leads to unjustifiable death of people, and defeat. You can't hide mediocrity with an officer's trouser stripes and sheepskin hat. The adoption of the legal documents only created the foundation for the reform. Figuratively speaking, the present stage of the army's development may be likened to Kazakh yurt with only its wooden frame assembled. Reform in the army is a process that includes numerous aspects that fall outside the scope of this article. Its implementation requires serious work and a long time. I believe that participation of competent persons directly or through the mass media in the reform could help to hasten it. Perhaps the time has come to organize and conduct a scientific-practical conference, to which a wide range of interested persons could be invited. As our laws stipulate, security and defense are the business of all the people.
