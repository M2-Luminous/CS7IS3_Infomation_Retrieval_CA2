Last March when the Ministry of Trade and Industry was preparing material in advance of a government decision on the Temelin plant in southern Bohemia, the ministry clearly had information that a study on the economic feasibility of the plant had been commissioned from the Belgian company Tractabel Kuzvart said. Part of the report studied the possibilities of energy saving and concluded that energy saving procedures would cost the country less than the production of electricity by any method. By 2010, the report stated, 3,500 megawatts could technically be saved, it would be economically advantageous to save 3,000 megawatts but the feasible saving by that year is only 1,200 megawatts. The study shows that the amount of energy saving possible is six times higher than Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy announced, Kuzvart said. Other government offices and constitutional officials had no information about this section of the study before the decision was taken to complete Temelin, as is shown by Environment Minister Frantisek Benda's proposal that a study be done including energy sources and needs and assessing the realistic energy saving potential, Kuzvart said. The government could only have made the announcement that, with coal power plants cutting production, a new source producing around 2,00 megawatts had to be found, if the Tractabel study had not been taken into account, he said. In the interests of averting looming environmental damage construction at Temelin should not have been resumed before new discussions, Kuzvart said.
