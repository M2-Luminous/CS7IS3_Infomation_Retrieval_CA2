His dramatic eleventh hour registration of a new party for the election was rejected overwhelmingly yesterday in a secret vote by the decision-making structures of the National Front -- and he has apparently retreated. But in political circles the big question this week is whether General Viljoen is going to sit back in the face of this setback. There is a possibility that he will submit a candidates' list of his new party -- the Freedom Front -- even before Wednesday [9 March] for participation in the election. If he does not do it, his registration will lapse. In such a breakaway from the National Front, he could possibly be followed by at least six Conservative Party [CP] MP's who are known to be pro-election men and who have been pressuring the CP to participate. They are the brothers Pieter, MP for Schweizer-Reneke, and Corne Mulder, MP for Randfontein; Mr. Willem Botha, MP for Uitenhage; Mr. Joseph Chiole, MP for Pretoria West; Mr. Pieter Groenewald, MP for Stilfontein; and Mr. Leon Louw, MP for Welkom; Cape Province CP leader Jan Hoon's name was also mentioned in this regard. Marathon Meetings Yesterday's drama in right-wing politics took place against the background of very tense marathon meetings which began at 0700 and lasted until just before 1600. The feeling among the majority of people, who had gathered from the early morning in front of the Synod Hall, was predominantly against General Viljoen. RAPPORT has even been told that arrangements were made for him to leave the hall through a side door in the event of tempers becoming so heated that his safety would have been in jeopardy. General Viljoen, co-leader of the Afrikaner National Front, first came on the firing line during a morning session of the National Front's Executive Council and later the People's Representative Assembly. Acted Unilaterally One thing that he was castigated for was acting unilaterally when he registered the Freedom Front as a party for the coming election on Friday night. This is probably the reason why the registration was not made in the name of the National Front. While Constand Viljoen had informed CP leader and his co-leader in the National Front, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, late on Friday night that such party was going to be registered, at the end of it all he had acted against Dr. Hartzenberg's wishes. At a news conference after yesterday's meeting, Dr. Hartzenberg did not want to commit himself on what he said to General Viljoen on Friday night. General Viljoen's registration acts directly against the two previous decisions by the National Front -- one of them as recent as a week ago. Just this week Dr. Hartzenberg had even said that the CP would not participate in the election as there was "nothing new on the table." Secret Notwithstanding the "official" mood within the National Front, plans to register were pursued secretly. This emerges from the fact that the new party's emblem had been designed some time ago, the forms had been ready for a while, and the necessary registration fee had already been raised. Despite the intimate get-together between him and General Viljoen, yesterday Dr. Hartzenberg tried to hide the differences within the National Front while speaking in "parliament." He said General Viljoen had acted properly by registering the party as he had the interests of the National Front at heart. "When he heard on Friday evening that the Inkatha Freedom Party had registered provisionally, he immediately went to register so that the National Front could get a chance to think about the matter at its leisure this morning. "Since the government did not want to give us the opportunity to test our support in a plebiscite, but had instead insisted that this must be done in an election, the council stands by its decision of two weeks ago not to take part in the election." The crisis in the National Front boiled over on Friday after an all-day meeting of the Front's Executive Council and attempts by the government and the ANC [African National Congress] to persuade General Viljoen to participate in the elections. By Friday night, while the clock for registration was ticking away minute by minute, a storm was raging inside the National Front's inner circles. It was ultimately the late night decision by the Inkatha Freedom Party to register that brought the pro-election members in thee National Front into motion and that culminated in Gen. Viljoen's dramatic journey to Kempton Park. As of press time, there was as yet no consensus on a map for a proposed Afrikaner homeland. A week ago instructions had been given for such a map to be drawn up as this would strengthen the National Front's claim for such a homeland.
