"The government has not taken over an easy heritage," said Schmognerova at today's parliamentary debate on the government programme. She said that in addition to economic recession and the breakup of the federation, the previous cabinets incompetence and hindrance of reforms were to blame for the bad state of the Slovak economy. As a result, gross domestic product fell last year by 4.1 percent, industrial production by 13.5 percent and construction work by 25 percent. Slovakia's foreign trade deficit was nearly 27 billion crowns, the state sector's debt reached 60 billion crowns and prices grew by 23 percent. Fifty-seven percent of all enterprises were loss-making. "This government could have chosen the easier path of preserving the present status quo without the unpleasant impact of unpopular measures, whereby it would have achieved a good pre-election position," said Schmognerova. She stressed that reaching the government's stated goals -- approaching zero GDP growth, a 10-13 percent inflation rate, unemployment below 17 percent and a budget deficit below four percent -- would be very complicated and would require public support.
