The price for standard ginned cotton is to be raised from 330 yuan to about 400 yuan per 50 kg. In addition, some cotton producing provinces also will introduce some other preferential measures to encourage peasants to grow cotton. Cotton output slumped in 1993 owing to natural disasters and other factors. Statistics by the end of January this year indicate that the country's total cotton procurement was only 67 percent of the procurement for the same period last year. Hebei, Shandong, and Henan -- the major cotton producing provinces of China the cotton output of which used to account for half of the country's total cotton output -- witnessed the greatest decrease margin in cotton production which has directly affected the country's cotton procurement as a whole. To ease the grim situation in cotton production and marketing, and to encourage peasants to grow cotton, the state now has decided to raise the cotton procurement price by about 21 percent this year, in addition to the 10-percent price rise last year. Meanwhile, the amount of subsidies to cotton growers also will be increased appropriately to make up the price difference between parity and the negotiated prices for chemical fertilizers and diesel oil. This will be another round of substantial raises in the cotton procurement price in China after a series of price rises over the past few years since 1988.
