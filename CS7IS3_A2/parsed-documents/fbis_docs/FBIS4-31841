The local Bosnian Serb army command said that the Moslems fired 21 shells on the Serb Army positions, and eight shells on civilian targets in the villages of Doli and Trnovo in eastern Bosnia. The Serb forces did not return fire, and the attacks caused damage, but no casualties, the command said. The Bosnian Serb Army is not responding to attacks, adhering to the letter and spirit of the latest one-month truce, signed in Geneva on June 8 by representatives of the Moslem-Croat Federation in Bosnia and the Bosnian Serb Republic. The Serb Army further reported Moslem attacks on military and civilian targets in the past 24 hours in most sectors of the Doboj front in northern Bosnia. On the Teslic front south of Doboj, the Moslems launched a strong infantry assault in an effort to break through the Serb lines, but were beaten back, the Serb source said. A Moslem sabotage and reconnaissance team was neutralised in the southeastern sector of the Doboj front, the source said.
