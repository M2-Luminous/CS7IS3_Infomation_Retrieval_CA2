Political sources in Jerusalem estimated that chances are nil for an imminent meeting between Rabin and 'Arafat. Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin spoke on the phone on Sunday. They discussed the possibility of holding a summit meeting but decided there would be no sense in such a meeting if it is not certain to result in an agreement. Yesterday's meeting in Cairo was attended by Colonel 'Amos Gil'ad, Rabin's aide-de-camp, and Israeli Ambassador to Egypt David Sultan. The PLO leader spelled out his conditions for the resumption of the negotiations: banning gun-toting settlers from moving around towns in the territories, relocating the settlers from the heart of Hebron to Qiryat Arba', and stationing an international force in the territories. 'Arafat surprised his audience with additional demands which totally ignore the Cairo agreement. Among other things, he is demanding that the size of the autonomous area in Jericho be doubled, that Palestinian policemen be stationed at the Jordan River bridges, and other demands that gave rise to disputes in the past. Neriya gave 'Arafat a message from Rabin saying that Israel is willing to significantly accelerate the negotiations and the implementation of the agreement once it is signed. 'Arafat departed for Tunis after meeting with Neriya. "Neriya promised everything would be all right, but he made no promises beyond the resolutions passed by the Israeli Government in the aftermath of the massacre in Hebron," a senior Palestinian source told MA'ARIV last night. Palestinian sources noted that both 'Arafat and Neriya voiced their apprehension that the peace process might be blown to smithereens. "What the settler did in the Cave of the Patriarchs was to massacre the peace process," 'Arafat said. He asked that Israel investigate the role of the Israel Defense Forces in the event.
