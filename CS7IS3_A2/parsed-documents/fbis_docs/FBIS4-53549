FBIS4-53549 "dreas098_a_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 20 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan SDF Supports U.S. Landing Drills at Iwojima SDF Supports U.S. Landing Drills at Iwojima OW2005120294 Tokyo KYODO in English 1107 GMT 20 May 94 OW2005120294 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF) is boosting support of a night-landing practice (NLP) by U.S. military aircraft at Iwo Island, popularly known as Iwojima, about 1,300 kilometers south of Tokyo. It was the first time the SDF backed the solo exercise by planes from the U.S. aircraft carrier Independence. Previously the SDF had cooperated with the U.S. Forces as part of a joint military drill. The U.S. Forces previously conducted NLP at Atsugi Naval Air Station in Kanagawa Prefecture. But Japan and the United States agreed to move the landings to Iwojima starting last year due to complaints of noise from residents around Atsugi. This year's practice is one of the largest, with 25 deck planes and some 400 pilots participating. In cooperation, the Air Self-Defense Force has dispatched 10 transport planes to carry U.S. ground crew officials and materials, while the Maritime Self-Defense Force offered 20 officials to back up air control and ground support and a rescue plane in case of an accident. Japan has also spent some 17 billion yen to construct lodging and hangars for the U.S. forces in Iwojima. The U.S. is expected to spend about 33 million yen for NLP this year, according to official sources. Speculation is that the SDF support is to pave the way for concluding the acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) with the U.S., in which the two forces provide each other with materials. Conclusion of the ACSA suddenly became an issue due to concerns that North Korea may be building nuclear weapons. The Defense Agency said the SDF Law and Japan-U.S. Security Treaty permit Japan's support of U.S. night-landing practices at Iwojima.
