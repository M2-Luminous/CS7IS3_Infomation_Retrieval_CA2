Without mentioning the Chiapas conflict, he issued his first statement since the beginning of the armed struggle in that state. He said that violence is the negation of politics and represents backwardness, disorder, anarchy, and the destruction of democracy. The government secretary appeared gaunt, nervous, and worried. He said only the law can guarantee legal security and democratic life. He noted that, within a state of law, it is always possible to punish criminals. Gonzalez also insisted that violence does not permit the reaching of agreements. Here is what he said: [Gonzalez] "Society, the political parties, and the government reject violence as a means of producing political and social change. As the president has said, there is nothing that can inhibit Mexicans' ability to reach agreements and to talk among themselves. The federal government has reiterated its commitment to safeguarding and strengthening a state of law with the security and peace demanded by development, as well as with dialogue and agreements as means for securing fundamental cooperation. All of this requires laws and compliance with the law." After delivering this message, the meeting turned into a debate on the situation in Chiapas. The political parties represented at the IFE General Council have rejected violence, but there is criticism about the methods the Mexican Army and the federal government have used to put down the uprising. A calm and articulate Porfirio Munoz Ledo [leader of the Party of the Democratic Revolution -- PRD] engaged the attention of his listeners by charging that the government controls the public forces and that the Indians have become cannon fodder. Munoz Ledo, speaking as the PRD representative, said the inefficient and segregationist policies of the regime should be questioned. He denied that the political forces have a common position on the Chiapas events. We, he said, demand moderation, legality, dialogue, timely information, and effective support and help for the people. We also demand respect for human rights and basic solutions, as well as an end to the impunity of government officials and political agents. Here is what Porfirio Munoz Ledo said: [Munoz] "The executive branch has the constitutional obligation to determine when, how soon, and how officials under its jurisdiction should be changed. Our responsibility is to continue struggling for the renewal and purge of the electoral authorities at all levels." Alberto Carrillo Armenta, representative of the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, also called for a nonmilitary solution in Chiapas. He said this year's elections process cannot be initiated if there is a state of emergency. He demanded security measures for candidates who, like the Cardenist Front's candidate -- Rafael Aguilar -- will be carrying out a political campaign in that state of the Republic. The Popular Socialist Party, represented by Jesus Carlos Hernandez, called for common sense in the debates on, and in the solution of, the Chiapas conflict. He rejected foreign meddling in the region. The National Action Party also participated in the debate. Juan de Dios Castro spoke in a very emotional tone. He tried to stir the political awareness of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], the federal government, and all Mexicans. He said the conflict in Chiapas could extend to other regions of the federation because there is poverty in all of them. He explained that the individual guarantees of the Mexican people cannot be violated because of what is happening in Chiapas. He recalled, quoting a South American leader, that changes will take place with or without politicians -- they just come. Here is what Juan de Dios Castro said: [Castro] "Changes will take place with or without us. If they take place without us, this will sadden me. The people are making demands. They are shouting demands that we make structural changes. They are also demanding respect for the Constitution." The PRI had three of its militants at the meeting. Two of them are official IFE representatives -- Santiago Nate and Amador Rodriguez Lozano -- and the third one, Miguel Gonzalez Avelar, is an adviser to the Chamber of Deputies. The PRI representatives said their party is not evading a debate, but they asked that the issue be discussed at a forum other than IFE. Amador Rodriguez Lozano said democracy is not a birthright of political parties but, rather, of society. He said democracy does not equate with irreconcilable division, and he added that no attention should be paid to apocalyptic visions. He said there are other problems that require the attention of IFE's General Council. Here is Amador Rodriguez Lozano: [Rodriguez] "The position we must adopt at this first meeting should not be one of searching for a leading role in the discussion of this problem. We should center our attention on the many difficult matters we have ahead of us -- matters that we will have to discuss repeatedly, passionately, and often." Miguel Gonzalez Avelar said there should be no confusion concerning the Mexican Army's involvement. He said that communities have the right to demand, as in the case of Chiapas, the presence of national forces. He said it would not be right for members of the federation not to expect to demand and receive help from the forces of the federation. Gonzalez added that our duty is not to dull our awareness. He recalled that in Chiapas there are rebel minorities, just as those who killed [Mexican Independence hero Miguel] Hidalgo were also in the minority, as were those who brought a foreign prince to Mexico and those who killed [Mexican patriot Francisco] Madero. Here is what Gonzalez said: [Gonzalez] "Today there is this faceless violence from a well- organized group that unfortunately and tragically includes young people aremed with wooden rifles who remind us of the Cristera War [between government forces and Catholic militants] when young people charged federal soldiers to silence their rifle barrels with little wax balls, believing this could be done because the little wax balls had been previously blessed by their pastors. "In any event, these groups are proposing substituting the party system for the unalterable will of rifles." The first regular IFE session is continuing. It has officially opened the 21 August elections process to renew the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies, the Presidency, and the House of Representatives. The session continues. The members will be discussing other issues. Discussions on the Chiapas events concluded at 1200.
