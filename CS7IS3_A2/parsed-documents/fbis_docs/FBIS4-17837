In his opinion, Plyushch "is holding all power in Ukraine." Asked about the possibility of the new parliament's cancelling the presidential elections scheduled for June 26 1994, Kuchma noted: "It would be desirable if we started to respect laws we have passed." In his opinion, the new parliament should not start its work with cancelling decisions made by its predecessor. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has been insisting on cancelling the previous parliament's decision to hold the presidential elections on June 26. At the same time, Kuchma said he saw postponing the elections as no tragedy. The candidates should possess "a plan of specific activities instead of the desire to prolong the agony of the country's economy as a whole." The former prime minister pointed out that it would be more favorable for him as a candidate for the Ukrainian presidency, if Kravchuk took part in the elections, which would considerably reduce Plyushch's chances. Kuchma pointed to the need to adopt tough measures to surmount the economic crisis. In his opinion, Ukraine's economy saw a state of emergency on the brink of a disaster. The parliamentary faction of the IBR created at a party meeting Tuesday consists of 21 deputies and is called Interregional Deputies' Faction Center. Its first meeting was scheduled for May 5.
