The recently concluded special session of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] outlined the policy to be followed by the executive branch in overcoming the serious budget deficit, which amounts to 4.2 billion pesos, and the excessive money supply, which is on the order of 11.6 billion pesos. Among the suggestions made by the Cuban deputies are: selective raising of tariffs on nonessential products, elimination of certain [word indistinct], establishment of a tax system, reduction of subsidies for certain products, granting of subsidies to low income earners, and reduction in state allocations for unprofitable businesses, a measure already being implemented. Cuba has been able to face the consequences of previous stages of the current crisis because even though the U.S. economic blockade existed, its effects were attenuated by the advantageous relations with Europe's former socialist countries. For many years, Cubans enjoyed the benefits of a just and equal distribution of health care, medical attention, and social security. Also, there has been equal distribution and subsidy of rationed products offered at extremely low prices. Access to some public services has continued to be free. With the disappearance of the former socialist bloc, the entire weight of the U.S. economic blockade has been felt. If we add to this the fact that credit is nonexistent and that this is an underdeveloped nation, we must conclude that Cuba now finds itself in a very adverse position which does not permit resorting to yesterday's solutions. The Parliament recommended to the government fundamental guidelines for adopting in coming weeks and months a series of realistic measures consonant with the current situation. Perhaps after a reasonable period, preliminary reports will show positive results. Cubans understand the need for adopting this strategy, although not all of them are capable of specifically adapting to the stringency of some of the measures -- hence the importance of a process of popular discussions in the country that will seek consensus. Only at the end of the discussions, sponsored by the unions, did Parliament reach conclusions on recommendations to the government. It was seen that premeditated solutions are difficult and do not have unanimous support. But solutions will never be proposed behind the people's back. Cubans with low incomes will not be neglected. At the same time, the 11 million inhabitants of the island will continue to enjoy the principal social achievements, such as education, health, and social security [words indistinct].
