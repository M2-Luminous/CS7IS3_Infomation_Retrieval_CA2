Present at the forum were regional leaders Bai Enpei, Liu Zuohui, Song Zhimin, Shen Shuji, and Bao Wenfa; and leaders of the regional departments concerned, all leagues and cities, and some banner and county party and government departments. Bai Enpei, Liu Zuohui, and Song Zhimin made important speeches at the forum. The forum was chaired by Bai Enpei. Along with the ceaseless deepening of reform and the rapid development of the economy since the third plenary session of the 11th party Central Committee, our region has registered big increases in revenues with each passing year. The region's revenues in 1980 was 413 million yuan; those in 1985, 1.136 billion yuan; those in 1888, 2.35 billion yuan; those in 1992, 3.91 billion yuan; and those in 1993 rapidly increased to 5.61 billion yuan. Song Zhimin pointed out in his speech: The region's revenues continued to double for several times in the past 10 years or so. Simultaneously, the region's economic and social undertakings have developed at an increasingly faster speed. Increasingly more financial resources have been spent to develop economic and social undertakings. The input to the construction of production projects and the development of undertakings continues to increase with each passing year. The number of personnel to be provided by the financial departments increases at an excessively high speed. The income of staff and workers and cadres increases with each passing year. The financial burdens become heavier and heavier. Leagues, cities, banners, and counties differ greatly in revenues. Meanwhile, problems of collecting, managing, and using financial resources exist in varying degrees among the financial departments at various levels. All this helps enhance the contradictions between the region's revenues and expenditures. The financial difficulties, cropping up in the course of promoting the economic construction, rapidly developing other undertakings, and ceaselessly improving the people's livelihood, are temporary difficulties in the course of advance and development. So long as we persistently implement the line, principles, and policies of the party will the financial difficulties certainly be alleviated and eliminated in a step-by-step manner along with the ceaseless deepening of reform and the sustained development of the economy. [passage omitted] At the time of collecting financial resources, the financial departments at various levels should conscientiously manage both budgetary funds and extrabudgetary funds. Under the leadership of the governments at various levels, the financial departments should further arrange, in a unified manner, available financial resources and expenditures; and make arrangements for the use of funds in the order of importance and urgency. We should first ensure the payment of wages in accordance with the principle of feeding the people primarily and building the country secondarily and the principle of acting according to capabilities; and arrange the expenses in other aspects according to the principle of keeping expenditures within the limits of income. We should strengthen and achieve the distribution of financial funds, do our best to shorten the capital turnover period, and ensure the timely distribution of capital. The banks at various levels should support the rapid distribution of financial funds, avoid the occurrence of the phenomenon of keeping the capital that should be allocated, and ensure the timely turnover of capital. The tax departments at various levels should strengthen the management of tax revenues, widely open tax resources, handle tax affairs persistently according to laws, calculate taxes according to tax rates, and collect and hand over to the state the taxes that should be collected and handed over. The banking departments at various levels should positively collect funds, try every possible means to alleviate the strain on capital, and better support the economic construction and the production of enterprises. The governments at various levels should support the financial departments to develop deposits, assimilate savings from society, increase available funds, and enliven the existing funds. [passage omitted] Bai Enpei finally stressed: We should strengthen leadership, rely on the masses, work arduously, and jointly overcome the financial difficulties. The party committees and governments at various levels should realistically strengthen the leadership over the financial work, regularly conduct research, carefully make arrangements, and timely solve various kinds of difficulties.
