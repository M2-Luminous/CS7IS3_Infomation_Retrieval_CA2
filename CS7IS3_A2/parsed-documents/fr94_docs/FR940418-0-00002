FR940418-0-00002 FR940418-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy 10 CFR Part 435 [Docket No. CAS&hyph;RM&hyph;79&hyph;112&hyph;C] Energy Conservation Voluntary Performance Standards for New Commercial and Multi-Family High Rise Residential Buildings; Mandatory for New Federal Buildings AGENCY: Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, DOE. ACTION: Final rules; Removal. SUMMARY: Pursuant to a court order, the Department of Energy today removes a portion of the interim commercial building energy performance standards from new Federally-owned buildings which set forth Standby Loss Criteria, Minimum Performance ``Loss'' for electric, gas and oil storage water heaters. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments and statements shall be sent to: Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Mail Stop EE&hyph;432, room 5E&hyph;066, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;7935. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ronald B. Majette, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Room 5E&hyph;066, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;7935. Eugene Margolis, Esq., Office of General Counsel, GC&hyph;72, U.S. Department of Energy, Room 6B&hyph;256, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;9507. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Energy Conservation Standards for New Buildings Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. 6831&hyph;40 (1988), the Department of Energy issued interim energy performance standards that were binding for the design of new Federally-owned buildings. 10 CFR part 435. A portion of the interim standards set forth ``standby loss'' rules to limit those losses in water heaters installed in new federal construction projects. Following publication of the interim standards, the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association filed a lawsuit challenging the ``Standby Loss'' criteria in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. In Gas Appliance Manufacturers Ass'n v. Secretary of Energy , 722 F. Supp. 792 (D.D.C. 1989), the court set the standards aside. It enjoined enforcement of the ``Standby Loss'' rules and remanded the case for the Department to develop a statement of reasons and then to issue its final rule. On remand, the Department published a ``Preliminary Statement of Reasons for Adoption of Standby Loss Criteria,'' 54 FR 49,724, November 30, 1989, as corrected, 54 FR 50,341, December 6, 1989. The Association then filed a second lawsuit against the Department. The District Court upheld the ``Standby Loss'' criteria. 773 F. Supp. 461 (D.D.C. 1991). The Association appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the matter to the District Court. Gas Appliance Manufacturers Ass'n , vs. Department of Energy , 998 F. 2d 1041 (D.C. Cir 1993). With that decision having now become final, the Department is removing the ``Standby Loss'' rules from the Code of Federal Regulations. The Storage Water Heater Standby Loss Criteria in question are part of ยง435.109 of the interim standards, entitled ``Service Water Heating Systems,'' published at 54 FR 4689, January 30, 1989. This section identifies the scope, design principles, minimum requirements, and a prescriptive compliance method for service water heating systems and equipment.
