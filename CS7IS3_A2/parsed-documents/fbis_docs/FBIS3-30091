Han told the National Assembly Committee for Foreign Affairs and Unification that North Korea's acceptance of International Atomic energy agency (IAEA) inspections provided the world with an opportunity to continue efforts to solve the problem through dialogue. However, he said, if North Korea does not issue visas to IAEA inspectors soon, the IAEA will inevitably have to take strong steps. "North Korea is delaying the issuance of visas, linking the start of IAEA inspection of North Korean nuclear sites to the third round of high-level talks with the United States," Han said. The foreign minister told lawmakers that North Korea and the United States met Tuesday and Wednesday after holding a contact on Feb. 15, the day that North Korea announced its acceptance of nuclear inspections, to arrive at some kind of understanding. Han said: "At the recent contacts, Washington told Pyongyang that the IAEA nuclear inspections should be completed satisfactorily and that suspension of `Team Spirit,' the South Korean-U.S. joint military exercise, should be realized only after an exchange of special envoys between South and North Korea. Only then, U.S. officials stressed, can North Korea and the United States hold the third round of high-level talks. But North Korea is insisting that the third round of high-level talks be held at an early date." Once Pyongyang and Washington meet for the third round, inter- Korean dialogue on pending issues including denuclearization of the Korean peninsula can start. In addition, consultations between the IAEA and North Korea on instituting full nuclear safeguards can move forward. He emphasized that to solve completely the nuclear problem, IAEA inspection of Pyongyang's two undeclared nuclear sites and mutual inspections by South and North Korea should be carried out. "If it is disclosed that North Korea diverted nuclear material for other than peaceful purposes as a result of the IAEA inspection, or if it is deemed unsatisfactory, then North Korea will again face a serious situation," Han said. The goverment expects North Korean action to enable the IAEA to begin nuclear inspections immediately, so that a solution to the problem can be found, according to Han.
