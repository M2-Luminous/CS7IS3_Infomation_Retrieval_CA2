Moreover, the National Police limited themselves to reporting that they are checking out the information that has been provided by the Israeli Secret Service, through the Israeli Embassy, indicating that Arabs had reportedly entered the country with the objective of carrying out attacks against Israelis. Despite the fact that the police did not provide many details, Villalba Cataldi stated that there is information that two Arabs entered the country with that purpose in mind. One of them has apparently already left the country, while the other is being sought by the police, according to the vice minister. Commissioner Enrique Martinetti, chief of the Intelligence Department, stated that an investigation has already begun in cooperation with the Migrations Department, Interpol, and authorities of the 4th Police Zone based in Ciudad del Este, as it is believed that the Arabs entered the country through that city. The Israeli Embassy has not been observed to have taken any special measures for the security of its diplomats and officials.
