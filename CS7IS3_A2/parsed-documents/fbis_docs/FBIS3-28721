Agriculture Secretary Roberto Sebastian said the government will gradually reduce trade barriers on agricultural products in the wake of the successful conclusion of the General Agreements on Tariff and Trade (GATT). But the tempo of this policy will have to conform with the existing laws such as the Magna Carta for Small Farmers which requires some form of protection for the country's agricultural sector, he added. Sebastian said the government can only liberalize its market once the country is already prepared to competitively take on the global market. Sebastian explained that the government's protection on smaller farmers does not reverse the government's commitment to free trade and fairer playing field in the world economy. He said these moves are part of government's measures to prepare local farmers for global competition. To prove his point, Sebastian said Malacanang is willing to certify as urgent a package of legislative measures to help local farmers compete in the world market. He said the government is also putting in place the infrastructures needed to become globally-competitive -- irrigation, post-harvest facilities and farm-to-market roads -- while trying to reduce protection measures gradually. To demonstrate how the protection measures are gradually reduced, the agriculture department cited the lifting of quantitative restrictions on processed meat products which was earlier listed on Memorandum Order 95 which reimposes quantitative restrictions (QRS) on a number of products, like corn, corn substitutes, livestock, meat and meat products and other agricultural produce.
