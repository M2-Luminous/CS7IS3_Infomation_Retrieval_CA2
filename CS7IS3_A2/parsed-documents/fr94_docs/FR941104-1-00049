FR941104-1-00049 FR941104-1-00009 At this time the Service feels that there is insufficient information on status and international trade to support a proposal to list the whale shark in Appendix II of CITES. A better understanding of the possible threats to this species is needed before such a proposal could be considered. There does not appear to be firm evidence suggesting that the whale shark has ever been other than infrequent in occurrence, or that there has been a significant increase in the catch of this species by the traditional fisheries in Asia. In lieu of proposals to list the whale shark, requiem sharks, and hammerhead sharks in the Appendices of CITES, the United States has submitted an agenda item on trade in shark products for COP9, which is discussed later in this notice. 7. Bigleaf mahogany ( Swietenia macrophylla ). American mahogany is the genus Swietenia, which is native to the neotropics. Two of the three species are in CITES Appendix II: Swietenia humilis (Pacific Coast mahogany) including its parts and derivatives, which occurs in Mexico and Central America; and Swietenia mahagoni (Caribbean mahogany) including only its logs, sawn wood and veneer, which occurs on some Caribbean islands and extends to southern Florida. The unlisted species, Swietenia macrophylla (bigleaf mahogany), occurs from South America to Mexico; in Costa Rica it evidently forms hybrids naturally with S. humilis. The United States has become the main importer of wood from bigleaf mahogany. During the comment period the Service received 22 responses relating to the January 27, 1994, Federal Register notice; 17 organizations or individuals favored the United States submitting a proposal to include Swietenia macrophylla, including only logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets, and plywood, in Appendix II, and 2 organizations were opposed. The favorable responses, sometimes in detail or with substantial enclosures, were from the company A & M Wood Specialty (Cambridge, Ontario, Canada); on behalf of the architects of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) from the Rainforest and Natural Resources Task Group of the AIA Committee on the Environment; the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society (London, U.K.); Greenpeace USA; the Natural Resources Defense Council of Washington, D.C. (NRDC); the Woodworkers Alliance for Rainforest Protection; some students and staff of Los Altos High School (Los Altos, California); and the general public (six letters). In addition, the following persons with particular research or conservation experience with the species individually supported the submission of a proposal: Mr. J. Beavers (Schaghticoke, New York); Sr. L. Quevedo-H. (Santa Cruz, Bolivia); Dr. L.K. Snook (Westport, Connecticut); and Sr. A. Szwagrzak (La Paz, Bolivia). Moreover, Dr. J.O. Browder, an Associate Professor in the Department of Urban Affairs and Planning of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, provided a copy of his recent study on the feasibility of small-holder mahogany-planting in Rond√¥nia, Brazil; and TRAFFIC USA advised the Service that it was collaborating with a graduate student of public policy at Harvard University who was studying the relative importance of illegal trade in the total trade in the species and the potential effectiveness of a CITES listing in achieving sustainable harvest and trade. Subsequently, TRAFFIC USA advised the Service that instead the study had evolved into hypothetical policy ramifications, and consequently they did not have such new data and information to provide. The responses opposed to the submission of a proposal were from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the International Wood Products Association (IHPA). At the Service's public meeting held on February 22, 1994, the IHPA inquired concerning the responsibilities and process used by the CITES Plants Committee (CPC) in recommending that proposals be considered, and the intention of the Service with regard to circulating potential proposals to the range States for comments, and whether those comments would be reflected in final positions of the United States on the species. The Service representatives responded that the CPC had advisory and technical roles, that the Service intended to communicate with the range States, and that the views of range States would be seriously considered. In comments submitted March 14, 1994, IHPA stated that they share a belief that the species does not qualify for Appendix II. They provided a broad and detailed commentary of opposition (with enclosures), which covered the three potential proposals for the several mahoganies. The Service has noted the particular comments on the genera of African mahoganies in the section on those genera below. At COP8, during an informal meeting on whether to include Swietenia macrophylla in Appendix II, most range States favored the Costa Rica or U.S. proposals_except Bolivia, Peru, and Honduras. Ultimately the preferred U.S. proposal was withdrawn because of continuing disagreement. In keeping with Resolution Conf. 8.21, the Service provided a draft of the new proposal to the range States in mid-April 1994 and solicited their comments. Prior to the June 10, 1994, deadline for submission of proposals for COP9, Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru expressed opposition to the potential proposal, whereas Colombia and El Salvador expressed support. The Service has been discussing this topic with the USFS, particularly regarding concerns about ecological extinction of the species, and with the U.S. Department of State, regarding the positions of range States and the effective role of CITES. The Service recognizes that some have argued that the purchase of CITES-approved mahogany wood could support sustainable use of this species, since listing requires the countries where a species is native to find that its export would not be detrimental to the survival of the species before they issue export permits.
