The start of the implementation of the Declaration of Principles and the Gaza-Jericho Agreement on Palestinian self-rule a few days ago as a result of the efforts made by Egypt's political leadership represented by President Husni Mubarak emphasizes the need to achieve parallel progress on the other tracks in the peace process. The Syrian-Israeli track is the most important track and the Lebanese-Israeli track is closely linked to it. As for the Jordanian-Israeli track, there are no real problems facing it. The U.S. secretary of state is returning to the region to try to break the deadlock on the Syrian-Israeli negotiating track. The track has been deadlocked since the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles was signed in Washington. There is not much that can be said about this track. The situation requires a major step by Israel. Israel must clearly express its acceptance of the principle of full withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights. The U.S. secretary of state carried new Israeli proposals to Damascus during his last tour of the region. Reports in the past two days indicate that Syria has not rejected these proposals but expressed reservations, as they did not explicitly refer to the principle of full withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan. Other reports have also indicated that Syria also has reservations over the timetable for withdrawal proposed by Israel. In light of the above it can be said that the Syrian-Israeli negotiations hinge on an important step on the part of Israel, namely, to clearly express its agreement to withdraw completely from Syria's territory. As for Syria, all the reports indicate that it is ready to establish full peace with Israel in return for full withdrawal and to negotiate an agreement on mutual security guarantees without infringing on the rights or basic legitimate demands of either of the two parties. There are strong indications that Christopher's next tour could break the deadlock in the Syrian-Israeli talks. We do not need to reiterate that Egypt is paying full attention to this peace track, the attention equalling that paid to the Palestinian-Israeli track. The point that must be emphasized here is that while the peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli track has achieved a great breakthrough in solving the Palestinian issue -- the core of the conflict between the Arab countries and Israel -- some remaining problems on this track are still very complicated. The Israeli side has shown some flexibility in its stance on the settlements and indicated the possibility of abandoning them in the final stages. But its stance on other problems remains negative and could, if the intransigence is maintained, undermine the entire peace process despite the strenuous efforts to date. In this regard, we specifically mention the problems of Jerusalem and the refugees. Regarding Jerusalem, no one can foresee how things will develop if no agreement is reached on this issue that is acceptable to both sides and to all the parties concerned with this major issue and its uniqueness. As for the refugee problem, Egypt said before the multilateral talks refugees committee, which has been meeting in Cairo since the day before yesterday, that there will be no peace or stability in the region if this problem is not solved. This issue is subject to international resolutions that should be taken into consideration. Flexibility must be a principal element when dealing with this and other major issues during the peace process, which remains long, uneven, and fraught with dangers. It is an accepted axiom that there is no alternative to peace, which continues to represent the future and hopes of all the peoples of the region, regardless of their nationalities.
