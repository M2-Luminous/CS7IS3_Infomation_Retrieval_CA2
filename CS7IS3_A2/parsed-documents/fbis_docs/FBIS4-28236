State political reporter Tony Allen says it follows meetings between Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett and Australia's international airline, Qantas. [Begin recording] [Allen] Mr. Kennett declared a personal black ban on Qantas and Ansett international services to illustrate his concern at the airlines using Sydney as their base. Now, after talks with Mr. Kennett, Qantas has announced a plan for a weekly direct flight to Osaka's new Kansai Airport. Mr. Kennett said it takes up an unused Ansett right that expires in November. [Kennett] And we will support Qantas to get that flight awarded to Qantas. If that is the case, then we are able then to establish ourselves and to (?prove) up the value of that flight. [end recording] As well, Qantas will add three new flights from Melbourne to Los Angeles via Auckland from the end of October. Qantas says it is more expensive to fly from Melbourne than from the Sydney and Queensland tourist markets, but if the new flights prove a success, there will be more.
