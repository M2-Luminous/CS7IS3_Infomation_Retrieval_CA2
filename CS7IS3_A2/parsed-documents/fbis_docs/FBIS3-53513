The paper adds: Geneva summit confirmed that peace can be genuine only if it is comprehensive and based on the UN resolutions and the principles of international legitimacy and justice. AL-BA'TH stresses that the U.S. Administration would not have convened the Geneva summit if it were not convinced of the importance of the Syria role in the peace process; a role which President Clinton said is crucial to achieve a genuine peace in the Middle East. The paper adds: Political quarters and the media agree that the Geneva summit undoubtedly dotted the i's and crossed the t's to ensure a new launch for the peace process. This is particularly the case when leader al-Asad reaffirmed Syria's certain and firm determination to establish a just and comprehensive peace on all tracks. The paper stresses that the lessons of ancient and contemporary history, as emphasized by President al-Asad, confirm that separate peace and partial solution cannot guarantee a genuine peace. Leader al-Asad very clearly expressed Syria's firm belief that the just and comprehensive peace is a necessity for everyone when he said: We seek a just and comprehensive peace as a strategic option that guarantees Arab rights, terminates the Israeli occupation, and enables all the region's peoples to live in peace, security, and dignity. For his part, U.S. President Clinton was clear in his support of President Hafiz al-Asad's view on the peace process when the U.S. President publicly acknowledged three matters raised by President al-Asad: Syria's principal role, which Clinton considered a key to peace; that the peaceful settlement should be comprehensive and not partial; and his administration's desire to push forward the Syrian-U.S. relations to a new, more important level. AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: The Geneva summit has provided a new and rare opportunity to find a just and comprehensive peace. Israel, as the media and political quarters feel, should make a clear and candid stand away from the methods of deceit and procrastination which it pursues to avoid the dues of the just and comprehensive peace. Within the same context, AL-THAWRAH says in a commentary: The world was right when it considered Presidents al-Asad-Clinton Geneva summit a historic event that will produce an equally important results. From the statements made by President Hafiz a-Asad and Bill Clinton, the world has learned again that the Syria's position on peace and the peace process is unequivocal; it is a clear position, based on objective principles and absolute commitment to the foundations of the peace process and the Madrid formula, as well as the pertinent resolutions of international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace. AL-THAWRAH adds: The emphasis laid by the Geneva summit on the importance of the comprehensive peace and the achievement of that peace banks on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of land for peace and returning to Lebanon its occupied southern part. AL-THAWRAH stresses that this emphasis will help put the peace process back on its normal course, provided that Israel abandons the policy of intransigence and provided that, as President al-Asad has said, the Israeli rulers show enough courage to respond favorably to a genuine peace based on justice and comprehensiveness. The paper adds: With the Geneva summit, the Arab position has scored a historic triumph represented by this summit's results and contribution toward affirming the credibility of the Arab position, guaranteeing the rights of all Arabs, and exposing the evasive nature of the Israeli policy. This would not have been possible without President al-Asad's extraordinary negotiating skills, his ability to convince others of the justness of the Arab causes, and an unlimited ability to represent Arabs and protect their national rights. AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Activating the peace process, which is the main objective of the Geneva summit, was a subject of clear and full agreement between the summiteers. The statements by Presidents al-Asad and Clinton confirmed the importance of the comprehensive peace and the U.S. President stressed the importance of Syria's crucial role in peace and the peace process. On the same subject, and under the headline "Summit of Success," TISHRIN says in an editorial: President Hafiz al-Asad did not need more political fame or credit or more spotlights when he went to Geneva. With his persistent efforts and principled positions and wisdom, he managed to win such things before Geneva. Despite the distorted balance of powers in the world and despite the deteriorating Arab situation, al-Asad managed to make the world acknowledge Syria's pioneering role in the region and the peace process. The paper adds: If it were not for al-Asad, the summit would not have been convened in the first place. Nor would the summit have been convened on the basis of a precise parity between the two parties. The paper adds: Syria's standing was high before the Geneva summit. It grew even bigger after the summit. In his statement, President Clinton said more than once that Syria has a crucial role in the region and that it would not be possible to achieve peace in the region without Damascus or President Hafiz al-Asad, who insists on playing a leading role in the peace process. The paper stresses that the Geneva summit has achieved a major success because it gave credibility to the thesis of the just and comprehensive peace and opened a new chapter in relations between Damascus and Washington. The paper notes that the summit has strengthened the world's confidence in Syria's central and crucial role in the region and foiled all attempts to encroach on Syria's weight and positions. The paper notes that the summit provided a valuable opportunity to build ties of mutual confidence and respect between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. TISHRIN concludes by saying: President al-Asad went to Geneva carrying the burden of the entire Arab cause. He returned with his head high because he protected the nation's dignity, strengthened its self-confidence, and revived its hopes in the possibility of regaining its usurped rights.
