The U.S. is due to announce sanctions against Japan next week over a trade dispute on the phones, and the sources said its latest position means it expects the volume of sales of Motorola-type cellular phones to increase to about 240,000 in the cellular service area extending from Tokyo to Nagoya. The U.S. Government says Japan has violated a 1989 cellular phone trade accord, and is scheduled to unveil by Thursday of next week a list of Japanese products subject to U.S. import sanctions if no settlement is reached by then. At present, the U.S. cellular phone maker Motorola Inc. is holding talks with its Japanese partner Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO). IDO has reportedly offered to accept a Motorola demand to install 159 Motorola base stations for relay of cellular phone transmissions, while Motorola is said to have withdrawn a demand that IDO buy 225,000 Motorola phones. IDO offers both Motorola systems and those made by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) for its cellular phone service in Tokyo-Nagoya area. According to U.S. figures, IDO had signed up 308,000 NTT-type cellular phone subscribers as of the end of last year, and Motorola a mere 12,900 subscribers.
