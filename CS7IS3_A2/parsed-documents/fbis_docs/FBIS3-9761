Kuzilek said the ODA deputies also told Havel about their attitude towards the issue of Jewish property restitution. The ODA-proposed amendments to the out-of-court rehabilitation settlement and land laws are not seen by the ODA deputies as a breach of the 1948 restitution deadline. "All it takes is to be well versed in the 1950s statutes," Kuzilek said. The amendment only seeks that all which ought to have been restituted under the law was restituted, he added. Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) Deputy Group Chairman Karel Hrdy said that he told Havel about an amendment to local election law. The CSSD pushes for a proportionate and simple majority combination election system, he said he told Havel. CSSD Deputy Petra Buzkova said they also consulted the question of pensionable age with Havel. Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) Deputy Group representative and deputy chairman of parliament Jan Kasal said that Havel was open to the idea of "three times and no more," a short for sentencing to life without the possibility of parole habitual offenders on a third conviction of a listed violent crime. Havel agreed, adding, however, that even such convicts should be allowed the chances of re-socialisation under strict conditions still to be worked out, Kasal said. Havel also agreed that alternative punishment for light crimes, namely community work, become part of the criminal code, Kasal said.
