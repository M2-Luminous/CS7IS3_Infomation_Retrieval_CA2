Russian space officials are optimistic that the cryogenic rocket deal with India will be carried through despite Moscow's refusal to supply related technology as envisaged by the original contract. The head of the Russian space agency, Glavkosmos, Mr. Yuri Koptev, told a local news agency that India would receive two extra cryogenic boosters as compensation for technical aid that Russia was forced to cancel. Russia will also supply equipment for the testing and exploitation of cryo-engines. The 1991 contract provided for the delivery of two cryogenic rocket boosters along with the knowhow for their manufacture in India. However, last year Moscow bowed to U.S. pressure not to transfer the cryogenic technology because it allegedly violated the Missile Technology Control Regime designed to prevent the spread of military rocket technology to developing nations. Mr. Koptev said the delivery of extra boosters would keep the initial value of the contract "virtually intact" at about 228 million U.S. dollars. India has already paid Russia about 60 per cent of the cost. Not yet finalised: The cryogenic contract was renegotiated during a visit to India last month by a Russian space delegation led by the head of the Glavkosmos, Mr. Alexander Dunayev. However, diplomatic sources in Moscow said the new terms of the contract were yet to be approved by both sides. Meanwhile, a Russian daily has reported that an additional agreement has been reached by Moscow and Delhi for the supply to India of three more cryogenic boosters at a cost of $3 millions each. The Rossiiskiye Vesti daily, published by the Russian government, said the new contract would enable India to pursue its space exploration programme, although it would have to adjust it to the changed terms of the 1991 contract. According to the paper, additional boosters will be supplied in 1996, after the fulfilment of the main contract.
