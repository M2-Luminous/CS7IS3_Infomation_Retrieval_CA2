Gregory Shaun Cooks, 33, of Austin, Texas, was arrested as he was about leave for Taiwan. The official said 1.4 kilograms (3.1 pounds) of heroin were seized. Convicted drug traffickers face the death penalty in Thailand but the sentence is usually commuted to a lengthy prison term. About two-thirds of the 1,200 foreigners in Thai jails have been jailed for drug offences.
