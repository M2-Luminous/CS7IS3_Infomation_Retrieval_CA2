AL-HAYAH has learned from reliable sources that the Yemeni Foreign Ministry instructed its ambassador in Riyadh to convey to Saudi officials Sanaa's wish to postpone the meeting until a later date "perhaps to be announced after the current pilgrimage season." The sources attribted the Yemeni request to the intensifying differences between Sanaa and Aden, particularly after the failure to implement the reconciliation agreement between the Yemeni president and his deputy. [passage omitted] This is the fourth time Yemen has requested postponement of committee meetings since they started in July 1992. Saudi Arabia still insists on its position, calling for the implementation of al-Ta'if border agreement signed by the two countries in 1934. [passage omitted]
