They discussed the "Partnership for Peace" programme, its practical aspects which guaranteed security. Vincent emphasized that the programme was very broad, but, unfortunately, in the undestanding of many political figures it was encompassing only the cooperation in military sphere. Vincent noted that the most important thing in the programme was the identity of both political and human virtues because post-communist countries joined the agreement. The programme "Partnership for Peace" was the adaptation period for the countries which sought NATO membership. During the period the aspiring countries would be observed by the Western countries in order to be sure they would orient themselves towards Western values, Vincent said. Brazauskas also admitted that "Partnership for Peace" was considered as the process of acquiring NATO membership. Brazauskas approved Russia's decision to join the programme. It would be the greatest achievement in the meantime, if Russia signed the documents of the "Partnership for Peace" programme and took part in it with the same status like all other countries, Brazauskas noted.
