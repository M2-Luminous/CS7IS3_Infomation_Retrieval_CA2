He noted that he was in the Dniester area where there were hostilities between the Moldovan Government and the breakaway Dniester Republic, and in Nagorno-Karabakh. He also visited other "flash points" in the world and drew the conclusion that it is impossible, as a rule, to settle such conflicts without the participation of peace keepers. The upper chamber committees on international affairs as well as on security and defence will discuss, at a joint sitting, the question on dispatching an additional military contingent to the U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia. The committees will debate a request by the U.N. secretary-general addressed to the Russian president to send an additional military contingent to the U.N. Protection Force stationed in Bosnia and Herzegovina in connection with the conclusion of agreements on a peaceful settlement of the conflict and a ceasefire in the Sarajevo zone. In compliance with the Russian Constitution, the province of the Federation Council (upper chamber of the Russian parliament) includes "the question on possible use of the Russian Armed Forces outside the territory of the Russian Federation". The preliminary debate on the issue will be conducted by the committees which will submit their proposal to a plenary session of the upper chamber. The Federation Council will debate the question on dispatching an additional military contingent numbering 300 to participate in the U.N. Protection Force to ensure control over the implementation of the agreement on a peaceful settlement of the conflict.
