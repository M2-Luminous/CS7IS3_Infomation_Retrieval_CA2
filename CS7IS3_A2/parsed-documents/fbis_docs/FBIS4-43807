According to Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen, the SPD wants to make it clear at tomorrow's party conference in Halle that Germany will lose its prospects if it "continues the politics of the same old rut." According to FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer, the FDP's campaign will show voters that the issue to be voted on in autumn is "the parliamentary existence of political liberalism." Verheugen said in Bonn that "more reasons are accumulating each day" for having a tough confrontation with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In this context, the federal manager referred to the coalition's failed efforts to present a joint tax concept for the next four years. The state secretary in the Finance Ministry, Franz-Christoph Zeitler (Christian Social Union), said on the weekend that this failure is not due to differences between the Union and the FDP, but that it involves an opportunity to focus on different priorities in the election campaign. Verheugen said this means "simply that each of the government parties wants to serve their own customers in the election campaign." The slogan adopted by the Union and the FDP on tax issues is: "Lie separately, win jointly." But they will not succeed in this, Verheugen said. The SPD's one-day party conference in Halle will adopt the government program and nominate Chairman Rudolf Scharping as candidate for chancellor. "Both these decisions will confirm that the SPD under Rudolf Scharping has achieved a high degree of unity," Verheugen announced. For the federal manager the lively internal debate on the SPD's election campaign strategy and coalition statements following the lost European elections is not surprising. In Verheugen's view, the large amount of good advice the SPD has received from party members is in line with the party leadership's basic course: "I cannot trace any tangible mood suggesting that a coalition statement must be made or that the strategy of concentrating on a few important issues must be changed." Hermann Rappe, chairman of the Chemical Workers' Trade Union and SPD Bundestag deputy, warned the SPD against making a coalition statement in favor of the Greens. "Voters want to see unity in the SPD, and they want to see what the SPD's political priorities are," Rappe said on DEUTSCHLANDFUNK radio. Discussions about a coalition with the Greens are not right strategically, nor tactically, and they harm the party, Rappe said. At its strategy debate on Saturday, there was wide agreement in the FDP Presidium that the party must deepen its election campaign in terms of contents. Besides achievement-orientation, the liberals' openness and their speaking out for tolerance and the constitutional state must be pointed out clearly, Secretary General Hoyer said. He was commissioned by the party to work out the "necessary corrections" to the existing advertising campaign and to present them to the Presidium within the next two weeks. It is obvious that the FDP must not concentrate solely on the economy, but must also "build a bridge" toward ecology; also it has to live up to its traditional role of "guardian" of the liberal constitutional state. The FDP leadership also wants to conduct a more accentuated election campaign against the Greens. In a letter to leading party functionaries, Hoyer said that the Greens must no longer be spared on account of being "a party of kindly idealists." There are many overlaps between voters of the FDP and the Greens, which must be taken more into account in the future. The FDP does not want to "outdo the Greens in terms of green populism," but to step up involvement in issues "that are of utmost concern to the citizens." Hoyer fiercely criticized Interior Minister Kanther's proposal to establish a voluntary reserve police force. Such a "spare-time police" is the wrong way to meet people's wish for more security. The state's division of powers must not be watered down. The right way, and the one that makes sense financially, is to increase the number of police officers, Hoyer said.
