He was talking with heads of plants, companies and financial groups -- both state-operated and market-based ones. Taking part in the meeting was Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Although the "pre-collapse" state, according to Yeltsin, is typical of not all enterprises, still "such a danger exists". The president said that he had "discussed in detail" the situation in production and the economy with the prime minister, outlining measures for its improvement. Political issues were not touched upon, for they are "more or less defined". The president believes that the political situation is "sufficiently favourable for foreign investments in the Russian economy". Following this discussion, said the president, the government has drafted eight decrees linked with the improvement of the economy. "In order not to make a mistake," Yeltsin addressed the audience, "we have invited you to look together into the decisions which we have not yet adopted but would like to adopt". Then the meeting went on behind closed doors.
