The mass-circulation daily named the two as Michihiko Kano and Masayasu Kitagawa, both of whom have pushed for political and electoral reforms. Kano, Kitagawa and their supporters are expected to leave the LDP in a day or two, at the earliest, the ASAHI said in its evening edition. Kano has served as director general of the Management and Coordination Agency, while Kitagawa was once parliamentary vice minister of education. The two men are lobbying some 40 LDP legislators to join a new party they want to set up, and hope to get at least 20 members for it, the newspaper said without attribution. Kitagawa is known for his close ties with new party Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura, who is the chief cabinet secretary. The pair plan to keep their distance from both the LDP and the ruling coalition, it said.
