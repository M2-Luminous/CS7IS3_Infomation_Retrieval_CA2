This initiative is part of the commendable efforts exerted by the Kingdom to support the Palestinian cause and to safeguard Islamic holy sites in the venerable Jerusalem. The custodian of the two holy mosques has instructed Prince Salman Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor of Riyadh Province and chairman of the Popular Committee to Aid Palestinian Strugglers, to take charge of the popular donations campaign throughout the Kingdom. Prince Salman has addressed a touching appeal to the Saudi people and to all Arab and Muslim citizens and residents, urging them to contribute effectively and to donate generously. For this purpose, Prince Salman has established a unified account at all of the Kingdom's banks in order to facilitate the reception of donations. Thirteen popular committees in the venerable Mecca, luminous Medina, Riyadh, Jeddah, al-Dammam, Abha, al-Qasim, al- Hasa, al-Ta'if, 'Ar'ar, al-Kharj, Tabuk, and al-Khafji have begun to receive citizens' donations that are flowing into banks during bank work hours from 0900-1400 and from 2100-0030. The banks will manage the donation accounts and will submit periodic reports on the progress of the campaign to Prince Salman Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz. In a related development, 'Abd-al-Rahim al-Jamus, director of the Kingdom's offices of the Popular Committees to Aid Palestinian Strugglers, has made special statements to express his pride in King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz's noble initiative, saying, "We believe that this call will receive an immediate and prompt response from the Kingdom's citizens, especially since the campaign is led by Prince Salman Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, who has been chairman of the Popular Committee to Aid Palestinian Strugglers since 20 Dhu al-Qa'dah 1387 of the Hegira, corresponding to 1968. Donations have amounted to more than 1.5 billion riyals since this committee was created. The Kingdom's citizens have contributed and members of the Palestinian community in the Kingdom, both those working in the government and in the private sector, have donated 5 percent of their salaries.
