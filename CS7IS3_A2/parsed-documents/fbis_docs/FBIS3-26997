But the unofficial wink at the new primary school -- intended for the children of Taiwan investors in the area -- was obtained only on condition that the Shenzhen government appoint the headmaster. Taiwan's national flag and song will be forbidden. Set to open next year with about 200 students, the school has become a symbol of the sensitive nature of cross-straits relations. The head of Shenzhen's Taiwan business association, Wu Sheng-shun, spent a year convincing Beijing that primary schools were no threat to communism. "I told them that up to lower middle school, education has no political implications," he said. The school will be allowed to use Taiwan teachers and schoolbooks, provided they are screened beforehand. But Beijing has warned that teachers must avoid spreading "political and ideological influences". Wu needed longer to convince Taipei, where education officials feared the pupils might be polluted by communism. But last week he won guarantees that the students would be able to enter middle school in Taiwan automatically, without any testing. In a symbolic tit-for-tat, Taipei demanded assurances that the mainland teachers at the school would not teach simplified Chinese characters, which the Communists introduced to fight illiteracy. Education is not the only reason for setting up the Shenzhen school, which will be enclosed in a compound with 210 luxury homes for the families of students. Taiwan investors on the mainland, especially those in Guangdong, have suffered from countless kidnappings, robberies and beatings in recent years. Security and comfort will be assured inside the fortified compound. "I've been living in my factory ever since I came here six years ago," said Wu, whose company makes bicycles. "There's nowhere else safe at the moment." After the school is built, at least some of the 10,000-odd Taiwan managers and technicians working in Shenzhen and Dongguan will find safety in numbers. "We'll all be together. That's one of the main benefits," Wu said. But, to Beijing, that is one of the dangers. The establishment of Taiwan-run organisations in the mainland has long been blocked for fear they may become touchstones for pro-Nationalist, or at least anti-Communist, sentiments. Taiwan business groups are required to have a mainland Chinese as head. Beijing's approval for the Shenzhen school appears to be part of its courtship of Taiwan investors, many of whom are reluctant to bring their wives and children to the mainland. Wu says it was the lure of more Taiwan investment that won the school the support of the head of the Chinese Communist Party's Taiwan Affairs Office, Wang Zhaoguo, whom he met in November. "I told him that if you want to improve conditions for Taiwan investors, you had better pay attention to the Taiwanese men in their thirties and forties, whose children are still young," Wu said. Taiwan officials, led by the secretary-general of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, Li Ching-ping, will visit the mainland next month to discuss primary schools with Beijing. Wu says if the Shenzhen school proves a success, other mainland cities could have Taiwan-run primary schools.
