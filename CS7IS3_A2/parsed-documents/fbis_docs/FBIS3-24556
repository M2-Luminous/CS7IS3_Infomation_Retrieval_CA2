Effectiveness depends greatly on the adsorptive properties of the adsorbents. In a previous work a study was made of the adsorptive properties of domestic porous polymers obtained by copolymerization of styrene with divinyl benzene, and Tenaks-GC (poly, para-2,6-polyphenylene oxide). These products were found to be lacking in uniformity of properties from lot to lot and having low resistance to heat. In the present work a study was made of the adsorption properties of Porolas-SG-2T, a new adsorbent prepared by copolymerization of ethylstyrene with divinyl benzene and derivatives of methacrylic acid. It has a specific surface of 270 m[.sup]2[/] per gram, 1.1 cm[.sup]3[/] per gram total pore volume, and 213 angstrom units average pore diameter. It was demonstrated that this adsorbent is more specific in interaction with the functional groups of simple esters, ketones, and especially n-alcohols, than Polysorb-1. This is evidently due to differences in the geometry and chemistry of the surfaces. The results indicate that Poroplas-SG-2T may be recommended for use as an adsorbent to concentrate high priority atmospheric contaminants. References 8: 4 Russian, 4 Western.
