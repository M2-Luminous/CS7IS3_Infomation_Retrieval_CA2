In an interview with the television company `N-TV' in Berlin on Thursday [3 March], Kinkel came out against issuing such an ultimatum "without examination" and "automatically" for such cities as Tuzla and Bihac. Instead, the "new momentum" has to be used "to make political progress." Kinkel nevertheless advocates linking the "political" and the "military" components. He argues for "tackling the individual crisis spots with this combination of the military and the political approaches, but above all with the political approach." In this way, an "overall solution" should be achieved "by a domino effect."
