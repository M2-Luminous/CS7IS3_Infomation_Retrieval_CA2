Type of Request: New collection. Burden: 4,605 hours. Number of Respondents: 92,100. Avg Hours Per Response: 3 minutes. Needs and Uses: In preparation for the Year 2000 Decennial Census, the Census Bureau will conduct a test census in 1995 of five test sites around the United States. We will conduct a precanvass operation at three of the test sites classified as urban areas. The precanvass operation will identify and collect a complete mailing address for every housing unit not already appearing in the Census Bureau's Master Address File (MAF). The MAF consists of 1990 census addresses updated with recently acquired United States Post Service (USPS) address records. During precanvass, enumerators will conduct interviews with homeowners and owners or managers of multiunit buildings. Unit addresses will be corrected, deleted, or added to a listing given to the enumerators. This operation will test the completeness of USPS address records and the quality of forms and procedures to be implemented for the Year 2000 Decennial Census. Affected Public: Individuals or households. Frequency: One time only. Respondent's Obligation: Mandatory. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313.
