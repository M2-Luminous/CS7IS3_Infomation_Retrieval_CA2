The newspaper said the agent, known as Gnat, currently holds a high-ranking post in the ministry. He is reportedly a former activist of the Sajudis popular front and was awarded for defending the parliament and other state institutions during the Soviet military aggression in 1991. LIETUVOS RYTAS implied that the pseudonym Gnat is used for Ignas Stankovicius, director of the ministry's International and Internal Relations Division. There has been no immediate reaction from the leadership of national defense. The ministry's press service said Stankovicius is currently on vacation due to health problems. Stankovicius, formerly an employee of the Physicotechnical Institute and regional environmental protection inspector, made a career leap to the rank of colonel in structures of national defense. In the summer of 1990, Stankovicius was appointed as the assistant director of the then Department of Defense, but his further career was interrupted by then Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius, who dismissed Stankovicius for "neglect of duties, disregarding property and the basic needs of soldiers and officers." But LIETUVOS RYTAS noted that soon before Stankovicius left the post, the leadership of national defense and the parliament's National Security Committee were informed by an anonymous "former KGB colonel" that KGB agent Gnat works in the system of defense. Stankovicius returned to the Ministry of Defense in January 1992. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in early 1993.
