You have our greetings, love, loyalty, and all heroic sacrifices since you represent the origin, right, and the source of all that is good and all powers. O dear steadfast people, you have our thanks and appreciation, because your Armed Forces achieved continuous victories against the elements of apostasy, rebellion, and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] for the sake of foiling the plan of hostility to the people, which is aimed at destroying the homeland, and of checking the intrigue of sabotaging the constitutional institutions in the country. Congratulations to you and to all the sons of our people in all the governorates of the republic, in Sanaa, Aden, Sa'dah, Abyan, Ta'izz, Lahij, al-Bayda', Hajjah, al-Maharah, al-Jawf, al-Hudaydah, Hadhramaut, Ma'rib, Shabwah, and all over Yemen. Congratulations to you on the victories of unity, freedom, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. You have our heartfelt greetings and thanks in all positions, on coasts, in valleys, and on mountains while you are supporting your legitimate leadership, constitutional institutions, and valiant Armed Forces in the battle of unity and fate, the battle of defending unity, freedom, and democracy, the battle of existence and fate, and the battle of defending unity, freedom, justice, and equality. Greetings and appreciation to your gigantic Army, which is fulfilling the pledge to safeguard unity and democracy through its confrontation with the tyrannical secessionists in the YSP and their attempts to ignite the military situation and to foment sedition for the sake of achieving their personal purposes and fragmenting the homeland and undermining the people's unity. The army of unity and democracy confronted treachery and aggression and performed its sacred duties so as to uproot all the secessionist and traitorous fortifications and to destroy them one stronghold after another. Your army is, at this moment, on the brink of crushing with its confident mighty hand the secessionists' wicked fortifications by besieging their dens with cordons of fire. It will write with its hands on the gates of free Aden the true and profound meaning of freedom after this freedom has been abused for the past 30 years under the coercion and repression of the party's dictatorship and its theory of rancor against the people and all its classes, which have lived under all woes of humiliation, fear, and death under the policies, conflicts, and massacres of the unjust secessionist clique. We address the members of this clique: You may turn to the right and turn to the left, but you will always find behind you the angry sea with roaring waves that will toss you asunder, and in front of you the army of the state and the people, the army of wisdom and faith, whose battalions and brigades are devouring you. O treacherous secessionists, remnants of the collapsing red communism, whichever way you turn your face and no matter what cloak of deception and trickery you try, no one will trust you because you have never trusted anyone. You have not even trusted each other. You did not trust the fortress of unity, the giant revolutionary and historic achievement that you sought to be a part of. Those who are conspiring against fate and the people for their selfish and personal interests and ambitions, will only reap ignominy and defeat. It has become clear that the red star fluttering above your heads, with which you have decorated the walls of your houses and camps, remains vivid evidence of your rancor, infidelity, sinfulness, and disobedience. You, brother officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers in the military units under the control of the secessionist clique, must join the army of unity, freedom, and democracy, as some of your brothers did in 'Imran, Dhamar, Yarim, Sanaa, Abyan, Shabwah, and in the Aden Governorate. This is so that your loyalty is to God, the homeland, the revolution, and constitutional legitimacy. This is especially important since this loyalty constitutes the course of safeguarding your life and the blood of your comrades-in-arms, through which you will restore your prestige and position in life and in the Armed Forces. Then you may return to your honorable position of defending the unity and democracy in the battles of defending right, freedom, unity, democracy, and of safeguarding the sanctity of constitutional legitimacy. Here are the dens of treason and the strongholds of the secessionists, collapsing before the soldiers who have faith in God and the homeland, and in unity and democracy. Do not be late in joining the ranks of the advancing forces of unity and legitimacy so that you will have the honor to triumph with them, for the will of the people, and so that you may safeguard history, which is now back on its true course after the achievement of unity and of fortifying it with democracy. Let the people be above all parties and have the upper hand. Let their interests be above all interests, selfishness, and parochial party policies, God willing.
