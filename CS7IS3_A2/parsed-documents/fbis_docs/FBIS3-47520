The immediate reason for the change is a recent revision of the law governing the Agency, curtailing its right to investigate cases involving anti-communist activities and establishing a watchdog committee in the National Assembly. But the Agency appears to have realized that it has reached the point where it has to switch from the practice of supervising domestic politics to boosting the nation's competitive power by gathering information overseas. In other words, the Agency has to internationalize itself if it is to serve the nation in the world arena. Director Kim Tok set the goal for the Agency in his New Year's message: "Let's become an international intelligence organization in tune with the general trend for internationalization." Accordingly, the Agency is now in the middle of the processes to strengthen the functions of collecting information, especially on business in foreign countries, after abolishing the department that was in charge of political affairs. Kim Tok specifically prohibited NSP agents from meddling in domestic politics. The Agency is also training its officials to specialize in various fields while stepping up foreign language education for its agents. It has already began sending NSP officials abroad for one- year study of language and political and social backgrounds of a country they are to be assigned to later. The NSP is also encouraging officials to develop associations with Korean businessmen and intelligence agents of their assigned countries, sources say. Moreover, the Agency made the use of computers a requirement for all agents and the ability to use a computer is a must for promotion. In addition, the NSP is working out measures to handle the "enormous amount" of information being collected by vast networks of Korean big businesses operating overseas and to prevent foreigners from siphoning off Korea's own economic information for foreign interests. The Agency is also faced with the necessity of strengthening its department in charge of affairs related to the National Assembly since it no longer is be able to take advantage of the confidentiality of Agency work under the revised law on the NSP. What irks the Agency more than anything else in the passage of the revised law is the abolition of the Agency's right to investigate persons accused of not informing the authorities of communist activities despite their knowledge or those who praise the North Korean political system. Initially, there was "some opposition" in the agency when those rights were abolished, but most NSP officials have now accepted the revision as part of "unavoidable" action on the part of the civilian government of President Kim Yong-sam, sources say. Under the revised law, the Agency is barred from auditing the security matters of every government agency. It has also lost the right to "coordinate business" of other governmental agencies. As a result, it is faced with shifting some personnel in charge of those affairs elsewhere.
