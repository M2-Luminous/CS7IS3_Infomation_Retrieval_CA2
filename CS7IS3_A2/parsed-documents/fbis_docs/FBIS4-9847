FBIS4-9847 "drlat064_r_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-064 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 Peru Minister Terms U.S. Jurists Report `Inconsistent' Minister Terms U.S. Jurists Report `Inconsistent' PY0104182694 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1501 GMT 31 Mar 94 PY0104182694 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 31 Mar (EFE) -- Peruvian Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santa Gadea described as "inconsistent" a report by a commission of international jurists led by U.S. attorney Robert Goldman that criticizes the Peruvian administration of justice. On 24 March Goldman informed Minister Vega that on 31 March he was going to release the report on "the administration of justice in Peru," which was prepared by the Goldman Commission after a three-day visit to Peru in 1993. In a letter to Goldman disseminated today, Vega denies Goldman's contention that the Goldman report has been released "at the request of the Peruvian Government." Vega states that in the face of repeated requests by the U.S. Government "it was agreed" to allow a team of jurists led by Goldman to visit Peru to learn about the Peruvian administration of justice. Vega adds that he has not asked the Goldman Commission for any report and that the U.S. Embassy in Lima has noted that the commission of jurists "has received this task from the State Department." These remarks, Vega says, should not be construed as a refusal by the Peruvian Government to have U.S. jurists come to Peru to learn about its justice system. He adds: "Yet, to accept an analysis which criticizes the current legal system, and which contains warnings and drastic recommendations that should be applied immediately is an altogether different thing." In his letter, Vega states that spending three days analyzing the Peruvian legal reality causes the report to be "so superficial that most of its conclusions and recommendations are only based on prejudgements and legal inconsistencies." Vega adds that the report has overlooked the progress made in November 1993 in making the Peruvian antiterrorist laws more flexible and states that the "reformulation" of the conclusions to convert them into simple "suggestions" reflects "the low degree of seriousness with which the original report was conceived." Vega "categorically" denies Goldman's allegation that he had informed him that the commission was going to prepare a report on the administration of justice in Peru.
