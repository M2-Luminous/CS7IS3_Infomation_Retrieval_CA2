In so doing, they attempted to raise provocations against and impose greater pressure on China by using pretexts they have cooked up. The Chinese representative refuted the resolution with perfect justice at the meeting and raised a no-action motion on the text. It turned out that China's motion passed the panel by a majority vote. This incident clearly tells us that interference in the internal affairs of other countries under the cover of human rights can find less and less public support these days. Chinese Premier Li Peng's remarks on the incident in his Government Work Report delivered at the NPC session yesterday were met with a thunderous applause, thus showing clearly the disgust of the 1.2 billion Chinese people with these human rights mongers. It is known to all that China is the world's biggest developing country. China's backwardness is, to a great extent, the result of the protracted aggression and oppression of a number of major western countries, which today are engaged in selling "human rights." As an independent sovereign country, China is now concentrating its energy on economic construction with a view to build itself into a modernized country. The Chinese Government has gained the thoroughgoing understanding that realization of this goal requires a sound social environment of stability and unity. Any turbulence in China will not only bring disasters to the Chinese people, but will also produce a great adverse impact on the stability and peace of Asia as well as the world. Practice has proved that the policy of reform, development, and stability currently pursued by the Chinese Government is a correct and successful policy. However, there are always people with ulterior motives in foreign countries who fly in the face of the facts, deliberately create over and over again so-called "human rights problems," and seize on the subject to exaggerate matters. The "shells" they are using in their attacks against China are no more than the few violators of Chinese law. They never concerned themselves in the past and do not take an interest today in the sufferings of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people. It is obvious to all that their real aim in brandishing the club of "human rights" is to impose political pressure on China, obstruct China's stability and development, and force the Chinese people to give up the development road they have chosen which conforms to China's national conditions. It is natural, therefore, that what they are up to has been cast aside by the Chinese people and the Chinese Government. It seems strange that all human rights mongers in today's world suffer from farsightedness. They can only envisage or imagine the problems of other countries, especially the Third World developing countries, yet turn a blind eye to the human rights situation in their own countries. As a matter of fact, the human rights records of their own countries are most inglorious. Among those who are selling "human rights," the most hard-working will perhaps be a handful of people with power and influence in the United States. Over recent years, these people have gone so far as to lump together the "human rights" issue with totally unrelated trade issues, asserting that "China's MFN trading status will be abolished" provided China fails to improve its "human rights" situation. Such an absurd idea has been found unacceptable even by many in the Western camp. At his meeting with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher the day before yesterday, Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans said in firm and clear-cut terms that Australia disapproves the current practice of the United States to lump together human rights with the MFN issue, for the MFN trading status "is not an honorable privilege but a form of normal trading relations." U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to arrive in Beijing today for a visit, and he is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit China since President Bill Clinton took office. That China receives him during the NPC and CPPCC sessions has clearly underscored the fact that China attaches great importance to its relations with the United States. The Chinese Government believes that establishing and promoting friendly relations between the two countries not only tallies with the interests of both, but is also beneficial to maintaining peace in the Asian-Pacific region and the world. China's policy toward the United States encompasses augmenting mutual trust, reducing troubles, stepping up cooperation, and refraining from coming into confrontation. During Christopher's visit in the country, China is willing to exchange views with him on bilateral relations and wide-ranging international affairs on an equal footing with a view to further mutual understanding. Yet, if someone takes China's forbearance for frailty and vulnerability to attack, makes indiscreet criticisms with insufferable arrogance, and even threatens to cancel China's MFN trading status, then he is sure to meet with a rebuff in China.
