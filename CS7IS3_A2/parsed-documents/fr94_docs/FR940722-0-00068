FR940722-0-00068 FR940722-0-00017 D. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; and E. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. Because of the threats discussed above, the Service believes that factors A, C, D, and E may apply to the southern Rocky Mountain population of the boreal toad. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the threats faced by this population. After reviewing the petition, references cited in the petition, and other available information the Service finds that the petition presents substantial information indicating that listing the southern Rocky Mountain population of the boreal toad as endangered may be warranted. Within 1 year from the date the petition was received, a finding as to whether the petitioned action is warranted is required by Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act. The petitioners also requested that critical habitat be designated. If the 12-month finding determines that the petitioned action to list the boreal toad is warranted, then the designation of critical habitat would be addressed in the subsequent proposed rule. At that time the Service also would determine if it is appropriate to propose to list the population as endangered or threatened. More detailed information regarding the above decisions may be obtained from the Service's Golden office (see ADDRESSES above). References cited A complete list of all references cited is available upon request from the Golden, Colorado, field office (See ADDRESSES Section). Author The primary author of this 90-day finding is Terry Ireland (See FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT above). Authority: The authority for this action is the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1544).
