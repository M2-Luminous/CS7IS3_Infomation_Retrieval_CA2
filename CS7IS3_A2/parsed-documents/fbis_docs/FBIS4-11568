They clarified, however, that the economy is "strong, and thus the country's economic development model is viable." Meanwhile, Victor Manuel Terrones Lopez, president of Canacintra [National Association of the Processing Industry], has predicted "stronger pressure is on the way from small groups seeking to break social peace," and he urged sectors to act "coldly and prudently to prevent violence at any cost in the upcoming elections." In an interview with UNOMASUNO, Cesar Hernandez Espejo, president of the National Association of Executives of Business Chambers and Associations [Asociacion Nacional de Ejecutivos de Camaras y Asociaciones Empresariales], has said there is no threat of economic instability because of the closeness of the elections. He added "given that we Mexican businessmen are not a political party, we will continue to invest and create jobs even if the Presidency is not won by the ruling party because we are part of a country that has a great chance of overcoming its problems and modernizing its economy, and, in turn, of achieving a definite economic consolidation." The country's top organization, which is affiliated with the CCE and CEESP, in a joint analysis of "the viability of Mexico's economic development model," believes "the pressure applied by the exchange rate and financial markets in November 1993 and March 1994 demonstrated the effectiveness and strength of the economic policy and the progress achieved so far because otherwise unfortunate events would have brought about economic crises of incalculable magnitude to the country." It is said this economic strength creates maneuvering space, which is "significant for economic development as well as a means to face difficult periods." The two organizations have explained that adverse developments, such as the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, "have not been caused by problems of economic or economic policy problems, and it is wrong to associate their impact on economic development with problems that are not inherent to it." In debating the strength of the Mexican economy, the CCE and CEESP have pointed out Mexico has managed to maintain a moderate growth of 16.9 percent from 1988 to 1993. Real remuneration (salaries, wages, benefits) grew by 31.9 percent in the manufacturing sector. "Few countries have managed to continuously reduce inflation while preserving economic growth and increasing competitiveness," the business leader added. According to the analysis of these two business organizations, the following will give the Mexican economy space to maneuver and even face other difficult situations: - The perseverance and congruity of economic policy during regular and critical periods, as was the case recently. - The strengthening of the national productive apparatus based on efforts to modernize and improve international productivity and competitiveness. - The tidying up of public finances and budget discipline. - The trust of investors, government authorities, and international organizations on the Mexican economy. It is also claimed that the process to modernize the Mexican economy shows significant progress and favorable results in various areas, "but this does not mean this did not entail costs for various sectors or that the process is over." On the contrary, the CCE and CEESP have added, "it is necessary to hasten the pace and increase efforts in all areas that for various reasons have fallen behind or have become out of step with the process of modernization." Likewise, it was said current headway in the development scheme and results make the Mexican economic process of modernization irreversible, because to "abandon or modify that scheme will cause serious consequences for the country's future and economic viability." The two business organizations have stated efforts that have already been made cannot be wasted because most of the economic adjustments have already been completed, and "their costs have already been covered, and the benefits are only now beginning to be reaped." Nor did they recommend the Mexican economic development model be changed because Mexico's challenge "is to ensure the full completion of the process of modernization, making it essential to advance and broaden all those areas in which the process has made the least headway." The CCE and the CEESP have concluded it is essential to complete the process of modernization "because it is the only way to guarantee a sustained, expeditious, fair, and balanced economic development." Canacintra President Terrones Lopez, interviewed shortly after a news conference in which he said the gross national product will grow between 1.5 to 2 percent in 1994 and that there will be 7-percent inflation, has expressed the private sector's commitment "to redouble investment and efforts to counter actions of destabilization by small groups, because we still have confidence in the country and its institutions." Lopez believes that as election time draws nearer, "pressure from destabilizing groups will be greater, but one must consider that Mexicans can rise above adversity, as we have seen for a long time, and in the face of this threat businessmen will strengthen efforts and work." He clarified that in addition to the education and cultural process in which Mexican society is involved, there is also a political process that permits greater awareness to analyze events with a cool head, "but it is essential that rumors which affect us so much be ignored because all sectors must seek social peace." Lopez said that regardless of the unfortunate events that have transpired, and those that may transpire, the government is continuing its economic program of support to the micro, small, medium, and big businesses; therefore, it will also continue to restructure their commercial bank debts. The Canacintra president said foreign capital continues to flow into Mexico, to the amount of $5 billion between January and March, and "that is why we need to act calmly and always place national interest first." In conclusion, he reported he has met with Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit authorities to look into the possibility of reducing the 2-percent tax on fixed assets and the value added tax, adjusting it to international levels of between 7 to 8 percent.
