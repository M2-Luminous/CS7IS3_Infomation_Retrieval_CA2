FR940826-2-00077 FR940826-2-00055 IX Retention of Jurisdiction Jurisdiction is retained by this Court for the purpose of enabling any of the parties to this Final Judgment to apply to this Court at any time for such further orders or directions as may be necessary or appropriate for the construction or carrying out of this Final Judgment, for the modification of any of the provisions hereof, for the enforcement of compliance herewith, and for the punishment of any violation hereof. X Modification A. If BOC Wireless Systems are relieved in whole or in part of any or all of the comparable equal access or nondiscrimination obligations of the MFJ as a result of legislation, judicial orders, or agency orders that vacate, modify, supersede, or interpret the provisions of the MFJ, the provisions of Article IV of this Final Judgment shall be modified or vacated to provide the same relief to AT&T or McCaw upon their showing that competitive conditions do not require a different obligation for AT&T and McCaw and that his modification is equitable and in the public interest. B. If AT&T and McCaw seeks modification or removal of the provisions of this Final Judgment upon grounds that include a showing either (1) that enhanced specialized mobile radio services, personal communications services licensed in the 1.8 to 2.1 GHz band, or other services have developed as effective competitive alternatives to the cellular services in existence at the time of entry of the Final Judgment, or (2) that there have been other changes or developments affecting a relevant market, AT&T and McCaw will be entitled to modification of the provisions of Article IV or Article V of this Final Judgment if it shows that intervening changes have made the retention of the provision inequitable, irrespective of whether the intervening changes or developments had been foreseen or were foreseeable when the Final Judgment was entered. AT&T and McCaw have stipulated that they will not move for any modification of this Final Judgment, except with the consent of the United States, for eighteen months following the date of the commencement of this action. XI Expiration The provisions of this Final Judgment, to the extent they remain in effect, shall expire on the date ten years after its entry. XII Public Interest Entry of this Final Judgment is in the public interest.
