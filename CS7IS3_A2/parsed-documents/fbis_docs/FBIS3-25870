Whereas the Hong Kong issue is also an urgent one, and the government should all the more derive a policy as soon as possible, and inform industrial and commercial circles at an early date so that they can make preparations. Ku Chen-fu pointed out that based on the future economic policy of Taiwan, establishing an Asia-Pacific operation center and a special free trade zone is now a fixed direction; on this premise, the issue of direct flights between both sides of the strait cannot be always avoided, and preliminary planning should be done.
