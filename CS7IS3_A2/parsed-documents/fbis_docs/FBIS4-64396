"I do not want to live in an illiberal country," the chairman of Fininvest told Italians, adding, in a sports metaphor that would become his signature during the campaign, that he had decided to "enter the game" because he believed the country was "governed by immature powers and by people tightly bound to a past which has been a failure on a political and economical plane." Berlusconi, 57, who abandoned the helm of one of Italy's biggest private industrial groups to mount his Forza Italia (Go Italy) electoral campaign, had been testing the political waters for some time before that announcement. He said he thought someone had to present a "viable" conservative alternative to the coalition of Progressives led by the Left Democrat Party (formerly the Italian Communist Party), a coalition the businessman defined as "Communist." When he founded Forza Italia, Berlusconi handed over to Fedele Confalonieri, Fininvest's number two, the chairmanship (but not the ownership) of a conglomerate which operates in the television, advertising publishing, supermarket, insurance and building sectors, generating net earnings of 10.5 trillion lire (6.2 billion dollars) in 1992. He also owns the winning AC Milan football club, which after Wednesday night's [27 April] game is headed for its fourth European Cup final in six years. With a considerable debt burden, the Fininvest empire chalked up industrial and financial current account losses for the first time ever in 1992. Losses were due mainly to interest payments of 738 billion lire (434 million dollars) on debts of 4.5 trillion lire (2.6 billion dollars). Net capital stood at 1.078 trillion lire (634 million dollars). The question of how to separate Berlusconi's political role from the influence of his media empire continues to be a vexing one for Italian politics, with no firm solution to the problem yet clear. The son of a bank employee, Berlusconi began his entrepreneurial career in 1962 at the age of 25, immediately showing a flair for business and for threading the bureaucratic and political red tape that quickly launched him on the Italian business scene and propelled him into the ranks of the world's richest men. His first company, the Cantieri Riuniti Milanesi, was responsible for building a housing complex for 4,000 people at Brugherio, on the outskirts of Milan. From there, he expanded to the Milano 2 and Milano 3 housing developments for 10,000 and then 15,000 people, then turned his sights from construction to media. In mid-1979, Berlusconi entered the commercial television field with Telemilano, a local station in Milan. A few months later he took a quantum leap with Canale 5, the first private television station to broadcast to a national audience. A Constitutional Court decision in 1980 to allow private channels to transmit over national airwaves opened up new horizons for "Sua Emittenza" (Lord Broadcaster) who went on to buy up Italia 1 in 1983 and Rete 4 in 1984. A bid to enter the French television world in 1984 proved difficult and finally collapsed in 1989, but he had more success in Spain where he bought up a 25 percent stake in Antenna 3 in 1989. Berlusconi's 1984 purchase of SORRISI E CANZONI TV (TV Smiles and Songs) magazine, today Italy's largest circulation publication, marked his entry into the publishing world. In 1988, he took a 25 percent stake in Amef, the company which controlled the Mondadori publishing group. Things went far from smoothly there, when Berlusconi found himself locked in combat with Carlo de Benedetti, the Olivetti chief, who was forced to back down in 1990, when Berlusconi became chairman of Mondadori, keeping the influential PANORAMA news weekly but losing the L'ESPRESSO-LA REPUBBLICA group to De Benedetti. In a move this month, part of Berlusconi's promised paring-back of his industrial empire now that his main concern is politics, Fininvest announced that its shareholding in Mondadori be reduced to less than 50 percent in a complex capital operation. Legal hassles have dogged Berlusconi, who in the 1980's found himself dragged into the scandal over the clandestine Propaganda Due (P-2) Masonic lodge, of which he was a member. He denied ever having played an active role in the outlawed lodge, but found himself charged with perjury in connection with the inquiries. The late 1980's also saw him doing battle with the RAI state broadcasting company which sued him for unfair competition and unauthorised use of live broadcasting. The issue of who was permitted to broadcast live was cleared up with a new broadcasting law which many saw as tailored for the Milan magnate. According to his detractors, Berlusconi's close personal friendship with disgraced Socialist Party chief Bettino Craxi, who was premier when the new broadcasting law was being drawn up, smoothed the tycoon's path in this and other areas. Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, started its life as a think-tank to test the political waters and do the groundwork for his change of career. Forza Italia linked up with the federalist Northern League in the north of the country, and with the National Alliance, heir to the neofascist Italian Social Movement in the south, in two- and three-way Freedom Front coalitions that gained the majority in the March 27-28 general elections. (The Front won an absolute majority in the Lower House, but a relative one in the Senate.) With a roster of faces fresh to national politics (95 percent of candidates had never sat in the Rome parliament before), Forza Italia took 95 seats in the Lower House and 41 in the Senate, less than its Freedom Front partners, making it parliament's third biggest force. The biggest percentage of the popular ballot, however, went to Berlusconi's party. Forza Italia, and Berlusconi in particular, fought the election battle on a "red peril" stance, warning the nation of the possible dangers of control of the economy falling to the former Communists of the Left Democratic Party. But it was the novelty offered by Forza Italia and the popularity of Berlusconi himself which seemed to win the new line-up most votes in a country jaded by scandals in the political and economic worlds, scandals in which Berlusconi and his empire have so far managed to remain unscathed.
