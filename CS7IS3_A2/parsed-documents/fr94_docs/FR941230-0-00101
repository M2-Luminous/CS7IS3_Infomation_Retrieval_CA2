FR941230-0-00101 FR941230-0-00019 • Rule 102(e) of Regulation S&hyph;T. Rule 102(e) of Regulation S&hyph;T has been amended to clarify the requirement that, after a date three years after its phase-in date, a registered investment company or business development company may incorporate by reference only documents filed electronically. Specifically, the amendments clarify that the exemption in the rule for documents filed in paper pursuant to a hardship exemption would be applicable only if any required confirming copy has been submitted. The rules also now provide that an exhibit, filed in paper, to Form N&hyph;SAR 59 may be incorporated by reference into another Form N&hyph;SAR filing. 59 17 CFR 274.101. • Rule 302(b) of Regulation S&hyph;T. In order to avoid any filer misunderstanding of the current requirement to retain a manually signed signature page or other signature authentication document, the Commission is clarifying the rule to specifically require a manual signature with respect to each signatory to the electronic filing. • New Rule 302(c) of Regulation S&hyph;T. As proposed, Commission rules no longer will require manual signatures on the paper copies of electronic filings required to be furnished by filers to national securities exchanges and national securities associations. 60 60 For example, Exchange Act Rule 12b&hyph;11 [17 CFR 240.12b&hyph;11] requires that a manually signed copy of Exchange Act reports be filed with each exchange upon which the registrant's securities are registered. • New Rules 303(a)(3) and (4) of Regulation S&hyph;T. The following are added to the list of documents that may not be incorporated by reference, consistent with other rule provisions 61 and current staff interpretations: 61 See revised Rule 102(e) of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.102(e)]. For a registered investment company or a business development company making electronic submissions more than three years after its phase-in date, a document which has not been filed in electronic format, unless the document has been filed in paper pursuant to a hardship exemption and any required confirming copy has been submitted or the document is an exhibit, filed in paper, to Form N&hyph;SAR, and is being incorporated by reference into another Form N&hyph;SAR filing. For investment company filings, any Financial Data Schedule required under Securities Act Rule 483. 62 62 17 CFR 230.483. • Rule 304(a) of Regulation S&hyph;T. Under the amended rules, descriptions of omitted graphic and image material will be allowed to be placed either in the text of an electronic filing where the omission occurs or in an appendix thereto, at the option of the filer. Registrants no longer will be required to list all omitted material in an appendix to the filing. Descriptions should be provided in narrative or tabular format, as appropriate. • Rule 304(d) of Regulation S&hyph;T. Phased-in registrants subject to the requirement to furnish a stock performance comparison graph in their proxy statements pursuant to Item 402( l ) of Regulation S&hyph;K 63 will be required to satisfy that obligation in their electronic filing in the same manner as applicable to other types of omitted charts or graphs, that is, by describing the omitted performance graph by presenting the graph's data points in tabular form. 64 The requirement to furnish a paper copy of the performance graph to the Branch Chief in the Division of Corporation Finance responsible for the review of the registrant's filings is retained, in order to allow the staff to continue monitoring information as distributed to investors. 65 As proposed, the option to file the graph in paper under cover of Form SE 66 is eliminated to prevent the possibility of an incomplete electronic presentation to the reader without reference to the Form SE. 63 17 CFR 229.402 l. 64 See letter from Mauri L. Osheroff, Associate Director, Regulatory Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, dated November 16, 1993, for an example of how the performance graph may be presented in tabular form in the proxy statement. This letter is available through the EDGAR Bulletin Board. 65 The previous requirement was found in Rule 304(d)(2) of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.304(d)(2)]. It now is incorporated into paragraph (d) of that section. 66 Rule 304(d)(1) of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.304(d)(1)]. • New Rule 311(b) of Regulation S&hyph;T. The rule governing filing of exhibits in paper under cover of Form SE has been amended as proposed to provide that exhibits to a Commission schedule filed pursuant to Section 13 or 14(d) of the Exchange Act may be filed in paper under cover of Form SE where such exhibits previously were filed in paper (either before becoming subject to mandated electronic filing or pursuant to a hardship exemption) and are required to be refiled pursuant to the schedule's general instructions. In the past, such documents were required to be filed in electronic format along with the schedule to which they relate, absent a hardship exemption. 67 67 For example, where an issuer delivers its Form 10&hyph;K with its Schedule 13E&hyph;4 [17 CFR 240.13e&hyph;101] in connection with its issuer tender offer proposal, the Form 10&hyph;K must be filed as an exhibit to the schedule, notwithstanding the fact that it previously had been filed with the Commission. See Item 9 of Schedule 13E&hyph;4. Under prior rules, the Form 10&hyph;K was required to be filed electronically as an exhibit, even if it originally had been filed in paper. Under the rules adopted today, the exhibit will continue to be required, but it may be filed in paper under cover of Form SE if it originally had been filed in paper.
