The discussion will begin with the draft agreement on Ukraine's membership in the economic union as an associated member. The CIS leaders will also consider two cardinally important economic documents. The first one is the draft agreement on the inter-state economic committee -- a permanent executive and coordinating body accountable to the Council of the Heads of State and to the Council of the Heads of Government. The second one is the agreement on the creation of a free trade zone, providing for a gradual annulment of customs duties, taxes and non-tariff limitations. The free trade zone is viewed as a transition to a customs union which is to become the subject of a separate agreement. The CIS leaders are also expected to discuss a new version of the provision on the Council of the CIS Defense Ministers, given changes in military-cooperation bodies. IF Note: The councils of the CIS defense and foreign ministers are to discuss matters pertaining to the Collective Security Council, and adopt a declaration on this body dealing with financial, personnel-related and functional question. The Collective Security Council was created in 1993 by the CIS heads of state and includes the countries which have signed the collective security agreement: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Moldova, Turkmenistan and Ukraine did not sign the collective security agreement. A special accent will be put on the problems facing Tajikistan. The foreign and defense ministers are to propose additional measures to stabilize the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border. The Council of the CIS border-troop commanders is to present a report on Russia's talks with the Central Asian and Transcaucasian states on cooperation in the protection of the borders with third countries. The CIS leaders are to sign a memorandum on cooperation between Russia, Ukraine and Belarus in protecting these countries' borders. IF Note: the draft memorandum says that the protection of the borders with the countries which are not members of the CIS is these countries' common concern and is not aimed at any third countries. This measure is to help Russia, Ukraine and Belarus to regulate migration processes and combat terrorism, drug trafficking and other trans-border crimes. Commander of the Russian border troops General Andrey Nikolayev told Interfax that support given to the Russian initiative was a welcome fact. He also announced that Ukraine had initialled this document and expressed hope that other CIS countries would join it. He noted, however, that the memorandum was an outline document and did not contain any specific measures or figures. A comprehensive CIS agreement on border issues should be gradually drafted, he said, because on their own the CIS countries cannot cope with the problem of border protection.
