The party's national executive said in a statement issued in this southern city that it would take part in legislative elections due this year, and would work towards the election of a monarchist president by the people. The party however refused to pledge allegiance to Victor Emmanuel of Savoy, the direct descendent of Italy's last king, Umberto II, saying they only recognized the former's cousin Amedee, Duke of Aoste. The party's leaders described themselves as Savoy's loyalists. Italy became a republic on June 10, 1946 after a referendum. The vote ended the reign of the House of Savoy, whose kings had ruled over Piedmont for nine centuries and as kings of Italy from 1861.
