The move, to be taken from January 11 to 17, is designed to protest against a November 25 government decree which increased the printing costs by five times. The boycott was announced today at a press conference by editors- in-chief of these newspapers, including IZVESTIA, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER) [INDEPENDENT GAZETTE], TRUD and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, as well as weekly magazine MOSCOW NEWS. Outraged by the government decision, press leaders had written to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on December 29, complaining that neither the newspapers nor their subscribers could afford the price hike. Some editors-in-chief pointed out at the press conference that the government decision is essentially designed to suffocate the press. Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Russian Press Association, said that they are forced to take the step. He added, however, that a final decision will be made according to the response from the government.
