Rakevich, Republic Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology, Ministry of Health, Belarus; UDC 613.62-084] [Abstract] There is reason to doubt the accuracy of data on occupational diseases in Belarus because of the rather random and irregular screening programs. Available data have shown that years of exposure to a given factor may be required before frank pathology can be discerned, and then only if a system of regularl examinations are scheduled. The screening system in Belarus has to be improved to discern premorbid states well in advance of disease onset, which means implementing regular medical examinations. Once regular screenings have been implemented, the time of appearance of a premorbid condition may be regarded as a temporal exposure limit for a given risk factor. References 15 (Russian).
