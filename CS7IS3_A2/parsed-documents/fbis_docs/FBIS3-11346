Marcos told local media that some EZLN members were tortured after their capture on 6 March and said that if the situation continues, the rebels could take up arms again and repel any attack. "Everything indicates that a military offensive is being prepared regardless of the results of the consultations" held after the peace talks with the government and that "the Army has already begun to mobilize," Marcos said. The guerrilla leader added that the Armed Forces have been constantly harassing the EZLN by detaining Indians, patrolling the area, and collecting military information. Marcos said that all of these actions have forced the Zapatists to change their minds about peace and prepare for a probable counterattack. "We could go into action again. We cannot trust a government that talks of peace while taking warlike actions," he stated. Marcos said everything indicates that the government is seeking a military solution, not a political one. He explained that currently there is no peace agreement, only a government proposal that is being studied by the Indian communities. Marcos also said that the EZLN has received information about a probable military attack on the Zapatists before May to annihilate the guerrillas before the presidential campaign enters its most critical stage. "The government's wants to behead our movement by removing the leadership in a surgical operation," he reported. Marcos said 10 Zapatists have been detained since the Armed Forces began to patrol Indian communities. These persons are probably questioned to learn more about the guerrillas' strategies and positions. He said that the government's actions will only increase the EZLN's distrust of the government and, if the Army attempts to attack Zapatista positions, the guerrillas will respond in kind. The present truce in Chiapas, he said, is an "undeclared war" that will quickly break out again if the government decides to attack. The armed conflict in Chiapas began on 1 January when the EZLN took up arms against the government. The EZLN engaged the Mexican Army in bloody combat early in the conflict, resulting in at least 150 dead, 500 wounded, and some 20,000 refugees, according to unofficial figures.
