Principal state leaders have been much concerned with the province's armament industrial enterprises. General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Vice Premiers Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua, and some other leaders have called on the province to resolve the problems of some large armament industrial enterprises in Qiqihar as quickly as possible. Sun Weiben called on armament industrial enterprises to seize the favorable opportunity, carry forward the voluntary spirit, increase the dynamics of reform, and explore new ways to invigorate armament industrial enterprises.
