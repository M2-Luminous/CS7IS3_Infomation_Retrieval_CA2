The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant is an open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. On or about October 12, 1984, applicant, initially named Equitec Siebel Total Return Fund (``ESTRF''), filed a registration statement to register an indefinite number of its shares of common stock. The registration statement became effective on or about January 2, 1985, and ESTRF commenced operations and the initial public offering of its shares on January 29, 1985. 2. On September 30, 1985, ESTRF reorganized into a Massachusetts business trust and was renamed Equitec Siebel Fund Group (``ESFG''). Over time, ESFG commenced operations of several series: Equitec Siebel Total Return Fund; Equitec Siebel Government Fund; Equitec Siebel High Yield Bond Fund; Equitec Siebel Aggressive Growth Fund: Equitec Siebel Cash Equivalent Fund; Equitec Siebel Global Fund; and Equitec Siebel Precious Metals Fund (collectively, the ``Funds''). 3. On January 7, 1991, ESFG's adviser entered into an agreement to sell the Funds' advisory contracts to SunAmerica Asset Management Corp. (``SunAmerica''). On June 14, 1991, shareholders of the respective Funds approved new investment advisory and management agreements between ESFG and SunAmerica whereby SunAmerica became the adviser of the Funds. In connection with the approval, the Funds were renamed: the Total Return Fund was renamed SunAmerica Balanced Assets Fund; the Government Fund was renamed SunAmerica U.S. Government Securities Fund; the High Yield Bond Fund was renamed SunAmerica High Income Fund; the Aggressive Growth Fund was renamed SunAmerica Emerging Growth Fund; the Cash Equivalent Fund was renamed SunAmerica Liquid Assets Fund; the Global Fund was renamed SunAmerica Global Equity Fund; and the Precious Metals Fund was renamed SunAmerica Precious Metals Fund. 4. The Global Equity and Precious Metals Funds were liquidated by vote of their shareholders on March 30, 1992. The Liquid Assets Fund was liquidated by vote of its shareholders on June 25, 1992. 5. On March 31, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved on agreement and plan of reorganization for each of the applicant's remaining Funds. Under the agreements, the remaining Funds would merge into other investment companies that were advised by SunAmerica. In accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8 under the Act, the board of trustees of each of applicant and the acquiring companies determined that participation in the reorganization was in the best interest of the shareholders and that the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result of the reorganization. 1 On July 29, 1993, applicant filed proxy materials with the SEC and mailed these materials to shareholders on or about July 29, 1993. Applicant's shareholders approved the agreement and plan of reorganization at special meetings held on September 23, 1993. 1 Rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption from section 17(a) for certain reorganizations among registered investment companies that may be affiliated persons, or affiliated persons of an affiliated person, solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. 6. Pursuant to each agreement, on September 24, 1993, applicant transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities of (a) its Emerging Growth Fund to the SunAmerica Emerging Growth Fund series of SunAmerica Equity Funds in exchange for shares of the SunAmerica Emerging Growth Fund and (b) its Balanced Asset Fund to the SunAmerica Balanced Assets Fund series of SunAmerica Equity Funds in exchange for shares of the SunAmerica Balanced Assets Fund. Applicant then distributed pro rata the appropriate shares of SunAmerica Emerging Growth Fund and SunAmerica Balanced Assets Fund to it shareholders. On October 1, 1993, applicant transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities of (i) its U.S. Government Fund to the SunAmerica U.S. Government Securities Fund series of SunAmerica Income Funds in exchange for shares of the SunAmerica U.S. Government Securities Fund, and (ii) its High Income Fund to the SunAmerica High Income Fund series of SunAmerica Income Funds in exchange for shares of the SunAmerica High Income Fund. Applicant then distributed pro rata the appropriate shares of SunAmerica U.S. Government Securities Fund and SunAmerica High Income Fund to its shareholders. In each case, the aggregate net asset value of an acquiring fund's shares represented the net asset value of the respective applicant Fund. 7. The expenses of the reorganization were borne by the investment companies participating in the reorganization of the SunAmerica Family of Mutal Funds, including applicant and each of the acquiring companies. Such expenses included preparation of proxy materials, printing expenses, and legal and accounting fees. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the reorganization. 8. As of the date of this application, applicant had no assets, liabilities or shareholders. All liabilities and obligations not discharged by applicant were assumed by and became the obligations of the acquiring funds. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. 9. Applicant is neither engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
