The program presented by the prime minister to parliament, in accordance with Article 78 of the 14 October Constitution, is in line with a spirit of openness and reaches out a hand of reconciliation to entire Togolese political class without exclusion, as Mr. Edem Kodjo put it. This program is based on a specific diagnosis of the social, economic, and political situation of our country. So, Mr. Edem Kodjo's proposals cover all aspects of our national life, notably, national unity, construction of a law- abiding state, economic and financial redress, security, socio- cultural development, and our country's foreign policy. Speaking on unity and national reconciliation, the prime minister stressed the need for a sustained fight against tribalism and ethnocentrism and said the aim is to renew confidence in the various components of the nation by ensuring that Togolese men and women realize they are brothers and sisters. [Kodjo] Democracy and law-abiding state cannot be achieved in Togo without this necessary effort for reconciliation, without reaching out a brotherly hand to everyone. Reconciliation will not be possible either without our making an effort to forgive and forget, without individual and collective effort to make amends, without a firm renouncement of unworthy acts committed by some countrymen who only see the sons of the same country as enemies to be vanquished and as opponents who must be eliminated. In short, reconciliation cannot be achieved without a great general pardon, which is the best form of a true amnesty. In order to make this reconciliation possible, government will strive, through the adoption of various legal and statutory measures, to help Togolese to surmount their past and rise above their recriminations in order to try and recreate harmony and again find the sense of common destiny. Preference must be given to dialogue on a permanent basis. Dialogue must be organized in order to stamp out rancor and strengthen brotherhood and solidarity. This concern for constant dialogue will be one of government's objectives. From the economic standpoint, the prime minister first stressed the current economic situation of Togo which is presently facing a crisis aggravated in 1990 and worsened by the devaluation of the CFA franc. He then went on to propose government action in this area. [Kodjo] Nothing is more urgent today than the need to adopt rigorous measures aimed at rescuing Togo from the serious financial and economic crisis facing it and whose effects have particularly been aggravated in some areas following the devaluation of the CFA franc. We must bear in mind that democracy and misery do not cohabit. The people's aspiration for democracy is an aspiration for a better life in a more open and free society where everyone will be able to find greater fulfillment and be more creative. Democracy is likely to be a bitter disillusionment for our people who have suffered a lot. Right now we do not strive to ensure a rigorous reorganization of the situation and a good economic and financial posture of our country. The general economic situation, which was already difficult in 1990 prior to the holding of the sovereign national conference, seriously deteriorated later throughout the entire transitional period. The gross domestic product fell from 445 billion CFA francs in 1990 to 354 billion in 1993, or a fall of nearly 100 billion CFA francs over the three past years with an external debt of 654 CFA francs. When the devaluation set in, prices increased by 30 to over 150 percent according to the products. The Togolese banking system is badly overstretched. The economic slump resulting from the sociopolitical upheavals led to heavy indebtedness of the bank thus making they less capable of supporting the economy. These are some of the factors that contribute to the bankruptcy of enterprises, retrenchment of staff, increase in unemployment figures, and the development of delinquency and misery. Government action aims at achieving the following objectives: obtain a gross domestic product growth rate of which is higher that the population growth rate; maintain a low inflation rate; reduce trade balance deficit, cut down on deficits resulting from government's consolidated financial transactions. These goals can only be achieved through the adoption of the bitter but unavoidable pill of structural adjustment programs with the support of international financial institutions and assistance from friendly countries. However, foreign assistance cannot only serve to complement internal efforts that all Togolese without exception will be called upon to make in a general and sustained solidarity move. Mr. Edem Kodjo's action program is a comprehensive one because it touches on all aspects of national life. But then no program can reconstruct the country without security, the prime minister further stated. [Kodjo] We cannot build the future Togo in the absence of peace and renewed security. Our country, Togo, is currently experiencing a new type of crime. Heinous crimes have come to bolster political crimes. Government will not spare any efforts to restore security. It will take all the necessary measures to discourage mounting insecurity in our country. A law-abiding country will be empty words in the absence of an effective public security personnel capable of controlling and containing threats to public order and to reacting to violations of citizens' rights and freedoms. Government's proposed action to stamp out insecurity will both be preventive and reactive. It will be necessary, among other things, to improve the training of top executives of the police corps and the Gendarmerie, and insist on the respect of the hierarchy; create new structures for coordination and monitoring of activities of security forces and reinject confidence in the forces; strengthen the police force and the Gendarmerie staff and equip them with modern communication means; strengthen the criminal punishments currently provided for by law to punish murders; strengthen antidrug programs; set up a mechanism to fight against the illegal possession of arms and work out a plan to dismantle arms caches in close collaboration with the Army. In fact, the Army must be one of the main pillars of the new society. It must be in harmony with the nation in the respect of the provisions of the new Constitution. In this regard, the government, with the assistance of Army headquarters, intends to organize detailed and thorough workshops on the defense policy and on the role of the Republican Army in national life. The specific and beneficial role of the Army will be enhanced since Republican values will be shared and respected by all.
