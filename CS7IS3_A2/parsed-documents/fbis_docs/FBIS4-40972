He added that the "Russia-NATO" protocol reflects the status of Russia as a superpower. Kozyrev categorically denied allegations that Russia claimed a "special status" in the partnership programme. "We are as equal a member of the UN as, say, the State of Fiji. All countries have an equal legal status in the framework of the (NATO) partnership, whether it is a mighty nuclear power, like the USA, or Belgium with its two or three divisions", he said.
