FBIS4-47189 "jpusr069___94004" FBIS-USR-94-069 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 31 May 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC & SOCIAL AFFAIRS Impact of Yeltsin Edicts on Economic Reform Examined Impact of Yeltsin Edicts on Economic Reform Examined 944E0966A Moscow KOMMERSANT in Russian No 19, 31 May 94 pp 3-5 944E0966A Moscow KOMMERSANT Russian CSO [Article by Nikita Kirichenko, Anastasiya Matveyeva, Aleksandr Privalov and Andrey Shmarov: "These Edicts Have a Place in the Package"] [Text] At the very beginning of last week, on Monday, Boris Yeltsin frankly and impartially qualified the state of the Russian economy as catastrophic. This declaration would have seemed quite penetrating -- now you cannot affect anyone with stronger expressions --if the president had not added that, as a counterbalance to the economic catastrophe, he had signed a package of six edicts on economic matters. At first, it spread quickly that the edicts abolished all restrictions on foreign trade. At the same time, rumors spread just as quickly that the edicts imposed restrictions on an increase in the enterprises' consumption fund and the issuing of cash. Due to these rumors, the dollar's cash exchange rate rose at once by 20 points. As far as the complete liberalization of VED [foreign economic activities] goes, this was not confirmed. As for the cash -- this was confirmed. The Abolition of Export Quotas and Licenses The president's Edict on the Abolition of Quota-Setting and Licensing for Deliveries of Good and Services for Export was signed exactly a week after the Minyust [Ministry of Justice] had registered the MVES' [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] order approving the instructions on the procedure for that same quota-setting and licensing. The KOMMERSANT correspondents interested in this incident were unable to uncover the persons responsible for promulgating the edict (except for the president himself, of course). The head of the president's group of experts, Aleksandr Livshits, stated that his subdivision did not participate directly in the edict's drafting. The government staff informed us that they had read the edict for the first time in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations' reaction was reflected in the perplexed statement of the chief of the Export-Import Operations for State Needs Main Administration, Andrey Dogayev: "I would like to hope that all the consequences of this document's adoption have been thoroughly studied and accepted after consultations with the sectorial ministries and the regional administrations. It would be undesirable to have a repetition of the situation which arose with the adoption of the new import customs tariff." In the Minekonomiki [Ministry of Economics], the specialist sought could not be found, but, after talking things over, KOMMERSANT's experts came to the conclusion that Mr. Shokhin's department does not issue such crude documents. And, in fact, the edict does not wear the crown of a bureaucratic creation. It consists of only two points, but they contain so many obscurities and contradictions that the drafting of the package of its supplementing documents will require serious and skilled work. The questions begin right with the edict's first point. It says that quota-setting and licensing shall be maintained for goods and services "to be exported in accordance with the Russian Federation's [RF] international obligations." In the opinion of the deputy chief of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations' Export-Import Operations for State Needs Main Administration, Mikhail Gaykazov, this makes it possible to interpret it as an indication of the fact that the talk is about goods to be shipped to other countries in accordance with intergovernmental agreements. But it is most likely that this is not so. As it seems to the experts, the non-tariff regulation of export shipments, according to the logic of Russia's relations with the YeS [European Union -- EU] and the MVF [International Monetary Fund -- IMF], was supposed to be maintained only with respect to those goods which have quotas set by agreements only with these organizations. Further, in the first point, astonishment is being evoked among knowledgeable people by the fact that the quota-setting and licensing have merged here, as it were, into a single whole, which, however, is also not surprising for the average citizen stupefied from the mass of new economic terms. At the same time, these are "two big differences." And the one thing may well exist separately from the other. Quota-setting is an attempt to reserve for the treasury the guaranteed receipt of money through the sale of export quotas. Under current market conditions, this source has begun to dry up. This is why an attempt is being made to plug the holes in the budget, by abolishing certain export preferences. However, export licensing is a means of ensuring the state's strategic interests. It is used as a lever for state regulation of foreign economic activities throughout the entire country, even with the most liberal approach to the economy. So that, to abolish licensing and to say that this is very liberal, is somewhat strange. KOMMERSANT's experts decline to make long commentaries with respect to the edict's second point because of its complete internal contradictoriness. They suggest that the government "abolish preferences for the exporting of goods and services for federal state needs (except for goods to be exported to the countries of the near abroad in accordance with intergovernmental agreements), with the exception of preferences granted in accordance with the RF Law on the Customs Tariff...." But this law contains one small point, according to which it is precisely these preferences which the government is granting. Finally, it is symptomatic that the edict passes over in silence the special exporters -- and thereby preserves their right to exist. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations explains the necessity of maintaining the institution of special exporters by the fact that, with their help, it is easier to maintain prices at the highest possible level, not letting them drop to the level of dumping prices, and also to exercise control over the repatriation of currency earnings. The next logical step on this path is a further reduction in the number of special exporters: after all, it is easier to control one than several. Taxes and Cash The subject of taxes is, in any event, no less confused than the preceding one. Part of this subject can be interpreted two ways, part looks too declarative and part is simply incomprehensible. However, there are also rational kernels. The first thing which is incomprehensible is the most important: by how much, actually, is it being proposed that taxes be reduced? If the text of the Edict on Certain Matters of the Tax Policy is interpreted literally, then it follows from it that it is being proposed that the rates for the NDS [Value-Added Tax -- VAT] and the profits tax be lowered by 10-20 percent. Ten percent of the current VAT rate (including the special tax) is 2.3 percentage points and it is 3.8 points for the maximum rate for the profits tax. Thus, the president's proposal can be reduced to bringing the corresponding rates down to 20.7 percent (the VAT) and 34.2 percent (the profits tax). This is undoubtedly pleasing, however, strictly speaking of course, this is ridiculously small: all the same, the granted break assumes rates higher than last year's. Also vague is the budget at the expense of which the profits tax will be reduced -- the federal or the municipal. And such confusion may cause very serious squabbles among the fiscal organs. Moreover, upon closer examination, even this benefit may be eaten away -- through an increase in the norms for other taxes. Indeed, it is recommended in the edict that the taxation of the citizens' personal incomes be increased, along with the taxes on the property of the public and legal persons. But the president could also have made a slip, having in mind a lowering of the rates not by percentages, but rather, by percentage points (a quite common slip of the tongue). And so then the edict's implementation may exert a fairly serious normalizing influence on the investment climate. In fact, let us take our reference investment plan (for details, see the investment review in KOMMERSANT No 17) and assume that the VAT is set at the level of 13 percent (minus 10 percentage points), while the profits tax is set at the level of 18 percent (minus 20 points). In this instance, the investment conditions change quite radically. Let us recall the plan's basic features. The total amount of investments is 500 million rubles [R], the time from the investment of the money to the production of the first output is 6 months, the number of workers is 201 persons (for the evaluation of the reference plan, interference in the form of preferences for small enterprises was not "applied"), the average wages are R300,000 per month, and the current return on capital is 40 percent (which corresponds approximately to the industry average). Calculations indicate that, under the existing tax conditions, the pay-back period for this plan comes to 17 months, the internal profit norm (the indicator which characterizes the maximum value of the resources which can be used for the plan's realization) is 739 percent and the investments' profitability (over the life of the plan) is 92 percent. If the taxes are lowered by 3-4 percent (the literal interpretation of the president's edict), then the pay-back period decreases to 14 months, the internal profit norm increases to 769 percent and the investments' profitability increases to 120 percent. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

It may be noted that, while the reduction of the profits tax affects mainly such indicators of efficiency as the investments' profitability and the internal profit norm (see Chart 1), the decrease in the VAT is reflected first of all in the lowering of the current demand for working capital (see Chart 2). Chart 1. The Investments' Profitability in Relation <annot> Key: -- 1. Left-Hand Column: the Investments' Profitability as a Percentage -- 2. Bottom Row: Profits Tax Rate as a Percentage</graphic> The effect, as we see, is considerable. However, it is unfortunate that, even if the president had percentage points in mind, then, in this instance as well, even a good undertaking may fall through. The Duma may block it -- for quite understandable fiscal reasons. <graphic> Chart 2. Increase in the Demand for Working Capital <annot> Key: -- 1. Left-Hand Column: Millions of Rubles --2. Bottom Row: Number of Months --3. Lines Represent the VAT at Various Rates</graphic> It is true that, in this instance, the administration has some kind of counterplay. A hint of this is contained in the tax edict: the talk is about accelerated depreciation, the mechanism of which the government is instructed to develop over the course of 2 months. Accelerated depreciation is good, first, because it makes it possible to reduce profit and, correspondingly, the tax payments, thereby improving the investment situation (see Table 1) and, second, because its use does not require legislative formalization. It is true that what is being talked about in the edict is accelerated depreciation in the high-technology sectors, but who will interfere in the event that this mechanism is applied to other industries? We would note, however, that our scenario for the "good" (in the sense of investment stimulation) version of the edict, as it were, leaves outside the framework the budget result of the easing of the tax climate. And this is hardly proper. It is possible, of course, to argues idealistically about the unrestrained growth of business activity and the increase in the tax base, which would follow this easing, which would make it possible to cover the tax arrears. But, to be honest, even if this occurs, it will not be right away by any means. This is why the budget effect, both for the Duma and for the president's economic experts, is far from being the last thing. And it must be noted that the drafters of the package of edicts understand this. They also understand the fact that simply introducing new taxes and raising the rates will not solve the old problems. Thus, it is necessary to do a better job of collecting the already existing taxes. This circumstance has been taken into consideration in other edicts from the package -- the Edict on Additional Measures for Normalization of Settlements and Strengthening Payment Discipline in the National Economy and the Edict on the Implementation of Integrated Measures for the Timely and Complete Submission to the Budget of Taxes and Other Obligatory Payments. These documents contain quite a few repeats of already existing norms or variations on their theme (for example, regarding the ban on the opening of several current accounts), which have been invoked, apparently, to demonstrate the seriousness of the authorities' intentions. But there are also new restrictions. The talk, first of all, is about the tax organs' right to withdraw funds without authorization from enterprises' currency accounts using the procedure for paying off arrears in obligatory payments (in essence, this point legitimizes already available TsB [Central Bank] and Minfin [Ministry of Finance] instructions on this matter), as well as about introducing a procedure for prioritization in the use of funds from a current account. At the same time, if, in the first instance, the interests of primarily exporters are affected, especially of those not burning with a yearning to run and to pay taxes, then the second circumstance is nothing new and it affects absolutely all managing entities and does so very seriously. And, really, about what does the Edict on Additional Measures for Normalization of Settlements... talk? It directs that all legal persons may obtain cash in a bank "... in an amount not exceeding 5 percent of the average daily receipts of funds into their current accounts for the preceding quarter, including for the payment of wages... -- in the amount of 5 times the minimum monthly wage, proceeding on the basis of the overall average listed number of workers." So, if you please: they thereby twisted the "dough" if not into a ram's horn, then very tightly. Indeed, as it turned out -- previously, the servicing bank issued exactly as much cash as was requested and it was the client's business to handle this cash in such a way that the controlling organs did not catch on and did not qualify it as personal income payments. There were lots of ways to do this -- from the old "for purchasing agricultural products" to payments to their own associates for leasing their motor vehicles and purchasing vouchers at a high price and selling them at a low price. Now, however, the enterprises' money circulation plans have been frozen. Of course, it is possible to obtain cash due, but only by transferring money to personal accounts. But this means that it is necessary to give instructions to the bank with an explanation of the purposes and, naturally, to whom the money is being transferred, i.e., strictly speaking, to illuminate for the tax inspectorate not only one's own bookkeeping, but also the bank's. Of course, there also remain such old tried and true methods as the use for money laundering of partners who have a business involving "dough" such as, for example, retail sales. However, this channel will work only as long as their use of cash registers remains uncontrolled. If they are forced to use the cash registers all the same, then then stream of "dough" will momentarily dry up. In the latter event, reliable money laundering will be possible, very likely, only through offshore companies. A Public House -- Sad Words The Edict on the Reform of State Enterprises, which is also part of the package under examination by us, has been called into being by lamentable circumstances. Apparently, it signifies by itself the overdue start of the government's long-promised campaign for the restoration of the manageability of state property. It must be acknowledged that the grounds for the start of such a campaign are more than adequate. Over the last few years, the press has been overflowing with proof of the fact that the management of the vast majority of state enterprises uses them as its own private domains, without hardly a glance at their nominal owner, the state. The current managers of the state enterprises are enjoying all the rights of an owner, without being burdened by an owner's responsibility -- and, on the other hand, also not burdened by any other external responsibility. The edict, about which we have been talking, will begin to restrict these managerial freebooters. Let us present its contents in brief. As of the moment of the edict's promulgation, it stops the establishment of new federal enterprises with the allocation to them of property based on the right of complete economic authority. Some of the currently existing federal enterprises will be eliminated -- and public plants, factories or industries will be established on their basis. It is clear from the edict's text that this action should be considered a punishment: considered as grounds for making such a decision will be the lack of profit based on the results of the last 2 years, the indiscriminate use of allocated federal credits or the "improper" use of real property -- in other words, the inept or illegal management of an enterprise. Just what does the punishment consist of? How will a "public" enterprise differ from a state enterprise? Property will be allocated to it not based on the right of complete economic authority, but rather, on the right of operational management, i.e., it will be able to implement the alienation, leasing or pledging of this property only by the consent of the government or an organ empowered by it. A reader of the edict will have a doubt: does a current state enterprise really have the right, for example, to lease its capacities without the approval of the GKI [State Committee for State Property Management]? Indeed, it does not. Thus, does the edict not declare that it is the duty of the "public" enterprises simply to observe the obligatory laws a bit more strictly than everyone observes them? Let us read on -- the suspicion gets stronger. Specified in the charter of a public enterprise is the personal responsibility of the manager for the results of economic activities --but really, is there nothing at all mentioned in the current contracts with the managers of state enterprises about responsibility for results? A public enterprise will be obligated to use federal credits for a specific purpose -- but is a current state enterprise also really not so obligated in the least? The only, perhaps, substantial harsh item in the edict is this: the procedure for distributing profits will be fixed in the public enterprise's charter. Although, if you think about it, even here there is nothing to be especially feared: first, what difference does it make how profits are distributed, if there have not been any for 2 years all the same; second, it depends on which procedure will be fixed.... The newspapers have already managed to inform us that many state enterprise managers are inclined to view the change into a number of public plants not as a punishment, but rather, as a long-desired goal. Our cursory perusal of the edict, it would seem, confirmed these managers' opinion: there is seemingly nothing terrible in the title "public" and you do come under the wing of the budget all the same. But this is only at first glance. But read more attentively -- you will see that the public plants have not been promised any kind of special protection. Judge for yourself. That a public plant is obligated to use federal funds for a specific purpose is stated in black and white, but that these funds will be allocated in any adequate amount is not stated even between the lines. That a public plant is not allowed to obtain credits without government guarantees is stated, but that the government intends to grant such guarantees is never mentioned. But if a public plant does not use any part of the property entrusted to it for operational management or uses it other than as intended, then the government will take the afore-mentioned property away from it. Chart 3. Structure of the Consolidated Budget's Revenues in the First Quarter of 1994 So, for an enterprise, the treasury's guardianship will turn out most likely to be more of a hindrance than a substantial help. And, for far-sighted managers, now is the time to take advantage of the loophole left in the edict: according to the last paragraph of point 4, a decision about converting to public enterprises "may not be made with respect to a federal state enterprise which has not been prohibited from privatizing by the State Privatization Program... and which has submitted using the established procedure, prior to 1 July 1994, an application for privatization." Hurry, gentlemen, submit the applications! The train is departing! Chart 4. Receipt of Revenues into the Federal and <annot> Key: -- 1. Left Side: Federal Budget -- 2. Right Side: Local Budget -- 3. Profits Tax -- 4. VAT -- 5. Income Tax from Natural Persons -- 6. Excise Taxes -- 7. Revenues from Foreign Economic Activities</graphic> On the other hand, it is possible that we are hasty with our conclusions. It is necessary to wait a month or two -- and it will become clear to everyone whether the changing of enterprises from state ones to public ones is a reward or a punishment. Prior to 1 July 1994, the government will approve a Model Charter for a public plant (factory or industry) and, prior to 1 August, it will determine the "procedure for the planning (finally! -- KOMMERSANT) and financing of public plants (factories or industries), including for the maintenance of social-sphere facilities allocated to them, for the setting of prices for the goods (work or services) produced by them and for their budget financing, as well as the wages for their workers." So let us read these documents and all doubts will disappear and everyone will find out at the same time just what the "planning of plants" means. KOMMERSANT's experts, however, are ready to state their own assumptions even now. It seems to us that the only real assistance to the public plants on the part of the treasury will be just the maintenance of the plants' allocated social, cultural and communal facilities: after all, if the plants, especially those which form cities, go bankrupt (you will remember -- 2 years without profits), then the budget will have no choice -- it will maintain the orphaned social, cultural and communal facilities by whatever means are necessary. As for all the rest, there will be plenty of planning and more than enough price-setting, but there will be no financing to speak of. To console the reader, however, let us make one more assumption: if this edict works at all, it will do so very, very slowly. Why? Because this happy moment is absolutely supposed to be preceded by the approval of the list of enterprises subject to change into public ones. And our government has a very hard time producing this genre -- the lists. We would remind you that the lists of VPK [Military-Industrial Complex] enterprises prohibited from being privatized (and those lists were, to a certain extent, similar to this one) took 9 months to prepare, instead of the 3 months prescribed by the presidential edict. But the lists of future bankruptcies are being prepared continuously -- there is no end in sight. Consequently, we will have to wait and wait for the list of potential public plants --indeed, even the deadline for their drafting has not been set by the edict. The Adventures of the Highway Fund Undoubtedly, Edict No 1008, On the RF Federal Highway Fund, occupies a special place in the package of presidential edicts by virtue of its reformatory incandescence and the sharpness of its statements. Without lapsing into needless pathos, it must be said that, since the beginning of 1992, the uneasy fate of the RF Federal Highway Fund has been linked partly to the fate of the RF itself and its reformatory thinking. Following its great Motherland, the Federal Highway Fund has endured the periods of birth, legislative formalization, amendments to the latter, consolidation and, finally, a separate article. Let us explain what we are talking about. At the beginning of 1992, when the main task for Gaydar's government was to show to the arbiters from the IMF a state budget with an acceptable deficit, the highway fund, along with its entire deficit, was isolated as a separate industry. The old taxes from motor vehicle owners (50 kopecks per unit of an engine's horsepower) simply could not cover the budget expenditures for road maintenance and repair. When the fund became independent, they began to see to its revenue portion. For example, a fee was imposed on legal persons when a motor vehicle was purchased. Thus, the fund even began to prosper, while Boris Fedorov did not note this at the end of 1993. The funds assets were immediately "consolidated" into the budget. However, inasmuch as the last thing Boris Fedorov wanted was to spend the money for road maintenance and repair, the special-purpose fund stopped being a special-purpose one. However, just a very little bit of time passed and everything became fine again: the new stage of reform "from above" determined that the fund's place is in the budget, but as a "separate article." Thus, KOMMERSANT's experts have carefully read in succession all six edicts of the presidential package. It is precisely the recognition of these diverse documents as a package which makes it possible to assess the entire extent of the disparity between the authorities' reformatory potential and the catastrophic state of the economy declared by the president himself. To reach the one reasonable, even if vaguely worded, idea on the restriction of illegal "dough," it is necessary in this package to wade through a pile of bureaucratic twaddle which is burdened by a claim to profundity. The continuation of the series of presidential edicts has been promised. Perhaps they will compel us to change our opinion about the entire "new wave of reforms" -- but certainly not about the first six drops.
