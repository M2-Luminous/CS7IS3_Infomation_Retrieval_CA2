The request was granted and the comment period was extended from May 30, 1994, to June 10, 1994. Copies of all comments and responses are documented in the FPEIS. The FPEIS was filed with the EPA on August 11, 1994, and published on August 19, 1994, in the Federal Register at 59 FR 42831. One private individual/organization commented on the FPEIS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Statutory Authority This Notice is being issued to interested parties in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Public Law 91&hyph;190, and Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA, 40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508. Background JTF&hyph;6 was activated on November 13, 1989, at Fort Bliss, Texas, by the Secretary of Defense in accordance with the President's National Drug Control Strategy. The thrust of this program is the use of Department of Defense training resources in the support of agencies responsible for the fight against illegal drugs. The mission of JTF&hyph;6 is to plan and coordinate military training along the U.S. Southwest Land Border in support of counterdrug activities by Federal, State, and Local LEAs, as requested through Operation Alliance and approved by the Secretary of Defense or a designated representative. The JFT&hyph;6 program provides operational, engineering, and general support to LEAs operating within the Southwestern United States which have drug interdiction authorities and allows the LEAs to conduct their missions more efficiently and effectively. The actions performed by JTF&hyph;6 personnel are quite diverse, ranging from reconnaissance operations to the building and renovation of roads and radio towers. The JTF&hyph;6's primary area of concern is within a 50-mile-wide corridor along the U.S./Mexico border from Port Arthur, Texas, to San Diego, California. The INS is responsible for the prevention of smuggling and unlawful entry of aliens into the United States. This is the task of the Border Patrol, which is also responsible for drug interdiction between the U.S. land Ports-of-Entry. Since the Border Patrol has been the primary beneficiary of most JTF&hyph;6 engineering actions to date, INS elected to act as lead agency for the preparation of this FPEIS. The EPA and JTF&hyph;6 elected to act as cooperating agencies. A Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare a PEIS was published on July 15, 1993, in the Federal Register at 58 FR 38140. Purpose The purpose of the FPEIS is to address cumulative environmental impacts of previous actions as well as those actions which may be developed within the reasonably foreseeable future. The FPEIS analyzes these cumulative impacts and generically examines the impacts of future individual actions based on experience with similar past actions. The FPEIS also describes the different types of actions performed by JTF&hyph;6. Dated: September 23, 1994. Doris Meissner, Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service.
