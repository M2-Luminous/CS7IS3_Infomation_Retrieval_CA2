Here is a report by Mahmut Lakicevic: [Begin Lakicevic recording] The Serbian Civic Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina represents that force and initiative of the Serbian people that categorically opposes the criminal and aggressive policy of the Serbian Democratic Party and Karadzic's Army and strives for the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as indivisible, sovereign, and recognized within its natural-historical borders, as well as returning of the Serbian people to its constitutive role together with the other two ethnic groups in Bosnia-Herzegovina by strictly implementing international political solutions -- of course, those that do not recognize the aggressor's occupation and his (?methods) of solving the Bosnian crisis. This was the gist of the statements Mirko Pejanovic and Miro Lazovic, members of the Serbian Civic Council, made at the news conference in Ljubljana after their official visit to Moscow. The (?continuation) of the peace process and the implementation of the Washington agreement provide an opportunity for that segment of the Serbian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina who do not recognize Radovan Karadzic's (?aggressor's) regime and the idea of a greater Serbia to join in the creation of the joint state of the three peoples in which human, civil, and national rights will be respected. The aggressors' intention to create a greater Serbia through coercion has undoubtedly caused the greatest harm and destroyed many innocent lives above all among the Bosniak-Muslim people, but Karadzic's war expeditions have also morally and spiritually humiliated the Serb people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and set them back 100 years in history. The Serbian Civic Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina is trying to present the real truth about the suffering of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which differs from the aggressor's propaganda and is rather successful in doing so. As Mirko Pejanovic, member of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, put it, the top Russian state leadership and church dignitaries with whom the delegation met in Moscow recently, were astounded by the fact that during the (?two-year) war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, aggressor's guns destroyed about 700 mosques, desecrated hundreds of Muslim and Croat tombs, and also ruined orthodox churches. They could learn this only from the Serbs who realistically saw into and [word indistinct] the entire outcome of the Serbian attack on Bosnia and who want to regain lost confidence and join the peaceful process of creating a united Bosnia-Herzegovina. Lazovic pointed out that the Serbian Civic Council is more and more recognized as a partner in negotiations, and has already received invitations from many international organizations and European countries to talks about including into the Washington agreement those Serbs who consider Bosnia-Herzegovina to be their homeland. This interest exists in the guise of Bosnian Serbs in exile who are disappointed by Milosevic's policy and consider themselves to be second-class citizens, Pejanovic says, and they should be helped to return to their homeland. The Washington agreement and the creation of the Bosniak-Croat Federation is the best opportunity for integrating the third people deceived by the illusion and sick dream of a greater Serbia whose builders and realizers should be brought before justice and the war crimes tribunal. Bosnia-Herzegovina must retain its multinational and multicultural identity, as this is a condition of its historical and national survival which is based solely upon peace, respect for national rights, and the equality of its peoples, Mirko Pejanovic concluded at today's news conference. Members of the Serbian Civic Council were today received by Milan Kucan, president of the Republic of Slovenia. The talks held touched upon the role of the Bosnian Serbs in the Washington agreement and international cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia, as Miro Lazovic and Mirko Pejanovic are visiting that country in the role of state officials. The current issue of opening the embassy of the Republic of Slovenia in Sarajevo was touched upon in particular, as there is a large number of Slovenes who are still living on the territory controlled by the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and who want to take part in the economic and cultural renewal of their second homeland.
