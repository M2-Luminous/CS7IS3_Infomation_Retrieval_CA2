FBIS4-7233 "dreas082_j_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 Indonesia Indonesian Version of Summit Meeting With SRV Indonesian Version of Summit Meeting With SRV Dailies' Comments on Summit BK2704140494 Jakarta Radio Republik Indonesia Network in Indonesian 0600 GMT 27 Apr 94 BK2704140494 Jakarta Radio Republik Indonesia Network Indonesian BFN [From the press review] [Text] Commenting on the current visit to Indonesia by Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh, KOMPAS says Indonesia has never doubted where the cordial bilateral relations would lead to, because in the past few years, the trade volume has continued to climb steadily. Indonesia's exports to Vietnam in 1993 stood at U.S. $165 million while its imports were at U.S. $32.45 million. However, KOMPAS also notes that if the Vietnamese leader's visit is aimed at holding talks on the refugee and continental shelf issues, we can understand the urgent nature of these issues because the Indonesian Government plans to develop Galang island [refugee detention center], located in the south of Singapore, into an industrial zone in parallel with the Batam island industrial zone. Meanwhile, PELITA believes that the Vietnamese president's visit to Indonesia reflects the increasingly close bilateral relations. The visit also reflects the imminent entry of Vietnam into the ASEAN regional grouping. Since Vietnam withdrew its troops from Cambodia, resulting in the termination of conflicts in that country, Hanoi's stand has been viewed favorably by ASEAN, whose policy is to create security, peace, and stability in Southeast Asia. Since that time, Vietnam has consistently reiterated its desire to join ASEAN and now it is only a matter of time for that country to do so. BERITA YUDHA says no ASEAN countries have any political objection to Vietnam's desire to join the regional grouping. At present, Vietnam, even Laos, has been involved in several ASEAN activities. The only problem is Vietnam's economic system, which is different from that of ASEAN countries. Therefore, Vietnam must also make some adjustments.
