Strangely, within the space of just a few words, Mr Vickery managed to make two basic errors of fact with reference to myself. First, it is completely mistaken to believe that I lead, or indeed am part of, any "faction" within the FUNCINPEC party. Second, to suggest that I -- together with a "faction" within FUNCINPEC -- am anything but completely devoted to the monarchy and, in particular, to the person of His Majesty the King is not only deeply insulting but also indicates a profound ignorance of my views and of Cambodian politics. [Signed] Sam Rangsi Ministry of State Minister of Economics and Finance Cambodia
