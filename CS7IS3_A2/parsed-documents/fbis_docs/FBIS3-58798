Many European Union [EU] member countries supported the accession of Cyprus and Malta to the EU. Nikolaos Belos, Greek Radio special correspondent at the European Parliament headquarters, has the following report: [Begin Belos recording] All the political groups in the European Parliament are in favor of the membership of Cyprus and Malta in the EU. This conclusion has been drawn from today's deliberations at the European Parliament plenary session, which were held after EU Council President Theodhoros Pangalos and Commission member Hans van den Broek presented reports on relations between the EU and these two countries. At the same time, it has been learned that the name of the EU observer at the intercommunal negotiations on the Cyprus issue within the UN framework will be announced in the next few days. As Mr. Pangalos noted, the observer will brief the EU on whether negotiations within the UN framework are in accordance with EU norms [kektimeno] and EU-Cypriot relations. Analyzing the presidency's intentions concerning the application of Cyprus for membership, Mr. Pangalos stressed that he has scheduled a meeting on the EU's association with Cyprus for May and added that the Greek presidency, responding to the decisions made at the Lisbon summit, will also hold a political dialogue with the Cyprus Government at all levels. Mr. Hans van den Broek pointed out that talks between EU officials and Cypriot authorities on preparations for membership are developing at a very satisfactory pace. In conclusion, Mr. Hans van den Broek described 1994 as an important year for the membership requests from Cyprus and Malta and stressed that the final decisions will be made in January 1995 on the basis of the progress made by that date. It is worth noting that all the political group representatives without exception, Greeks and others, who took the floor supported Cyprus' membership in the EU. Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos gave an international news conference late this afternoon and responded to questions from correspondents on the Greek presidency's program. On EU expansion, Mr. Pangalos, who will visit the three Scandinavian candidate countries soon, stressed that there are difficulties in the negotiations but expressed the hope that they will conclude by 28 February as scheduled. He added that the presidency has provided for two unscheduled meetings of the EU foreign ministers in February. Responding to a question on the Skopje issue, Mr. Pangalos said that Greece supports and guarantees the existence of Skopje. This state, he said, exists thanks to Greece, since its economic life depends on Thessaloniki. For this reason, Mr. Pangalos added, Greece would like this state to change its behavior on the issues of borders, its constitution, and the emblems on its flag. Mr. Pangalos also responded to questions on the implementation of the white paper and on other issues that the Greek presidency will be handling. [end recording]
