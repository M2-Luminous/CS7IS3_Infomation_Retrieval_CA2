Nobody from the SLF was killed or wounded by the Army, said A. Bappa, one of the rebels involved in the occupation of the dam and the hostage-taking of 30 employees from the bauxite company Suralco. This statement directly contradicts the Army's official statement, which said that five rebels were killed while fleeing during the recapture mission. [passage omitted]
