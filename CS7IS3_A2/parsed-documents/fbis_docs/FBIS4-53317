FBIS4-53317 "dreas096_a_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-096 Daily Report 18 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Extra Budget Worth 10.89 Trillion Yen Extra Budget Worth 10.89 Trillion Yen OW1805004994 Tokyo KYODO in English 0026 GMT 18 May 94 OW1805004994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- The government adopted Wednesday [18 May] a 10.89 trillion yen supplement to extend for 40 days a 50-day provisional budget worth 11.05 trillion yen that is nearing expiration. The revised stopgap budget totaling 21.94 trillion yen for 90 days was endorsed at a morning extraordinary cabinet meeting for immediate submission to the current Diet session. The government also extended the provisional outlays for the fiscal loan and investment program, adding 6.95 trillion yen to 16.78 trillion yen. The rare supplement on a stopgap budget -- the first since fiscal 1990 -- followed long political turmoil involving the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the selection of premier Tsutomu Hata. Diet deliberations for the 73.08 trillion yen full budget, submitted to the Diet unusually late on March 4, started finally Tuesday, but uncertainties over a speedy passage still prevail with the new ruling coalition parties holding a minority of Diet seats. It normally takes about two months for a full budget to pass through the Diet. Citing the lingering uncertainties, a Finance Ministry official told reporters the 40-day extension period was timed so that the stopgap budget expires when the current Diet session ends on June 29. As in the initial provisional budget, the supplement earmarks necessary minimum expenditures to keep administrative bodies functioning and excludes public projects in new policy areas. Outlays related to public works are increased by 1.07 trillion yen to 3.84 trillion yen, about three-sevenths of spending included in the full budget. Minimum expenses in labor, operations and other administrative expenses are set at 25 percent of the full budget, up from 14 percent in the initial stopgap budget. Among other major outlays, the supplement boosts social welfare spending by 1.48 trillion yen to 3.69 trillion yen, and raises tax grants to local governments by 3.64 trillion yen to 7.30 trillion yen. In revenues, the ministry estimates an additional 2.92 trillion yen to a total 6.75 trillion yen in the 90-day period, including 1.93 trillion yen more in tax income to 3.15 trillion yen and 910 billion yen more in bond issuance to 3.38 trillion yen. To cover an estimated revenue shortfall of 15.20 trillion yen, the ministry plans to raise funds by issuing short-term treasury securities if necessary. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told reporters after the cabinet meeting, "I can't deny that a long delay will affect the economy." But he stressed that the government decided on the revised stopgap budget to "minimize" adverse effects and is calling for early passage of the full budget. Meanwhile, some economists warned that the economy-stimulating outlays earmarked in February's pump-priming package will dry up by the end of June. The Japanese economy is recently showing improvements on the heels of the fiscal measures, but without fresh outlays, it could suffer another setback, they said.
