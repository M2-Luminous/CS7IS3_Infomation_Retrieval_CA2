The 45-month embargo on Iraq has caused a heavy burden for Jordan. Relations between Jordan and the United States are excellent. The U.S. position on Jerusalem has not changed. The United States seeks to reach a comprehensive peace in the region, and my tour emphasizes this. These are highlights of Christopher's statements, which he made at a news conference via satellite broadcast by several world capitals. If we want to assess these statements, we cannot but describe them as positive and consider them points in favor of the U.S. policy in the region, that is assuming they were not made just for consumption or to prepare for Christopher's upcoming tour of the region, which will begin within days, in his capacity as a full partner in the current peace negotiations between the Arabs and Israel. For the U.S. secretary of state to take note of the fact that the siege imposed on Iraq and the siege of al-'Aqabah have caused a considerable burden for Jordan is something very important, but talk and statements are one thing and actual implementation is something else. If the United States is serious about what it says, then the first thing that it should do is to stop these measures and stop all practices that cause any harm to any people in the region. As for the peace process, the United States, which is the full partner and main sponsor, should play its role honestly and neutrally and without a clear and open bias to the Israeli side as the situation is now. Israel still shows disregard for international charters and resolutions and is obstructing the path of peace in a bid to abort the peace process and preempt the negotiations with the Arabs from tackling any issue that brings a just and comprehensive peace closer. The United States continues to supply Israel with all means of strength, most modern weapons, and all it needs to remain superior in the region, continue its deviation, and practice all forms of repression, terrorism, killing, and siege on the occupied territories, destroying houses, and launching aggressions against cities and villages, whether in occupied Palestine or south Lebanon. All these practices are carried out while the U.S. Administration is aware of them. At any rate, we are going to take Warren Christopher's statements seriously, and we hope to see implementation on the ground. Only then we will reconsider what is said about the U.S. full bias toward Israel.
