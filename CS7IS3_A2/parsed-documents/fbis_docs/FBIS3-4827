FBIS3-4827 "dreas040_h_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-040 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Mar 1994 SOUTHEAST ASIA Singapore Semiconductor Company Signs Four Partners BK2502150094 Singapore BUSINESS TIMES in English 25 Feb 94 p 2 BK2502150094 Singapore BUSINESS TIMES Language: English Article Type:BFN [By Joseph Rajendran] [Text] Government-linked Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing [CSM], which today breaks ground on a US$660 million (S$1.05 billion) [Singapore currency] plant at Woodlands, said yesterday it had signed up four joint venture partners. It also said it would spend U.S.$100 million expanding its existing plant, called Fab 1, at the Science Park. For the Woodlands factory, the Economic Development Board [EDB] is believed to be one of the partners which will fork out part of U.S.$200 million which CSM expects to raise for phase one of the project. This will be EDB's second major commitment in the semiconductor business -- it has a 26 percent stake in the U.S. $330 million Tech Semiconductor project, which is next to the CSM site at Woodlands. The other three partners in the CSM venture are U.S.-based listed firms -- Rockwell International, Brooktree Corp and Actel Corp. CSM, which is part of the Singapore Technologies Ventures stable, will start negotiations with three other partners next month. It expects to rope in up to six partners for the project, called Fab 2. Plans for the plant -- which will be Singapore's largest high-tech investment -- were announced three months ago. The Government, having made Singapore the world's largest producer of disk drives, wants semiconductor technology to be the country's strength in the next decade and is leading the way with these projects. Rockwell, which has been a good customer of Fab 1, designs chips for use in aerospace, missiles and defence-electronics systems. The company, which had 1993 sales of about U.S.$ 10.8 billion, gets most of its orders from the U.S. government. Brooktree Corp, which grossed sales of U.S.$ 111.3 million last year, is involved in Very Large Scale Integrated circuits that solve complex technical problems. It also develops chips for the multimedia industry. Actel, with 1993 sales of about U.S.$59.6 million, designs circuits for computers, telecom products and military equipment. CSM's facility systems director Ang Tang Yong said yesterday that the three partners will be "guaranteed manufacturing capacity based on equity participation. They will also be given preferential pricing."
