He added that the advantages resulting from a place in the international market by Shanghai and Hong Kong would play an irreplaceable role for China's economic development. Mr. Liu said that he believed both places had their own merits. Shanghai as a financial centre in the Far East since the 1930s has seen a vast annual amount of imports and exports by reason of its sound geographical location. The municipality now boasts a strong economic base with many financial professionals. The 350-sq. kilometre Pudong economic development zone will be of great economic might with branches of 28 foreign-funded banks and representative offices of 60 other foreign-funded banks there at present, ranking the municipality first among the cities in the country in terms of the number of such establishments. Shanghai, however, cannot replace Hong Kong as an international financial centre in Far East Asia for several reasons, including, first, the well-established financial system in Hong Kong which had made it an international financial centre widely recognized for its sound operation. The territory possesses a free port, the gathering of professional personnel in various fields and good investment and geographical location, while Shanghai cannot develop into a free port in near future. Second, Shanghai is scheduled to become an international financial centre by the year 2010. Before that date, the municipality can only be a domestic financial centre and lag behind Hong Kong for at least 20 years. Third, once the municipality becomes an international financial centre, the Chinese government will have no intention of replacing Hong Kong with Shanghai nor will it weaken the territory's function and status. It is recognized that the two places can at the same time do good to China with their status in the international financial market. The Shanghai government, according to Mr. Liu, has called for the removal of the headquarters of the Bank of China to the municipality. He, however, believed that such an idea was loaded with difficulties, including communications and transport which are yet to be improved. The idea could, however, be achieved in two phases involving first the removal of the international department of the bank to Shanghai and then the department as well as capital would go to Hong Kong after 1997, while the headquarters remained in Shanghai. Such a move had precedents in the international community with Japan, for example, where many banks have their headquarters in Osaka, while their international businesses departments remain in Tokyo.
