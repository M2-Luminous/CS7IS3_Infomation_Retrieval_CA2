Concerning the Banque du Zaire, the head of state has appointed a new governor and a new deputy governor. Through this action, and following the protective measures taken to curb the ill-considered outflow of important funds from the Banque du Zaire, the head of state sought to draw all the conclusions from the report issued by the board of the Banque du Zaire. It has been concluded from this report that serious presumptions of responsibility weigh heavily on the governor of the Banque du Zaire, concerning not only the failure of the monetary reform of 28 September 1993 but also the mismanagement of the (?concurrent issuing of bank notes) that resulted from the aforementioned reform. In promoting the former deputy governor, (Ndian Kabul) -- who was not involved in the failure of the aforementioned monetary reform -- to the rank of governor, the head of state has put his trust in a high-ranking civil servant of the institution who is called on to take measures likely to improve the dramatic situation of our central bank. The same could be said of the deputy governor who has been chosen among the high-ranking experienced men of our monetary institution. Concerning public sector companies and one mixed economy company, the head of state has taken these measures to fill the vacancies that resulted from the measures of dismissal that have recently hit the former managers of PetroZaire, the national post and telecommunications board of Zaire and Zaire-SEP. We note that concerning this matter, the head of state has appealed to competent managers who are experienced in their fields. In addition, the head of state has at the same time sought to resolve the problem of the legal statute of the Banque de Commerce Exterieure du Zaire [Foreign Trade Bank of Zaire] which has for a long time been operation in a state of confusion. Finally, concerning the education sector, the president of the republic, Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko has also signed two decrees, one concerning the restructuring and the reorganization of the Zairean national commission to UNESCO and the other appointing the permanent secretary of this commission. Here are the main points of these decrees, signed on Tuesday, 1 February, 1994 by the president of the republic, Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko: 1.
