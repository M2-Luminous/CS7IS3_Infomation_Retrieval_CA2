Schmidt] [Text] Environmental Protection Technology Provides Additional Company Profit Integrated Recovery Systems for Etching and Electroplating Return Valuable Materials to Production Effective environmental protection in a company does not just result in costs. Sometimes it becomes a profitable business if advanced recycling technology is used. Siemens Matsushita Components GmbH in Heidenheim and Siemens-Steckverbinderwerk [connector factory] in Speyer are demonstrating this. The environment is being saved in the future from 18,000 m[.sup]3[/] of waste water and up to 7,000 metric tons of compressed sludge residue. This previously resulted from the etching of aluminum capacitors. At the same time, the electronics firm of Siemens Matsushita Components has reduced the operating costs in its capacitor factory in Heidenheim by 1.7 million Deutsche marks annually. The system required an investment of 1.2 million Deutsche marks to realize these production and environmental goals. It is about 500,000 Deutsche marks cheaper than the previous model. Jakob Bauer is the Siemens environmental manager who provided these figures. He also provided information regarding the technical details. According to him, the new system is achieving a high degree of recycling. "Of the hydrochloric and sulfuric acids used here, 80% are recovered from used etching baths. Previously, these acids would be neutralized, the sludge removed and sent for waste disposal." This activity shows up in the statement of costs because resources are now being returned to the production cycle. Jakob Bauer emphasizes that, in Heidenheim, the bath residues coming from the etching process are "separated into highly acidic and weakly acidic fractions using a membrane method, diffusion dialysis. These fractions are rich in metals." In this way, according to Bauer, it has become possible to extend the working life of the etching baths. This saves money. Besides this, not only is 96% of the aluminum salts retained but also, in an additional step, they serve the goal of environmental protection. Now, these salts are supplied to community sewage treatment plants which can make use of them again as precipitating agents. Electroplating in the Siemens Factory in Speyer Waste water treatment that makes minimal use of chemicals, water cycling for rinsing baths, and recovery methods for resource recycling increase environmental protection and company profit. Another example of methods providing both increased environmental protection and profit potential is the Siemens-Kabelwerk [cable factory] in Mudanya in Turkey. There, a recycling system for cable remainders has been in operation for a few months. This system first breaks up the incoming lines and then separates the polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride of the cable sheath from the copper by means of a vibrating chute. In this way, the plastics can be used again and copper with a purity of 99.5% and which can be smelted again is recovered. In addition, claims Bauer, this environmental protection system also contributes to Siemens' profit with 250,000 Deutsche marks annually. Behind these and other production methods and products is, according to Bauer, the idea that, "we need to work on complete solutions for the emission areas of waste water, waste products and exhaust air. In these solutions, the sum of all emissions should represent an optimized minimum." These environmentally conscious production methods and products will not always be a profit-generating investment for the companies. In addition, a safety system is to be created for the emission areas of soil and ground water which "is adapted to the existing potential danger." Systems that traditionally pose particular problems for the environment include electroplating shops such as those in the Siemens Steckverbinderwerk in Speyer. These systems are problematic because of their use of water-polluting materials and because of their often large requirement for rinse water. However, it can be seen even here how a modern plant of this type can be created to protect the environment. "In Speyer," says Bauer, "we no longer operate with the conventional end-of-pipe technology. Rather, we treat the waste water using the advanced side-stream method." Recovery methods integrated into the process here serve the recycling of resources. The remaining waste water is treated according to special concepts designed to make minimal use of chemicals. These innovations also include a control and documentation system under computer control. The usefulness of these innovations has resulted in a reduction in the quantity of waste water by about one half. As "we now recover 2,000 kg of copper, 80 kg of palladium and 6 kg of gold and 7,500 liters of polishing bath and 1,700 liters of nickel bath annually, the metal hydroxide waste is also reduced by about one third," summarizes Jakob Bauer.
