Other business people told ITAR-TASS about their anxiety over the growing instability on the Russian market, which will inevitably follow the resignation of Yegor Gaydar from the post of first deputy prime minister. In the opinion of Mikhail Dunin, vice president of the Moscow Commodity Exchange, "Gaydar's resignation will trigger panic at commodity and stock exchanges, as a result of which the dollar exchange rate may reach 1,500 - 1,600 roubles before the end of January." The growth of the dollar exchange rate will "automatically lead to another round of inflation, to the growth of prices, including hard currency prices." Dunin stated with regret that "hopes for the stabilisation of the situation on the Russian market, that emerged after December 12, are not coming true, which may enhance the prestige of Zhirinovskiy." Aside from it Dunin, the same as other business people, complained that "endless cataclysms in the Russian Government do not allow business people to implement long-term programmes, because the unpredictable character of the policy, pursued by the Cabinet of Ministers, does not make it possible to forecast the situation on the Russian market." Oleg Vinogradov, chairman of the board of directors of the Mosexpo joint-stock company, regards Gaydar's announcement of his resignation as an "untimely step". He accused the first deputy prime minister of giving up the attempts to form a government, which would guarantee the continuation of the reform." Sergey Popov, adviser to the president of the Association of Russian Banks, has an opinion of his own about Gaydar's statement. He believes that Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, a possible successor of Gaydar on the post of first deputy prime minister, "is more adequate to Russian realities." Popov likes Yavlinskiy's desire to get from the prime minister the guarantees of the implementation of a clear programme of actions and to take upon himself the responsibility for the reform course.
