FR940728-1-00015 FR940728-1-00004 Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;17.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;17, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. Discussion Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received reports of two incidents where AlliedSignal Aerospace (formerly Garrett Auxiliary Power Division and Garrett Turbine Engine Co.) GTCP85 series auxiliary power units (APU) experienced uncontained failures. In both incidents, the APU turbine wheel fragments exited the APU exhaust axially and damaged the aircraft while on the ground. The FAA has determined that this failure mode is a potential safety hazard both on the ground and in flight, as the APU can release turbine wheel fragments that can penetrate the aircraft APU exhaust duct and cause damage to other aircraft systems. In addition, the hot turbine wheel fragments can pose a fire hazard. This condition, if not corrected, could result in an axially uncontained APU failure and damage to the aircraft. FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of AlliedSignal Aerospace Service Bulletin (SB) No. GTCP85&hyph;49&hyph;A6831, dated March 17, 1994, applicable to APU's installed on McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9/MD&hyph;80 series aircraft, and SB No. GTCP85&hyph;49&hyph;6919, dated May 17, 1994, applicable to APU's installed on several other aircraft makes and models. These SB's describe procedures for modifying the APU to install an exhaust centerbody. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require modifying the APU to install an exhaust centerbody to contain turbine wheel fragments from exiting the APU axially. Due to the increased risk associated with airborne failures, flight operable APU's would be required to be modified within 24 months after the effective date of the AD, and within 36 months after the effective date of this AD for APU's that are ground operable only. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. There are approximately 3,000 APU's of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 1,500 APU's installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 5 work hours per APU to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $7,055 per APU if the exhaust duct is not reworkable, $3,254 per APU if the exhaust duct is reworkable, and the FAA estimates that 1,050 domestic APU's are reworkable. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,003,950. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [AMENDED] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: AlliedSignal Aerospace: Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;17.
