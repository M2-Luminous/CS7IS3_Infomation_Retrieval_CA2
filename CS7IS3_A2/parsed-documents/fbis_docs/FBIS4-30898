A Chilean military delegation arrived today in Prague, but the arrival of Chilean Ground Forces Chief Commander Augusto Pinochet has not been confirmed although it had been notified. Chladek said that Pinochet's visit had a special meaning for him. He said he was born in Chile to a Czech father and Chilean mother whose family had suffered a great deal under Pinochet's regime, losing several of its members. After a calm intervention by the Czech Police, the demonstrators removed the banner.
