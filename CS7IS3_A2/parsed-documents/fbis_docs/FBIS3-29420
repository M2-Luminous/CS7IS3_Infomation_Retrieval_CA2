FBIS3-29420 "dreas033__a94001" FBIS-EAS-94-033-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo Considers GATT Appeal on U.S. Sanctions OW1702123594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 16 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1702123594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The government has raised objections to the United States, which has made firm its plan to initiate procedures for imposing sanctions against Japan on the issue of U.S. access to Japan's market for automobile and portable telephones. The government has complained that "since Japan has faithfully complied with agreements made with the United States, it is hard to understand why sanctions should be imposed," (as stated by an official of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications). Should the United States actually initiate sanctions against Japan, the government plans to consider taking its case to the GATT. However, to avoid an all-out confrontation, the government also plans to promptly work out a "comprehensive surplus-cutting and market opening program" (tentative name) to accelerate market opening and reduction of Japan's current account surplus. On the afternoon of 15 February (early morning of 16 February, Japan time), the U.S. Government, in accordance with Article 1377 of its Trade Act, ruled that "Japan has violated a bilateral accord concluded in 1989" regarding Japan's market for automobile and portable telephones. There has grown a strong likelihood that the U.S. Government will subsequently initiate procedures for imposing sanctions. Japan is "prepared to appeal to the GATT should sanctions be initiated," (as stated by Takakazu Kuriyama, Japanese ambassador to the United States), by the United States through such measures as levying punitive tariffs on certain Japanese items. The government is also determined to reject numerical targets the U.S. Government wants Japan to accept so that the U.S. Motorola Inc.'s transmission system for mobile phones will become more widespread in Japan. Whether this system, which is handled by the Nippon Ido Tsushin Corporation (IDO), will become popular is a question that would depend on business decisions that private firms will make. Therefore, the government plans to break the deadlocked situation on the basis of discussions between private firms. However, both Japan and the United States hope to avoid a "battle of reciprocal sanctions," (as stated by U.S. President Bill Clinton), at all costs because the entire Japanese economy would be seriously affected, should the United States further wave its "let-the-yen-rise negotiating card." For this reason, the government plans to once again seek U.S. understanding of Japanese efforts by compiling a comprehensive program to reduce its surplus and open its markets. At a cabinet meeting held on the morning of 15 February, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister, Chikara Sakaguchi, labor minister, and other ministers pointed out the need for such a program. The government is considering plans to announce this program as being undertaken at Japan's own initiative. Details of the program will now be worked out mainly by relevant ministries. The program is expected to include such plans as stricter application of the Antimonopoly Law and further deregulation, in addition to the improvement in procedures regarding government procurement -- on which agreement has already been made at the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks. Since the United States is further pressuring Japan to open its markets and reduce its surplus through a two-pronged strategy of sanctions and encouragement of yen appreciation, it seems Japan will have to work out its comprehensive program before the July summit meeting of major industrialized nations (Naples summit).
