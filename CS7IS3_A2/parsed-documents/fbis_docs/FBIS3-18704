The February poll, conducted by Dimarso on behalf of DE MORGEN, reveals that the Walloon Socialists only represent 30.1 percent of the French-speaking electorate, representing a 6-percent drop since December. In Flanders, the VLD's [Flemish Liberals and Democrats] progress seems to have come to a standstill. Party leader Verhofstadt and his supporters lost 1.5 percent (down to 28.5 percent), and are now at their lowest level since July 1993. Dimarso's monthly poll was conducted between 7 and 16 February among 1,000 Flemish, 1,000 Walloons, and 400 people from Brussels. There was a "no response" from 18 percent of those questioned. In Flanders, the majority parties are not benefiting from the VLD's downturn. The CVP [Christian People's Party] remains practically at the same level (21.8 percent), while the SP [Flemish Socialist Party] has dropped from 18.3 to 17.6 percent. Even the Volksunie [People's Union] has fallen from 6.6 to 6.3 percent, despite the strong European list it disclosed in February. The winners are Agalev [Live Differently] (up 0.7 percent to 11.3 percent), the Vlaams Blok [Flemish Bloc] (from 9.7 percent to 11.5 percent), and Rossem (from 2 to 2.4 percent). Walloon Region In the Walloon region, the PSC [Social Christian Party] is the biggest winner. Deprez' party registered a 1.5 percent increase to 20.1 percent; the PRL [Liberal Reformation Party] climbed slightly to 23 percent (up 0.7 percent); and the Ecolo [Ecologists] jumped to 16.3 percent (up 0.9 percent). The category "others," which in addition to the FDF [French-Speaking Front] and some minor leftwing parties includes ultraright-wing parties, lost some ground (from 11.2 to 10.5 percent).
