Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-24FEB94-PALESTINIANS PLO Voices Alarm Over Turmoil in the Territories SUMMARY Recent statements by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and by mainstream PLO organs have indicated growing concern that continued turmoil among Palestinians in the occupied territories will threaten the PLO's ability to establish an effective autonomy regime under the Declaration of Principles (DOP) with Israel. While PLO statements have characteristically charged that Israeli machinations lie behind any disarray among Palestinians in the territories, they have nonetheless also carried an implicit warning to Palestinians that the infighting threatens their own future. END SUMMARY In an interview reported by the Amman daily Jordan Times, 'Arafat expressed alarm over rising quantities of firearms among Palestinians in the territories and was quoted as charging that "there is a very terrible trade of arms going on under the auspices of some Israeli officers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip," an effort he described as "seriously and wickedly planned" to create "another Afghanistan among the Palestinians." While noting 'Arafat's charge, the Jordan Times reported that the Israel-PLO DOP had prompted serious rifts among mainstream Palestinians in the territories, including within 'Arafat's own Fatah faction, and that unnamed PLO officials have privately expressed fear of a "civil war" if Palestinians failed to exercise "self-restraint" (17 February). A Fatah statement reported by the East Jerusalem Palestinian daily Al-Quds on 15 February implicitly confirmed reports of rifts within Fatah. The statement charged that Israeli security services are trying to "prepare the climate for a prolonged civil war" among Palestinians, and specifically to "create suspect bodies that raise the national slogan and operate under different names within Fatah." It called on Fatah supporters to "act with alertness and high responsibility and not deal with these unofficial and illegitimate organizations." It also asserted that Fatah statements issued in the territories "are approved officially by Fatah's supreme organizational committee" in the territories and that any other statements, including those issued by "Fatah's [local] organizational offices," are "unofficial." Recent commentaries broadcast by the mainstream radio Voice of the PLO in Baghdad also implicitly appealed to Palestinians to temper their internal disputes. On 16 February, the radio charged that Israel is seeking to "create chaos and lack of security" in the territories and to "maliciously sow disputes and provoke sensitivities" among Palestinians. It warned that "some of us have fallen victim to this black propaganda." Apparently reflecting fears that Palestinian residents of the territories will challenge the authority of returning PLO officials, the commentary called for "awareness of the masses" to prepare for "national reconciliation after a long expatriation during the occupation" and said that factions in the territories "should not now run after authority" but should rather seek to "enhance cooperation . . . to launch reconstruction." Three commentaries on the 21st warned against internal divisions. They charged that Israel is responsible for "all the forged and distorted statements" and even "tribal differences" among Palestinians and is seeking to "create seditions and sow discord" to prove that the proposed Palestinian autonomy regime "cannot run the affairs of the Palestinian people." Palestinians, they advised, must maintain "enhanced national unity" under PLO leadership as well as "further vigilance against any malicious instigation promoting discord." (AUTHOR: MORTON.
