Good evening, Mr. Leotard. Before mentioning the diplomatic or political aspects of this case, let me ask you a couple of questions on the purely military aspect. Is it conceivable that French troops will enter the areas controlled by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]? [Leotard] The instructions we gave our forces are two-fold: first, to develop the humanitarian action, that is to survey the sites where people are threatened or facing difficult sanitation or food problems; second, not to approach the front line. The front line more or less cuts through Rwanda north to south -- in the south, on the road from Kigali to Bujumbura, Burundi. We avoid getting close to that line for the time being, because it can be a line where Rwandan army, militias, and the RPF are clashing. [Masure] Tension was reported at a certain number of roadblocks today and General Germanos, who is at the scene, says the situation is fragile. Aren't you worried? [Leotard] He is right, and I would like to say that the video report I just saw is extremely interesting and positive, but we should avoid any untimely satisfaction. The situation is extremely fragile, and Gen. Germanos was right to say so. It is characterized by many uncertainties, and we do not know everything about the situation. We now have fewer than 500 soldiers in Rwanda in a relatively large area and, as we saw in the report, we do not know all the distressful situations we may face. I believe we must be extremely prudent. I repeat that our role is to wait for the arrival of UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] II, which is the UN force replacing us as early as possible, I hope. We are scouting the area, observing what is going on, listening, and going to places where dangerous situations are reported. We do what we can physically do. [Masure] I would like to ask you a personal question. What do you feel when you see French soldiers in this difficult environment? [Leotard] As the man in charge of French defense, naturally I am extremely happy to see French soldiers welcome. I must stress that we did not know what the reception would be like. It could have been dangerous or difficult, and it can be tomorrow, tomorrow morning, so we must be very careful. There is a generous feeling driving many French to help a country in distress, but the government also does not want to risk the lives of our soldiers and does not want to give this military presence, even if it has a peaceful and humanitarian aim, a character of provoking one or the other party. As you see, the men carrying out this mission do so very tactfully, but it is a very difficult situation because there is no clash. We do not want a clash, and for soldiers this requires a great deal of self-control with relatively modest means. There is also an important question: What do we do with refugees and how? We are now in touch with the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] to make sure that food and medical aid follow, enabling these refugees to be properly treated. [Masure] Mr. Defense Minister, the purity, if you will pardon the expression, of French intentions was strongly criticized before the start of this intervention, including by our very close allies, both European and American. Do you feel now that you have reassured them, or do you feel that there is a political evolution? [Leotard] I believe this evolution is taking place. We are in permanent contact with our partners at the Western European Union, among others, and with the Americans. I myself had talks with several of my counterparts--European defense ministers--and it has gradually transpired that, first, they are going to help us with the logistics and with health equipment. Second, they support our concept politically: the idea that we are there temporarily only until the UNAMIR II -- that is, the UN force mission -- arrives. I believe this is France's position. It may be necessary to explain it further, but we do not intend to stay at all, nor do we not intend to carry out military actions. I would like to point this out again if necessary. We are there because there was a lot of concern in France and throughout the world, and justifiably so, after these massacres, and we believed that the international community could not accept genocide in 1994, because this was the real issue. We regretted the fact that we were the only ones to do so at the beginning. I believe some countries, including African countries, because this is the key, are joining us; I hope there will be many more. We have been given the assurance that some Senegalese will be able to take part in the operation tomorrow; I hope that the Ghanaians will be able to do the same in a few days. We hope the Africans themselves will be able to manage this type of conflict, this type of crisis, themselves in the future. It is first and foremost their responsibility. We do not intend to replace them at all. [Masure] Francois Leotard, a last question: Can you confirm to the families of these French soldiers in Rwanda that they will all be back home in two months and that whatever happens they will hand over to the UNAMIR II at the end of July? [Leotard] This is our intention. The prime minister mentioned the end of July before the National Assembly: We are going to do our utmost to respect this goal. The French, on the whole--it is often the case, including politically....[pauses] when French soldiers are involved, that there should be a maximum of support and unanimity around them. This is a fair mission, a difficult one, perhaps a risky one over the next couple of days, and it is necessary for French opinion--I know that this is the case-- but for politicians, among others, to avoid criticism and opposition. These are the soldiers of France and, in an operation that is desired by many of those who are threatened, is supported and desired by the government, even if we are a bit lonely. We are sticking together and closing ranks, and we try to support our soldiers. I believe this is the least we can do. [Masure] Thank you.
