In his opinion, "one cannot rule out social cataclysms in the near future." Under this situation, Sterligov indicated, the RNC deems it possible to create a Russian Power Union bloc as an association of the opposition "which could participate in the presidential elections if they take place." In his words, in the near future the RNC intends to create "a national council -- a kind of council of the Elders -- which would proceed with the consultations with different opposition forces to coordinate their positions and to form a single bloc." "We addressed Varennikov, Achalov, and Starodubtsev with a proposal to form such a council," said Sterligov. As he said, "one should agree to the president's idea on national accord, however, this accord cannot be reached as a result of adopting one act." "Public recognition of serious mistakes on the part of the president and his circles and their resignation could be a step on the way to national accord in society," stressed Sterligov. He indicated that "for their part, the opposition forces could publicly take pledges to ensure stability in society and to rule out any political persecutions." "Russia must reject the present system of elections which has recognized its bankruptcy and start formation of a power structure at a `Zemstvo Assembly'," declared Sterligov. As he said, "the first `Zemstvo Assembly' should be convened in 1996 instead of elections scheduled for this time." Sterligov pointed out that delegations of Russia's territories and regions representing different strata of the population would be able to elect new power structures and, probably, abolish the institute of the presidency.
