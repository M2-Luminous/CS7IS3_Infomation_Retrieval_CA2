FBIS4-35198 "drnes104dd_94016" FBIS-NES-94-104 Daily Report 30 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Al-Husayni: `Battle Over Jerusalem' Has Begun Al-Husayni: `Battle Over Jerusalem' Has Begun TA3005112194 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1005 GMT 30 May 94 TA3005112194 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] The Palestinians today decided to increase their political activity in East Jerusalem as the peace process advances. This is their reaction to Israel's expected moves. Faysal al-Husayni, who holds the Jerusalem portfolio in the Palestinian Authority, declared that the battle over Jerusalem has started. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: [Begin recording] [Amir] Faysal al-Husayni, the Palestinian Authority minister in charge of Jerusalem, held a news conference at Orient House a short time ago and declared that the battle over Jerusalem has started. He emphasized that in his opinion Israel started this battle in an attempt to limit Palestinian political activity in Orient House and other Palestinian institutions in the city: [Al-Husayni, in English] We can say that while we are fighting a battle to end the isolation of Jerusalem from the other part of the occupied territories, I believe the Israelis are trying to open a new fight and a new battle against us, so they hope that the world and we will forget about the matter of the closure of Jerusalem and we will fight only for our existence and the existence of our institutions in Jerusalem. [Amir, translates the above and continues] Al-Husayni said that while the Palestinians are trying to struggle against the isolation of Jerusalem from other areas in the territories -- referring to the ongoing closure on the city -- Israel is trying to open a new battle against us in order to make the world and us forget the closure on Jerusalem and limit our struggle to the existence of our institutions in Jerusalem. Al-Husayni noted that the political activity in East Jerusalem preceded the Oslo agreement, and that it drew its strength from the peace process rather than the interim agreement. He emphasized, therefore, that the Palestinians will open more political institutions in East Jerusalem as the peace process advances, because it was agreed that the negotiations over Jerusalem would start only during the last stage of the agreement.
