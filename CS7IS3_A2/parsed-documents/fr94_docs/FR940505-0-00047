FR940505-0-00047 FR940505-0-00013 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 91&hyph;ANE&hyph;47; Amendment 39&hyph;8878; AD 94&hyph;08&hyph;06] Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Pratt & Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series turbofan engines, that requires initial and repetitive fan blade leading edge inspections, and either installation of fan blade sets with modified fan blade shrouds or rework of the fan blade shrouds as a terminating action to the inspections. This amendment is prompted by reports of flutter-induced fan blade fractures. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent fan blade fracture and uncontained engine failure, resulting in possible damage to the aircraft. DATES: Effective July 5, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Pratt & Whitney, 400 Main Street, East Hartford, CT 06108. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Fisher, Aerospace Engineer, Engine Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7149, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT9D&hyph;7R4 series turbofan engines was published in the Federal Register on June 2, 1993 (58 FR 31356). That action proposed to require initial and repetitive on-wing or shop fan blade leading edge inspections to check for leading edge damage in accordance with PW Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;255, Revision 5, dated January 8, 1990; and to require fan blade set replacement or optional rework of the fan blade shrouds in accordance with PW SB No. 72&hyph;309, Revision 9, dated June 12, 1991. Though the NPRM referenced PW SB No. 72&hyph;309, Revision 9, dated June 12, 1991, this final rule incorporates the later Revision 10, dated September 2, 1993, which is substantially unchanged from Revision 9. Rework of the fan blade shrouds in accordance with PW SB No. 72&hyph;309, Revision 9, dated June 12, 1991, is an acceptable alternate means of compliance for paragraphs (c) and (d) of this AD. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One comment states that the proposed 90-day requirement for initializing the inspection program poses a significant hardship and economic impact due to difficulty in scheduling engine maintenance. This comment requests extending the initializing period to 180 days. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) agrees that the proposed initial 90-day eddy current inspection requirement may be burdensome to some operators. The FAA has therefore added a visual inspection as an option to the eddy current inspection in this final rule. This visual inspection offers greater flexibility in scheduling as it can easily be performed in the field. The FAA does not concur, however, in extending the initializing period to 180 days, as this time period does not offer an adequate level of safety based on risk analysis results. This final rule establishes an interval of 200 cycles in service (CIS) before visual or eddy current inspection that should enable operators to initialize the inspection program with minimum disruption to scheduling without reducing flight safety. Also, the FAA has added guidance emphasizing the manner in which the visual inspection should be performed. One comment requests eliminating the reference in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the proposed rule to the leading edge refurbishment described in PW Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;117, as the determining factor for beginning the inspection program. The comment further states that a previous AD, 90&hyph;14&hyph;08, already requires the leading edge refurbishment described in PW SB No. 72&hyph;117, and therefore meets the intent of paragraphs (a) and (b) of the proposed rule. The FAA concurs. Repetitive leading edge refurbishment as described in PW SB No. 72&hyph;117 is already required by AD 90&hyph;14&hyph;08. The compliance section of this AD has been changed from the wording in the NPRM to eliminate reference to leading edge refurbishment, and combines paragraphs (a) and (b) of the proposed rule into a new paragraph (a) which has the same inspection requirements and interval of 200 CIS as the repetitive inspections of paragraph (c) of the proposed rule.
