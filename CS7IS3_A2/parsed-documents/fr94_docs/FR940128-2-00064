FR940128-2-00064 FR940128-2-00036 In the HDW EIS ROD, DOE deferred final disposal decisions for the tank wastes contained in single-shell tanks (SSTs), pending further evaluations in a supplemental EIS. However, to meet regulatory requirements, DOE's current planning basis is to retrieve SST waste, and to integrate double-shell tank (DST) and SST waste management activities leading to final disposal. Because DOE now proposes to integrate SST and DST waste management programs, the TWRS EIS described in this NOI will replace the previously planned supplement to the HDW EIS. The TWRS EIS will address the DOE's proposal for the management, treatment, storage, and disposal of the waste currently stored in the existing 149 SSTs and 28 DSTs and other wastes to be generated during future decontamination and decommissioning activities at Hanford. DOE recognizes that removal of waste from the tanks may trigger Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) treatment and disposal requirements to complete closure of the tanks. However, the impacts of tank closure cannot be meaningfully evaluated at this time. DOE will conduct an appropriate NEPA review, such as an EIS to support tank closure, in the future. The planned interim action EIS will address the construction of six new tanks and associated new transfer lines, and the tank operations. For the purposes of this interim action EIS, operations considered would be limited to the retrieval, pH adjustment or alkalinity control, and storage of wastes from the Watchlist safety tanks. The primary focus of the EIS would be the resolution of safety issues related to the three tanks that are on the Watchlist because of hydrogen generation (241&hyph;SY&hyph;101, 241&hyph;SY&hyph;103 and 241&hyph;AN&hyph;104), but the tanks may also be used to alleviate safety concerns in other Watchlist tanks (50 tanks are currently on the Watchlist). Further decisions regarding the retrieval, treatment and disposal of wastes from the Watchlist tanks will be the subject of the TWRS EIS. DATES: DOE invites all interested parties to submit written comments or suggestions concerning the scope of the issues to be addressed, alternatives to be analyzed, and the environmental impacts to be assessed in the TWRS EIS and the new tanks EIS, during a 45-day comment period ending March 14, 1994. The public is also invited to attend scoping meetings in which oral comments will be received on the proposed TWRS EIS and the new tanks EIS. Oral and written comments will be considered equally in preparation of the EISs. Written comments must be postmarked by March 14, 1994. Comments postmarked after that date will be considered to the extent practicable. Oral and written comments will be received at public scoping meetings to be held on the dates and at the locations given below:
