But even the country's first-ever Law "On the Utilization of Nuclear Power," which would have helped to eradicate many problems, passed two readings in the Supreme Soviet and...sank into oblivion. The editorial office asked Gennadiy Kalistratov, chairman of the State Duma Energy Subcommittee, to tell us what, in his opinion, the legislative line on nuclear power should be. [Kalistratov] To begin with, the draft of the stillborn law must be resurrected. Section 1 of it describes the evolution of a nuclear facility from conception to dismantlement. Mutual relations between the center and the regions are specified in the organizational and financial respect. Section 2 comprises compensation (moral, physical, and property) for both individuals and territories in the event of accidents. The responsibilities of components and authorities are set out. A number of problems not covered in the draft law should be considered legislatively. For example, long-term storage of solid and liquid waste on the territory of stations and construction of regional burial sites. As well as questions of operating AES's [nuclear electric power stations] and market conditions. It is worthwhile to work out and incorporate into a normative document a mechanism for denationalizing nuclear power units. It is useful to utilize foreign experience here. Thus, in ancient "market" countries -- Britain and France -- the nuclear power industry is run by the state. This is evidently the most acceptable option for Russia. But the practice of private U.S. companies operating nuclear facilities is premature for us, bearing in mind the economic and technical might of these companies. In a period of reform and instability it makes more sense to leave the running of AES's exclusively to the state. It is no less important to legislatively stimulate specific territories' interest in the construction of AES's. The three-stage coordination which exists in our country is retarding the solution of this question. The West has switched to a two-stage system: the local council and the government. The funds received in the form of taxes from AES's are almost completely seized by the oblast. Sometimes the profits tax is shared out as follows: one-third to the republic budget, almost two-thirds to the oblast budget, and a mere one-tenth to the rayon in which the AES is located. Consequently the rayon has no objective interest in the AES. It undoubtedly makes sense to review the proportions of payments to the budget. Furthermore, there is now an acute need to define the legal status of the 30-km zone's area and to indicate its rights in relation to a station and the economic foundations of development. A special question is posed by the legislative definition of legal responsibility for circulating incorrect data on the effects of operating an AES and its effect on the environment. It is not only a question of ethics and politics but also one of economics. The point is that our country is one of the five world leaders in theoretical physics, technologies, and reactor construction, and in the spheres of enriching uranium and operating AES's. Russia has great export potential, and export earnings could maintain nuclear power collectives' prosperity for the entire period of market reforms and could even cover Western credits. Our country is now at the epicenter of a fierce clash between Western reactor construction competitors for a place in the market. A particularly keen struggle is going on for the East European, Near East, South Asian, and Far East zones of influence. An even more insidious aim is being set: To squeeze Russia out of...Russia itself. That is, to replace domestic equipment with Western equipment, payment being made in clean energy conveyed via a power line. And we are "kindly" being left with the nuclear waste. If this happens our domestic scientific and technological and operational experience will disappear forever. Therefore an "ideological" struggle also lies ahead on the legislative level. Russia must have a national nuclear energy development program which matches its potential. A law approving this program is bound to become the mainspring of a whole package of normative documents in this sphere.
