In an interview with reporters at Government House this morning, the finance minister said the current appreciation of the baht is both good and bad for Thai exports. [Begin recording] [Tharin] This is an ordinary realignment of international markets. The situation is being monitored by the Exchange Equalization Fund. There is a little fluctuation at foreign exchange markets, but we believe the situation would stabilize soon. [Unidentified reporter] Will the stronger baht have an impact on our exports? [Tharin] There is no big change at present. What has happened is an ordinary adjustment to global changes. [Reporter] The dollar is said to have slipped very low, and there has been a call for the government not to peg the baht to the dollar. What is going to be done on this matter? [Tharin] Our exchange system has the baht tied to a basket of currencies. Under this system, we tie the baht to foreign currencies and we use this as a medium of trade. This is the reason why the value of the baht has to be adjusted in accordance with realities. However, we rely heavily on U.S.dollars. Since the dollar has weakened slightly, the baht has become stronger compared to the dollar. But, compared to the yen and mark, the value of the baht has dropped slightly. Therefore, the current situation favors our exports to Japan and Europe. [End recording]
