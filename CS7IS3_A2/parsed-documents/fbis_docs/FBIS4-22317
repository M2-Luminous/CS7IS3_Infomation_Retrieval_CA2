Yerin to First Deputy Minister of Economics of the Russian Federation A.G. Shapovalyants reported by the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA investigative service: "Now It Is Becoming Clear Why Ilyumzhinov Relinquished the Post of President of Kalmykia"] [Text] To First Deputy Minister of Economics of the Russian Federation A.G. Shapovalyants Concerning Disclosures of Violations in the Use of Credit Resources of the Steppe Association. Dear Andrey Georgiyevich! The Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] of Russia is conducting a check on the fact of illegal use of state credit resources by a number of managers of state and commercial structures. It has been preliminarily established that in September-November 1992 the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, on a petition of Rostekstil, the Russian state concern for the production of textile commodities, in the person of B.M. Fomin, president, issued a favorable special credit for the total sum of 14 billion rubles [R] to the Steppe Commercial Bank (Republic of Kalmykia). The indicated sum was intended for extending credit to enterprises of the Rostekstil concern for the purchase and processing of wool. The redistribution of the credit resources of the commercial bank Steppe led to the fact that a basic sum of credit to the extent of R10.4 billion was received by the Steppe Association (Republic of Kalmykia), which is not part of the Rostekstil structure, and, in accordance with the contract, it fulfills the functions of a dealer organization of the concern. In its turn, under the pretense of the purchase of wool, the Steppe Association concluded a number of contracts with commercial enterprises in the cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Nizhniy Tagil, stipulating a large interest fine for nonfulfillment of contractual conditions. Actually, fine penalties were a hidden form of payment of interest for credit received from the Steppe Association. The return of credit resources to the Steppe Commercial Bank was scheduled for 26 April 1993. In connection with the fact that, owing to the squandering of credit monetary resources, the Steppe Association and, consequently, the Steppe Commercial Bank as well, were unable to pay off the existing indebtedness by the indicated date, the date for the return of credits was postponed on Fomin's petition, without adequate grounds, until the end of 1993. The measures that were conducted exposed the selfish interests of a number of senior officials of organs of authority and administration in the receipt and use of favorable credit resources. In February of 1993, during registration of the San Corporation, a privately held joint-stock company with the rights of a trading house, the Rostekstil concern, its founder, acted as a juridical person and its president, B.M. Fomin--a holder of 15 shares of stock (7.5 percent) of the capital fund of the corporation--acted as one of its physical persons. K.N. Ilyumzhinov (president of the Republic of Kalmykia at the present time) was elected president of the San Corporation. For the purpose of extracting profits from the illegal use of credit resources, Ilyumzhinov opened the Steppe Commercial Bank in Elista, whose founder became the heads of commercial enterprises: the San Corporation, TOO [limited partnership] Kiminek, and the Sar firm, and B.M. Fomin became a member of the board of the bank. It should be noted that the capital fund of the Steppe Commercial Bank totaled R150 million, of which R100 million was money stolen earlier through false credit advice notes by S. B. Terloyev and L. Yuferev, managers of the commercial enterprises APKO [not further identified] Cosmos and AO [joint-stock company] Continent, which embezzled a grand total of more than R20 billion. Simultaneously with the opening of the Steppe Commercial Bank, Ilyumzhinov, also with Fomin's assistance, organized the Steppe Association, whose activity amounted to the accumulation and resale of substantial monetary resources at the expense of allocated state credit resources. At the present time, without conducting documentary inspections, it is impossible to determine the total damage caused the state by the illegal use of credits, and also the profit received by the Steppe Association. However, it is already known now that Ilyumzhinov and his circle, under the guise of purchasing wool, conducted a concealed conversion of monetary resources for a total sum of more than $7 billion with the subsequent placement of hard currency in the accounts of foreign firms, including R2.5 million to the personal account of a private person in the Republic of Poland. To the present time, the foreign partners have not fulfilled their obligations to deliver wool and food products, and they are continuing to use the currency for their personal purposes. It should be noted that the Aquarius System Interface joint-stock company (city of Moscow) whose manager, T.I. Gasanov, was the minister of industry in Ilyumzhinov's government, was involved in the conversion and transfer of hard currency to Poland. At the present time, a check is being made on the fact of delivery of industrial commodities to the Steppe Association from the Gender firm for the sum of $250,000 under the guise of humanitarian assistance. Citizen V. Dzhambinov, who is the deputy to the permanent representative of the president of Kalmykia under the president of Russia, participated in the receipt and sale of the goods in question. There are reasons to believe that the Gender firm purchased the "humanitarian" assistance in question for hard currency received earlier from Ilyumzhinov. Dzhambinov transferred the R95 million from the sale of the received commodities to the Steppe bank (to the current account of the Ilyumzhinov fund), and R40 million through false documents to the city of Moscow for the Tau firm. Preliminary analysis of available materials of financial-economic activity of the commercial enterprises under the control of Ilyumzhinov makes it possible to reach a conclusion concerning the lack of any kind of substantial monetary resources at his disposal to pay off the indebtedness for credit in the full amount, and, what is more, using them for the development of the republic's economy. [Signed] Minister V. Yerin From the editorial office: NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA have written more than once about K. Ilyumzhinov's "shady" funds and affairs. However, the president of Kalmykia, in dissolving the soviets, was useful to B.N. Yeltsin in the spring and summer of 1993. Now, after his demonstrative friendship with A. Rutskoy, and in view of the new strategy of the Kremlin ("Give back the sovereignty that you at one time gulped down"), Ilyumzhinov is being worked over. In the beginning, the criminal funds did not intimidate the president of the Russian Federation, and now, with their exposure, Ilyumzhinov can be "broken," which has been done. The editorial office has in its possession a number of documents with the very highest endorsements. We will acquaint the readers of NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA with them in the next few issues.
