This report summarizes a survey of more than 7,000 farm households nationwide by the Central Policy Research Center of the central government and the Ministry of Agriculture's Office of Rural Economy Fixed Observation Sites. It reflects the voice and desires of the peasantry from the first line of agricultural production, and as such is of great value to us in understanding and studying rural problems. Rural fixed observation sites were established a decade ago, in 1984. To understand the developmental situation and problems of the rural market system, during the first half of last year they undertook by random sample this special survey of "rural households and the market," among 7,012 rural households. Survey questionnaires and forms sent out totalled 636, and the same number were returned, so the survey was totally effective. Agricultural Production Is More Marketized Rural reform has pushed millions of peasants into the great tide of commercial economics, and many of these peasants have begun to operate in accordance with the market economy, regardless of pre-production decisions concerning what to produce or how much of it, as well as sales during and after sale. This is a sign of the further development of the agricultural production market. First, there has been fundamental implementation of the rights of farm families, and the effect of prices on production is becoming daily more obvious. According to the survey, 57.53 percent of the households surveyed thought that current production decisions were theirs to make (including what to produce, how much to produce, and how to produce); rural households have gradually adopted the principle of maximum benefit. Second, under the function of the price factor, the commercial rate of agricultural products has improved, while the personal use rate has declined. The survey showed that the overall commercialization rate of agricultural products was 54.49 percent. Third, there has been a steady decrease in the variety and volume of state-purchased products among agricultural products, while the rate of products sold directly to markets has continually increased. In 1992, among households surveyed, there were only two products for which the State purchased more than half of the total: cotton (70.95 percent) and tobacco (66.29 percent); grain occupied 48.45 percent, with the rest all sold in markets. In 1992, among all agricultural products sold by households surveyed, 31.31 percent were sold to state-owned commercial departments, 64.58 percent were sold by private individuals directly or indirectly into the market, and other parts were sold in other forms. Of the agricultural products sold, the accounts of 76.5 percent were settled on time, which means that nearly one-fourth were not settled on time. Fourth, rural households entering the market did not feel that connecting with the market was a comfortable experience. Their first problem was that, in a situation where the markets were opening up, they did not know what to produce, due to inconsistent information. This made it difficult to turn their produce into commodities. In 1992, among agricultural products of surveyed households, those products in which more than 10 percent of output had been stored up and were ready for sale were medicinal materials (30.1 percent), oranges (36.2 percent), gunny (30.1 percent), wood (17.4 percent), vegetable oils (14.8 percent), and corn (12.6 percent). This was caused by a supply and demand imbalance, so prices were too low. Second, administrative decrees under the planned economic system were still a constant occurrence, and the self operating rights of rural households have not really been implemented. There were 42.47 percent of rural households reporting some sort of administrative interference with their production. In the pre-production decisions on 19 out of 20 varieties of agricultural products (medicinal materials excepted), the decisions were still made on the basis of accomplishing government assignments. Third, there is a very low degree of organization of farmers going into circulation. There were very few rural households, only 4.6 percent, which participated in the operation and sale of agricultural products, a total of only 44 days engaging in transporting goods for sale. Therefore, although there was definite improvement in the degree of marketization degree of agricultural products, there was still a limited number of farmers engaged in operational activities, so an agricultural product price formulation system has not been genuinely established, and the market development of agricultural products needs to be perfected. Agricultural Products Are Generally Supplied By the Market Studies show that the majority of agricultural production materials required by surveyed households were purchased in the market, a change from the former situation of relying chiefly on the state and collective allocations. This is a considerable improvement from the process of market reliance. One, the majority of the supplies used in agricultural production are purchased in the market at a higher cost. In 1992, every family surveyed spent 765.24 yuan for farming supplies, of which 677.84 yuan was spent in the market at a negotiated price, which was 89.64 percent of the total expenditure; 78.4 yuan was the parity price expenditure, which was 10.36 percent of the total. Two, the farm supplies purchased at the parity price were insufficient, and quite often could not be supplied, so they played a lesser role in production as the conditions for completely relaxing the price grew more mature by the day. In 1992, parity price chemical fertilizer received by farmers constituted only 63.9 percent of the total supply, while parity price diesel fuel could not be fully supplied either. The survey showed that, at present, there are a growing number of departments which are involved in managing farm supplied, establishing a pattern of multi-channel circulation. In addition to supply and marketing cooperatives which both operate "connected" parity farm supplies and organize goods sources for sale at negotiated prices, departments which popularize agricultural technology manage farm supplies which are related to technology popularization and fee-based services. Community cooperatives and special cooperatives also organize goods sources to serve farm households, there are manufacturers which sell directly, private operators set up stalls to sell or deliver goods to the customer's door-step. Three, farmers' greatest objections are that the price of farm supplies is rising too rapidly, and that the market is flooded with poor quality, copied, or bogus products. There is a sharp contradiction between the supply and demand for farm supplies, while slow market development combined with imperfect management makes pricing and quality into flash point issues bringing many farmer complaints. When the surveyed households responded to a question concerning the "least satisfying thing about purchasing farm supplies", the ranking in order of was: high prices number one, poor product quality was second, and too many copied, bogus, and poor quality products was third. Looked at by category of product, besides the pricing problem, 34.8 percent of farming households mentioned bad quality seeds, 31.9 percent noted the large amount of copied, bogus, and poor quality pesticides, while 43.5 percent of farming households mentioned the lack of funds for buying farming machinery. Resolution of the agricultural materials supply problem demands supporting not only the development of the agricultural use industry, promoting a necessary balance between supply and sales of farm supplies, but also stressing price restructuring, further opening up of the market, encouraging multi-channel circulation under the conditions of strengthening macroscopic administration, and accelerating development of key elements of the market. [5 Jan p 1] [Text] Capital Is Starting To Flow, as "Glue" for Allocating Resources The survey of rural fixed observation spots shows that the single pattern of capital circulation has begun to change, with the objective of regulating surplus and resolving production capital. Multiple channels of capital circulation are emerging, but the capital market has not been established yet, and there are still contradictions between capital and supply, which restricts the development of production and economic growth. First, as capital circulation channels become pluralized, banks and credit unions face a challenge to their position as the chief channel, with personal loans between individuals surpassing the old timers. Based on the survey, in 1992 the average farm household had 422.57 yuan in loans for production, which was 21.46 percent of the cash outlay for family operational costs. Of farm households' total loan burden, 185.04 yuan of the debt came from banks and credit unions, or 43.79 percent; 10.15 yuan of the debt came from cooperative fund committees, which was 2.4 percent; and there were 215.86 yuan in personal loans, 51.08 percent, surpassing banks and credit unions to take over first place. Looking at different types of farm households, those totally engaged in farming had the smallest loan amount, only 16.16 percent of their household operational expenditure for the entire year; households totally engaged in non-farming pursuits had the largest loan amount, which was 37.74 percent of their operational expenditure for the entire year, in addition to private interest-free loans. This kind of phenomena shows that it has been the rise of non-agricultural industry that has brought on capital circulation, and a situation whereby capital regulation and circulation are no longer small-scale and mutually assisting, initiating a "market" tendency. Second, loan capital has been centered on the short term, with very little long-term lending, and most of the capital was put into non-agricultural industry. Looking at the investment direction of loan capital, most of it went into non-farming areas, and this constituted 63.5 percent of the total amount of farming households loan capital; 26.5 percent of the loans went into forestry, livestock, fishing, and commercial plants, with only 10.5 percent put into grain production. Different capital resources have different interest rate standards. This reflects the fact that floating interest rates do indeed exist in the countryside. Third, there is an outstanding contradiction between supply and demand, but as a practical matter the amount is not very big. The investigation showed that 64.1 percent of farming households felt the lack of capital for agricultural production, which makes it difficult for them to engage in expanded reproduction. Among farming households who lacked capital, 75.3 percent of them were willing to raise capital through loans. But in fact only 32.1 percent of farming households did so, which was 48.9 percent of farming households having a capital shortage. As resource allocation and the economic means of regulation have changed, capital has begun to flow as the "glue" of resource allocation. But the capital market has yet to be established in the countryside. To promote rural financial system reform, and enable limited capital to work more positively in rural resource allocation, we should permit pluralized growth and development while developing and perfecting major channels of finance and capital, strengthen administration in the process of development, and enlarge rural cooperative fund associations, bringing their mutual assistance function into play. A Slow Shift in Land-Use Rights Land functions as a special production element, its market formation signaled by shifting and flowing land-use rights, allowing its allocation to accord perfectly with benefit principles. For many years, along with the development of rural non-agricultural industry and the improvement in non-agricultural product degree of marketization, smashing the situation of land being isolated and sealed, there has appeared a shift in land-use rights. This also displays several new characteristics. First, land contracts are basically stable, with not many shifts in contractors. Based on the survey, since the implementation of the household responsibility system of linking remuneration to output, 63.9 percent of farming households have readjusted their contracted land, while 36.1 percent of farming households have never done so. Among sample households, 93.8 percent of farming households have not subcontracted their land, 4.2 percent of farming households subcontracted only part of their land, and 1.99 percent of farming households have subcontracted all of their land to others. Second, in the current phase, it is impossible for land-use rights to shift on a large scale, as these are restricted for the most part by society's safeguard functions. The survey shows that in grain production, which occupies most of the land area, production decisions are based primarily on the family's life requirements. Whether farm households subcontract their land largely depends on how much of a labor force the households have. Third, this shift in land-use rights is still in a spontaneous and disorderly situation, lacking regulated administration. Fourth, in a situation where the planting business brings fewer benefits, farming households are reluctant to put more land into operation. The survey shows that there are many features restricting shifts in land-use rights. In addition to the major role still played by the land's societal protection function, the original collective property rights are unclear; leaving the land means abandoning all that one has built up, while development of rural urbanization and township enterprises regional construction is also quite slow. To resolve the land problem, we must positively invigorate operation and usage rights under the precondition of maintaining collective ownership and stabilizing farming families' contractual rights. We should not only allow, but should also guide and regulate compensation for shifts in land-use rights, to bring about a perfect reorganization of the key elements of production. Circulation of the Labor Force Has Accelerated The survey of fixed observation sites shows that since the breakup of the old pattern in which the entire labor force was bound to the land, labor has started to flow among the various rural businesses and between urban areas and the countryside. Some farmers are now choosing their jobs based on their qualifications, their preferences, and the law of value. So we are just in the midst of cultivating a labor market. One, the fact that surpluses and shortages of labor force exist at the same time in industries, regions, and farming households makes it both possible and necessary to make adjustments between surplus and shortage and the circulation of labor. Based on research and estimates, the surplus labor force is about one-third to one-fourth of the average farming household's labor force; but meanwhile, about two-fifths of farming households are confronting shortages of labor in family operations in varying degrees. Among these, 4.5 percent of the households had labor shortages throughout the year, while 35.5 percent of the households had a shortage during the busiest farming season. In the production and operation of non-agricultural industries, the labor shortage problem was more urgent, with the total frequency reaching 40.8 percent. To meet the need of maintaining normal production operations, 30.8 percent of the families sampled hired help. Those who did not hire outside help despite having a labor shortage gave their inability to afford it as the reason. The rate for this was 62.2 percent. Second, as hiring of help increased, so did wages. Most of the outside hiring was done by non-agricultural industries. Non-agricultural industries accounted for 60.7 percent of the outside hiring in 1992, 24.1 percent by planting businesses (12.7 percent in grain production), and a very small part by forestry, fishing, and stock raising. Spurred by the economic benefits and lured by job openings, labor is shifting from undeveloped to developed regions. This trend became very clear when the households in the survey were divided along regional lines. The average hired help workdays in the eastern areas were 35 percent higher than in the inland areas, and 2.8 times again higher than in the west. Three, when the labor force flows on a smaller scale, with unstable employment, it requires wider channels for labor shifts, and the establishment and perfection of a labor market. Although at one time or another mid-level organizations in many places have seen the emergence of some sort of labor market with employment agencies, etc., these have all been in a preliminary status, and lacked organized leadership. There are many reasons for the backward development of a rural labor force market. Besides the poor qualifications of the labor force itself, being unsuited to the requirements of new job openings, even more important have been the restrictions of the economic development level and system. Two different types of resident registration systems have created a protective screen and barrier blocking the flow of labor between the cities and the rural areas. Township enterprises' situation of "leaving land doesn't mean leaving the countryside" also delays construction in small towns by restricting the labor force shift. The restricting elements listed above must be resolved in order to develop a rural labor force market. [6 Jan p 1] [Text] The change from a planned economy to a market economic system will by no means be successful in every instance, but will have to deal with complex and rapidly changing markets. There are various kinds of contradictions between the small-scale production of farming households and big markets, two of which are the low qualifications of the farmers and a lack of fundamental change in the role of government. Resolution of these problems requires persistence in opening and conscientious organization, in order to create better external circumstances for farmers going into the markets. One, the lower qualifications of farmers makes it difficult for them to match up with market economy requirements. Rural reform has pushed farmers to the primary position in the market economy, but whether they can swim freely in the ocean of the market economy will be determined to a very high degree by their qualifications. Looking at documents for different groups which indicate the labor force's educational level as one of the important indicators of farmers' qualifications, the educational level shows a positive relationship to family operational benefits. Looking at share of productive fixed assets (initial value), illiterate farming households are at 100, grade school level households at 122, junior high school level 116, and middle high school level 130; looking at gross income from family operations, illiterate households are still at 100, followed by the others in order at 110, 113, and 116 respectively. Among households surveyed, 13.8 percent of heads of household or those making production decisions were illiterate, 41.5 percent had a grade school education, 34.5 percent had a junior high school education, and 10.1 percent of them had a high school education. In addition, 11.5 percent of the farmers had special skills, and only 3.9 percent of the farmers had received professional education and training. A low educational level, combined with the affects of the traditional production economy and the old, planned economic system, has resulted in conservative thinking and narrow vision in a great many farmers. They are contented with slight financial improvements, they are afraid of risk and worry excessively, they do not know how to arrange production and operations activities, nor do they have any way of obtaining such information when they get into the market economy. They can deal with regular farming work only by traditional ways and their experiences, they do not understand market rules, they cannot take advantage of market regulations. The survey showed that quite a few farmers have only a dim understanding of marketing concepts, and very little of contractual concepts. There is a low rate of contracting and implementing contracts for the purchase and sale of agricultural products. In 1992, only 159 households of sampling households signed purchase and sales contracts, which was only 2.3 percent of the total number of families. Two, the small production scale of farming households and their low specialization level make it difficult for them to face the big markets. Based on the study, the average family had 4.76 people, a labor force of 2.63, farming 11.7 mu of land which was divided into 8.08 pieces, and at year's end owned 2,480 yuan of the initial value of production fixed capital. Among households surveyed, 57.5 were engaged completely in agriculture, 29.6 percent of the households engaged mostly in agriculture but with other businesses as well, 11.1 percent of households engaged mostly in non-agricultural business but in farming was well, 1.3 percent were involved completely in non-agricultural operations, and 1.5 percent were other. In this situation of small scale operations, the coexistence of self-supply and self-merchandising has brought production into the "small but complete" pattern, and led to a trend of holding different businesses, in order to deal with market risks. The activity of holding different businesses on a small scale must lead to small batch production, leaving them powerless to engage in market competition and lacking a negotiating position. Other than what they supply to themselves, very few of the farmers' products can go into the market for exchange. In a way, this is an exchange of surplus products: when the markets offer a good price, farmers sell more; when not, they take more for themselves, so they have no way of establishing a competitive advantage. This can be explained by the fact that completely agricultural households sell so many kinds of products. Among these totally agricultural operators, 33.5 percent sell one or two types of agricultural products, 14.6 percent sell three or four types, 16.5 percent sell more than five kinds of agricultural products, with the extreme example being the sale of 15 kinds of agricultural products. Meanwhile, trade methods have been unorganized and scattered, with very little organized sales or regulated trust sales, wholesale, or futures, so they were also in an unfavorable trading position in trade. Many of the self-operation rights received from production and operations are lost in market circulation. Three, the role of government has not really changed, macroscopic adjustment and control lack force, and there is no regular and perfected market environment for farming households entering the market. In the conflict that arises from the new old systems coexisting, one still often sees the administrative order of the old system, and farmers' self-operation rights in production have not been implemented completely. In some cases, farmers' rights to make their own decisions concerning what to plant have been replaced by administrative plans. The markets for certain products are often closed by administrative means. All these things have restricted farmers' activities in varying degrees. Construction of a market economic system is very imperfect, especially for that macroadjustment and control which are essential to a market economy. The foundations are lacking for a perfect system. First is the information foundation. In recent years, although relevant departments have attempted to improve the means of information transfer to promote development of a market economy, all their efforts have been far short of what is needed, regardless of whether it has been the quantity of information supply or how up-to-date or accurate; this has resulted in losses for producers. Some farmers have even gotten the idea that whatever the government encourages us to plant, that will be hard to sell; whatever the government restricts us from planting, that will sell well. In the situation of a market economy, vast numbers of farmers are thoroughly familiar with the principle of maximizing income. In addition, while budgetary restrictions are very efficient in household operations, extremely few farmers know what will earn them more money, so they urgently require "information guidance". Second is the facilities foundation. Constructing a market system for trade in agricultural products is delayed and backward, with even primary level trading markets for agricultural products trading markets having trouble attaining a satisfactory status. According to documents which classify the sampled households by their distance agricultural products trading markets, 30.1 percent of farming households' lived more than 20 km away from the markets, and 26.4 percent of farming households' lived more than 10 km from the markets. Under circumstances of inconvenient transportation and backward means transport, things are more difficult for farming households who live far from the markets. The shortage of storage facilities and poor means of processing have made agricultural products a "short leg", with most of them having to be sold locally. Third is the system foundation. Regulations and laws essential to the market economy are very imperfect: In some places there are no regulations to comply with, and especially in the countryside, those laws which do exist are not complied with. Most of the problems farmers encounter in shipping agricultural products and selling them are due to the imperfection of laws and system. Of the sampled farming households, 306 stated that the greatest difficulty they had in going into circulation was, first, that there were too many barriers, and the phenomenon of levying arbitrary charges was severe; second, poor social security made them lack a sense of security. These both involve legal construction. Many of the sampled households, when confronting the great wave of the market economy, summarized their desires in such sentences as this: What farmers want is to prosper; what they lack is the means to do it; what they are short of is capital; what is difficult for them is technology; what they worry about is marketing channels; what they expect is service. To remove the barriers for farmers going to market, from the standpoint of developing major entities for producing merchandize, there must be a rise in the farmers' own qualifications in education, technology, and merchandizing economics. From the standpoint of establishing a market economic system, the changeover from the old to the new system must be stepped up. There must be a change in the role of government, stronger macroadjustment and control, development of a production elements market, and a greater degree of opening in rural economic development. Comprehensive development of the rural economy must be shifted into the channel of a socialist market economy.
