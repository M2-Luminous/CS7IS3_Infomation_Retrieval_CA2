FR940819-1-00008 FR940819-1-00001 (1) The site must be located in an eligible area as defined in the program regulations under which the development is being funded or approved. (2) The proposal must comply with the applicable environmental laws, Executive Orders, and subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter. (b) Single Family Housing. In addition to the general requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, sites must provide a desirable, safe, functional, convenient, and attractive living environment for the residents, and insure long-term market demand and acceptability. (c) Multiple Family Housing. Multiple family housing projects shall be located in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (r) of ยง1944.215 of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter. Locating sites in less than desirable locations of the community or in close proximity to undesirable influences such as railroad tracks, cemeteries; adjacent to or behind commercial sites; bordering structures which are not decent, safe, or sanitary or a positive conducive influence on the proposed site; bordering sites which have potential environmental concerns such as processing plants, etc., is not acceptable. Screening such sites does not make them acceptable. Sites which are not an integral part of a residential community and do not have a reasonable access, either by location or terrain, to essential community facilities such as water, sewerage, schools, shopping, employment opportunities, medical facilities, etc., are equally not acceptable. ยง1924.107 Utilities. All development under this subpart must have adequate, economic, safe, energy efficient, dependable utilities with sufficient easements for installation and maintenance. (a) Water and wastewater disposal systems. (1) Single Family Housing. If sites are served by central water or sewer systems the systems must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. If sites have individual water or sewer systems they must meet the requirements for water and sewerage in Exhibit B, paragraphs V and VI of this subpart. Sites in subdivisions of more than 25 dwelling units on individual systems, or sites that do not meet the requirements of Exhibit B, paragraphs V and VI of this subpart, must have State Director concurrence. (2) Multiple Family Housing. Proposals processed under this paragraph shall be served by centrally owned and operated water and wastewater disposal systems unless this is determined to be economically or environmentally unfeasible. All central systems, whether they are public, community or private, shall meet the design requirements of the State Department of Health or other comparable reviewing and regulatory authority(ies). The regulatory authority(ies) will verify in writing that the water and wastewater systems are in compliance with the current provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act, respectively. (i) Sites which are not presently served by a central system, but are scheduled for tie-in to the central system within 2 years should have all lines installed during the initial construction. Such developments must have an approved interim water supply or wastewater disposal system installed capable of satisfactory service until the scheduled tie-in occurs. (ii) In addition to written assurance of compliance with State and local requirements, there must be assurance of continuous service at reasonable rates for central water and wastewater disposal systems. Public ownership is preferred whenever possible. In cases where interim facilities are installed pending extension or construction of permanent public services, the developer must assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the interim facility or establish an entity for its operation and maintenance which is acceptable to the local governing body. If a system is not or will not be publicly owned and operated, it must comply with one of the following: (A) Be an organization that meets the ownership and operating requirements for a water or wastewater disposal system that the Agency could finance under subpart A of part 1942 of this chapter or be dedicated to and accepted by such an organization. (B) Be an organization or individual that meets other acceptable methods of ownership and operation as outlined in HUD Handbook 4075.12, ``Ownership and Organization of Central Water and Sewerage Systems.'' The Agency should be assured that the organization has the right, in its sole discretion, to enforce the obligation of the operator of the water and/or sewerage systems to provide satisfactory continuous service at reasonable rates. The advice and assistance of the Regional Attorney should be obtained in preparing any necessary agreement with the organization or individual supplying water and/or sewerage systems. (C) Be adequately controlled as to rates and services by a public body (unit of Government or public services commission). (iii) When central systems are not available, the Agency will thoroughly evaluate the proposed individual systems for economic feasibility and potential impact on the environment. Information and guidance for evaluation and design of individual water and wastewater systems is contained in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publications ``Manual of Individual Water Supply Systems'' and ``Design Manual, Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems'', respectively. Developments of more than 25 dwelling units with individual systems must have the National Office concurrence. A request for concurrence must contain written recommendations and the following: (A) Information prepared by the local, county or State regulatory authority having jurisdiction indicating whether individual systems are feasible on the proposed sites. Supporting factual data should include evidence that clearly shows that individual systems will perform satisfactorily for a reasonable period of time with reasonable maintenance cost. Reasonable time and reasonable cost can be equated with the cost and expected life of a central system if one were available. (B) Supporting information for the proposed individual water systems, covering the following points: ( 1 ) Documentation of how individual water supplies can be developed with satisfactory water production at a reasonable cost. In areas where difficulty is anticipated in developing an acceptable water supply, the availability of a water supply will be determined before closing the loan.
