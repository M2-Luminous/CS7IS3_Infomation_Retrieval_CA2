Background The adoption of the State Underground Petroleum Environmental Response (SUPER) Act of 1986 set standard procedures for the State of Florida's Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and their Division of Waste Management's Bureau of Waste Cleanup to regulate during cleanup processes undertaken at all petroleum contamination sites. The SUPER Act was amended on February 20, 1990, and is currently referred to as Chapter 17&hyph;770, Petroleum Contamination Cleanup Criteria. Chapter 17&hyph;770 gives the FDEP authority over cleanup operations for areas which have been contaminated by fuels from petroleum storage systems. Chapter 17&hyph;770 also provides guidance for permittees in preparing initial remedial actions (IRA's), contamination assessment reports (CAR's), and remedial action plans (RAP's) while assessing and delineating areas where suspected petroleum contamination has occurred. In order to facilitate the authorization process for the potentially large number of permittees who would be required to discharge treated groundwater to surface waters of Florida, the FDEP requested that an NPDES general permit be issued to cover these facilities in Florida. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), after proposing a draft permit on August 25, 1988 (53 FR 32442), issued a final NPDES general permit on July 17, 1989 (54 FR 29986), to cover the facilities and similar types of discharges associated with them. This NPDES General Permit was modified on August 29, 1991 (56 FR 42736), to address general dewatering for uncontaminated discharges of produced groundwater and short term discharges from facilities with treated groundwater. This modification also changed the number of the permit from FLG040001 to FLG830000. As of June, 1994, EPA has authorized over 350 facilities to discharge under the general permit, and the FDEP estimates that there are over 20,000 facilities that have reported suspected petroleum leaks throughout the State of Florida. The current permit FLG83000 expired on July 16, 1994, and numerous facilities are either discharging under this permit or submitting Notices of Intent for coverage under this general permit. Therefore, EPA Region IV is proposing to reissue the NPDES General Permit No. FLG830000 to facilities in the State of Florida to assist in permitting these types of activities. The requirements for those facilities that were covered by the current NPDES General Permit before July 16, 1994, will be continued in force until reissuance of this general permit occurs. However, once reissuance occurs, all facilities covered by this permit will be required to submit a NOI requesting continued coverage under the reissued general permit within sixty (60) days after reissuance of the general permit. Permittees submitting NOI's after July 17, 1994, will not be provided with a notification of coverage under the general permit. These facilities will not be allowed to discharge until the date which the reissued NPDES General Permit, FLG830000, becomes effective, or until an individual permit is issued to the facility.
