We have just received a report that [word indistinct] is bombing. But we have also received a report that an order has been issued to the effect that air strikes should follow. Of course, we may again ask ourselves whether this will be the same kind of strike as we have seen hitherto. I am afraid that this is what is going to take place. As you can see, this agreement in the UN [words indistinct] we are talking about one thing, they are talking about another -- it is like that deaf telephone game -- we are talking about eliminating Serb artillery and chetnik tanks and equipment, while they are talking about one chetnik tank. They always talk along the lines of there being only one tank, which they are looking for and cannot find, and so on. Anyway, as far as I know, there is an order to act. What they are going to do, at the moment [words indistinct] but what I can say to the people of Gorazde at this really critical moment is this: I want to tell them that they are not alone, that we have been working throughout all these days and nights. Last night we adjourned our meeting at 0200. Today a series of meetings...[pauses] We have involved the world in this matter, at the moment the entire world is talking about Gorazde. Whether this will bring about any success to this town [words indistinct] I do not know yet. We talked to President Demirel, Turkey's president, an hour ago. [passage indistinct] to save the town. What is the most important thing, though, is that we must save ourselves in the first place. I would first call on the citizens not to succumb to panic. It seems there are elements of panic. Various reports, they are coming in every hour, every two hours, [words indistinct]. My impression is that there is panic in the town. There are cases of combat positions being abandoned. We will find out whether this was justified or not. We know that a huge force has been unleashed on Gorazde but the town can and must hold out. We were in such a situation here [word indistinct]. Two years later we started pushing them slowly back. They can take the town with a great deal of difficulty. If its defense is organized they cannot take the town. They would have to pay dearly for each house. Consequently, I would like to call on the people of Gorazde to restore their courage [words indistinct]. Let them know that the entire world supports them and, first of all, the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina supports them.
