Unfortunately, the smell of blooming trees in once picturesque towns and villages that have found themselves in a combat zone contrasts sharply with the almost apocalyptic horror of devastation. Blood brothers, Serbs and Croats, look at what you have done. Ruins, ruins, and ruins again. and this is a roadblock of the UN peace keeping force, UNHCR [as heard] for short. It controls a part of the territory between the self proclaimed republic of Serbia and Croatia. Had it not been for the blue helmets, the smoldering fire of war would have blazed here with renewed strength. A UN command post snuggled near a demolished church in the small town of (Pakrac), formerly a resort. The chief is Canadian. When asked whether it was dangerous here he said that while today the situation was relatively relaxed, a month ago it was very dangerous. Intense fighting took place at the local cemetery as well. Even the dead have no peace from the living, many of whom found their final resting place here. While touring the roads of former Yugoslavia, we managed to meet fighters of the Russian battalion, which serves under the UN aegis. There were 1,200 in the beginning, then a third was sent to Bosnia, to the long-suffering town of Sarajevo. These lads serve at the so-called checkpoints. [Begin recording][Lutskiy] Do shootings occur often? [Bessmertnykh] There are battles every day. [Kobzev] Our battalion lost two men this year, and 17 sustained injuries of varying extent. As to the situation, it is difficult to say how an immediate peace can be established here. There can be no talk about establishing immediate peace here. [end recording] The deputy battalion commander's opinion was also confirmed at the Russian Embassy in Croatia. [Begin Kerestedzhiyants recording] I want to emphasize that there is no side where you can plant both feet and say: This is just. [Points to a wall map of former Yugoslavia, with color coded division of forces displayed] The Serbs have no right to clean out Gorazde, which is home for 60,000 Muslims. These people have nowhere to go. The Muslims here also have no right to attack the Serbs because they are under UN protection and have been declared to be in a security zone. And a security zone implies lack of danger from within the zone first and foremost. General tension and readiness to continue is fairly high on all three sides. No one here is satisfied with the way things have been solved so far. [end recording] Politicians and servicemen are unsatisfied, but what about the common people, who are forced to abandon their homes and who find themselves in refugee camps? According to estimates of representatives of the UN high commissioner for refugees, who take care of the problems of dispossessed people -- housing, feeding and providing medical services for them -- more than 4 million people in the former Yugoslavia are in need of such services. However, even here in the camps life goes on, children feel at home here and play merrily, old people talk about their own affairs, and everyone is making plans for the future. This is Aleksandr Lutskiy reporting from Croatia for the "Utro" program.
