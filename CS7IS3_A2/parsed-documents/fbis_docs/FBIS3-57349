Here is an excerpt from that interview. [Begin Gagua recording] Our republic needs 23-24 million cubic meters of gas per day for the normal functioning of enterprises in winter. We still do not have the opportunity to buy gas in such quantities. Until today we were receiving 11.5-12.0 million cubic meters, which is about 45 percent of the demand. However, since we were not fulfilling contractual obligations -- as you know, all the gas comes from the Republic of Turkmenistan -- we received a harsh notice yesterday morning. It said that due to a failure to fulfill contractual obligations -- what they meant was the non-payment of a large debt in respect of a gas transit service -- the gas supply would be terminated at 1800 hours yesterday. This was followed by a message from Moscow. It was based on Turkmen information. The message was signed by a deputy chairman of the Russian joint stock company Gazprom, (Revizov). It said that at the request of Turkmenistan the gas supply to Georgia would be terminated at 1800 hours. You can easily imagine what the consequences would have been. We did our best to put off the implementation of such harsh sanctions. After intensive talks with our colleagues we reached an agreement with them that these sanctions would not be implemented. However, the supply of gas was sharply reduced. Yesterday morning we were getting up to 12 million cubic meters of gas a day, while now we are being supplied with 8.5-9.0 million. By a decision of the republic's deputy prime minister a government delegation has been set up and will fly, probably tomorrow, Sunday [23 January], to Turkmenistan for talks. We hope that this issue will be solved positively next week and that the supply of gas will be resumed at the pre-reduction level. [end recording]
