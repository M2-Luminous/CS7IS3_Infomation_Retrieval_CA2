Washington has in fact predicted no imminent breakthrough in the Israeli-Syrian peace talks even though it made sufficient hints to suggest that their bilateral negotiations have entered a new stage and could come to fruition later on. This suggests that enough progress was attained during the last trip by Christopher to warrant its continuation. It would naturally be unreasonable to presume that the secretary of state is coming back to the region on a wild goose chase. But, it must be remembered that Damascus has also made an issue of the fact that it is still on the U.S. list of countries sponsoring "terrorism" and has injected this matter into its contacts with Washington. Presumably this subject will figure highly on the Syrian leaders' talks with Christopher when he arrives in the Syrian capital Sunday. President Hafiz al-Asad cannot be expected to accommodate Washington on its efforts to energise the Syrian-Israeli track as long as his country is viewed and treated as some kind of terrorist state. Israel, on the other hand, seeks to know in advance the extent and scope of peace that Damascus would be willing to offer in return for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. In this vein, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has proposed a phased Israeli pullout stretching over eight to ten years in order to test the workability of the Syrian peace intentions. Rabin has yet to confirm or deny, however, that Israel would be willing to withdraw completely from the occupied Syrian territory at the end of the tunnel. President al-Asad insists, and rightly so, on receiving a clear commitment from Rabin that full withdrawal from the heights would be in the cards in return for normalisation of relations between the two countries. What this complex situation boils down to is similar to the vexing egg-and-chicken syndrome where one set of questions begs the other. This is where Christopher may help by attempting to offer simultaneous answers to concurrent questions. Bridging the gap between the two countries is still possible, and that, we guess, is why the secretary of state is coming back so soon to the region.
