In a communique issued in Santo Domingo, the PRD and the other seven small parties that supported Pena Gomez stated that "we are facing an electoral coup attempt perpetrated by the current government (of conservative President Joaquin Balaguer) through the distortion of the electoral process. The Dominican Republic held presidential, parliamentary, and municipal elections on 16 May in the presence of international observers. "Government officials, in an attempt to keep themselves in power, realizing that it is impossible for them to win the elections honestly, decided to corrupt the electoral process, because they know that it is difficult for them to achieve their goal through a direct coup d'etat or through military force, the communique stated. After insisting that Balaguer's Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) has resorted to "fraudulent attempts in the past," the PRD maintained that "on this occasion, the crisis acquired an unprecedented characteristic because the country's democratic order is at stake." The PRD and seven other parties said "the key is to preserve the representative system," and reaffirmed that [words indistinct] the PRD leaders announced last Friday, in the voice of Pena Gomez himself. Analysts think this could reportedly unleash an institutional crisis that would prevent Balaguer, should he be proclaimed winner, from ruling beginning on 16 August, the date scheduled for the change in government. Balaguer, an octogenarian who is virtually blind and has a 1 percent (30,000 vote) lead in the vote count, plans to start his seventh term in the presidency in the next four days. No winner in the presidential elections has yet been proclaimed because of the fraud charges, and the Central Electoral Board announced that it will start an investigation into alleged distortions in the voters list. Meanwhile, Pena Gomez announced he will start an international offensive to prove that his fraud charges are true.
