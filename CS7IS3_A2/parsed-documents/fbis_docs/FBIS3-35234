The source said in statements today that Libya condemns terrorism in all its forms and that it has cut off all relations with any groups that follow a course of violence instead of dialogue and peaceful negotiations. He denied the presence of Abu-Nidal's [Sabri al-Banna] group on Libyan territory. He also denied that any Libyan officials had met with any members or leaders belonging to Abu-Nidal's group recently. The Libyan source believes that raising Libya's name in relation to the assassination of the Jordanian diplomat, as some newspaper reports have done, is an attempt to sour Jordanian-Libyan relations, especially during this phase of peace. He stressed Libya's interest in its relations with Lebanon.
