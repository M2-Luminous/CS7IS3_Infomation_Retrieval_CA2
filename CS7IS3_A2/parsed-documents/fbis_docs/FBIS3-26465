The decision was made by the ruling Communist Party leadership since amending its radical development strategy for 1994 by putting greater emphasis on social stability. Chinese sources yesterday said concerned government departments under the cabinet were ordered to make all-out efforts to achieve the targets, which set both the annual economic growth and inflation rates under 10 percent. Following a crucial decision made by the Politburo to give social stability priority, the State Council amended its overall development plan to adhere to the strategic change made by the party's top policymaking body. China's senior party leaders, including party chief Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, vice-premiers Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua have--in their recent inspections to regions--urged local officials to follow Beijing's line. "Both the central ministries and regional governments were urged to pay close attention to the leadership's newly set strategy and to take the overall social and economic situation into consideration when working out their own strategies," an informed source said. "The overall target for economic growth and price increases should be reined in under one digit and should not go higher than 10 percent," the source said. The strategy rethink by the Politburo, first reported by The Hongkong Standard and confirmed by Jiang Zemin in a speech to non-Communist Party leaders over the weekend, decided to play down the emphasis on pace of economic growth and reform. Jiang, who is also Chinese president, said the Politburo had decided on a four-point principle for economic development this year, which said "to seize opportunities, deepen reforms, boost development and guarantee stability". The Politburo had late last year formulated a three-point strategy that read "to seize opportunities, deepen reforms and speed up development". The inclusion of guaranteeing social stability and the substitution of "speeding up development" by "boosting development" underlines a significant change of mind by the leadership. "It is not appropriate at this time to bring up the slogan of `speeding up the pace of reform and hastening economic development'," the source quoted a report as saying. The government has tried over the past year to strengthen macrocontrol over the national economy in order to address problems arising from the economic overheating. The report said Beijing had urged localities to implement the government policy to deepen reforms, while combating price increases under the call for "a continuous, faster and healthier economic development."
