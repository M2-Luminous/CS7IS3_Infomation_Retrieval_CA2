The conference considered several alternative solutions. The principal discussion centered on a political solution of the feasibility of beginning mining operations. The Deposit imeni Lomonosov is situated in an ecologically vulnerable area of the Arctic region with poor soils and powerful subterranean aquifer beds. The deposit's reserves are estimated at 130 million carats. The diamond content per metric ton of ore is approximately 0.6 carat, and about 50 percent of it is suitable for jewelry. The "Severalmaz" AO [Joint-Stock Company] was formed by government decision in 1992 to develop the Deposit imeni Lomonosov. The principal stockholders are the Arkhangelsk Oblast Property Fund (25 percent), "Arkhangelskgeologiya" (16 percent), and "Atomredmetzoloto" (16 percent). The "Severalmaz" AO submitted an application on 2 November 1992 to the Roskomnedra [Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources] for a license to develop the deposit. It took roughly a year in Moscow to coordinate the business plan, the financial report, the operation's ecological feasibility report, and other documents. In the opinion of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts, not one of the three alternatives for mining operations (See table) is ecologically irreproachable. There has been no final decision on the fate of the deposit thus far. This should have been reached at yesterday's Roskomdragmet conference, to which executives of the Roskomnedra, the Minprirody [Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources], the Arkhangelsk Administration, and the "Severalmaz" AO itself were invited. Inasmuch as Arkadiy Lechugin, cochairman of the commission on a tender to prospect in the seven areas containing diamonds in Arkhangelsk Oblast, was present at the conference in Moscow, we will report on the results of the bid (See KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 22 December) in tomorrow's issue. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Working Version of the TEO [Technical and Economic Feasibility] for Large--| |Scale Development of the Imeni Lomonosov Diamond Deposit | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Parameter |Underground Devel-|Open Development |Development by Co-| | |opment | |mbined Method | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total capital inv-|5.7 |5 |6 | |estment, in billi-| | | | |ons of dollars | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Period for deposi-|11 |9 |21 | |t's development, | | | | |in years | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Intensivity of op-|5 |5 |5 | |eration, in milli-| | | | |ons of metric ton-| | | | |s annually | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Period of deposit'|36 |28 |43 | |s operation, in y-| | | | |ears | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Degree of diamond |66 |60* |80* | |extraction from o-| | | | |re, in percent | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |* According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts. | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Diagram Showing Location of Kimberlite Pipes in the Diamond Deposit Imeni Lomonosov KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts believe that several alternative solutions could have been considered at the conference. The first one is the freezing of operations at the deposit, with the possible payment to the Arkhangelsk Administration of "compensation" from diamond-mining Yakutia. The second one is a recommendation to authorize the "Severalmaz" AO to undertake large-scale development. The third alternative is to advertise an international competition for the deposit. Finally, the most likely alternative is experimental-industrial development in the first stage (2 to 3 years) of two small pipes by two different technologies (an underground working and an open cut). As Leonid Gurevich, deputy chairman of the Roskomdragmet, told a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, the conference managed to "make substantial progress." In the opinion of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts, this means that the first alternative (freezing the deposit) was turned down.
