The Japanese authorities have revealed their intention to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council more than once. It is an unbiased view of the international community that Japan has no justification and elementary qualification to seat itself at a responsible post of the United Nations. It is ridiculous of Japan, a criminal state which provoked World War II, to seek UNSC permanent membership while having yet to atone for the unpardonable crimes and cleanse its dishonor as "enemy state" specified in the UN Charter. Moreover, it is a reckless act for Japan to seek permanent membership while being criticised by unbiased public opinion for its grave threat to peace and security in Asia and its obstructions to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula through the promotion of its nuclear armament on the pretext of the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. In trying to gain a permanent seat in the UNSC, Japan pursues the purpose of increasing its political say in the international arena, act a "leading state" and establish a "world order" militarily favorable for it. The Japanese reactionaries must discard the foolish daydream, liquidate its past first of all and immediately renounce their scheme to convert Japan into a military power and arm it with nuclear weapons.
