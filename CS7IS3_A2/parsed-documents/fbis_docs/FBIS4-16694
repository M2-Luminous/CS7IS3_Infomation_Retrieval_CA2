Those close to him say that, even during the days of defending Beirut against Israeli troops or during the siege of the Lebanese city of Tripoli by the Syrian Army, the Palestinian leader was never so worried as he is today. He has staked his all by agreeing to separate peace with Israel 13 September 1993. But after nine months of persistent talks, the results are very modest: Not a single one of the interim agreements has been observed. On 13 April 'Arafat was to have already installed himself, together with his administration, in Jericho, and the Israeli troops were to have left. Instead, I am talking to him in his same old modest office in Tunis in which everything was ready for the move three months ago. "Despite the fact that we are firmly maintaining our commitment to the peace process," 'Arafat stressed, "we are forced to point out the attempts by the Israeli side to delay and thwart the schedule for the implementation of agreements we have already reached." The Israeli Government's "free interpretation" of the signed agreements, whose quintessence is reflected by what Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said -- "For us there are no sacred deadlines" -- is putting the Palestinians out of countenance. It is this attitude by the Israeli Government that has allowed extremists on both sides to organize themselves and step up their joint offensive against the peace process, 'Arafat believes. That is possibly precisely why the Palestinian leader did not look too enthusiastic about the upcoming talks in Moscow. When asked whether he believes in the success of Russian endeavors to mediate between them and Premier Rabin, who is nowadays also preparing for his first official trip to Moscow, he answered laconically: "That would be highly desirable." "The first Soviet-Palestinian political contacts were made in 1968 when Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir took me to Moscow and presented me there," 'Arafat explained, smiling for the first time during the almost one-hour long interview, given on the eve of his trip to Moscow. "We were received by Brezhnev straight away." 'Arafat kept silent about what the Kremlin leaders discussed with the Palestinian nationalist-capitalist, but the main thing is obvious: The PLO received political and military support. But that is not the most surprising thing, nor is it how he managed to get on with all the general secretaries from Brezhnev to Gorbachev; the most surprising thing is how he managed to maintain good relations with Moscow even after August 1991. In the first few months after the failure of the putsch, he was counted among the "sworn enemies" of the new Russian democracy, together with Saddam Husayn, Kim Il-song, and Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, whereas today Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev flies to Tunis in order to give him an official invitation from Russian President Boris Yeltsin to visit Russia. Furthermore, the Russian minister is praising the "courage and political insight of the chairman of the PLO Executive Committee." 'Arafat is a realist and a pragmatist, who has studied the political machinations of the Near East thoroughly. He understands perfectly well that everyone can end up in a difficult position. Only a few know how to get out of them with honor. Suffice it to recall that, having expressed "moderate sympathy" for Iraq during the Gulf War, and having lost the support of rich sponsors in the Gulf, not to mention the United States and West Europe, 'Arafat was able to focus the attention of the international community, and primarily the "victorious" U.S. Administration of President Bush, on the fact that the smoldering Arab-Israeli conflict in the Near East would regularly provide this kind of setback if the process of a Near East settlement did not begin. To give the Palestinian leader his due, he has always tried to maintain the impression of the equal importance of the two powers sponsoring world talks in the Near East. At times you get the impression that he even plays up to Russia's desire to appear more important in the region than it actually is today. He tactfully left unanswered the question about who blocked Moscow's proposal to conduct a new "Madrid-2" multilateral meeting, although U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's letter, which demands that 'Arafat give up supporting any "unsanctioned" initiatives, is well known in diplomatic circles in the Tunisian capital. As for sending a Russian contingent to Palestine to protect the civilian population, then 'Arafat stressed that the presence of Russian observers in Palestine side by side with Americans is not only desirable, but even follows from the actual text of UN Security Council Resolution No. 904.
