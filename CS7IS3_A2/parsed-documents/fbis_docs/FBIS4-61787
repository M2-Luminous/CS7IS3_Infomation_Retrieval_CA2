According to information at the disposal of Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the Latvian bureau for monitoring the withdrawal of the Russian Army, 191 Russian Army units are stationed in Latvia at 247 military facilities. The timetable submitted by Russia includes 155 military units and formations, as well as command structures. Mr. Upmalis today explained that the formations of military facilities mentioned in the timetable and list submitted might include many separate military facilities. However, in this case it is impossible to define precisely the number of facilities and Army units included in the formations. According to Upmalis, it is planned during this week to assess the timetable submitted by Russia and to make a list of Army units which have not been included in the timetable. Then it is planned to submit the list to the command of the Northwestern Group of Russian Forces and the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
