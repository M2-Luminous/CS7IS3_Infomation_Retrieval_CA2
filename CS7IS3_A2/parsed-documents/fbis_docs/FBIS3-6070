The sixth working delegates' contact for the exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and the South was held in the South side area of Panmunjom on 12 March amid great expectations and interest of the people at home and abroad. The head of our sides' delegation made the following keynote statement regarding the contact: We had the sixth round of contact today with a keen awareness of the importance to the nation of the mission of the delegates of the two sides. The people at home and abroad are uneasy now about the prospects for the exchange of special envoys and are expressing deep worries over the continually slow progress of our working delegates' contact. Therefore, we think we should give good news to the people at home and abroad who are observing this contact by announcing a breakthrough in the present stalemate [kyochak sangtae] by joint efforts at today's contact, and would like to clarify our position. As your side is aware, the issue of exchanging top-level special envoys of the two sides was initiated by our side, and we have since made all sincere efforts to realize it. Our side initiated the proposal for the exchange of special envoys last year, from the ardent desire to truly improve and develop North-South relations, paying attention to your side's [South Korea] remarks -- as have already been reported -- that your side would place the nation at a foremost position and that no ally can be better than the nation after the launching of the civilian regime, expressing hopes for a meeting of top-level leaders at, for instance, Mt. Paektu or Mt. Halla or any place. If your side truly possessed the will to resolve all the important issues raised between the North and the South between fellow countrymen, hand in hand with the national position, and maintained the position to hold a meeting of top-level leaders, your side should have sincerely accepted our new proposal for the exchange of special envoys. Your side, however, suddenly changed the attitude you took in the initial stage of the launching of the regime and rejected our proposal for an envoy exchange by insisting on working talks on a lower level. Moreover, deviating from the national position, your side attempted to harm the fellow countrymen in cooperation with outside forces. Your side even went so far as to say that your side cannot shake hands with the dialogue partner with nuclear weapons, thus totally rejecting the envoy exchange. In fact, our nation consists of fellow countrymen connected with one blood lineage whether they live in the North or in the South. The fellow countrymen in these relations are conducting large-scale nuclear war exercises against the fellow countrymen and seeking an international alliance [kukje kongjo cheje]. What need and what good will this bring about for our nation? The North and South are fellow countrymen, not strangers, even though they have different ideas and systems. Dialogue between us should be dialogue for national interests, not dialogue for outside force, even though we have different views. Therefore, from a sincere attitude of giving priority to national dignity and interests and resolving all issues based on the principle of national independence, we sometimes gave advice to your side and criticized your side's unjust position and attitude, and at other times showed generosity and concessions and expected that your side would assume a national position and become an independent dialogue partner. Because we expected your side, just like our side tried to, would sincerely assume a national position and exchange special envoys for the sake of national interests, we demanded that your side discontinue all large-scale nuclear war exercises and abandon an international alliance. Moreover, we recently asked your side to cancel its plan to introduce Patriot missiles and its remarks that it cannot shake hands with those who have nuclear weapons. We did so not to pick a fight but to sincerely exchange special envoys and improve North-South relations in compliance with basic national interests. I think our sincere position has won deep sympathy from public opinion at home and abroad and sympathy and due support even from many people on your side. Because the exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and South is an important matter and because the missions of special envoys are urgent for the sake of national interests, correctly solving problems, which are stumbling blocks to the exchange of special envoys, is a pressing task that should be resolved on a priority basis. Our just proposal and position has not received a due response from your side for almost one year. We repeatedly expressed regret over this to your side, gave exhaustive, lengthy explanations and advice to your side, and patiently urged your side to agree on the contact for the exchange of special envoys. As a result, your side has today changed its course toward exchanging special envoys -- changing last year's opposition to the exchange of special envoys. Of course, your side's present attitude is still different from the position our side assumed when it proposed the exchange of special envoys. Your side has tried, first, to exchange special envoys to pursue its own interests. Under circumstances in which your side has accepted our proposal for the exchange of special envoys and has tried to exchange special envoys, no matter the reason your side may have done so, our side would like your side to clarify its position on a few matters. Your side must make clear, first, is that it is necessary for your side to admit that when we proposed the exchange of special envoys, you automatically [toponoko] opposed it. We acknowledge that your side must make this matter clear without fail for the successful exchange of special envoys. The second thing your side must make clear is that your side consistently opposed our side's proposal regarding the envoy exchange in the past. Our side had proposed to your side's former authorities when the first North-South dialogue started 20 years ago that the North-South summit should be held. Later, we have proposed on many occasions through official and unofficial channels that the North-South summit should take place. In particular, our side's special envoy visited Seoul in early April 1992 and invited your side's top-level leader to Pyongyang. At that time, heads of state and government and prominent figures of many countries came to Pyongyang and congratulated our respected and beloved leader on the occasion of his 80th birthday and had significant meetings with him. Your side, however, even though we are the same fellow countrymen, did not come to Pyongyang, turning down our special envoy's proposal and, as a result, the North-South summit failed to take place. However, we have never mentioned this. The reason we make this clear today is because we want to prevent the unpleasant past regarding the envoy exchange of the North and South from occurring again. Realizing the exchange of special envoys by the two sides and resolving all pending issues, including the issue on denuclearization, through discussions is the earnest desire of the nation. Such being the case, under any circumstances, the two sides should exert joint efforts to realize the envoy exchange from the view of being the same fellow countrymen. By so doing, we will prepare a starting point for North-South relations. Accordingly, if the two sides continue to debate over whether we cannot accept your proposal since it is yours or that you should accept this because it is ours by holding firm [choltaehwa] to its own position, as we did in today's contact, the opportunity for the envoy exchange, which was achieved with much effort, will never materialize again. Out of a such stance, we deeply studied and examined your side's proposals and remarks made during the last working-level contacts and a private meeting between the heads of both sides. Putting all accounts together, we reached the conclusion that your side suggested that the issues of giving up the international alliance and canceling all large-scale nuclear war exercises, which were put forth by our side, might be dealt with and resolved when special envoys are exchanged. Your side also said that the decision on suspending the 1994 Team Spirit joint military exercise had been made and more efforts should be concentrated, from the national view point, on the international alliance. Your side said the plan for the introduction of Patriot missiles had been shelved. Your side said it reversed its decision not to shake hands with those who have nuclear weapons because the situation had changed since the remark was made last June and because your side's top authority said later that the North had no nuclear weapons judging from information available. This position of your side, on the whole, is short of our expectations, but we would keep it in mind [kue yuuihagojo handa], as an expression of understanding the feasibility of the four demands we raised. Therefore, I would like to put forth the following constructive proposal as a momentous step to conclude the working delegates' contact today and exchange the top-level special envoys of the North and the South. First, I propose to take one momentous joint step to give the people at home and abroad a hope for the envoy exchange. For this step, we suggest that the North and the South promulgate at home and abroad in the form of a joint communique [kongdong podo] that the two sides reconfirm their intention to exchange top-level special envoys and have completely agreed to exchange the special envoys at an early date. If we issue this joint communique, we will be able to give great joy to the people at home and abroad, who are worried about the prospects of the envoy exchange, and it will be a manifestation that the delegates of our two sides are fulfilling their responsibility to the nation. Second, I propose that the two sides seriously discuss and bring to a conclusion the draft agreement on procedural matters that they have put forward in today's contact. In this connection, since our side has put forward a new counterproposal, fully taking into consideration the draft agreement that your side put forward during the previous contact, we think that the two sides can easily arrive at a settlement if we hold clause-by-clause discussions on it. We think there is no reason why your side should not accept our new proposal. As our side has shown broad-mindedness in the generous position to realize the envoy exchange urgently, it can be said that the early realization of the envoy exchange is entirely dependent upon your side's attitude. We express a hope that the top-level special envoys of the North and the South will travel between Pyongyang and Seoul at an early date as a result of your side positively responding to our sincere position. [end DPRK delegate statement] After the conclusion of the statement, the two sides began to discuss specific problems. Our side repeatedly urged the other side to take steps to announce to the nation in a joint communique that the two sides reconfirmed each other's intention of exchanging special envoys and agreed to realize it at an early date. The South side, however, refused to accept our side's proposal to take joint steps with unreasonable excuses and pretexts. The South side said that they can only issue a joint communique if the two sides agree on the working procedural matters as well, and made an absurd assertion that taking joint steps is meaningless. Refuting this assertion of the South side, our side questioned the reason for not issuing a joint communique on the two sides' agreement on the exchange of special envoys now that all suspicions have been dissolved -- the suspicion of the South side that the position of our side, which initially proposed the envoy exchange, for the envoy exchange is doubtful [pultumyong hadago]; and the suspicion of our side of the doubtful view of the South side, which obstructed the envoy exchange by laying four crossing gates [negaji chadanbongul mandulgo]. When the head of the delegation of our side asked the South side if it objects to the envoy exchange [tuksa kyohwanul haryonundenun tarungosi omnungarago murunde taehae], the South side said no. So our side stated that the intention of exchanging special envoys is reconfirmed. When our side asked the South side if it has a different opinion on the exchange of special envoys at an early date, the South side also said that it shares the same view of our side. So our side confirmed that the two sides share the same view on this matter as well, and asked under these circumstances why the two sides cannot issue a joint communique to inform the nation. However, the South side blindly opposed the issuance of a joint communique. Our side repeatedly questioned if we can brand the South side's attitude as their lack of intention to exchange special envoys and as its intention to delay the envoy exchange. However, the South side could not reply. Our side stressed again and again that there is no reason why the two sides cannot issue the communique now that the two sides have clearly confirmed the intention to exchange special envoys and shared the same view that the envoy exchange should be made at an early date. In addition, our side strongly asserted that under the circumstances in which a joint communique cannot be issued, the two sides should report it as each side considers appropriate. However, the South side said that it cannot do this, either. Our side said emphatically that we will report it in our own way [urinun uridaero podohalkosirago] irrespective of the South side's intention. During the contact, the working procedural matters were discussed for the envoy exchange. In the discussion of the working procedural matters, out of the 28 points of 13 articles contained in the draft agreements put forward by the two sides, they agreed in principle on all but four articles. In the discussion of the working procedural matters, the South side insisted on its unreasonable position and took a negative attitude toward the principled and important matters related to the tasks of the special envoys, such as adherence of the North and the South to the principle of national independence, confirmation of the way of national reunification, and the promotion of the great unity of the whole nation. Our side gave a logical and reasonable refutation to the South side's unjust assertion, repeatedly stressed the justness of our side's draft plan of working procedural matters, and hoped that the South side will take a position to bring about a turning point by coming to the next contact after making further study of our side's plan so that the two sides may affix their final signature to the draft agreements without fail. Then followed a tete-a-tete contact of the senior delegates of the two sides. It was agreed that the seventh working contact would be held at the Tongilgak in our side's area of Panmunjom on 16 March.
