About five hours after the beginning of the negotiations in Cologne, employers and representatives of the IG-Metall trade union separated. They agreed that there would be no sense in holding further negotiations, Norbert Wrobel, the head of the IG-Metall negotiation team, stated. He said that there was no rapprochement in the talks at all: "At the end we were where we had started in the morning. This also makes us angry." Wrobel blamed the employers for the failure of the talks. They had insisted on abolishing the vacation bonus, something that is not acceptable to IG-Metall. Asked whether a strike could still be avoided, the IG-Metall chief negotiator stated: "The signs are very bad." In the evening the IG-Metall Executive Committee planned to discuss further action. Deputy IG-Metall Chairman Walter Riester said that a regular strike must also be discussed. Hans-Friedel Schuhe, the leader of the employers' negotiators, also said that strikes must now be expected. He said that he is very angry about the suspension of the negotiations. IG-Metall refused to discuss many of the issues. Therefore, the important topic of the vacation bonus was not discussed at all. Since IG-Metall refuses to discuss any reduction of the vacation bonus, there is no basis for deliberations. IG-Metall continued to "refuse the necessary measures to reduce costs." IG-Metall demanded wage and salary increases of 5.5 percent. The employers, on the other hand, wanted to enforce a zero round for wages and salaries and, at the same time, reduce personnel costs by 10 percent by abolishing the vacation bonus and collectively agreed vacation regulations.
