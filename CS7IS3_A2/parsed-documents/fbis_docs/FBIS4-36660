He told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone from Abu Dhabi that 30 Jordanian military air engineers are equipping Northern U.S.-made F-5 fighter aircraft with spare parts -- "which has helped to restore their combat-readiness, thus enabling them to participate in recent battles." Al-Asnaj said that "the DRY authorities are investigating this involvement with the Jordanian quarters concerned and with a number of Arab states, on the grounds that this involvement is one of the factors contributing to escalating the war." It is worth mentioning that a high-ranking Western diplomatic source, who asked to remain anonymous, told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that "some reports say that Yemen is obtaining arms from Russia." The sources added that "Jordan may be the channel through which the arms are imported for Sanaa." Al-Asnaj pointed out that Northern aircraft, which have resumed their attacks recently, "are bombing civilian targets in the Aden suburbs." He stressed that "the DRY will cooperate with any measures taken by the Security Council to secure a cease-fire, and may apply to the Council again if [UN secretary general's envoy Lakhdar] Brahimi's mission fails."
