According to Olechowski the delayed signing of the documents testifies to poor economic relations between the two countries. The ministers also discussed international issues. Stanislav Daskalov also met with President Lech Walesa to discuss cooperation between the two countries. "For many years we used to be in one political and economic camp so certain ties and cooperation were established. Now, when we are reforming our countries, I think that we should return to some questions," the president told the Bulgarian guest. According to Walesa, Poland and Bulgaria should make joint efforts to create the vision of the new Europe. Daskalov said that Poland and Bulgaria have common goals--the integration with the European communities. He also conveyed the invitation of President Zelyu Zelev for Lech Walesa to visit Bulgaria. The Bulgarian guest and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak discussed problems connected with the development of Polish-Bulgarian economic and trade contacts, including the liquidation of trade barriers and the establishing of free trade zones. The two sides stressed that efforts to integrate with Europe should not replace bilateral agreements. Pawlak stressed that the boosting of economic cooperation between Poland and Bulgaria would allow to overcome obstacles which had existed in contacts between the two countries in the past. Minister Daskalov stressed that Bulgaria will continue to repay its debt to Poland with deliveries of goods. He added that there are chances for the debt being settled later this year. "Our economies are complementary," said Daskalov. The prime minister and the visiting Bulgarian foreign minister also touched upon the questions of Macedonia and the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. In another development, Daskalov met with under-secretary of state at the ministry for foreign economic relations Maciej Lesny to discuss the opportunities to boost economic cooperation between the two countries. Later in the day, Minister Daskalov met with deputy Senate speaker Zofia Kuratowska to touch upon the questions of European integration and adjusting Polish and Bulgarian legislations to the European Union standards.
