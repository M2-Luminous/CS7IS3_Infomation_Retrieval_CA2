In 1993 they received 38,656 first-and-second trial cases of crimes as well as of civil, economic, and administrative disputes, which showed a 4.15 percent increase over 1992. They tried and wound up 38,656 cases, which showed a 4.26 percent increase over 1992. They handled 77,978 cases of petition letters and visits written and paid by the masses. While successfully conducting the administration of justice, they further enhanced their sense of initiatively rendering services and continuously paved the new ways of serving the reform and economic construction. Through the administration of justice and their initiative service they made positive contributions to safeguarding the municipality's stability; promoting the deep-going development of the anticorruption struggle; protecting the legal rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations; ensuring the enforcement of the state macroeconomic readjustment and control; and promoting the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction. 1. We Dealt Strict Blows at the Criminal Elements Who Had Seriously Endangered the Social Peace; Strictly Punished the Criminal Elements Who Had Damaged the Economy; and Created a Fine Social Environment for Reform, Opening Up, and Economic Construction. In 1993 the people's courts at all levels throughout the municipality received 5,581 first-trial cases that showed an 11.13 percent increase over 1992. Of these cases, those of serious and appalling crimes showed a 16.02 percent increase over 1992. They tried and wound up 5,552 first-trial cases that showed a 10.4 percent increase over 1992. Of 5,843 criminals whose cases were tried in the year, 5,800 were announced guilty and accounted for 99.26 percent in the total, showing a 2.7 percent increase over 1992. Of these tried criminals, those who were sentenced to more than five-year imprisonment, life imprisonment, and death penalty (including probation) accounted for 28.63 percent in the total; those who were sentenced to less than five-year imprisonment, reform, surveillance, and probation accounted for 68.89 percent; and those who were exempted from criminal punishment accounted for 1.74 percent. A. We deeply carried out the struggle of "dealing strict blows at crimes" and made out-all efforts to safeguard the social stability. The broad masses of cadres and policemen of the people's courts at all levels across the municipality further enhanced their sense of dealing strict blows at crimes and deeply carried out the struggle against crimes. They emphatically handled the serious and appalling criminal cases that had seriously endangered the social peace. In particular, they persistently joined in advance in the investigations of serious and appalling criminal cases of murder, hold-up, rape, heavy harm, gangsters, and arson, which were bitterly hated by the masses. They carefully examined these cases as well as tried and wound up them rapidly. They also resolutely, heavily, and rapidly punished in line with the law the criminal elements whose crimes were very serious. They resolutely gave heavy judgment or death penalty to criminals who deserved to receive. Thus, they reinforced the dynamics of dealing blows at crimes and continuously maintained the trend of "dealing strict blows at crimes". They tried and wound up 2,695 criminal cases that exerted serious influence to the society and effectively punctured the arrogance of criminal elements. In line with the prominent problems of public security, they actively carried out the specialized struggles and concentratedly dealt blows at robbery and the damage of electric equipment. They earnestly implemented the "decisions" adopted by the municipal people's congress standing committee with regard to banning narcotics; punishing the criminal elements of smuggling, making, and trafficking in obscene things; banning prostitution and going whoring; and strictly punishing the criminal elements of abducting women and children. They also jointly with the relevant departments actively carried out the struggle against "pornographic things" and "six vices" as well as tried and wound up 64 cases of luring and sheltering women for prostitution, making and trafficking in obscene things, participating in gambling, abducting and trafficking in human beings, and trafficking in narcotics. They created a fine social environment for reform, opening up, and the establishment of socialist market economic systems. B. We strictly punished economic crimes, attended to trying major and appalling cases, and promoted the deepening of anticorruption struggle. People's courts at all levels across the municipality continued to deal strict blows to criminal activities that seriously disrupted the economy in line with the law and gave priority to punishing criminal activities concerning state functionaries who took advantage of their posts to engage in corruption, bribery, misappropriation of public funds, production and marketing of fake and inferior commodities, tax evasion, refusing to pay taxes, and other activities that damaged the prestige of the party and the state and disrupted the socialist market economic order. In line with the guidelines of the central directive on handling major and appalling cases well, we prominently grasped the handling of major and appalling cases well. We accepted 357 economic criminal cases each involving an illicit sum of over 10,000 yuan, accounting for 35.9 percent of the total number of economic criminal cases, and recovered 6.8 million yuan in economic losses for the state and the collectives. Regarding serious economic criminals, we upheld the principle of punishing them strictly in line with law. Of these economic criminals, 30.41 percent were sentenced to more than five years of imprisonment, life imprisonment, and capital punishment (including death sentence with temporary suspension of the execution), an increase of 9.41 percentage point over the previous year. Courts at all levels across the municipality upheld the principle of "first be resolute and second be careful and accurate," strictly handled cases in line with facts and evidences, applied suitable law to the cases, conscientiously studied and understood the state promulgated law and regulations on economic construction and the party's relevant policies on the establishment of the socialist economic structure, strictly distinguished between the limit between economic crimes and miscalculations in economic activities, and properly handled the relationship between dealing blows and protection; strictly distinguished between the limit between economic crimes and ordinary economic law-breaking acts; and properly handled the relationship between dealing blows and education. Meanwhile, they provided economic criminal clues for public security and procuratorial departments which they had discovered in the course of economic trials. In order to expand the social effect in handling cases, courts at all levels across the municipality extensively conducted propaganda on the legal system through public trials, meting out punishment in the public, and reporting by the press media. Since last August, the municipal intermediate and higher people's courts successively tried and meted out sentence for the case of Yu Zuomin of Daqiuzhuang in Jinghai County, and the corruption case of Hu Fengming, former manager of Guomin Hotel, and a number of cases that brought a great influence to the people. Particularly, the handling of the case of Yu Zuomin caused strong repercussions in society, showed the decision and acts of the party and the people's government in strengthening the legal system and fighting corruption, promoted the in-depth and sound development of the anticorruption, and received a good comment from all social sectors. C. We actively participated in comprehensive management of public security and succeeded in preventing and reducing crime. People's courts at all levels across the municipality conscientiously upheld the principle of "giving simultaneous attention to dealing blows to criminals, preventing crimes, and taking temporary and permanent measures for solution," and paid attention to the comprehensive management of public security in the course of giving trials. While actively conducting the struggle to "deal strict blows to criminals," they actively coordinated with relevant departments to manage some areas where public order was chaotic, selected some typic cases with educational significance, and conducted open trials in places where the cases occurred in an effort to expand the results of handling cases. They held 315 public trials on various sorts of cases, concentrated efforts on meting out sentences for 908 criminals, and allowed 7,904,800 people to listen to the trials, thus effectively dealing blows to and frightening the criminals and inspiring the masses of people to struggle against criminal acts. We continued to strengthen juvenile court work, unceasingly improved the method of "educating juvenile delinquents in the course of trials and integrating punishment with education," further implemented the measures aiming at helping and educating delinquents, and saved a great number of misguided youths. We paid attention to education on implementing legal policies before, during and after the trials, on admitting the crimes and serving the sentence, on urging delinquents to receive transformation, and on tracking their acts. We handled 2,572 cases on reducing sentences and releasing criminals on probation in line with the law, and succeeded in promoting education and transformation of criminals held in custody. We did a good job in helping, educating, and examining criminals whose sentences were temporarily suspended and their punishments were exempted or reduced, and who were released on probation, and succeeded in preventing criminals from committing new crimes again and reducing the number of such cases. Suggestions for conducing judicial work were actively encouraged. Over the past year, 452 suggestions for judicial work were proposed, 41 percent of which were accepted, and these suggestions yielded fairly good social effect. 2. We Strenuously Strengthened Economic Trials and Actively Served the State Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Policy and the Development of the Socialist Market Economy The people's courts across the municipality accepted 6,248 cases on economic disputes for first trial, an increase of 29.7 percent; the lawsuits involved a total sum of 1,047,120,000 yuan, an increase of 169.92 percent over the previous year. People's courts at all levels across the municipality proceeded their work from guaranteeing the smooth implementation of the state macroeconomic regulation and control policy and the establishment and normal operation of the market economic structure and made special efforts to strengthen the trial of the following few kinds of cases: A. They carefully handled all sorts of cases emerged in the course of changing the planned economic system into the market economic system. The tried and concluded 184 cases on enterprise bankruptcy, enterprise contracted and leasing operation, enterprise cooperative management, and enterprise amalgamation emerged in the course of changing the operational mechanism. B. They conscientiously tried all sorts of cases emerged in the process of cultivating the socialist markets. They tried and concluded 3,262 cases on purchase and marketing contracts, bill disputes, and infringement on patent and trademarks, and at the same time, actively and carefully tried cases of a new type, such as cases on disputes concerning futures trade and listing stock in other localities. C. They promptly handled all sorts of economic disputes emerged in the course of strengthening the state macroeconomic regulation and control policy. Primarily, they coordinated with the state to rectify the financial order, strengthened the trial of cases on bank loans, and concluded 415 cases on loan contract disputes, and recovered 40 million yuan in overdue loans for the financial departments in line with the law. They conscientiously tried 121 cases on contract disputes of construction projects occurred when the state curtailed the capital construction funds, and coordinated with the government to readjust the capital construction items. D. They actively tried all kinds of cases related to the development of the rural economy. They properly tried cases on rural contract disputes and safeguarded the responsibility system with the family-based output-related contract responsibility system as the mainstay. Meanwhile, they promptly tried cases on economic disputes involving township enterprises and promoted the development of the rural economy. E. We fairly tried and handled cases on maritime affairs and maritime businesses. Last year, we tried and handled a total of 136 cases of this kind, an increase of 183.33 percent over the previous year. Cases involving foreign countries, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan accounted for 35.29 percent of this. As a result, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese and foreign parties concerned were protected and opening up and international economic and trade development were promoted. In the course of improving the trial of economic cases, people's courts at all levels continuously expanded their service for reform, opening up, and economic construction. First, economic dispute mediation centers were established. Economic dispute mediation centers were set up at various grass-roots courts in the municipality, the municipal intermediate people's court, and the municipal maritime affairs court. In line with the demands of the Supreme People's Court, and within the scope stipulated by laws, these centers provided mediation to economic disputes before disputes were brought to lawsuits by following the principle of "being simple, flexible, rapid, and efficient." As a result, economic disputes were resolved rapidly. Last year, economic dispute mediation centers throughout the municipality received a total of 2,100 cases, of which, 1,500 were concluded. Through these cases, 150 million yuan worth of economic losses were retrieved for enterprises. The average time to conclude a case of this kind was one month, and some of these cases were concluded within only several hours. Second, help was provided to enterprises to clear debts according to laws. In light of the problem in which some state-owned enterprises and township enterprises in the municipality were unable to clear receivable debts and thus seriously affected economic development, many courts positively launched the special service activities of helping enterprises clear receivable debts, thus promoting the development of enterprises. Third, the joint activity of building the legal system was tried. We actively launched the activities of building the legal system together with some enterprises, positively propagated policies and laws, guided enterprises to mediate disputes, and helped enterprises perfect contracts, establish regulations and systems, and train legal professionals to handle cases according to laws. At the same time, enterprises also supervised law enforcement of courts, thus helping raise the law enforcement level of courts. Fourth, the contacts between courts and economic management departments were strengthened. The municipal higher people's court established the economic dispute coordination office together with the municipal economic development and coordinated in a timely and appropriate manner, 40 cases that emerged suddenly due to the forced freeze and transfer of enterprises' funds on accounts by the courts of other localities. The municipal higher people's court also received and handled 228 disputes and cases of various categories, involving 120 million yuan. 3. We Positively Conducted the Trial of Civil and Administrative Cases, Protected Legitimate Rights and Interests of Citizens and Legal Entities, and Supervised and Safeguarded Administrative Organs To Do Administrative Work According to Laws People's courts at all levels in the municipality received and handled a total of 23,070 civil cases of the first ruling, of which, 23,304 were concluded. With the implementation of the "General Principles for Civil Code of the PRC" and the "Law on Civil Procedures" as the central task, people's courts at all levels in the municipality comprehensively enforced the laws and policies on civil affairs, improved the methods of trying civil cases, and laid emphasis on trying the cases in the following aspects: They concluded the trying of 2,571 cases on real estate, 3,026 cases on debts payable, and 36 cases on labor disputes that were closely related to economic construction and the development of market economy, thus promoting the establishment and development of real estate, banking, and labor service markets. Second, we meticulously tried and handled 11,857 cases on matrimonial and family disputes and protected the legitimate rights and interests of old people, women, and children, thus making many families more harmonious. Third, we appropriately handled 2,498 cases on damage compensation, land, and irrigation works, safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of the persons concerned, and imposed sanctions upon the behaviors running counter to civil laws, thus promoting unity and stability and the building of the socialist spiritual civilization. Fourth, we continuously improved the forms to trying cases and gave full play to the role of persons concerned in providing evidence. Some people's courts also tried out the methods of "separating complicated cases from simple ones" and "opening court sessions directly," thus improving the quality and efficiency in trying cases. Some people's courts established real estate trying tribunals to resolve complicated or difficult real estate cases in a correct and timely manner. Fifth, we strengthened the work concerning the grass-roots people's courts and newly established six people's tribunals, so that the total number of people's tribunals throughout the municipality reaching 208. The vast numbers of cadres and policemen of people's tribunals fearlessly and persistently went down to rural areas, plants, and even households to handle cases on the spot, thus providing convenience for the masses to take legal proceedings. These cadres and policemen also positively guided the grass-roots units to regulate and organize work, thus resolving many contradictions and disputes of the grass-roots units in a timely manner. People's courts at all levels in the municipality positively and prudently tried administrative cases. Last year, we received and tried 161 administrative cases of the first ruling, a drop of 2.43 percent from the previous year, and concluded the trying of 161 cases. Of these cases, 39.75 percent had the specific administrative behaviors of administrative organs maintained according to laws, 15.5 percent had their original penalty and court decisions canceled or changed, and 31.68 percent had their lawsuits withdrawn by persons concerned. As a result, the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal entities, and other organizations were protected according to laws, the execution of functions and powers by administrative organs were supported and supervised, and the building of democracy and the legal system was promoted. In the course of trying cases, we vigorously conducted the administrative execution work. Based on the large scale and heavy task of rebuilding Tianjin's dangerous houses, which gave rise to more administrative disputes, some people's courts voluntarily went deep to real estate management and urban construction departments to conduct investigation and study and offer legal consultations and suggestions for key house rebuilding projects. People's courts also transferred some judicial personnel to the worksites of relocation projects to accept and handle the enforcement cases registered by administrative organs, and to resolve the problems existing in the administrative enforcement cases so as to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the relocated people and ensure the smooth progress of key house rebuilding projects. 4. We Actually Strengthened the Work of Lodging Lawsuits, Appeal Against Legal Decisions, and Execution of Legal Decisions, Thus Safeguarding the Fairness and Dignity of the Law People's courts at all levels in the municipality positively and boldly accepted and tried all kinds of new cases emerging in the development process of reform, opening up, and economic development and actually protected the concerned persons' rights to bring lawsuits against others and to appeal against legal decisions. We appropriately handled the disputes that tended to cause disturbances and that were revealed by the masses. We patiently attended to the work of persuasion and education, thus resolving contradictions and calming down incidents. Last year, we handled a total of 53,674 petitions from the masses and mediated and handled 464 simple disputes. We strengthened the functional role of judicial and supervisory departments, persisted in the principles of seeking truth from facts and correcting whatever was wrong. We conscientiously handled cases of appeal, maintained according to laws the cases whose original judgment was right, and corrected according to laws the cases whose original judgment was wrong. Last year, we concluded the trying of 1,520 appealing cases of various kinds, of which, 101 had their judgment changed completely or partially. As a result, the fairness and dignity of laws were safeguarded. For those who unjustifiably kept appealing against court decisions, patient persuasion was given them to withdraw appeals and accept court decisions. We voluntarily invited people's congress deputies and members of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference committees to attend court sessions as visitors and to inspect cases. We also listened to their opinions with an open mind and consciously accepted the supervision by the masses. In order to overcome the "difficulties" encountered in the implementation of court judgments, the people's courts at all levels across the municipality adopted powerful measures to improve the implementation methods and to expand the implementation ways by proceeding from having people's courts serve economic construction. The municipal higher people's court established the tribunal last year in charge of implementing the court judgment, thus, it straightened out the relationship between higher and lower people's courts in the work of implementing the court judgment and enhanced the guidance and harmony over the implementation work. As for cases that exerted great influence and encountered great interference and difficulties in the implementation, these people's courts asked for instruction and reported them in a timely manner to the municipal party committee and the municipal people's congress as well as kept the municipal people's government informed of them in order to enhance the contacts with various circles and to obtain their understanding and support. The people's courts in some districts and counties actively launched a "campaign" in this regard and emphatically enhanced the work of handling the long-standing discrepancies in old cases that involved multiple links and faced great difficulties. By fostering the concept of taking the whole situation into consideration, they assisted outside people's courts to handle 94 cases. They also upheld the civilized implementation in this regard, put emphasis on the style and method of implementation, overcame and resisted local protectionism, and emphasized that no one is allowed to regard the withholding of hostages as a measure in implementation. The municipal higher people's court adequately mediated and handled 10 incidents in which outside people's courts came to the municipality to deal with their cases by withholding the hostage. It also actively handled the incidents in which the cadres of the municipal people's courts were scolded and beaten in the implementation work or in taking legal proceedings. Thus, it dealt blows at the criminal activities that impaired the performance of official duties by upholding and promoting justice. Through the arduous efforts made by the broad masses of implementing personnel, the municipality received 5,951 cases in this regard in the year and handled and concluded 5,998 cases to show a 3.54 percent increase over 1992. It recovered 42,514,800 yuan in funds involved in these cases. 5. We Strived To Be the First-Class Court of the Country and Further Enhanced the Work of Self Reform and Improvement A. We made efforts to strive to be the first-class court of the country. The municipal higher people's court put forward the fighting target of "striving to be a first-class court in the country through efforts in the next five years," at the forum of presidents of people's courts across the municipality last year. Thus, it unified the ideology and understanding of leading cadres at all levels and of the broad masses of cadres and policemen. Thus, a new situation in which all courts were learning from the advanced, finding out their gap, and vigorously catching up with the advanced, gradually took shape in the year. B. We enhanced the construction of leading bodies. The leading bodies of people's courts at all levels across the municipality were generally reinforced and consolidated. A large number of cadres who are in the prime of life, have both ability and political integrity, and possess higher cultural standards, were selected and promoted to the leading posts of people's courts at all levels. The municipality vigorously grasped the improvement of work style and ideology among the leading bodies at all levels, upheld the democratic centralism, defined the duties among the staffers of leading bodies, enhanced the unity among the leading bodies, and upgraded their fighting strength. C. We enhanced the reform in the systems of personnel affairs management. In selecting and employing cadres, the municipality paid attention to gradually introducing the competition and encouragement mechanism in this regard and actively explored the systems of personnel affairs management, in which cadres are capable of both higher and lower posts and the survival of cadres will be of the fittest. It also upheld the principle of integrating the material interest with the administrative achievements and contributions of cadres and policemen and formulated the adequate criterion of appraising achievements and the methods of awarding and punishing personnel. All of these played an active role in awarding the superior, punishing the inferior, and arousing enthusiasm. D. The construction of contingents focused on improving administrative honesty was strengthened. The education on improvement of administrative honesty was vigorously strengthened. According to the central discipline inspection commission's five regulations on leading cadres' administrative honesty and self-discipline and the supreme people's court's circular on strengthening the improvement of administrative honesty, we worked out and perfected the measures and systems for improvement of administrative honesty, concentrated efforts on consolidating the problems of establishing personnel contacts cropping up in the course of handling cases, generally examined the enforcement of laws and disciplines, and realistically solved the problems of not strictly enforcing laws. We strictly investigated and handled 14 cases of 15 court cadres violating laws and disciplines and actively corrected the practice of accepting bail for probation. To stop producing new corrosive phenomena and unhealthy practices, the municipal higher court worked out and revised "several regulations on leading cadres at various levels opposing corruption and advocating administrative honesty" and "the system of responsibility for the wrong handling of cases." The number 1 criminal court that won the collective merit citation as well as some advanced examples in doing solid and arduous work and making selfless sacrifice, including the national court model Liu Shanlin, were commended in a timely manner. E. The improvement of professional ability and standardizations was strengthened. Eleven training classes for more than 800 cadres and policemen were organized. Through vigorous investigation and study, a preliminary investigation and study network was set up in the municipal court department. More than 50 reports on investigation and study findings were applied by the state science and technology commission, the supreme court, the leading organs under the municipal party committee, and relevant publications. The study on the new situation and new problems relating to the judicial work was strengthened. The municipal higher court convened 20 symposiums of various types and worked out 13 documents guiding the judicial work. In the past year, although the people's courts at various levels across the municipality made appropriate achievements, some problems still remained. The major indicators were that some leading cadres and judicial personnel were not suitable to the development of the socialist market economic system in terms of their understanding and law enforcement levels. Some cases were not handled in a high quality manner and longer periods of time were spent on hearing some cases. The new categories of cases and the new situation cropping up in the course of developing the socialist market economy were not extensively investigated and studied. Some weak links in the management of contingents and the improvement of administrative honesty still existed. The cadres and policemen's political integrity and professional abilities needed to be further improved. These problems should conscientiously be solved and improved in the future. Fellow deputies: Along with the setup of the socialist market economic system and the socialist legal system, a large number of new laws will be formulated this year. There will be increasingly more cases to be directly heard by the people's courts. The judicial work tasks will become heavier. The people's courts at various levels across the municipality should take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics as a guidance; conscientiously implement the guidelines of the national political and legal work conference, the national meeting of higher court presidents, and the second (enlarged) plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee; further strengthen and reform the people's court work to meet the requirements for setting up the socialist market economic system; persist in the strategic principle of "taking a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough;" strictly enforce laws; improve the law enforcement levels; go all out to maintain social stability; promote the improvement of administrative honesty; and provide legal guarantees and service for speeding up the municipality's reform, opening up, and modernization. In the new year, the people's courts at various levels across the municipality should closely rely on the leadership of the party committees at various levels, consciously accept supervision by the people's congresses and the masses, do their duties, bravely do pioneering work, work arduously, strive to be first-grade courts in the country, bring into full play the trial functions, and make new contributions to stabilizing society and accelerating the municipality's reform, opening up, and economic construction.
