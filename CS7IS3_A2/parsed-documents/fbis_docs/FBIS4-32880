The decision provoked protest within the opposition. In justifying the decision, Congressman Carlos Ferrero Costa said that only five months have elapsed since the implementation of the Constitution. [Begin Ferrero recording] In the first place, the president may step down whether a constitutional reform is approved or not. No constitutional reform is needed for the president to step down. Secondly, nowhere in the world is the incumbent president required to step down in order to seek his reelection. [end recording]
