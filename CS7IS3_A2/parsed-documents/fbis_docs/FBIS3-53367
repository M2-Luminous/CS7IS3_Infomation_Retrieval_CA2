The delegation includes Labor Knesset Member Rafi Edri; Dan Propper, president of the Industrialists' Association; Dani Gillerman, president of the Union of Chambers of Commerce; Klal Director General David Vinshel; Eytan Sheshinsky (of Kur); Bank Hapoalim Chairman 'Amiram Sivan; Mikha'el Federman of the Dan hotels; Dov Lautman of the Delta textile company; and other economic figures. The delegation will hold meetings with the Moroccan prime minister, the finance minister, the commerce and industry minister, the agriculture minister, and other economic figures. This is a reciprocal visit, returning a visit in Israel by a Moroccan delegation. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres attribute great importance to the visit. They met the members of the delegation prior to their departure, and Peres told them: "The time has come for Israeli-Moroccan relations to move forward a step, be open, and be anchored in open agreements." Rabin added: "Economic ties between Israel and Morocco constitute a practical expression of the fruits of peace." Hayim Shibi adds: Syrian businessmen have been invited to attend a meeting with Israeli entrepreneurs in Washington in February. The Syrians have not yet responded to the invitation. Entrepreneurs from the Middle East are expected to attend the meeting, in which the U.S. Commerce Department is involved.
