Nine of the victims died during the incident while three died later in hospital, a police spokesman said. He said the crowd had marched on the bank when word went round that a Kokomba man was inside to cash some money, apparently to lynch him. "The bank called in the soldiers after the crowd refused to heed appeals to disperse after failure to convince them that no Kokomba man was inside", the police spokesman said. When the soldiers failed to disperse the crowd by shooting into the air, "they started shooting into the crowd which had by then started stoning them". The incident has undermined the relative calm that had slowly returned to the municipality over the past two weeks, after previous incidents of rioting, killings, arson and looting, in the wake of the Kokomba-Nanumba ethnic conflict, which later engulfed the north to include the Dagombas and Gonjas. The Tamale municipality is predominantly Dagomba. The National Mobilisation Programme (NMP) said over 120,000 people have so far been registered as refugees and are being held in schools, mosques, church compounds, police stations and military barracks in the conflict areas. More than 1,000 corpses had been buried following the fighting, which erupted after a Nanumba killed a Kokomba man in a marketplace row over the price of a guinea fowl. Several others either died in the bush or were thrown into rivers or burnt alive in their houses. The police said all markets within the Tamale Municipality had been temporarily closed down and a night curfew continues while a three-month state of emergency has been clamped on the conflict areas of Gushiegu/Karaga, Zabzugu/Tatale, east Gonja, Nanumba, Saboba/Chereponi and Yendi. Meanwhile, police said three persons were injured Tuesday night when a grenade exploded at the yam market in Accra, popularly known as "Kokomba market" because the Kokombas who are mainly yam farmers are engaged in the supply and distribution of the food stuff to that market. They named the three, who were described as traders, as Kwaku Sasu and Eric Danso, on admission with serious injuries and Joseph Asare, who had been treated and discharged. "No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion and no one has been arrested. But we believe the incident is a spillover of the Kokomba-Nanumba conflict in the northern region", they said. They said one unexploded grenade was found at the site of the incident, and that the injured were asleep when the grenade exploded. Police said three men in military uniform were seen in the market area about the time of the incident and that investigations are going on. The National Electoral Commission (NEC) has postponed indefinitely the district election slated for 22 March in the entire northern region and parts of the Volta and Brong-Ahafo regions which experienced a spillover of the conflict.
