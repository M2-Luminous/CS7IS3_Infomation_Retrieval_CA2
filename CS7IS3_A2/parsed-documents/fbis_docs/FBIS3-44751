At this time, when the whole world is joined in celebration, we want to convey new year greetings and wishes to our combat comrades in the Navy, Army, and Air Force who are fighting on every front for the motherland; to Armed Police officers and men; to militiamen and reserve personnel on various fronts; to retired and resigned old comrades who have racked their brains in building our Armed Forces; to demobilized servicemen, disabled servicemen, and family members of martyrs and servicemen; and to people's governments at various levels and the people of various nationalities who have shown care and support for national defense building and the building of the People's Armed Forces! The year 1993, which has just passed, has added a colorful page to the history of the invigoration of the Chinese nation. This was a year in which we profoundly implemented the spirit of the 14th party congress, used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the whole party and Army, and rapidly developed the undertakings of reform, opening up, and modernization. It was a very important year, in which we built the socialist market economy system based on the action plan which was formulated by the CPC Central Committee for marching towards the new century. It was a year in which our country witnessed economic development, political stability, national unity, social progress, and great vitality in various areas. During the year, the People's Armed Forces advanced together with the people of various nationalities in the whole country, and overall army building scored new results. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, of which Comrade Jiang Zemin is the core, the whole Army diligently grasped military quality building, followed the road of crack troops with Chinese characteristics, and scored outstanding results in various areas of work. We implemented the spirit of the 14th party congress and voluntarily used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the minds of the officers and men of the whole Army. This completely strengthened enthusiasm and resolution to uphold the party's basic line and guaranteed a correct direction for the reform and building of our Army. We inherited and developed our Army's excellent traditions, vigorously stepped up and improved ideological and political work under the new situation, and further promoted the "five kinds of revolutionary spirit" proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character pioneering spirit" advocated by Comrade Jiang Zemin. With the military strategy for the new period as guidance, we established our thinking on winning battles on the basis of currently available equipment, while new enthusiasm for training emerged in every Army unit. We adapted to the new situation of development of the socialist market economy, continuously deepened reform of logistics work, and enabled logistics and supply ability to improve markedly. At the same time, science and technology for national defense made new progress, educational reform in military academies started at a new pace, reserve strength continuously increased, and militia and reserve work made new progress. To conclude, meeting the requirements of "being politically qualified, being militarily capable, having a good work style, strict discipline, and effective logistics," our Army's various tasks, aimed at the main goal of building a modernized and regular revolutionary army, made another solid step in the past year. We are facing a new international situation in which peace and development became the two main themes in the world and challenges and opportunities coexist, as well as a new domestic situation in which economic construction has become the center of various tasks, and reform and opening up is being thoroughly implemented. Our Army's duties are arduous and difficult, and the responsibilities are glorious and heavy. In the new year, we must continue to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideas on army building in the new period and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as guidance and base ourselves on our military strategy for the new period to further implement the policy of paying attention to quality building, strengthen ideological and political building, firmly grasp the implementation of various tasks centering on military training, thoroughly improve our combat ability, and provide strong and forceful security guarantees for the country's reform, opening up, and modernization construction. We must continue to resolutely use the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the whole Army, earnestly put the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping to the primary position when engaging in ideological and political building in the Army and giving theoretical education to cadres. We must use the fruits of the study to guide and promote the building and reform of Army units. We must strengthen the building of the cadres contingent -- especially leading groups at various levels; implement the "Outline on Army Building at the Grass-Roots Levels" reissued by the Central Military Commission; promote party work style building, clean government building, and socialist spiritual civilization building; strengthen and improve ideological and political work under the conditions of the development of the socialist market economy; ensure that at any time and under any condition, the Army voluntarily maintains a high degree of political and ideological conformity with the CPC Central Committee; and maintain the Army's high degree of stability and unity. Based on the demands of military strategy in the new period, we must upgrade combat ability under modern conditions -- especially high-tech conditions; continue to deepen reform of military training, grasp technical and tactical training, and ceaselessly improve coordinated combat capability, quick response capability, electronic warfare capability, combat survival in the wilderness, and comprehensive logistic ability. We must adapt to the new situation the socialist market economy, continuously strengthen the building and reform of logistics, vigorously develop farm and sideline production, and diligently improve the Army's material and cultural conditions. It is necessary to expedite the development of science and technology for national defense. Management of Army units, educational reform in military academies, and logistic building must make new headway in the new year. To conclude, under the main theme of implementing the military strategy for the new period, our Army's various tasks should make great achievements. The goals have now been fixed, the principles have now been set, and the crucial work now is to grasp implementation. Not to grasp firmly is not to grasp at all, and not to grasp solidly is also not to grasp at all. Whether the decisions of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission can be enforced, whether the military strategy for the new period can be carried out, and whether reform and building of the Army can scale new heights, all depends on implementation. Emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts is the quintessence of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as the precondition and crux for us to grasp work well. We must always observe this ideological line, proceed from reality when doing every task, straighten out the guiding thoughts for our work, and examine the very work by the criterion of judging whether it is conducive to increasing the Army's combat ability; and we must really be able to be responsible to the party, the people, and the long-term building of the Army. Grasping implementation is an arduous task, which requires strong revolutionary ambition and a sense of responsibility. Our cadres at various levels must always think of the undertakings of the party and the people; discharge their duties honestly; be responsible, work hard and not be upset by criticism; and make selfless contributions. They must run the Army strictly, set strict demands, carry out strict training, and practice strict management. They must establish honest and pragmatic leadership work styles, do practical things, speak the truth, report the actual situation, resolutely prevent and overcome formalism and superficial style, always view the grass-roots level and build the foundation as the core of work. They must voluntarily serve the grass-roots levels, and really be able to meet the demand which has recently been raised repeatedly by Chairman Jiang of the Central Military Commission: "Spend more time on learning, spend less time on social intercourse, do more research and investigation, be less subjective do more practical things, and speak less empty words." The new century is walking towards us. We must, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission of which Comrade Jiang Zemin is the core, work together with one heart, struggle arduously, clear the way to forge ahead, successfully fulfill the glorious duties given to the Army by the party and the people, and usher in a bright future with new victories.
