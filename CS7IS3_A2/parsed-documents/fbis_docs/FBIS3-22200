Two thirds of the towns in the country have no central water supply system and in some regions the drinking water situation ``requires urgent measures,'' due to threat of ``irreversible consequences.'' This was stated by Vice Premier Alexander Zaveryukha, in charge of agrarian issues, environmental protection and natural resources, at a meeting of the Collegium of the Russian Federation's Committee for the Water Supply Industry on Tuesday. According to Zaveryukha, the Russian Federation still has no program on supplying the population with drinking water, while as a result of ``the continuous mass pollution, two-thirds of man-made water sources do not meet the requirements for drinking and fishing reservoirs,'' and the construction of water supply networks ``has been sharply falling in recent years.'' The vice premier pointed out that the Russian government intends ``to give up inefficient administrative command methods of protecting water resources.'' A water supply fee should be introduced and the parliament should consider and pass the project already submitted by experts ``The Basics of the Water Legislation of the Russian Federation.'' Zaveryukha believes that in all industries without exception it is necessary ``to more actively pass to economic relations between the state and the users of natural resources.'' In his opinion, the first step in that direction was the introduction of considerable penalties for the pollution of the environment.
