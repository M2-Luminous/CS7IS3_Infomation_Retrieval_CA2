FR940506-2-00019 FR940506-2-00008 [A&hyph;201&hyph;504] Porcelain-On-Steel Cooking Ware From Mexico; Amendment to Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Amendment to Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: On August 16, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (58 FR 43327) the final results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on porcelain-on-steel cooking ware from Mexico. Based on corrections of clerical errors, we have changed the margins for one company and are now amending the final results. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lorenza Olivas or Rick Herring, Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; Telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 16, 1993, the Department published the final results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on porcelain-on-steel cooking ware from Mexico (58 FR 43327). The review covered the period December 1, 1989 through November 30, 1990. On August 24, 1993, we received a letter from counsel for CINSA, S.A., alleging that the Department had made ministerial errors. Petitioner submitted rebuttals to respondent's comments on September 1, 1993. On December 23, 1993, we determined that ministerial errors were made. (See Memorandum to Joseph A. Spetrini dated December 23, 1993; Corrections of Alleged Clerical/Ministerial Errors in Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.) Although these final results are the subject of litigation before the Court of International Trade (the Court), by order dated March 31, 1994, the Court granted the Department leave to correct these errors. Amended Final Results of Review After reviewing all comments, we have corrected the errors where appropriate. We corrected the double counting of CINSA's freight expenses for U.S. sales by deducting only the U.S. dollar factor amount, instead of both the dollar and pesos amounts, from U.S. prices to arrive at the net price used in our price-to-price comparisons. We recalculated the brokerage charges on U.S. sales and used the correct brokerage expense factor to derive total brokerage charges. We made an additional correction. We recalculated the home market sales price used in our determination of sales below cost by adding the value added tax to the home market price as stated in our notice of final results. For further discussion of the Department's positions on the above corrections, see Memorandum to Joseph A. Spetrini dated December 23, 1993; Corrections of Alleged Clerical/Ministerial Errors in Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. As a result of our corrections of clerical errors, we determine the margin for CINSA, S.A., to be 6.71 percent. Based on this rate, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to collect cash deposits of estimated antidumping duties and to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries in accordance with the procedures discussed in the final results of this review (58 FR 43327). These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during the review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This notice is in accordance with sections 751(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675(f)) and 19 CFR 353.28(c). Dated: April 30, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10990 Filed 5&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
