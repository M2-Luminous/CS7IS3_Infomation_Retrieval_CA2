Several people have been killed and others wounded. We are unable to give the number of victims because of the intensity of clashes and shelling. Yet, it is known between last night and dawn today, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola rebels had already fired more than 300 shells of various caliber at the martyred city. As usual, the civil defense, the National Police, and the Angolan Armed Forces have halted the destructive wrath of the men from Jamba. We expect to give other details in our next report.
