I. Angelopoulos: "Will Mr. Papandreou Accept the `Offers' From the United States?"] [Text] As was expected, in Washington the other day U.S. President Bill Clinton asked Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to cooperate with the Turkish leaders on the "solution of disputes" between the two countries. "This is the most suitable time" for this the U.S. President said and, of course, he did not fail to mention the Cyprus issue along with Greek-Turkish affairs. The way in which Mr. Clinton linked these issues merely confirms formally that Turkey has now raised the question of an Aegean-Cyprus "package" and that the U.S. leaders have clearly accepted this with the consent of the State Department and the Pentagon. Although he was extremely careful with his words at the joint news conference, Mr. Clinton let it be known that, according to Washington, normality in the Greek-Turkish relations is necessary because Turkey is now faced with a most acute economic and political problem. The U.S. President asked the Greek side not only to proceed with a dialogue with Ankara ("in return" for some concession by Turkey on the "confidence-building measures" in the Cyprus issue) but he also asked his interlocutor that Turkey be helped to develop its ties with Europe. In short, yesterday the White House and U.S. diplomats asked Greece to participate in the "rescue operation" for faltering Turkey. According to what is being said behind the scenes, Mr. Clinton linked Greek-Turkish affairs directly to Balkan issues that are of interest to Greece, particularly to the increased role Greece could play in this region from now on in cooperation with the United States. The U.S. President let it be known that, in Washington's opinion, the "open wounds" our country now has in the region do not "favor" the development of this role, which cannot be undertaken unless Athens is a trustworthy interlocutor with its neighboring countries.... So, for the United States the normalization of Athens' relations with Ankara is somehow the "key" to opening the gate of the Balkans to Greece under U.S. guarantees. If Greece wants to have a good political and economic position in the southern Balkans without any problems on its northern borders it should--in the U.S. view--certainly agree to discuss the Aegean "problems" with Ankara, open the road to the European Union for Turkey and, of course, accept a "solution" to the Cyprus issue in the spirit of "political equality"--which is an Ankara-Denktas demand--so that the path to the indirect recognition of the pseudostate in occupied north Cyprus will be open. There has been no answer by Mr. Andreas Papandreou to what Mr. Bill Clinton said publicly the other day about Greek-Turkish affairs. The prime minister merely listened to what the U.S. President said. What does this silence mean? Is it that Mr. Papandreou did not accept the logic of his interlocutor about Greek-Turkish affairs? Or is he discussing this argument without having decided yet? Only on the Cyprus issue did Mr. Papandreou have something to say: He agreed that the acceptance of the "confidence-building measures" by the Turkish Cypriot side would be a very happy event in the search for a solution to the problem. However, what will happen to the "package?" Mr. Clinton did not conceal the fact that the Aegean-Cyprus issues were discussed with [Turkish] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who visited him in Washington with careful timing a few days ago. As we already noted, the U.S. President does not conceal the fact that he now agrees with the view that Turkey must "be saved" (which of course is also the view shared by Greece's strong partners in the European Union). How the Andreas Papandreou government will react to these most critical issues will soon be evident in both the Cyprus developments and in the level of (whatever) "communication" there is with Ankara. Mr. A. Papandreou knows very well since the other day what Mr. Clinton's "offers" are and what Mr. Clinton demands "in return." The bad thing for the Greek side is that the U.S. "offers" are not in the field of the Greek-Turkish relations, where only Greek concessions are demanded. On paper at least, Mr. Clinton is offering Greece a good Balkan position (Washington also needs this to succeed in building a strong Balkan "corridor" to separate Germany and Turkey). However, this position is impossible without Greek "sacrifices" in Greek-Turkish affairs. At the same time, Mr. Clinton can maintain in his discussions with the Greeks that Washington is treating Athens politically better than the European Union does, since it counts on Greece in the Balkan issues. He may also maintain that Turkey's situation now is so bad at all levels that the opening of an Athens-Ankara dialogue would not necessarily mean immediate Greek concessions on major points of "dispute" in the Aegean.... U.S. diplomacy appears to expect some "spectacular" movement in the next few days by the Turkish Cypriot leaders on the Cyprus issue, assessing that something like this would give Mr. A. Papandreou an "alibi" for ending Greek objections to a Greek-Turkish dialogue. A close associate of Mrs. Ciller already went to Nicosia yesterday to confer with Rauf Denktas. The next few weeks or days might see a lot of things. After his visit to the United States, Mr. A. Papandreou is obliged to proceed with significant decisions for the country.
