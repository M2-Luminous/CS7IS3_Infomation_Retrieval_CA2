August 30, 1994. I. Introduction On November 2, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to adopt Equity Floor Procedure Advice (``Advice'') A&hyph;2, Stopping Orders. On June 1, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to narrow the scope of its original filing, to revise certain language used therein and to request approval to amend its Minor Rule Violation and Enforcement Plan (``MRVE Plan''). 3 On July 25, 1994, the Exchange submitted Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change in order to correct a typographical error. 4 On August 24, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 3 to the proposed rule change to clarify certain procedural requirements. 5 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 See letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Phlx, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated May 31, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). 4 See letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Regulation and Trading Operations, Phlx, to Sandra Sciole, Special Counsel, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated July 19, 1994 (``Amendment No. 2''). 5 See letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Regulation and Trading Operations, Phlx, to Sandra Sciole, Special Counsel, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated August 24, 1994 (``Amendment No. 3''). The proposed rule change, together with Amendment No. 1, was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34216 (June 15, 1994), 59 FR 32034 (June 21, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change, including Amendments No. 2 and No. 3 on an accelerated basis. II. Description of the Proposal The Exchange proposes to adopt Advice A&hyph;2 in order to codify its policy regarding the handling of stopped orders on its equity floor. 6 Under the proposed rule change, a Phlx specialist who stops an order 7 will be required to display a representative size of that order in his or her quote, 8 unless the specialist executes the order immediately after granting the stop. In addition, proposed Advice A&hyph;2 will prohibit a specialist from trading as principal with a stopped order if he or she is holding an agency order at the same price (or better) as the interest for the specialist's own account. Pursuant to the Exchange's rules, 9 the specialist must exercise due diligence to match the stopped order with such agency order. 6 Proposed Advice A&hyph;2 will be followed by the designator ``(E)'' to clarify that it applies only to the Phlx's equity floor. 7 An agreement to ``stop'' an order at a specified price constitutes a guarantee by the member who grants the stop ( i.e., the equity specialist) that the order will be executed at the stop price or better. See, e.g., Phlx Rule 1018 (``Stopping an Option''). 8 The Phlx has indicated that, where the spread between the consolidated best bid and offer is greater than the minimum variation, a specialist who stops a buy (sell) order will be required to reduce that spread by bidding (offering) at a price higher than the prevailing bid (lower than the prevailing offer). Under the Phlx proposal, the specialist may display a stopped buy (sell) order at the stop price so long as such bid (offer) does not create a locked or crossed market. Finally, where the spread between the consolidated best bid and offer is the minimum variation, the Phlx specialist must reflect the stopped buy (sell) order in his or her quotation at the prevailing bid (offer). Telephone conversations between Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Regulation and Trading Practices, Phlx, and Beth A. Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on July 26 and August 23, 1994. As noted above, the specialist must display a representative size of the stopped order. See Amendment No. 3, supra, note 5. After being placed on the specialist's book, stopped stock must be executed in accordance with traditional auction market principles. 9 See Phlx Rule 218 (``Customer's Order Receives Priority''). See also Phlx Rules 119 (``Precedence of Highest Bid'') and 120 (``Precedence of Offers at Same Price''). The Exchange also proposes to amend its MRVE Plan to include minor violations of Advice A&hyph;2 and to establish a fine schedule for such violations. According to that schedule, inadvertent failure to adhere to the advice's requirements 10 may subject a specialist to a $250 fine; a second occurrence during a three-year running calender period could result in the issuance of a $500 fine. Thereafter, the sanction will be determined at the discretion of the Exchange's Business Conduct Committee. 10 The Phlx has stated that it would not consider intentional failure to adhere to the advice's requirements to be a minor rule violation.
