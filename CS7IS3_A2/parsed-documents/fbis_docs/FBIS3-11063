Ian Burchett, Canada's consul in Mexico City, said that the goal for 1994 is to even out the trade balance. Currently, Canadian imports from Mexico are greater than its exports. However, Burchett noted that the interest showed by over 5,000 Canadian companies to do business with Mexicans within the framework of NAFTA will encourage Canadian exports. Burchett told EL FINANCIERO NORESTE EMPRESARIAL that investors are conducting a huge advertising campaign in Mexico to increase their exports since Mexico stands out as Canada's leading commercial partner in Latin America. Figures provided by the Canadian Consulate in Monterrey reveal that Canadian exports to Mexico from January to November 1993 amounted to 714,254,000 Canadian dollars compared with 710,298,000 million for the same period in 1992. For that same period, Canadian imports reached 3,289,591,000 Canadian dollars while they reached around 2,542,320,000 dollars during the same period in 1992. These figures reveal that the Canadian trade balance with Mexico has followed a positive trend. In 1991, Canadian companies exported some 500 million dollars [as published] to Mexico while Canadian imports from Mexico were in the amount of 2,833,687,000 Canadian dollars. The Mexican market has been a priority for Canada, vis-a-vis other Latin American countries, even before implementation of NAFTA.
