Tonino Opes reports. Opes: Four victims in two days: Drugs are exacting a heavy toll in Sardinia. There are lethal overdoses from the killer heroin that has recently begun to arrive from Thailand after an absence of ten years. Now it has replaced Brown Sugar [previous two words in English] and its effects are more devastating. The Cagliari police commissioner, Emilio Pazzi, has sounded the alarm. Pazzi: To inject oneself with a dose of Thai heroin for those who are used to Brown Sugar, using most probably the same dose, means facing almost certain death. Opes: Thai heroin is exceptionally pure and is difficult to cut into doses, so drug addicts are running a high risk. In Cagliari alone there are over 10,000 drug addicts, but the problem concerns the whole island. Unfortunately Sardinia has one of the highest rates of AIDS in Italy. Announcer: We have just received the news that the killer-heroin has claimed another victim this morning in Sassari [Sardinia]. A young man of 32 died after having injected himself with a dose of the lethal heroin.
