We wanted to get an answer to this question on the basis of a survey of a 1,000-head sample representing the country's population over the age of 15 that was carried out by the Szonda Ipsos Public Opinion Research company in January 1994. During the survey, the people questioned first had to say whether they find it acceptable for a person who is in one of the following nine groups to become a member of the next government and plays an important political role. The replies were as follows. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Group |Acceptable |Unacceptable | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Younger than 35 |76 |24 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Had a leading role in pr-|51 |49 | |evious system | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moved back to Hungary fr-|39 |61 | |om abroad | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Parents were communist l-|66 |34 | |eaders | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Is a member of a nationa-|77 |23 | |l minority | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Is unfaithful to his mar-|63 |37 | |riage partner | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Does not believe in God |79 |21 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Is of Jewish origin |83 |17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Homosexual |34 |64 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The answers show that the vast majority of the Hungarian population has no objections against a young, national minority, atheist, or Jewish person playing a leading role in Hungarian politics. For about two-thirds of the voters, it is not an important factor making a political role impossible if someone is adulterous or if his parents were communist leaders. However, only half of those who replied considered leading positions in the previous regime compatible with a future governmental position, and the majority of the public clearly rejects those who have moved back from abroad or are homosexuals: Nearly two-thirds of the questioned people considered it unacceptable for them to have a serious political position. Apart from those who oppose the political role of people returning from abroad, the social-demographic characteristics of people who reject the other groups are very similar. Elderly people, people with lower levels of education, people living in small villages, people with low incomes, and those who are inactive or dependent are represented more than the average. People with lower schooling generally gave more negative answers than the average. The rejection of people under 35, those who are returning from abroad, who are adulterous, atheists, or homosexuals increases with the increase of age, and it is mainly village dwellers who reject those who deceive their partners, Jews, and homosexuals taking on a political role. It is worth looking at the answers in relation to the political orientation of the person replying (Table 2). Examining the left-wing, liberal, and conservative voters in groups -- placing all those who selected a party in one of the groups -- we can see that an important political role when the person is young, member of a national minority, of Jewish origin, adulterous, or homosexual is most acceptable to the liberal voters. The liberal voters mainly reject those who are returning from abroad or played a political role in the previous system, and most of them do not find the political role of homosexuals acceptable, although fewer of them reject this than people among the conservative voters. Naturally, the largest proportion of left-wing voters find it acceptable for atheists, children of communist parents, and former functionaries to play an important political role, but a large majority of them do not reject the political role of national minority or Jewish people. However, it is interesting that more of them reject young people -- on this issue, they are closer to the views of the conservative voters -- and they particularly reject people returning from abroad. On this issue, the liberal and conservative voters are closer to each other, just as in the rejection of the future important role of former leaders. The conservative voters are extremely opposed to homosexuals or former cadres taking on political roles, however, they are mainly in contrast with the majority of the whole population in the fact that their majority finds it unacceptable for children of communist parents to have an important role in the country's leadership.

The statistical analysis distinguished three groups of opinions. The first group in which the views rejecting adulterous, atheist, Jewish, and homosexual people appear together is obviously characterized by a traditional and prejudiced attitude. The second group of opinions, which is dominated by the rejection of former functionaries and the children of communist parents, is characterized by an anti-communist attitude, while the third group of opinions, in which the rejection of people under the age of 35 and those returning from abroad are together, can be seen as a conservative attitude. [passage omitted] The distribution of the replies indicates the dilemmas into which a "negative campaign" can sweep parties belonging to the various groups. According to the data, the relative majority of those who replied represent a liberal attitude at the moment, but it can also be seen that some one-fifth of the liberal, left-wing, and uncertain voters, mainly those of lower social status, can easily change their mind under the influence of a powerful negative campaign. It is not certain that this kind of campaign would, at the same time, strengthen the conservative parties, because many of their voters have a liberal attitude and a vehement negative campaign can make these people uncertain in their choice of party, as was seen after Istvan Csurka's [them member of the Hungarian Democratic Forum] actions in the summer of 1992. It is also striking that the voters of left-wing and conservative parties are mainly divided by their attitude to the previous system, rather than by their relationship to the liberal and conservative attitudes. While 60 percent of the voters of liberal parties belong to the group characterized by a liberal attitude and 40 percent to the conservative attitude, the proportion in the case of the voters of left-wing and conservative parties is the opposite: Some 40 percent of them are characterized by liberal attitudes and 60 percent by conservative attitudes. Therefore, from this point of view, the profile of left-wing and conservative voting bases are similar to each other. [passage omitted] In the course of our survey, we attempted to find out if there is a group in society that is consistently mistaken in its judgment on the distribution of opinions and is, as a result, more susceptible to the influence of campaign messages. We examined how many times the people surveyed were able to say what the majority view was on the nine questions they were asked, and how many times they were wrong. On the basis of the social and demographic characteristics, the group that was completely unable to give an estimate can be best isolated from the rest: Many more people over the age of 60, with lower schooling, with income in the lowest 10 percent, who are religious, and many of whom said they did not wish to participate in the elections can be found in this group than the average. Accurate estimates were mainly given by people in Budapest, with highest incomes, and people in their 50's. These social groups have many Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] supporters, therefore, the proportion of people giving accurate estimates was also higher than the average among the MSZP supporters. However, there is not much difference in the accuracy of the estimates between the various groups of voters, although somewhat more of the opposition supporters were able to form an accurate opinion on the public view. To sum up the results of the survey, we can say that the majority of Hungarian society definitely rejects the future political role of only homosexuals and people returning from abroad, and to a smaller extent, functionaries of the former regime, and the vast majority formed an accurate view of society's dominant views. It is unlikely that the other stereotypes of a possible negative campaign would have much influence. Therefore, people against whom these campaigns are directed do not risk much if they respond, thereby strengthening the consensus of the majority. Nevertheless, there is a group in society that might also be vulnerable to a negative campaign. However, for the bigger parties, giving gestures to this group of people might be risky because this might alienate the rest of their voters. In addition to this, this group's willingness to vote is rather low, and a negative campaign is mainly suitable for changing the views of already committed voters, rather than for mobilizing people.
