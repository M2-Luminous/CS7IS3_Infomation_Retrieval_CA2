Many politicians from the governing coalition fear that Lech Walesa will wait until the last moment, so as not to lose a bargaining chip. After the decision made by the Democratic Union [UD], everyone knows that, even if the veto is used by the president, it will be overturned. According to the most drastic scenario, the veto could be a pretext for dissolving the parliament. Shortly after he received the draft of the Budget Law, the president stated that he has many reservations with regard to it, and that is why he does not know yet whether he will sign it. According to the president, the budget, which was prepared by the left-wing government, was adapted to the country's economic capabilities. That is true enough, but it also completely contradicts promises made before the elections. "The nation will feel cheated again," Walesa says. Two weeks passed since that time, and, throughout the period, the president did not make a decision. Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy tried to persuade the president on Thursday [7 April] to make a decision as soon as possible, so as to enable the coalition to "know where it stands." According to the Small Constitution, the president has 30 days in which to take a stand on a budget, which means he has precisely two more weeks to keep the coalition in suspense. According to many politicians from the coalition, the president will procrastinate until the last moment because the threat of a veto may be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations regarding filling the posts of deputy prime minister for economic affairs and of finance minister. But, following Saturday's statement by UD, to the effect that the party will not support a possible presidential veto, it has become obvious that the coalition will have no problem whatsoever pushing the budget through. Only the date of its enactment could be a problem. A few days ago, Defense Ministry [MON] chief Piotr Kolodziejczyk tried to persuade the president to submit the budget to the Constitutional Tribunal. According to Kolodziejczyk, the Budget Law interferes with MON's powers to an unacceptable extent by telling the ministry what kind of arms equipment it is supposed to purchase and where. If the president vetoes the budget and sends it to the Tribunal, the Sejm will not be able to adopt the budget until after a verdict has been rendered by the Tribunal. A dissolution of the Sejm is the most radical scenario; it is being mentioned by some politicians. The Small Constitution provides that the president is empowered to dissolve parliament if it fails to adopt a budget within three months. Actually, the Sejm did manage to adopt it this time, but an argument could be raised that enactment of the budget by the Sejm involves not only its adoption by the Sejm and debates on the Senate's amendments, but also taking a stand on a possible presidential veto. Under this interpretation, three months passed a long time ago, but, according to legal experts, no justification can be found for the above argument in the Small Constitution.
