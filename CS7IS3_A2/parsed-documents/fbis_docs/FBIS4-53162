And in an interview with THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW [AFR] Mr Siew also cautioned against forcing the pace of any APEC move towards an institutional framework. Mr Siew, in Sydney last night to address the Asia Pacific Insight Briefing, appeared to indicate that APEC should steer clear of political disputes such as the U.S. pressure on China over human rights. "I think it will be better for APEC to focus on economic issues only, not to talk about any political issues. (If) it gets involved in political issues, it will become very complicated," Mr Siew told the AFR. While APEC had made "a lot of progress" in the past five years, Mr Siew said he would like to see the organization take on an "institutional framework". But such a move should only occur when a consensus had emerged among the APEC membership for such a "community". Achieving such a community, however, required patience "because the members of APEC come from different cultural, political, and social backgrounds". Mr Siew said APEC's goal should be "open regionalism instead of the closed regionalism exercised by the Europeans and others". A judgment on how consistent the North American Free Trade Agreement and the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] were with open regionalism could only be made in the future. "If they follow the GATT rules, they will become open regionalism. If they just emphasize their own interests then they will just veto the GATT rules and the spirit (of the GATT)," he said. Asked whether an Australian-New Zealand link with AFTA -- as mooted by the prime minister, Mr Keating, last week -- could be detrimental to the interests of APEC, Mr Siew said the AFTA and NAFTA membership had given assurances that their regional groupings "will not be against the general objectives of APEC". "So we hope that kind of assurance can be honored," he said.
