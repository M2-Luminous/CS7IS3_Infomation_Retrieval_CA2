And yet, do not be deceived; although Gen. de Lapresle may not be talkative, he knows what he wants, does what he says he will, and does not officially have moods. Like all officers who have accepted the notion of discipline, he knows how to obey, but he also knows how to give an order and expects it to be carried out. At the age of 56, Bertrand de Lapresle is the last-chance general for the United Nations. Born in Marseilles on 5 September 1937, a graduate from Saint-Cyr, holder of a master's degree in economic sciences and a graduate from the faculty of Political Sciences, Bertrand de Lapresle was sent to Algeria in 1960 with the airborne and armored troops. After 1963, he alternated posts in the Foreign Legion, in the armored division and cavalry units (especially in Germany), in the general staff, and higher military, scientific, and technical education institutes. In August 1981, with the rank of colonel, he commanded the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment in Orange (Vaucluse). From 17 May to 25 September 1983, Bertrand de Lapresle was chief of staff of the French section -- 2,000 men -- of the multinational force in Beirut, alongside American, Italian, and British contingents, called up following the Sabra and Shatilah massacres to help the regular Lebanese army to intervene between rival factions and protect the civilians. In that post, he was valued for his qualities as an organizer and, also, for his coolness and sense of diplomacy during the individual actions which the international force was obliged to carry out. He again served in the general staff, especially in the "financial planning" office, and, with the rank of brigadier general, he was deputy chief of "operations" in the army general staff in 1986, and then in 1987 he became chief of the "plans, programs, and space" division in the army general staff. Promoted to major general, he commanded the 3d French Armored Division in Germany in 1989. Raised to the rank of lieutenant general in 1990, he became major general of the Army (number two in the hierarchy, after the chief of staff), then he was placed, on 1 December 1993, at the head of the five divisions of the Rapid Action Force (FAR). In the Army, Bertrand de Lapresle is an officer who is not opposed by his peers or his subordinates (which is a double exploit). His appointment was expected and, in its way, it is a signal which France is sending to the United Nations. Indeed, Gen. de Lapresle is already being called "the last-chance general" in the French armed forces, the man who -- if he failed to agree with Mr. Butrus-Ghali on remedying the United Nations' shortcomings on the spot -- could be repatriated with the 6,600 or so French blue helmets in the former Yugoslavia.
