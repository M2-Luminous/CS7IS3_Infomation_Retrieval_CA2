Martin Bartisek obtained the answers of Vladimir Meciar, the movement's chairman and Slovak prime minister, on the following topical issues. [Begin recording] [Bartisek] As the word referendum is likely to be used with increasing frequency in the days to come, I would like to ask the following question: Certain political moves will undoubtedly follow and, as you yourself have said, there is a chance of reaching a political agreement between political parties and movements. Following political talks, is the month of September, when the early elections should be held, acceptable to you? [Meciar] [passage omitted] Why should we need such a long period to organize elections? Who needs it? The later the elections are held the worse, the worse it will be for the state, the worse it will be for the economy, and the worse it will be for the social sphere. That's what the struggle we are waging with the opposition parties is all about. As for who is holding the initiative in this respect, then this is a matter of no consequence. What is important is that the state benefits, and whether we succeed or not is a matter of secondary importance to me; the protection of the state has priority. That's the essence of how I feel and how the HZDS feels about the elections. [Bartisek] Still, is September actually realistic for you, or will it not be acceptable? [Meciar] At the moment this is under discussion. All the parties are engaged in permanent consultations and, until these talks have ended, I do not want to say anything about their conclusion. [Bartisek] In your view, how should the question in the referendum--the question on which citizens should give their unequivocal answer--be formulated?. [Meciar] Let's recall the Slovak Republic's electoral system and the interpretation of the constitutional provisions which deputies interpreted to benefit them rather than the people. In other words, here I am, I have made promises, and I am not fulfilling my promises. That must not happen. The way in which the question should be formulated is that the deputies, who abandoned the initial policies and the parties and movements on behalf of which they stood, should not thus lose their mandate. Another reason is that the electoral system is based on proportional representation of the parties. The second question should ask whether early elections should be held immediately, but no later than June 1994 which is in the interest of the state. The third question should ask whether all those are taking part in privatization should not be compelled to show where their money for privatization comes from. I would like this to be included in the referendum, because so far I have been unable to assert this in any other way. Showing where the money comes from could be one of the dominant questions in the referendum... [Bartisek, interrupting] Do you think that you could get away with putting three questions of such importance to a citizen in the referendum? Is it actually acceptable? [Meciar] Yes, I think it is. In technical terms it can be done. It is possible. These are the three questions which cannot be answered anywhere else. [end recording]
