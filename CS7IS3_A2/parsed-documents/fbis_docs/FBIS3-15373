RA [Republic of Armenia] Governmental press service informed us, the main railway bridge was damaged after the first explosion in December, 1993. A new temporary bridge was built nearby, allowing transfer of trains over the bridge. One of the supporting blocks of the new bridge has been damaged as a result of the new explosion. The RA Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan promised to deliver the grain and fuel to Armenia by air. Meanwhile the Minister of Food and Resources David Zadoyan reported, trucks were sent to Georgia for delivering the cargoes (particularly grain). The reconstruction of the bridge will take 20-25 days at least, Mr. Zadoyan reported. The Armenian specialists left to the place of the explosion. According to the official report, the reconstruction time will be only known after investigating the situation on the spot. This is fifth explosion at the railway, connecting Armenia with the external world, during this winter. And therefore the declarations of the Georgian parliamentarian Aleksandr Kavasadze about "brotherly relations" between Armenia and Georgia, made on March 1, sound rather strange. Meanwhile the Yerevan-Tbilisi highway is being used starting from March 2. The non-stable situation in Georgia didn't allow to use this road before. The main difficulty is to ensure the security in the Marneuli-Tbilisi section, which is now guaranteed.
