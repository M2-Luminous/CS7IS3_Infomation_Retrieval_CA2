The announcement flows from proposals made by the government and the ANC [African National Congress] which could pave the way for an all inclusive settlement. [Begin Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer recording] Even if we fail to get the constitution as far as convincing the Freedom Alliance parties to also accept the proposals, we nevertheless still have to go ahead and push it through Parliament, to amend the constitution and also to adapt the electoral constitution so as to create the possibility for further registration by other parties. [end recording] The proposals make for, among others, provision for a double ballot, the entrenchment of the volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] idea in the final constitution, extended powers to provinces, the retention of the name kwaZulu/Natal, and the postponement of the registration date for political parties to take part in the election. The Freedom Alliance says it is cautiously optimistic about the proposals. However, all the parties want to study the proposals before reacting to them. KwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi has called it a step in the right direction. He also disclosed that President F.W. de Klerk told him by telephone that a government delegation was to meet King Goodwill Zwelithini soon to eliminate obscurities about his constitutional role. Reaction has also been received from the Inkatha Freedom Party, the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] and the Democratic Party [DP]. [Begin recording] [Inkatha's Hennie Bekker] The first reaction to that is that there is a possibility of us moving forward and we can look if we cannot find each other along the way. [PAC's Gora Ebrahim, in English] We of the PAC are certainly opposed to the balkanization or the creation of ethnic states. But we do recognize the fact that there is a need for an all inclusive election in our country, and we hope that this would now pave the way for inclusive elections to take place not later than the 27th of April 1994. [DP's Douglas Gibson] Regarding the possibility of a volkstaat feel a little uncomfortable because three days ago Mr. Nelson Mandela announced there would not be a volkstaat in South Africa. His statement now seems to hint that there could be a volkstaat, and on television last night, Dr. Pallo Jordan said that the ANC has not changed its approach at all, so I'm not sure whether they are not just playing with words.
