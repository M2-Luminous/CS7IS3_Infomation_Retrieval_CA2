The results were eagerly awaited by the Zairian people this afternoon. In accordance with Parliament regulations, the deliberations should have and could have immediately begun. However, when the members filled the conference room, and after the bureau was installed, about 20 members of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] moved in to prevent the session from starting by whistling, booing, chanting and singing. Up to 1830, the members of the HCR-PT bureau were unable to utter one word. They could not even announce the points on the agenda or begin the session. Some HCR-PT members left the room discouraged but some were there until 1930. The Tele-Zaire team was prevented from filming because their flashbulbs were broken. After the bulbs were replaced, the team was able to film some images which we will show you as soon as possible.
