Abdullah] [Text] The condition of the state-owned textile mills is deplorable. The industrial units of the Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation [BTMC] incurred losses of 401.25 crore [4,012.50 million] taka during the past 21 years. The BTMC has 41 textile mills. At present production has virtually stopped in 36 of them. Efforts by the government to sell these mills to the private sector have not yielded the desired result. All 41 mills are facing acute financial crisis due to recurring losses. There was no production in these mills during the past year due to the unavailability of raw cotton. Only five mills are operational while the rest have been unofficially closed. As a result, 47,000 mill workers are unemployed. BTMC sources said that the Ministry of Industries has invited private sector bids on 10 mills, but it has been learned that the response is not very encouraging. Steps are also underway for the denationalization of 10 more mills. The government's plan is to privatize the mills in a gradual manner. It has been reported that the Industries Ministry is going ahead with the sale of these mills, although the prices offered is far below the actual cost of the mills. About 10,000 workers in these 10 mills, which were declared closed about nine months ago, have not yet received the salaries and other benefits due them. From 1972-1993 the corporation incurred a loss of 401.25 crore taka. During the past two and a half years, that is, during the term of office of the present government, the corporation incurred a loss of 286 crore [2,860 million] taka. This shows that the loss incurred in the textile sector during the tenure of the present government exceeded all records. The BTMC earned profits during the 1972-1976 fiscal years. From 1977-1979, the corporation earned a profit of over 1.5 crore [15 million] taka. It also earned profits during the 1982-83, 1984-85, and 1988-89 fiscal years. By deducting the profits made during the past 21 years, the net loss of the corporation is estimated to be around 401.25 crore taka. The BTMC workers union at a press conference held yesterday called on the government to accept their 14-point demand, which includes reopening the 10 industrial units of the corporation which had been closed and payment of their overdue salaries. They alleged that a grave situation is prevailing in the BTMC units. The mill workers have not been paid in four or five months. The union leaders further alleged that these mills incurred losses worth several million taka during the term of office of the present government. They said that influential persons are conspiring to purchase each mill worth about 50 crore [500 million] taka at the nominal price of only 5 to 10 crore [50 to 100 million] taka. The 14-point demand of the jute mill workers include reopening the 10 mills which have been closed; payment of the back salaries of the workers; release of the workers arrested under the Anti-Terrorism Act; withdrawal of duty on the import of raw cotton, color, chemicals, and machinery parts; banning imports of duty-free thread; preventing entry of smuggled thread and textile yarn; withdrawal of value added tax; lifting of interest on bank loans; issuance of long-term loans for modernization of the textile mills; and providing capital to these mills. The statement at the press conference was read by the general secretary of the workers union, Z.M. Kamrul Anam. The other union leaders present included Md. Nurul Islam Bhuiyan, Subash Chandra Debnath, Abu Taher, and Shamsunnahar. The textile workers have also decided to stage a sit-in in front of the Bangladesh Secretariat [ Dhaka complex which houses all government ministries] on 29 December to press their demands.
