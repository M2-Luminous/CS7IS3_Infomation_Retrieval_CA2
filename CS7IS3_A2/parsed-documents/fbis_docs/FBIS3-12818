He and President Husni Mubarak will hold urgent consultations and comprehensively evaluate the peace process and the developments in the wake of the Hebron massacre. This was stated by Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Sa'id Kamal, who told MENA in an exclusive statement that late last night he conveyed to Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa a message from President 'Arafat on some obstacles the Israelis and Americans are still raising to a UN Security Council resolution condemning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and approving the deployment of international observers in the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinian ambassador said the United States rejects any mention of Arab Jerusalem in any Security Council resolution on the pretext that Jerusalem will be discussed in the final stage of the negotiations. Kamal noted that this problem can be overcome by calling for dismantling the settlements and protecting the Palestinians in all the territories occupied in 1967, which implicitly means Arab Jerusalem. He said 'Arafat's message to the Egyptian leadership is part of the constant, ongoing coordination and consultations between Egypt and the PLO, especially within the framework of Egypt's current efforts to issue a Security Council resolution condemning the Hebron massacre. The Palestinian ambassador to Egypt said while in Cairo 'Arafat will also receive a report from Dr. Nabil Sha'th on his talks in Washington with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and a number of his advisers, especially Dennis Ross, the general coordinator of the Middle East peace talks. Kamal called on the United States to adopt an effective position on forcing Israel to disarm the settlers, not only in Gaza and Jericho, but also throughout the West Bank, too. He explained that the issue of an international presence or forces in Gaza and Jericho is not new, as it was mentioned in the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles reached in Oslo and signed in Washington on 13 September. Full details of that declaration had been worked out by Palestinian and Israeli negotiators before the al-Ibrahimi massacre, he said. He stressed that the Palestinians now want the settlers to be disarmed effectively and expeditiously. Kamal called on the United States to take effective measures to recognize the PLO, as it promised to do during a meeting in Washington in October between PLO Political Department Chief Faruq Qaddumi and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
