Whatever the case may be, the Americans are under the impression that Rabin is uptight about the Clinton-al-Asad meeting, and they have been sparing no effort to put him at ease. They agree with the notion that the prime minister cannot afford to talk about a withdrawal on the Golan while conducting tough negotiations about a withdrawal from Jericho and Gaza. On the other hand, it is hard to envision a situation where the Syrian president informs Clinton that for the sake of normalization with the United States he is prepared to stomach normalization with Israel, including the opening of borders and embassies, and Clinton pleading with him to put off a decision until Rabin and 'Arafat reach an agreement. In such an event, Rabin and Clinton will have a problem. Rabin's problem will be with the Jews in Israel who are still having a hard time digesting the compromise in Jericho, while Clinton's will be with the Jews in America who were removed from the political agenda as a result of the Oslo agreement. The very meeting with the U.S. President, who will be taking time off from his discussions about security in Europe, is seen by the Syrian president as quite a formidable achievement. Clinton's aides recall that three former U.S. Presidents also conferred with al-Asad, and that nothing could be more natural than a meeting with yet another regional leader taking part in the political process under U.S. orchestration. This may very well be the way the Geneva summit appears from the American point of view, but al-Asad experts are sure that he will make it his business to depict the event in a totally different light. Even before shaking hands with his young counterpart and consoling him on the death of his mother, al-Asad scored important points with the Arab world. He can argue that all he had to do to obtain such prestigious publicity was to do nothing; neither to excessively obstruct the PLO in its negotiations with Israel, nor to demand that Arab leaders punish 'Arafat for deviating from their agreement to coordinate moves vis-a-vis Israel. He kept all options in his hands and did not budge from his fundamental positions, such as the demand for an Israeli withdrawal from all the territories. Ahmad Jibril, the murderer of U.S. soldiers in Berlin, is still being hosted in Damascus, and al-Asad makes no secret of his ties with Hizballah. Rabin, Jewish functionaries, and U.S. officials fear that the U.S. President -- who is eager for foreign policy achievements -- will be tempted to buy glass beads from al-Asad and hug him as if they were diamonds. Al-Asad recently reminded us that the Americans are prepared to be grateful even for second-hand beads. Three times he promised to let go of the Jewish hostages in Damascus and Aleppo, and there are signs that he will sell them a fourth time, this time directly to the U.S. President. Clinton will then rush to talk about it in front of the U.S. television cameras which have a short memory. The experts, led by Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, an Arabist and head of the Israeli delegation to the talks with Syria, are telling Rabin that the shrewd Syrian president will not let such a rare opportunity slip through his fingers next Sunday [16 January]. The meeting with George Bush in the midst of the Gulf war and Syria's participation in the Madrid conference were prerequisites for the improvement of its relations with the West, but two years later these moves are deemed insufficient. As the Americans see it, he has not done enough when it comes to relations with Israel on the one hand, and with regard to Iran, North Korea, and terror on the other. If he concludes that he cannot "string along" Clinton, al-Asad may deliver the goods that will help the U.S. President justify the meeting and pave the way for more tangible changes in the future. Rabin is now trying to up the ante with regard to the public manifestation of the change in Syria's position and to make sure that al-Asad does not profit from the weaknesses of his U.S. interlocutor. The prime minister should hope that Clinton arrives at the meeting with the Syrian president in high spirits, carrying positive press clippings about his talks with Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, Lech Walesa, and his NATO partners. Success in Europe will reduce the danger of Clinton searching for -- and finding -- consolation with al-Asad for his frustration in failing to encourage reforms in Russia, to cite just one example. The more the summit is depicted as a great achievement, the more the pressure will increase on Israel to pay its share for success on the Syrian track, despite the difficulties on the Palestinian track and at home. If it is real, this achievement could be used to improve positions versus the PLO and the Likud.
