According to incomplete statistics, almost three million people were killed in the war including one million soldiers from throughout the country and more than four million people were wounded. The war also left 170,000 aged homeless persons who now depend on the assistance of their countrymen and social welfare centers. More than two million people were affected by toxic chemicals and about 500,000 children were deformed. Implementing and developing the nation's humanitarian tradition, our party, state, and people have applied various forms of assistance to help these war victims. However, this is a wide-scale and very difficult, complicated task that cannot be resolved by the Labor, War Invalids and Social Welfare Ministry alone. It needs the special attention and assistance from the entire society, genial persons, and humanitarian and charitable organizations at home and abroad. Assistance programs for these war victims should include measures to restore and promote their physical fitness; help relieve their difficulties in the daily life; and create conditions for them to participate in various social activities, especially in productive labor. This will enable them to live peacefully with other people in society.
