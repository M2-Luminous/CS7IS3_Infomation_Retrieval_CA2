FBIS3-38753 "drweu026__a94020" FBIS-WEU-94-026-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 February 1994 ANNEX Germany West German Industrial Output Fell 7 Percent in 1993 AU0202161494 Hamburg DPA in German 1237 GMT 2 Feb 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0202161494 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In the recessionary year of 1993 west German industry had to reduce its output by an annual average of 7 percent compared with 1992. As the FRG Economics Ministry announced on Wednesday [2 February] by presenting the December results, according to preliminary calculations, output increased slightly by 0.5 percent in price and seasonally adjusted terms during the last month of 1993 compared with the previous month. However, the Federal Statistical Office expects this result to be "corrected downward." Nevertheless, the ministry stresses that "all the main groups of the producing industry" with the exception of electricity and gas supply are affected by the (currently existing) increase in output; this is most marked in the construction sector with an increase of 5 percent following unusually cold weather in November. At the beginning of January, the ministry reported a decline in overall industrial output by 2 percent in November compared with October 1993. According to the two-month comparison of November/December over September/October 1993, which does not show so many oscillations, net industrial output declined by only 1 percent. Only the electricity and gas suppliers were able to raise their output by 1.5 percent, while construction output went down by 3.5 percent. This two-month comparison shows that processing industry output was down by 1 percent. This primarily affected investment goods, at minus 1.5 percent, as well as essential and nonessential foods and beverages, minus 2 percent. Compared with the November/December 1992 period, west German industrial output went down by a total of 2.9 percent. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |November and December 1993/November a-| | |nd December 1992 (change in percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Producing industry overall |- 2.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Processing industry |- 2.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |-- basic materials and producer goods |+ 3.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |-- investment goods |- 6.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |-- consumer goods |- 3.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |-- essential and nonessential foods a-|+ 0.1 | |nd beverages | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Mining |- 7.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Electricity and Gas Supply |+ 3.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Construction Sector |- 8.0 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
