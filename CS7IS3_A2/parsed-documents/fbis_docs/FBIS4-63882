As a reserve, the Russian party has one more option -- the "presidential" -- which is still to be revealed. An ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned on the sidelines of the talks between the Russian and Ukrainian government heads that the attempt to harmonize the positions of the parties, which are at times mutually exclusive, is experiencing great difficulties. The talks process has already gone on for three days. The chief stumbling-block lies in the conflicting approaches of Moscow and Kiev to the principle of separate bases for the national fleets. Both delegations have held repeated consultations with their presidents using the telephone "hot" line. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy met several times today. However the main work is being done by the working group of experts. It is expected that the sides will draw up the final text of the intergovernment agreement on beginning the division of the Black Sea Fleet. If this happens, the document will be signed by Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yefim Zvyagilskiy, the heads of the delegations of Russia and Ukraine at the talks. One way or the other, the talks will end this evening, since Viktor Chernomyrdin leaves for an official visit to China after 2000.
