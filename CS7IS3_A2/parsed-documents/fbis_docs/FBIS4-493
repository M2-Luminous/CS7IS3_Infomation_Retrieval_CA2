In a statement sent to the main South African political players, the South African Police, foreign embassies and the media, the burgerraad called for an alternative site to be used. A copy of the statement sent to SAPA said no-one could guarantee security at an event which was expected to draw the biggest crowd ever in the history of the country. It called for an alternative site to be used, saying no-one could guarantee security at an event which was expected to draw the biggest crowd ever in the history of the country. [as received] The burgerraad argued that most of the people living in the vicinity of the Union Buildings were Afrikaners and the inauguration could lead to "bitterness" among these citizens. Unlike a sports stadium, the Union Buildings could not accommodate a massive crowd of people. Up to 300,000 could attend the inauguration on May 9 or 10, it said. Also, the union building was an ideal place for a sniper attack and crowd control would be next to impossible.
