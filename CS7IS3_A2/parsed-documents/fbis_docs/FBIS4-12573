[Al-Sahhaf] I welcome you. [Jayda'] [words indistinct] discussion of lifting the embargo from Iraq. To what extent has Iraq responded to the UN Security Council resolutions? [Al-Sahhaf] Iraq has responded to the UN Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 687. This is documented in the UN Security Council records. That is why Iraq recently asked the UN Security Council in a letter signed by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz to fulfill its commitments and implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 which calls for lifting the economic embargo from Iraq. Within the Arab League framework, we are supported by the general secretariat and the secretary general to maintain the atmopshere that calls for lifting the embargo from Iraq and the Iraqi people. We did not submit a draft resolution to the Arab League Council because we do not want one, two, or three members to come out with harmful political objectives, thus showing that the Arabs disagree on Iraq's request. We remain satisfied with the general atmopshere of support provided by the Arab League secretary general. [Jayda'] Your Excellency, what is the truth behind what is being reported on there being Kuwaiti prisoners in Iraq and what is Iraq's stand on this issue? [Al-Sahhaf] There are no prisoners in Iraq. We [words indistinct] through the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC]. Others became aware that the issue is one of missing people. There are internationally acknowledged procedures and rules for following up the issue of missing people, not to mention that the ICRC also follows up such issues. In the aggression against Iraq, and during the crisis, there were missing people. One should search for them, and collect information about them. This takes time, and this is not the first time that this happens. In all crises, wars, and armed conflicts, people are reported missing. The search for them continues. As you know, the Americans are still following up the issue of those missing in action in Vietnman. This issue is similar to the other. They waged an all-out war against Iraq. One can say that it was a third world war against Iraq. There were victims in this war, and people were reported missing. The question is one of missing people. We cooperate in accordance with acknowledged procedures to collect any information we might obtain during our invesigation, and search to determine the fate of these missing people. There are also tens of thousands of Iraqis who are reported missing. We will also ask that searches be carried out, investigations conducted, and information collected on them. [Jayda'] Your Excellency Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, what are the dimensions of the Iraq-Gulf relationship in light of opening channels with Qatar, Oman, and recently with Bahrain? [Al-Sahhaf] These are the dimensions of an Arab relationship between two Arab countries. These are normal dimensions. Iraqi relations exist with our brothers in the Gulf, particularly with Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain. We seek to promote these relations. This is a joint effort and a common desire between us and our brothers in these three Arab countries. God willing, these normal relations with the brothers will witness broader scopes of cooperation and joint action. [Jayda'] Mr. Minister, how does the Kurdish problem affect the domestic state of affairs in Iraq, and how true are the reports about foreign assistance? [Al-Sahhaf] As a result of the U.S.-led imperialist game in northern Iraq, northern Iraq has become an arena for gangs, killings, and plundering. They are even stealing electricity poles and selling them in Iran. Therefore, great harm has been inflicted since 1991 when the U.S. and allied forces interfered in northern Iraq and supported gangs there. The harm done to the sons of our Kurdish people in Iraq is very great. There are epidemics there. Nothing is available there. People in northern Iraq are suffering greatly. There is no security. Killings and thefts are everywhere. This inflicts great harm on Iraq because that part of Iraq, northern Iraq, is a beloved part. It goes without saying that there are Arab parties -- we are not leveling accusations lightly but on the bases of facts and information -- which provide thse gangs with money and weapons. [Jayda'] The question of Arab reconciliation was supposed to top the agenda of the meeting of Arab foreign ministers. What is Iraq's role in Arab reconciliation? [Al-Sahhaf] You know that the Arab League secretary general has put forward an initiative for pan-Arab reconciliation. The initiative contains ideas and suggestions. The Arab League secretary general asked Arab states to make observations and comments on this initiative. As an Arab country that fully embraces pan-Arab action and joint Arab action, the initiative was given due attention. Thus, we studied it carefully and sent our observations to the secretary general. We criticized some paragraphs containing points which we thought were inaccurate and did not give the question its proper scope and should be developed to complete what was missing. On the other hand, we supported other paragraphs because we thought they were appropriate and correct. Therefore, we presented a mature, studied paper as a contribution from Iraq to the secretary general, upon his request, so that different views would lead to a feasible program that brings about pan-Arab reconciliation. [Jayda'] Mr. Minister, what are the latest developments in the relations with the West, particularly Iraqi-French relations? [Al-Sahhaf] You know that diplomatic relations with all European states, except Britain and France, remained in place. As for Britain and France, after agreeing with them, a section to look after interests was opened in their capitals. In turn, they have asked the embassies of some countries in Baghdad to look after their interests. Thus, relations continued to exist through this diplomatic channel. Relations in terms of trade, mutual interests, and the economy do not exist because of the Iraq embargo. However, I can characterize the relationship between Iraq and European nations as follows: Iraq's relationship with these countries, as reflected through companies, is a good relationship. Hundreds of European companies come to Baghdad. However, relations with governments exist only through an ordinary diplomatic channel and that is all. [Jayda'] Are their any developments in French relations? [Al-Sahhaf] Yes, regarding Iraqi-French relations, there has been a positive change in relations between the two countries, which was only natural because relations of cooperation and mutual interests between Iraq and France are broad and large and deserve careful consideration. The two countries have resumed coordination and activation of the previous relationship. We have covered a considerable distance in this regard, and the relationship between Iraq and France is now proceeding in the right direction. We hope it will continue along this road until it returns to its previous status, if not better. [Jayda'] Mr. Minister, is Iraq willing to normalize relations with the United States? [Al-Sahhaf] Even when the president of the United States was George Bush himself, who led the brute aggression against Iraq, we told the Americans we were willing to talk and to have an equal, serious dialogue. This proves that Iraq believes -- and we truly believe in this -- that dialogue is not to be held with one party alone, excluding others. As long as there are possible interests, we believe that the way to serve these interests is dialogue. We have no problem with that. We continue to call for dialogue, and if the same desire and political will are available for the other party, then there will be dialogue. This is a natural thing between all countries. [Jayda'] To conclude this conversation, I would like to know your assessment of the Arab foreign minister conference in Cairo at the Arab League? [Al-Sahhaf] This meeting did not address many substantive issues. There were several important issues on the agenda. However, these require further consideration and discussion to become mature enough and ready to make appropriate decisions on them. There were positive discussions that underline a mutual desire to see work develop within the Arab League and within other frameworks of joint Arab action. We think this approach should be promoted and supported to enable it to develop further. Regarding some hot issues, the Arab League, as you know, has adopted positive positions on these issues, such as the crime of the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque and support for the Palestinian people. There is active follow-up on economic issues. Credit here goes really to the activity of the Arab League secretary general and the General Secretariat of the Arab League. [Jayda'] Thank you Mr. Minister. [Al-Sahhaf] You are welcome.
