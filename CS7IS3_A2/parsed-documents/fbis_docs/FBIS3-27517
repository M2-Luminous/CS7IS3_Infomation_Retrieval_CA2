Li Peng stated in his letter: The aerospace industry occupies a very important position in China's economic construction and construction of national defense. It has been the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the CMC's consistent principle to maintain a momentum for developing China's aerospace industry and to step up the transfer of aerospace technology to the national economic construction. In the past 30 years or so, you have scored great achievements in and made contributions to the development of China's aerospace industry through unremitting efforts. I earnestly hope that, through this conference, you will further unify your thinking, change your concepts, seize the opportunity, deepen reform, and step up development on the basis of Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to make new contributions to enhancing China's defense capability, promoting national economic development, and increasing China's overall national strength. Liu Huaqing said in his letter: Now China has turned a new page in the aerospace industry to carry forward its development and forge ahead into the future. I hope you will keep your sacred missions firmly in mind, start from the world strategy and supreme interests of the state, greet challenges, keenly engage in reform, and bravely scale new heights in your industry to create a brighter future for the Chinese aerospace industry. State Councillor Song Jian attended and addressed the conference. He also expressed his ardent expectations of further developing the aerospace industry. The CAIC was established last year by reorganizing a former government organ, according to the decision of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, to meet the need to establish a socialist market economic system. In his report to the conference, President Liu Jiyuan said: During over one year of intense work, the aerospace front has smoothly completed institutional transformation and has brought many new reform measures into practice. Organs at various levels were streamlined, their work style changed moderately, and their efficiency rose to some extent. The industry has made great achievements in the fields of scientific research, production, development of civilian products, export, and separate management of military goods and civilian products, and has thus laid a foundation for further development. The new ideas for developing the aerospace industry are: "developing aerospace industry, stressing civilian products, improving economic returns, and marching toward the world." The industry's objectives of development by the year 2000 are: "making great developments in applied satellites and the application of satellites and industrializing them in earnest by successfully developing and manufacturing a new generation of telecommunications satellites, meteorological satellites, resource satellites, and new aerospace engineering; further modernizing weaponry; developing the CAIC into a high-tech and large-scale transnational conglomerate; marketing Chinese-made satellites and their parts and other civilian goods on the international market, after consolidating and strengthening the existing position of China's carrier rockets on the international market, to better serve people of the world; and, from now on, setting the average annual growth rate of this industry's total output value at 20 percent and its annual per capita productivity over 100,000 yuan, so that the aerospace industry will truly become one of the attractive industries.
