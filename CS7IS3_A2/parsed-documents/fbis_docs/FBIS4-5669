DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi, minister of health and welfare, hinted, however, at his disapproval of behind-the-scene deals among coalition parties over cabinet posts. "The new prime minister should select new cabinet ministers," he told reporters. Work on allocation of cabinet posts "must begin after procedures are worked out and a new prime minister is picked," Ouchi said. Ouchi's comment alluded to news reports that Social Democratic Party Secretary General Wataru Kubo is tipped to become new chief cabinet secretary under Hata, who is the head of Shinseito, the most influential force in the coalition.
