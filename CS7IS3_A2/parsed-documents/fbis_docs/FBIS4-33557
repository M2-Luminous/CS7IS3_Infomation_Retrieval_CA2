A second 1915 is threatening the country. What must we do? When the U.S. Marines landed in Haiti on 28 July 1915, most Haitians in the cities refused to understand. They were always sounding bugles, shouting freedom or death. They were always swearing that they would not let foreigners take the country of Dessalines again. But unfortunately, words are something and the decisions we make are something else. On 28 July 1915, there were Haitians who were impatiently awaiting the Americans . As in 1915, so it is today in 1994. That is 79 years of humiliation, mourning, torture against inhabitants in both the cities and the countryside. The dirty Haitian bourgeoisie has joined with a coarse, criminal Army to annihilate all the Haitian people and to help the Americans land again -- to weigh us down even more within the logic of the coup d'etat and the protection the Americans have sworn to provide as a reward to all the criminals who helped it stage the coup d'etat. There were Haitians who welcomed the Yankees in 1915 because they would bring industry, and consequently, the country's economy would progress. Today, in 1994, considering the U.S. plan for the Caribbean region within the framework of the New World Order, will the Americans be bringing industries and progress? If we closely examine what is going on today, we will realize that the Haitian situation is a real headache for the U.S. Government. Haiti is one of the most problematic countries in the region. Imperialism took many chances with all its previous governments, before the government of Titide Aristide. Nothing ever worked. All the money that was invested in development projects to prepare Haiti to enter the New World Order has vanished because most of that money was misused by dictators while the country remains underdeveloped despite the fact that the Americans felt they could cooperate with those outdated, bloodthirsty, and dictatorial governments that were previously in power in Haiti. Regarding Aristide, despite all the mistakes his government might have made, President Titide appeared as one of the most honest governments that ever led the country. But the Americans did not agree with this government's social project. So they dismissed it. It therefore looks more necessary for the United States to stage another military intervention in order to integrate the country into the framework of the New World Order, but without President Aristide. We are not talking about the [words indistinct] the 1915 seashore businessmen who always pretended to love Haitians, but who were always sucking the people's blood for advantages from foreign countries, their home countries. All these things show how forgetful we are. Why should we believe the United States would like us more than this Army of zenglendos and the bourgeoisie? Why would the United States be interested in coming to help us in 1994 when we consider that it prevented us from seeing the color of true democracy, which the entire Haitian people wanted to establish through the 16 December 1990 elections? What would prompt the United States, which refused to acknowledge our independence until the year 1895, to try to remove us from the sufferings we are experiencing now in 1994? If Haitians today think that another U.S. intervention will help us, it is also because we have tried to become conscious so we can really feel what is going on now in our little country. As early as 1898, during the war between Cuba and Spain, the U.S. Government began a gruesome game in the Caribbean Sea. Marines landed for the slightest reason. Americans were conquering. Cuba, Panama, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic were under their law. They were all being kicked. They were all working hard for the well-being of U.S. people, for the advantages of U.S. imperialism. Even recently, in the year 1990, after the Cold War period, after the disappearance of the eastern bloc, the Americans landed in Iraq and killed people to defend their own interests. Besides, what would prevent them from doing that because they are king everywhere, they are the policeman of the world. Despite all this and all that we do not say, we do not understand why we refuse to be cautious. We will end this talk here for today. Let us think, because once again, our lives are threatened.
