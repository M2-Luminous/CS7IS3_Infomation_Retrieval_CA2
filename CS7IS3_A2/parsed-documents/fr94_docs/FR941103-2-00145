FR941103-2-00145 FR941103-2-00081 Based on data from the FBI's National Crime Information Center, Volkswagen showed that the theft rate of the Toyota Cressida went from 4.7 (all figures provided are for thefts per thousand vehicles produced) in 1985 to 4.26 in 1986; the theft rate of the Toyota Supra went from 10.39 in 1985 to 2.79 in 1986; the theft rate of the Nissan Maxima went from 4.18 in 1984 to 1.99 in 1985; the theft rate of the Nissan 300ZX went from 8.74 in 1983/84 to 5.14 in 1989; and the theft rate of the Mazda RX&hyph;7 went from 12.11 in 1984 to a theft rate of 6.09 in 1989. For these reasons, Volkswagen believes that the antitheft system planned for installation on its MY 1995 A6 and S6 lines is likely to be as effective in reducing thefts as compliance with the parts marking requirements of part 541. NHTSA believes that there is substantial evidence indicating that the modified antitheft system planned to be installed as standard equipment on the MY 1995 Audi A6 and S6 car lines will likely be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with the requirements of the theft prevention standard (49 CFR part 541). This determination is based on the information that Volkswagen submitted with its petition and on other available information. The agency believes that the modified device will continue to provide the types of performance listed in section 543.6(a)(3): promoting activation; attracting attention to unauthorized entries; preventing defeat or circumventing of the device by unauthorized persons; preventing operation of the vehicle by unauthorized entrants; and ensuring the reliability and durability of the device. As required by 49 CFR section 543.6(a)(4), the agency also finds that Volkswagen has provided adequate reasons for its belief that the modified antitheft device will reduce and deter theft. This conclusion is based on the information Volkswagen provided on its device. This information included a description of reliability and functional tests conducted by Volkswagen for the antitheft device and its components. In 49 CFR 543.9, paragraph (h)(2)(ii) permits the agency to establish an effective date for the modification of the exemption earlier than ``the model year following the model year in which NHTSA issued the modification decision'' upon a showing of good cause by the manufacturer that an earlier effective date for modifying its exemption is consistent with the public interest and purposes of 49 U.S.C. section 33106. In its petition, Volkswagen stated that making the modification of its antitheft system effective beginning with MY 1995 is in the public interest since it would permit expeditious manufacture and sale of vehicles with the modified antitheft system as standard equipment. Volkswagen cited the 1990/91 theft data published by NHTSA in the Federal Register (59 FR 12400, March 16, 1994) shows that the Audi 100/200 car lines had a theft rate of 1.3564 (per thousand vehicles stolen), substantially below the 1990/91 theft rate of 3.5826. Volkswagen stated its belief that the antitheft device proposed for the MY 1995 Audi A6 and S6 car lines, with essentially the same device, will continue to have a theft rate well below the median. NHTSA has reviewed this showing of ``good cause'' and finds that making the modification of Volkswagen's petition effective beginning with the 1995 model year is consistent with the public interest and 49 U.S.C. section 33106. For the foregoing reasons, the agency hereby exempts the Volkswagen Audi A6 and S6 car lines that are the subject of this notice, in whole, from the requirements of 49 CFR part 541. If, in the future, Volkswagen decides not to use the exemption for the car line that is the subject of this notice, it should formally notify the agency. If such a decision is made, the car line must be fully marked according to the requirements under 49 CFR 541.5 and 541.6 (marking of major component parts and replacement parts). The agency notes that the limited and apparently conflicting data on the effectiveness of the pre-standard parts marking programs continue to make it difficult to compare the effectiveness of an antitheft device with the effectiveness of compliance with the theft prevention standard. The statute clearly invites such a comparison, which the agency has made on the basis of the limited data available. With implementation of the requirements of the ``Anti Car Theft Act of 1992,'' NHTSA anticipates more probative data upon which comparisons may be made. NHTSA notes also that if Volkswagen wishes in the future to modify the device on which this exemption is based, the company may have to submit a petition to modify the exemption. Part 543.7(d) states that a Part 543 exemption applies only to vehicles that belong to a line exempted under this part and equipped with the antitheft device on which the line's exemption is based. Further, section 543.9(c)(2) provides for the submission of petitions ``(t)o modify an exemption to permit the use of an antitheft device similar to but differing from the one specified in that exemption.'' However, the agency wishes to minimize the administrative burden which section 543.9(c)(2) could place on exempted vehicle manufacturers and itself. The agency did not intend in drafting Part 543 to require the submission of a modification petition for every change to the components or design of an antitheft device. The significance of many such changes could be de minimis. Therefore, NHTSA suggests that if the manufacturer contemplates making any changes the effects of which might be characterized as de minimis, it should consult the agency before preparing and submitting a petition to modify.
