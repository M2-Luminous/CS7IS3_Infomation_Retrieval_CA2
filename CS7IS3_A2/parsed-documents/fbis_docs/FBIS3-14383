Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid held a news conference, in which he stressed that the session was eventful and beneficial. He said that there is Arab interest and the highest level of coordination in making the Middle East region free from weapons of mass destruction. He added that there is a unified Arab concept on reassessing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty during 1995. He also said that the council decided to lift the boycott of Liberian companies that were on the boycott list. On the obstacles impeding Arab reconciliation, he said that the issue is still under study and, despite the passage of one year since this issue was raised, it still needs some time in view of the consequences of the Gulf crisis. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that some Arab countries' demand to amend the Arab League Charter does not mean closing the door on his initiative to set up the Arab Court of Justice and achieve Arab reconciliation. On Jerusalem, he said that the Arab League has reiterated its firm stand on the Arabism of Jerusalem and the inalienable Arab rights and that efforts are now being held at the highest levels on current Arab issues, such as Somalia, Yemen, and the Libyan-Western crisis. In this respect, he praised President Husni Mubarak's efforts to attain a peace declaration between the Somali factions. On Arab water security, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the Arab foreign ministers discussed this issue carefully and decided to have more studies on the protection of Arab waters.
