The 10-point programme worked out and published by President Kim Il-song on April 6, 1993, was adopted as a great political charter common to the nation at the Fifth Session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly. The programme outlines the general purpose of great national unity for founding an independent, peaceful and neutral pan-national unified state through the great unity of the whole nation, the ideological basis of great national unity for uniting on the basis of patriotism and the spirit of national independence, and the principle of unity for promoting co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests and subordinating everything to the cause of national reunification. The programme also comprehensively indicates practical ways for great national unity such as ending all political disputes and promoting trust and unity between the North and the South. Kim Yong sun, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, in his report, said that the 10-point programme, for the steadfast patriotic stand running through all its points and its fair content, serves as a most reasonable and realistic great political programme of national unity and a great charter of national reunification acceptable to all who truly love the country and the nation and want the reunification of the country, irrespective of idea and religious belief, system and political affiliation, and place of residence. "The 10-point programme evoked the full sympathy and support not only of the entire compatriots in the North, South and overseas but also of the revolutionary people worldwide as soon as it was published, and its invincible might and vitality have been eloquently proven through practical life," he stated. He called for rejecting the interference of outside forces and paving the way for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country with the great unity of the nation under the banner of the 10-point programme. To hasten national reunification through concerted efforts of the whole nation, both the North and the South must firmly maintain the principle of national independence. The South Korean authorities must relinquish the reckless confrontation and war moves, repeal the "National Security Law" hindering the nation's unity, dissolve the "Security Planning Board", stop suppressing the patriotic students and people who rose up for independence, democracy and reunification and set free, at once, all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience who are illegally detained. The United States must discontinue its unjustifiable campaign of pressure upon the DPRK and take a proper stance for a solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula through DPRK-U.S. talks. The United Nations Security Council must maintain a fair stand as an international organization, abandoning such unfair double standard attitude as not calling in question the United States and the South Korean authorities, its servants, increasing the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula and as turning a blind eye to the countries engaged in dangerous nuclear development under the aegis of the United States, while putting unjust pressure upon the DPRK which is conducting nuclear activities for peaceful purpose. The patriotic democratic movement organizations in South Korea and the organizations of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon) at home and abroad should intensify various forms of mass movement to implement the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and invigorate dialogues and contacts between the North, the South and the overseas sides. The meeting was attended by Pak Song-chol, Politburo member of C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea and vice-president, and other officials concerned.
