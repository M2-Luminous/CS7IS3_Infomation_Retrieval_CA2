FR940617-1-00078 FR940617-1-00012 The agency has carefully reviewed the comments, existing data, and other information, and is clarifying the effectiveness criteria for health-care antiseptics in this tentative final monograph. In order for an antiseptic ingredient to be generally recognized as effective for use as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and/or surgical hand scrub, it must have existing data from well designed clinical studies demonstrating effectiveness. The agency believes that it is important to correlate effectiveness data from clinical studies with effectiveness data from in vitro studies on the activity of the vehicle and active ingredient individually, so that the germicidal contribution of the antiseptic ingredient to the total formulation can be fully characterized. As stated in the testing guidelines in the previous tentative final monograph, at 43 FR 1240, ``*␣*␣* there should be demonstration that the formulated product is better than the vehicle alone. Testing of the complete formulation of Category III ingredients *␣*␣* is necessary to judge the importance of the vehicle in the release of the active ingredient as well as the influence of formulation on aspects of effectiveness *␣*␣*.'' The agency believes that information on the in vitro activity of the active ingredient alone helps to characterize its antiseptic activity independent of formulation and helps to further define formulation effects on the antimicrobial ingredient. Therefore, the agency is proposing that in vitro studies of the antimicrobial activity of health-care antiseptic drug products covered by §333.470(a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) be conducted on the active ingredient, the vehicle, and the final formulation. Manufacturers are to have such data in their files for products containing ingredients included in the monograph. In this amended tentative final monograph, the agency is proposing that the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the antiseptic ingredient, the vehicle, and the formulated product be characterized by the determination of their antimicrobial spectrum and by minimal inhibitory concentration determinations performed against selected organisms using methodology established by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratories Standards (NCCLS) (Ref. 1). Because the principal intended use of these health-care antiseptic drug products is the prevention of nosocomial or hospital acquired infections, the agency concludes that these products should be able to demonstrate in vitro activity against a microbial spectrum that reflects this use. Since 1970, the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System (NNIS) has collected and analyzed data on nosocomial pathogens reported to the Centers for Disease Control by a number of hospitals who perform prospective surveillance on nosocomial infections. These data provide an indication of the most frequently occurring pathogens at four major sites of nosocomial infection_the urinary tract, surgical wounds, lungs (pneumonia), and bloodstream. The agency believes that health-care personnel handwash, surgical hand scrub, and patient preoperative skin preparations should be able to demonstrate in vitro effectiveness against these pathogens as well as the normal resident skin flora. Therefore, the agency is proposing that micro-organisms associated with the most commonly occurring nosocomial infections and those found most often in nosocomial infections of high risk patients as reported by the NNIS, for the period from January 1985 through August 1988 (Ref. 2), be included in the list of micro-organisms to be tested in §333.470(a)(1)(ii). The agency further concludes that this proposed list identifies a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity that is also appropriate for home use antiseptic handwash products. The agency notes that neither filamentous dermatophytic fungi or viruses are included in the NNIS report. More recent studies (Refs. 3 and 4) have reported small numbers of nosocomial infections associated with both of these organisms. However, the new studies do not provide sufficient information to assess the relative importance of these organisms as a cause of nosocomial infection. Therefore, the agency is not proposing to include filamentous dermatophytic fungi in the list of micro-organisms to be tested, as proposed in the previous in vitro effectiveness testing guidelines (43 FR 1210 at 1241) and is continuing to propose that viruses also not be included. The agency recognizes that the list of organisms to be tested may need updating to assure that it remains reflective of current trends in the microbial etiology of nosocomial infections. The agency intends to update the list as new information becomes available. Further, the agency invites the submission of comments and specifically data on the role of other organisms, particularly viruses and filamentous dermatophytic fungi, in nosocomial infections. In addition to the characterization of the in vitro spectrum of activity, the agency believes that information on how rapidly these antimicrobial drug products achieve their antimicrobial effect is necessary. As a means of indicating how quickly these products achieve their antimicrobial effect, the agency is proposing in vitro time-kill curves of the formulated drug product as part of the testing requirements. The agency acknowledges that there is currently no accepted or standardized method that may be used in conducting this type of study and invites the submission of proposed methods that may be considered as applicable to this test. In §333.470(a)(1)(iv) of the proposed testing regulations, the agency provides guidance on the development of such methods. However, any time-kill studies submitted to the agency are to be conducted on a 10-fold dilution of the formulated product against the ATCC strains identified in §333.470(a)(1)(ii) of the proposed testing regulations and are to include enumeration at times at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 30 minutes.
