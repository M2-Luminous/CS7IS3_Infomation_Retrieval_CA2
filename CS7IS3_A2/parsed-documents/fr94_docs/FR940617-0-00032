FR940617-0-00032 FR940617-0-00005 4. Proposals shall be submitted on the forms furnished by the Owner and must be delivered in a sealed envelope addressed to the Owner. The name and address of the Bidder, its license number, if a license is required for bidding on a project by the State, and the date and hour of the opening of bids must appear on the envelope in which the Proposal is submitted. Proposals must be in ink or typewritten. No alterations or interlineations will be permitted, unless made, initialed, and dated before submission. 5. Prior to the submission of the Proposal, the Bidder shall make and shall be deemed to have made a careful examination of the Specifications, forms of Bidder's Proposal and Acceptance, and Contractor's Bond attached hereto, and shall become informed as to the location and characteristics of the proposed central office and remote terminal installations, features and services, the transportation facilities, the kind of facilities required before and during the delivery and installation of the equipment and materials, the general local conditions and all other matters that may affect the cost and the time of completion of the installations. Bidders will be required to comply with all applicable statutes, codes, and regulations, including those pertaining to the licensing of contractors and the ``Anti Kick-Back Acts,'' as amended, (40 U.S.C. 276c; 41 U.S.C. 51 et seq. ) and regulations issued pursuant thereto, and 18 U.S.C. 287, 874, 1001, as amended. 6. Each Proposal must be accompanied by a Bid Bond, in the form attached, or a certified check on a bank that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, payable to the order of the Owner, in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the maximum possible bid price. The maximum possible bid price is the sum of the total base bid, spare parts, maintenance tools and all positive amounts for alternates. Each Bidder agrees that, if its Proposal is one of the three low Proposals, its Bid Bond or check shall be held by the Owner until a Proposal is accepted and Contractor's Bond, when required, is furnished by the successful Bidder and such acceptance has been approved by the Administrator, or for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the date hereinbefore set for the opening of Proposals whichever period shall be the shorter. If such Proposal is not one of the three low Proposals, the Bid Bond or check will be returned to the Bidder within a period of thirty (30) days. 7. The successful Bidder will be required to furnish to the Owner a Contractor's Bond in conformance with the requirements of 7 CFR part 1788, subpart C, Insurance for Contractors, Engineers, and Architects. 8. Should the successful Bidder fail or refuse to furnish a Contractor's Bond within thirty (30) days after written notification of the award of the Contract by the Owner, the Bidder will be considered to have abandoned the Proposal. In such event, the Owner shall be entitled (a) to enforce the Bid Bond in accordance with its terms, or (b) if a certified check has been delivered with the Proposal, to retain from the proceeds of the certified check the difference (not exceeding the amount of the certified check) between the amount of the Proposal and such larger amount for which the Owner may in good faith contract with another party to construct the Project(s). The term ``successful Bidder'' shall be deemed to include any Bidder whose Proposal is accepted after another Bidder has previously refused or has been unable to execute the Contract or to furnish a Contractor's Bond. 9. If requested by the Owner or the Administrator, the Bidder shall furnish evidence, satisfactory to the Owner and the Administrator, that the Bidder has the necessary facilities, ability, and financial resources to perform the Contract. 10. The Contract, when executed, shall be deemed to include the entire agreement between the parties thereto and neither party shall claim any modification thereof resulting from any representation or promise made at any time by any officer, agent, or employee of the other or by any other person. 11. The Owner reserves the right to waive minor irregularities or minor errors in any Proposal, if it appears to the Owner that such irregularities or errors were made through inadvertence. Any such irregularities or errors so waived must be corrected on the Proposal in which they occur prior to the execution of any Contract which may be awarded thereon. Failure to provide a Bid Bond or check as specified in item six (6) above is not a minor irregularity. 12. The Owner reserves the right to reject any or all Proposals. 13. The equipment to be furnished for all central offices and remote switching terminals included in the Proposal is to be of one and the same basic design. A Proposal submitted on any other basis will not be considered. 14. Equal Opportunity and Employment (a) The Offeror's or Bidders's attention is called to the ``Equal Opportunity Clause'' and the ``Standard Federal Equal Employment Specifications'' set forth herein. (b) The goals and timetables for minority and female participation, expressed in percentage terms for the Contractor's aggregate workforce in each trade on all construction work in the covered area, are as follows:
