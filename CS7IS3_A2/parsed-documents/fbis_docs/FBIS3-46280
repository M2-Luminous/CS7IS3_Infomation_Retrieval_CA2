He pointed out that railway operation must also be adapted to the market economy, and the change must be made resolutely. Han Shubin reminded railway personnel throughout the country to clearly notice the current difficulties: Railway transportation is in serious short supply, and is far from meeting the needs of rapid development of the national economy. The railway system is operating in a difficult condition, and the whole trade is running in the red. The shortage of construction funds is increasing, and this seriously constrains railway development. The foundation for industrial safety is not solid enough, and there remain a lot of hidden perils. He said: The basic industrial attributes of the railway system and the short transportation capacity also make it harder to change the management and operation structure. However, if the railway system does not carry out in-depth reform and does not move into the market economy, it will encounter even greater difficulties. In 1994, the Ministry of Railways will focus the reform on the measures of adopting the corporate system on a trial basis, transforming the government institution functions, promoting railway construction joint ventures, and expanding the scope of opening up. Han Shubin pointed out: The adoption of the corporate system should proceed according to the characteristics of this trade. The main forms should be sole corporations and limited-liability corporations. This year, the Fuzhou Railway Subbureau will start the pilot scheme for reorganizing itself into a corporation; the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Corporation will carry out the pilot scheme for adopting the joint-stock system, and arrangements will be made to list its shares on stock exchanges; the pilot scheme for adopting the joint-stock system will also be carried out intensively in the Nanning Railway Corporation, and will be extended to the whole of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau if conditions are ripe. Han Shubin stressed the need to grasp the opportunity as international capital is interested in investing in China's railway construction, and called for further opening up this aspect. When expanding the use of government-arranged foreign loans, the railway system should also make efforts to attract more direct foreign investments and to set up more cooperative production projects. Han Shubin mentioned, for the first time, the need to make full use of Hong Kong's role as an international financial and entrepot trade center and to develop the railway system's operation in Hong Kong. At the same time, it is necessary to increase economic exchanges with neighboring countries and regions, greatly develop international coordinated transport, especially transport across the continental bridge and by container transport, and encourage the exportation of railway products, labor services, and technologies. It is learned that in 1994, China's investment in railway construction will be 29 billion yuan. There will be seven key construction projects, namely, the Beijing-Kowloon railway, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway, the Baoji-Zhongwei railway, the Houma- Yueshan railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway, the Nanning-Kunming railway, and the West Beijing Station. In the whole year, 2,100 kilometers of new railway lines will be laid; and 1,335 kilometers of railway lines will be turned into double-track lines. In 1994, the railway transportation plan will arrange the transport of 1.56 billion tonnes of freight and the transport of 640 million tonnes of coal. When formulating these targets, the authorities gave consideration to the fact that the additional capacity of railway transport will not be large, the reconstruction projects along some existing railway lines may affect the railway operation to a larger extent, the size of capital construction in the whole country will be cut down appropriately, the market demand for coal transport will change, and passenger transport demand will increase. Reportedly, railway development will be facing a serious shortage of funds in 1994. The railway system will operate in the red and the business deficit will amount to 7 billion yuan.
