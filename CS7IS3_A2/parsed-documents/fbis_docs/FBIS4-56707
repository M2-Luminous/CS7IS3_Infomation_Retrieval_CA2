How do you feel today? [Endara] I must say I am happy and proud to be a Panamanian. I am happy because when I went out to vote, I saw in the faces of the Panamanian people the same pride I felt. People feel proud of their democracy and freedom. That makes me very happy as president and as a Panamanian citizen. [Reyna] What institutions do you think helped you in your democratic work? [Endara] Many. I must mention the Public Force, in particular the National Police. Five years ago, this body was an Army with military training. Today, the police are performing their duties by helping voters cast their votes and preserve order. The Supreme Court of Justice has played a very important role, not just because it has remained independent of the executive branch. Not only that, when the executive branch overstepped its duties regarding rights -- thank God, it did very few times -- the Court ruled against us and we abided by its decision immediately because we know this Court is very responsible. I must also thank the Legislative Assembly. Although I do not enjoy a majority there, it has supported me when fundamental proposals, such as the Electoral Code, have been presented. In general, I must thank government and opposition parties because they handled the campaign very well and enjoyed democracy. [Reyna] What advice would you give the candidate who comes out the winner, after all of the votes in the ballot boxes are counted? [Endara] To protect these democratic institutions we have put to work during this brief period of time, he should protect and preserve them so they can mature. It would be criminal to let something so beautiful be ruined. I would say this should be the primary concern. [Reyna] Mr. President, a message for the 18 countries of the continent of America who are watching us through Cadena Sur? [Endara] I thank all Latin American friendly countries for the support they have given Panama in its struggle for democracy and freedom. We have always appreciated this support. We expect them to continue supporting us now that we live in freedom and democracy so this democratic experiment can continue and we can live in a free, democratic America.
