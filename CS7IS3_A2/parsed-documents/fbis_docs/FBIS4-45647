Balandina: "Marine Inspection Will Be Intensified"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Border Troops are responsible people. So, in the same serious manner as they are equipping their new base, they have begun to perform their primary task -- protection of our oblast's sea borders. They will be facing even more tasks beginning this spring. The Border Troops Kaliningrad Group commander and the Oblast Environment Protection Committee chairman have approved a plan for cooperation between the Border Troops marine group and the environment protection committee. I attended a joint meeting of the unit, at which 14 officers and warrant officers, who had gone through special training, received certificates from the Oblast Environment Committee as nonsalaried staff members. During the ceremony, Marine Inspection chief T.I. Gryn expressed her confidence that the engagement of the Border Troops staff and equipment will help to improve protection of the fish population, detain ships violating regulations, monitor sea pollution by oil, waste, and soil, as well as to constantly control extraction of amber, and in the future, also oil from platforms. Ships patrolling internal and territorial waters, the continental shelf, and the Russian Federation's economic zone, will either take on board Oblast Environment Committee inspectors, or they themselves will perform such duties, as nonsalaried staff members. Having discovered violations, they, as inspectors, will fill out protocols of detention. The cooperation plan also envisions a permanent exchange of information on the situation in controlled regions and the location of foreign industrial or scientific-research vessels. The results of patrols and plans for future cooperation will be discussed every week at briefings with the participation of Marine Inspection representatives. Undoubtedly, such close cooperation will significantly intensify control over protected waters, and will bring an end to illegal fishing by foreign vessels. The Border Troops have already begun to implement the cooperation plan.
