The governments of the United States and Japan held their first security consultative committee meeting under the new format in Tokyo on March 11, 1994. Representing the United States were Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Undersecretary of Defense Frank G. Wisner. Representing Japan were Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Tsutomu Hata and Director General of the Defense Agency Kazuo Aichi. 2. The two sides affirmed that the U.S.-Japan alliance has grown stronger and has increased in importance in the post-Cold War period. The treaty of mutual cooperation and security between Japan and the United States of America, the basis of the bilateral security relationship for almost 35 years, remains vital to the maintenance of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. The two sides noted that the security treaty also constitutes the foundation of our political partnership, which is pivotal to peace and stability in the world. The vigorous partnership between the United States and Japan, based on strong bilateral security ties, is also an essential element of an emerging Pacific community. 3. The United States reiterated its commitment to maintaining a strong, forward-deployed military presence in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. also expressed appreciation for Japan's high-level host nation support, for the provision of facilities and areas for use by U.S. forces in Japan, and for the hospitality of host communities. These are valuable contributions to the effective forward deployment of U.S. forces and thereby to our mutual security. The two sides confirmed the importance of Japan continuing such host nation support, and agreed to start consultations on this in the coming months, taking into consideration that the current special measures agreement is to expire at the end of March 1996. The continued harmonious use of facilities and areas by U.S. forces in Japan is indispensable to deterrence and the readiness of U.S. forces in Japan. At the same time, the understanding and cooperation of host communities are essential to the smooth and effective operation of the security treaty. Both sides are determined to continue their cooperation on issues related to facilities and areas provided to U.S. forces. In this context, the two sides pledged to continue their efforts for consolidation and realignment of facilities and areas, particularly in Okinawa, consistent with the purposes of the security treaty and U.S. operational requirements. 4. The two sides stressed the importance of interoperability and complementary defense cooperation. They also noted that cooperation in acquisition and defense technology exchange has contributed to the effective operation of the security arrangements and enhancement of mutual security. In this connection, the two sides stressed the importance of expanding the two-way flow of defense technology. 5. The stability of the Korean peninsula is of vital interest to both the United States and Japan. The two countries have worked closely together on the North Korean nuclear issue. The two sides reaffirmed that a diplomatic solution is the best means of resolving the issue. They insist on North Korea's full compliance with all of its international commitments, including the Nonproliferation Treaty. The two sides endorsed efforts to enhance regional political and security dialogues and welcomed the convening of the ASEAN regional forum. They noted the need to increase the transparency of defense plans and expenditures among the nations of the Asia-Pacific region in order to enhance their shared sense of security. 6. The two sides emphasized that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles poses a serious challenge to our mutual security and that it is important to counter such threats. The United States and Japan continue to discuss theater missile defense in bilateral security consultations.
