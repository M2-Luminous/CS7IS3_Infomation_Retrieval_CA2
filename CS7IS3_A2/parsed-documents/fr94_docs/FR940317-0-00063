FR940317-0-00063 FR940317-0-00022 For frequent issuers, current information can be disseminated in official statements for new offerings, and thus is readily available without the preparation of a separate annual financial report. Regardless of the form of document relied upon to provide the marketplace with information concerning the financial condition of the issuer or obligor, to minimize risk of misleading investors, issuers or obligors should provide, as discussed above with respect to primary offerings: •Financial statements that are audited in accordance with GAAS (or disclosure of the absence of such an audit) and that are either prepared in accordance with GAAP, or accompanied by a quantified explanation of material deviations from GAAP or a full explanation of the accounting principles used; •Other pertinent financial and operating information (depending on the type of issuer and security sold), as well as the sources for repayment_of course, a variety of information may be appropriate for an issuer with a range of outstanding securities with differing characteristics, from general obligation to revenue and conduit bonds; and •A narrative discussion that analyzes the issuer's or obligor's financial condition, and results of operations, as well as facts likely to have a material impact on the issuer or obligor. Clarity and conciseness are equally relevant concerns with respect to ongoing disclosures, as with official statements. As discussed above with respect to offering statements, as a general matter, the annual financial information may reasonably be expected to be made available within six months of the issuer's fiscal year end. 97 For some conduit entities, annual information may not be sufficient and investors may need more frequent periodic financial information. Under guidelines developed by the National Council of State Housing Agencies, for example, current information on loan portfolio status is compiled and disseminated to information repositories on a quarterly basis. 98 Similar ongoing disclosure on a periodic basis appears appropriate for analogous conduit municipal financings such as structured student loan programs, housing and health care financings. 97 See Section III.C.3.d. above. 98 State Housing Guidelines. 2. Event Disclosure In addition to periodic information, to assure that participants in the secondary market base their investment decisions on current information, commentators have called for timely disclosure of events that materially reflect on the creditworthiness of municipal securities issuers and obligors and the terms of their securities. There is a general consensus among participants in the municipal securities market that investors need information about the following events, among others, where material: 99 99 In 1990, the American Bankers Association Corporate Trust Committee drafted a proposal identifying 16 factors that it believed were important for issuers to disclose to bondholders and the marketplace. American Bankers Association Corporate Trust Committee, Proposed Disclosure Guidelines for Corporate Trustees (ABA Draft for Discussion Purposes) (June 12, 1990) (``ABA 1990 Guidelines''). As published in final form in September of 1991 (``ABA 1991 Guidelines''), the Guidelines contained a nonexclusive list of five types of events that could be disclosed by notice to a repository. Numerous market participants have referenced the ABA draft proposal, or variations of that proposal, as a starting point for identifying straightforward, nonjudgmental, categories of events that call for prompt disclosure. An addendum to the Joint Statement provided four examples of ``significant information'' that the participants considered appropriate for disclosure. The nonexclusive examples were (1) nontechnical defaults, (2) draws from a debt service reserve fund, (3) failure to make a regularly scheduled payment, and (4) any draws on any credit enhancement. Joint Statement, Addendum. The list set forth above is drawn from these proposals. a. Principal and interest payment delinquencies b. Nonpayment-related defaults c. Unscheduled draws on reserves d. Unscheduled draws on credit enhancements e. Substitution of credit or liquidity providers, or their failure to perform f. Adverse tax opinions or events affecting the tax-exempt status of the security g. Modifications to rights of security holders h. Bond calls i. Defeasances j. Matters affecting collateral k.
