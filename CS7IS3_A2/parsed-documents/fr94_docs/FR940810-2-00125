FR940810-2-00125 FR940810-2-00075 6. To ensure compliance with the ``refund'' requirements that are, in effect, imposed by Rules 6e&hyph;3(T) (b)(13)(ii) and (d)(1) in the event of a surrender during the second Policy year, the Companies will agree in the Policies to waive a portion of the CDSC, equal to 20% of premiums paid in the second Policy year, up to one base Policy target premium. 7. Although this waiver formula has been designed to ensure that no violation of Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(v)(A) will occur, the formula can result in the imposition of a CDSC that is lower than what the rule would permit. To that extent, the expiration of the waiver after the end of the second Policy year could be deemed to cause an increase in the CDSC that would be prohibited under the stair-step provisions. 8. The Applicants represent that the CDSC never increases as a percentage of base Policy target premiums paid in each year, except to the extent that the expiration of the partial waiver of the CDSC after the end of the second Policy year is deemed to cause such an increase. The Applicants further represent that the sole purpose of the partial waiver is to implement the sales load refund mandated by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(B)(13)(v)(A) and (d)(1). 9. The Applicants submit that it would be anomalous if the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder were to prohibit the expiration of the partial waiver after the end of the second Policy Year_ i.e., at the very time when, under the specific terms of Rule 6e&hyph;3(T), the Companies' obligations to make the waiver expires. The Applicants further submit that the fact that the waiver formula can result in a lower CDSC than might be permitted under Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) is a clear benefit to Policy Owners. Applicants' Conclusion Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in pertinent part, that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security of transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of the 1940 Act, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the reasons expressed in this application, the Applicants submit that the requested exemption from Section 27(a)(3) of the 1940 Act and Rules 6e&hyph;3(T) (b)(13)(ii) and (d)(1) thereunder meet the standards of Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
