He pointed to the importance of Syria's participation in the ongoing peace efforts. Arriving in Taba this morning to lead the Palestinian delegation to the meetings of the Gaza-Jericho Committee, Sha'th said the Palestinians want progress in every direction and on every track of the Arab-Israeli negotiations to achieve a comprehensive peace in the region. Sha'th said that during the new round of talks, which will begin today, he and the Israeli delegation will discuss the border crossings, the size of the Jericho area, and the Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. He expressed the hope that topics relating to the transfer of civilian authority to the Palestinians will be wound up during this round. He stressed that the Palestinian side has a real desire to negotiate during this round. He said he hoped the Israeli side has the same desire. He said the Palestinian stance has not changed, indicating that it is awaiting Israel's reply to the papers it presented earlier. Dr. Sha'th noted that the Palestinians will participate in the coming round of Arab-Israeli talks in Washington, noting that there has been too much delay in resuming these talks. Dr. Sha'th called for a quick transfer of power in the West Bank and for holding legislative elections in the occupied territories in July 1994. Dr. Sha'th said the new round of talks in Taba was delayed because he was in Tunis, where he briefed the Palestinian leadership on the outcome of the last round of meetings of the Gaza-Jericho Committee. He stressed that any progress in the meetings of this committee will positively affect the meetings of the Economic Committee in Paris next week.
