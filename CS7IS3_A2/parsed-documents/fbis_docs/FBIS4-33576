The case originated in a previous decision ordering a raid on and seizure of the transmitters of the General San Martin FM radio station, which was operating illegally. The station owner filed a petition to annul the decision saying that the station's activity could not be classified as a crime or even an "administrative violation," and questioning the Federal Police's authority to seize the transmitters. Judge Alvarez Canale said the seizure "is perfectly admissible in our legislation and does not violate any constitutional guarantees." The judge also said that Decree No. 332/89 authorizes not only the Federal Police but also all security organizations, if they have a federal court order, to close stations, lower antennas, or seize the equipment used by clandestine stations. The National Telecommunications Commission (CNT) with Federal Police support closed five clandestine FM radio stations in Chubut, four in Trelew, and one in Madryn. So far the Federal Committee for Broadcasting (Confer) has closed and seized the transmitting equipment of more than 800 radio and television stations throughout the country.
