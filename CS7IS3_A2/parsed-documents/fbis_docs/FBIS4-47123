Their relations are developing based on the "European" (negotiation) type. The Baltic version seems to be the most predictable and the least disastrous. Therefore, it is making it possible to delve calmly into the intertwining of those problems which must be solved by Russia and the West in the search for new principles of foreign policy and European security. However, as the English proverb goes, "it takes two to make love or war." A divorce becomes civilized if both parties observe agreed-upon and generally accepted rules of behavior. In this sense, Russia has moved ahead much farther on the path to compatibility with the world community. It has already withdrawn or is withdrawing from the Baltic countries troops which may not be on the territory of another state against its will. In the area of economics, Russia is also offering the Baltic States good relations. Latvia has been granted most favored nation status. The transit of Russian freight and the proximity of the Russian financial market are ensuring, to a great extent, the prosperity of the former republics: Latvia is laying claim to the role of the "Baltic Switzerland," while Estonia is claiming that of the "Baltic Hong Kong." Russia has even met the Baltic States halfway in moral questions. In particular, agreement has been expressed with the Latvian side in the condemnation of the 1940 occupation and the postwar repressions. Russia has covered its half of the path to a "civilized divorce," having given up much and having lost much. The Baltic Republics have succeeded greatly in their economic and political "jump" toward the West: a program has been outlined, along with time frames, for their gradual integration into the European economic system and their insertion into the security structures is also proceeding at a gradual pace. But the ticket to Europe has been issued to these countries, it seems, prematurely. The Baltic States have quite a few unhealthy "small problems" capable of becoming the source of a threat to security in the post-confrontation era. Building up in the region is the potential for internal instability engendered by ethnic confrontation, political extremism, economic jerks and innovations, to which society is unable to adapt. Not precluded is the threat of a local military conflict. The "Baltic Perimeter" of Russia's borders, so safe at first glace, is not without danger for Europe. From the standpoint of culture and civilization, the Baltic States have always been drawn toward the West and and it is in this sense that their current "departure" has taken place. Undoubtedly, the "pieces of the historical past" left in them (the Russian-speaking population and the economic and military infrastructures) and the geopolitical situation are still keeping them within Russia's gravitational field. The Baltic dualism, which, in individual matters, is changing into acute incompatibility, is expanding the "dispute" area for possible collisions between Russia and the West. The chief danger lies in the fact that the Baltic countries are rushing into Europe without being sufficiently "European." First of all, they will hardly be able to fit the image of a European state by subjecting the Russian-speaking population to discrimination. In Latvia and Estonia, these people are viewed as "colonists" and have been deprived of citizenship or have had their civil rights infringed upon. The local parties' approaches to the solution of this problem are often of a destructive nature -- from proposals which bring to mind associations with genocide and ethnic cleansing to "civilized segregation" in the spirit of the declarations of Estonian President Lennert Meri that "the rights of citizens and non-citizens will be protected." However, this assumes the preservation of the division of Estonia's population into first-class and second-class citizens. That The Baltic States are not mature enough for a "civilized divorce" from Russia and a final "attachment" to the West is also becoming apparent in the territorial claims against Russia, which Estonia is raising especially importunately and which manifestly look like a political anachronism. This is the kind of baggage the Baltic countries are bringing with them into a united Europe and inserting into its security structures, having already become associate members of the Western European Union and participants in the "Partnership for Peace" and hoping to find themselves in NATO in the near future. The independent Baltic States, it seems, do not fully realize the responsibility which indepence imposes on then. The excessive aggressiveness with which the Baltic countries are trying to become members of NATO or to obtain guarantees of Western military assistance is threatening to make this region a middleman in the aggravation of relations between Russia and the West. For the time being, Russia is bearing with restraint the multilateral damage which the departure of the Baltic republics is inflicting on it. It has been deprived of many bases and has lost important parts of the PRO and PVO [ABM and Air Defense] systems. Serious and costly restructuring of the entire strategic military infrastructure of Russia's western oblasts, which were formerly rear-area oblasts and have now turned out to be forward-area oblasts, is needed. The communications system with Kaliningrad Oblast has been undermined. Russia's geostrategic losses are measured not simply by the loss of its position in the Baltic region. Within the framework of NATO, a special "Baltap" command has been established, the area of responsibility of which has been declared to be the entire Baltic Sea, right up to the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia. Its everyday tasks include the development of all types of cooperation in the region -- between NATO and Western Europe, on the one hand, and the former socialist countries, including Russia and and the Baltic States, on the other. However, it can take upon itself the function of protection of the Baltic States from an aggressor -- Russia, although, within Baltap, it is considered a highly unlikely one. By exaggerating fears about Russia's "imperial ambitions" and hurrying too rapidly into NATO, the Baltic States are provoking feelings of heightened vulnerability in Russian military and political circles. The prospect of turning out to be on one of NATO's flanks, irrespective of the conditions of Russia's own participation in the "Partnership for Peace," may stimulate in them a desire to take preventive measures. We have before us the "Baltic Paradox": while trying in every way possible to sever the bonds of the past, Latvia and Estonia are doing all they can to strengthen a common future with Russia. Not having solved the problem of citizenship and thereby leaving within themselves a "Russian Enclave," they are postponing their own prospects for becoming the "far abroad" and are preserving for Russia the right to keep them within the focus of its own "near" interests. The territorial claims and the ardor for NATO are creating the impression that it is advantageous for the Baltic countries to maintain a smoldering and controllable tension in relations with Russia. But it is hardly effective as a "trump card for bargaining" with Russia and the West. If this is a method of national identification, then it is too dangerous. In striving for a "civilized divorce," the Baltic States are proving to be insufficiently "civilized" for it. While parting with Russia, the Baltic States are still not ready to join Europe.
