In this daira located in the wilaya of Bouira, 66 people suspected of being infected have been hospitalized, and 46 cases have been confirmed. According to health officials, a water-line break between 0900 and 1200 may have been responsible for the epidemic. The rupture is believed to have allowed waste water to seep into potable water conduits. Dr. Ouahdi, head of the national program to combat waterborne diseases, says the epidemic could have been avoided if local authorities had paid attention to warnings from daira health officials. These reports noted problems in the potable water system. "Samples taken in various parts of the daira have shown the absence of chlorine. This proves that the potable water was not treated even [text missing] epidemic," our source said. Readers are reminded that the same cause was cited as responsible for a similar epidemic in Guelma (196 cases) and Saida (104 cases) in July of last year. Tiaret reported 500 cases of typhoid fever in the second half of 1993. To avert a pandemic, disease prevention officials in the Health Ministry are working in two ways to address problems in contaminated zones. The first line of action is long term and will involve renovation of pipes and improvement of chemical and bacteriological monitoring in the potable water treatment system. The second, for immediate implementation, involves warning people in areas affected by the epidemic to take special hygiene precautions and augmenting chlorine levels in the water towers. In the same context, the Health Ministry early this month created "an antidiphtheria operational group" headed by Professor Dif and consisting of the directors of various health agencies (INSP [National Public Health Institute], Pasteur Institute, ENAPHARM [National Pharmaceuticals Company], etc.). By conducting regular briefings for the medical corps and local authorities in areas affected by the epidemic, the committee will promote wide dissemination of information about this contagious airborne epidemic and means of prevention. "There were some deaths when the epidemic first broke out, because doctors did not recognize the disease," said Professor Dif, director of the Health Ministry's prevention service. The diphtheria epidemic seems to be almost completely under control now, with only two active centers of contagion presenting the risk of further infection: one at Tizi-Ouzou (87 cases and six deaths) and the other at Ghardaia (79 cases but no deaths). In that connection, Professor Dif assures us that vaccination coverage will be provided. "We do not, of course, have vaccines in the industrial quantities needed to conduct a nationwide vaccination campaign, but we are in a position to treat the epidemic now under way," he said.
