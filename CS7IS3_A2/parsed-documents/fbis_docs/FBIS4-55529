How do you remember it now, more than a week after your accident? What actually happened? [Horn] I told the police that we were traveling at about 90 km an hour. I know this precisely, because we were joking about it just before the accident. I saw a flash in front of us on the road but I do not remember anything more because the driver swerved and we crashed. It is a fact that the truck did not have any lights on; it is a fact that there was nobody in front of us to overtake and that the road was completely dry. Thus the circumstances would have been right -- barring something untoward -- for us to avoid this stupid accident. [passage omitted] [Laszlo] The question arises whether you will accept the nomination for prime minister. [Horn] Well, look, it depends on my party's decision. We decided, and it was adopted by the congress at the end of February, that once the coalition negotiations are completed, a special congress will make the final decision in personnel matters. If this body, by expressing the opinion of the membership, decides that Gyula Horn is suitable for this task, naturally, I will not run away from the responsibility. I will accept the responsibility. [passage omitted] The important thing is that the future economic decisionmakers in the cabinet should have total power. What went on here for four years -- when the leader of the economic decisionmaking body was changed nearly every year -- was untenable. However, before anyone can accuse me of pushing my party's interests, let me tell you that I have never volunteered for any post; I was always asked. If the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] wins the elections and decides to nominate me for prime minister, naturally I will say yes. If not, it is not the end of the world for me. [Laszlo] [passage omitted] The press reported earlier that the MSZP might be willing not only to form a coalition with the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], but perhaps also with the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] or the Christian Democrats. What is the situation now? [Horn] There are no coalition negotiations under way with any party. I have to add, of course, that a kind of preliminary consultation is under way. [passage omitted] We are open to the SZDSZ. Naturally, this openness could decrease if a certain tone or style got the upper hand within the SZDSZ, which we would not be pleased to see. As for Fidesz, well, it suffered a serious loss in the elections. Unfortunately, the style of statements made by some Fidesz leaders during the election campaign sometimes resembled the extreme right. Under these circumstances it would be very difficult for the MSZP to achieve an agreement with representatives of this style. Regarding the Christian Democrats, we said at the end of February that we are ready to cooperate with the Christian Democratic People's Party, to be precise, if it sheds its extremist tendencies. Well, I do not see many signs of this being done. [Laszlo] MSZP leaders have often said that they do not wish to conduct any kind of spring cleaning -- either on a large scale or a small scale. How do you envision the running of offices in the next tenure of government? [Horn] The prime minister and the political state secretaries have to go when there is a change of government. As to whether the administrative state secretaries will go or stay, in my mind this is up to a personal and subjective decision. In the case of the deputy state secretaries, their professional performance has to be examined. These will be our guiding principles if we are in this position. To my mind there are very many who worked very well in the past four years. [Laszlo] How do you envision the oft-mentioned social consensus or agreement, in which employers, employees, and politics would all participate? [Horn] We have issued a letter of intent regarding the organization of an economic and social agreement. The goal is to create an agreement between the government and the interest protection organizations of the employers and employees, but not only on social issues. For example, the reform of the budget must be started by all means, that is, the reform of the large-scale system of distribution. There is a need for a new privatization practice or policy. The opportunity must be created for a new modernization program, that is, over and above privatization something real and genuine should take place in the modernization of the economy. Because, contrary to all other talks, one of the facts of the past four years is: first, modernization has not begun in the economy. Second, productivity has declined. The recovery of Hungarian agriculture and currency can be considered a national issue. Naturally, on the issues of income, taxation, social security, and the health service, agreement must be reached in the most concrete manner, in writing and in public. For in the next period everything must be done in public. There is a need for the greatest degree of self-restraint on behalf of every participant in social and political public life. For nobody can produce a miracle here. It is impossible to raise the standard of living suddenly from nothing and to improve social services. However, improvement can be achieved by a much better and much fairer distribution system. [Laszlo] The party faced accusations earlier that a certain section of the party is inclined to initiate some sort of restoration. These accusations can still be heard today. [Horn] The MSZP does not want any kind of restoration, for example renationalization. Our goal and basic philosophy is to create a social market economy and a market economy cannot be built without a considerable proportion of private ownership. The newly and legally acquired property of new owners must not be touched. Just as the church properties must not be touched either. Compensation: We were against it in parliament, but now we want to finish it. We want to complete it. What the previous government and parliament pledged must be completed. However, it must be finished as soon as possible, as early as in 1995. There is no chance for any kind of restoration, for anybody who contemplates this is bound to be defeated and we do not want to be defeated but to succeed.
