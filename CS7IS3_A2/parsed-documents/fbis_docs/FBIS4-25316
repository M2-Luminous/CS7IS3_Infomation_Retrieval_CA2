The funds will be issued as payments instead of relief funds to farmers for their work on highway construction projects in poverty-stricken areas. Yang Zhong, deputy director of the leading group of the aid-the-poor projects under the State Council, recently noted at a conference in Guiyang that it is one of the measures taken by the central government to help improve communications conditions in poverty-stricken areas. Since 1985, the departments of communications in the related provinces and autonomous regions have constructed about 150,000 kilometers of highways in rural areas, including roads for farm machines. The highways link more than 1,500 towns and 10,000 villages. According to Yang, now there are still 1,700 townships and more than 17,000 villages in China which have no access to highways. He said that most of the villages and townships are in the poverty-stricken regions in the central and western parts of the country. He said that the construction of highways should be placed at the top of the economic development agenda in poverty-stricken regions. Such projects are expected to promote the growth of the market economy and break the isolation of the regions.
