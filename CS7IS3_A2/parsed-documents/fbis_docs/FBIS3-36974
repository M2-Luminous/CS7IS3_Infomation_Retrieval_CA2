The discussion of the first version of the draft law several days ago was too passionate, and the draft law did not get the needed number of votes. Today the document was approved by the majority of deputies. Following the coming into force of the new constitution and the need for bringing legislative acts of subjects of the Russian Federation into line with it, as well as in connection with elections to the representative bodies of power and local government bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, at which violations of the federal legislation took place, the State Duma resolved to give some recommendations to the president of the Russian Federation as the guarantor of the constitution, of human rights and freedoms. It recommended to the president to take measures for putting an end to the violation of electoral rights of individuals and the rights of local government bodies in the legal acts of subjects of the Russian Federation, adopted by their executive authorities, including a possible suspension of those legal acts. In the opinion of the State Duma, it is also necessary to take measures for bringing into line with the new Russian Constitution the presidential decrees and normative acts of subjects of the Russian Federation, which regulate general principles of the organisation of representative and executive bodies of state power of subjects of the Russian Federation, as well as of local government authorities. It was suggested to bodies of state power of subjects of the Russian Federation, the Russian prosecutor-general and the Central Electoral Commission that they take measures for bringing into line with the Russian Constitution and legislation legal acts of subjects of the Russian Federation on the election of bodies of state power and local government authorities. The Committee for the Affairs of the Federation and Regional Policy and the Committee for Local Government Problems of the State Duma were assigned to work out as a matter of priority federal draft laws on general principles of the organisation of the system of state bodies in subjects of the Russian Federation, as well as local government bodies.
