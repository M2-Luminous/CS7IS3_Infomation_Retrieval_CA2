Disputed security issues were settled by the agreement the two sides signed in Cairo last week. Ahmad Quray', Fatah Central Committee member and a key Palestinian negotiator, said the Cairo agreement is a genuine translation of the Oslo accord. What we have reached on the border crossings, he said, was even better than what was reached in Oslo. He noted that the Israelis agreed that the Palestinian flag be raised over the crossings.
