This was decided by Bonn by lifting the halt to arms deliveries to Turkey. Germany sends weapons to a state that systematically oppresses, drives away, and kills the Kurds. This signals to the government in Ankara that the destruction of the Kurdish people continues to be more or less tolerated. For this reason the question whether Turkish soldiers in the southeast of the country fight with German armaments is important, but not of a central nature. Now it becomes obvious that Kinkel's order to examine evidence of the use of German weapons was only a show to calm down critics. One can only call it cynical how the Federal Government ignores statements by eyewitnesses, misinterprets films, and adopts the excuses of the Turkish Government in those instances where German armaments are clearly visible in photographs. However, the end of the halt to arms deliveries would be a scandal even if Turkey were no longer to use any weapons from Germany against the Kurds. The more armaments are streaming into the country, the less the military needs to worry about its stocks, the more unscrupulously can Ankara wage its war in the southeast. In addition, the symbolic importance of the decision made by Bonn is even more murderous than the continued use of German weapons in practice: It confirms to the Turkish Government its knowledge that, for Germany, good relations with the geostrategically important NATO partner are more important than the Kurdish people's right to existence.
