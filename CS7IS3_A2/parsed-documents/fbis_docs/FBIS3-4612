(Posco) will take the main stake in the soon-to-be-launched single consortium for the second mobile telephone network, the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) announced Monday. Posco reportedly won because of its technology and capital, while Kolon pressed the argument that the steelmaker is semi-state-run and therefore cannot control the new private cellular phone network. Second Mobile of the Kolon Group, Posco's sole competitor, will instead have to be satisfied with holding the second biggest share. FKI was commissioned to form a single consortium for the multibillion-dollar project within this month by the Communications Ministry at the end of last year. In their first chance to show unity, many business groups gave up the chase for the dominant stake in the consortium to avoid fierce competition. The Sunkyong Group, whose chairman Choe Chong-hyon is also chairman of FKI, took the initiative by announcing his group's surrender of the second mobile phone project, which it won in August 1992 but was forced to give up amid alleged political favoritism. Its Taehan Telecom instead vied for the main stake in Korea Mobile Telecom, the solid cellular phone monopoly that is to be privatized.
