After the president's March 9 speech, a seemingly shocked Parliament agreed--for the first time in more than 12 months of loose talk--to hold a no-confidence vote. Two days later, Meciar was dethroned from his three-headed job as premier, privatization minister and chair of the National Property Fund, leaving in his wake an internationally discredited decentralization process that has been more of an exercise in power than an instrument of reform. Through Valentine's Day of this year, Meciar's government had managed to privatize just 108 companies (91 through public tender, 17 through direct sale) since the June 1992 elections swept his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) into power. The ex-factory lawyer's oft-repeated claims to be making the privatization process more "transparent" were widely interpreted by reform advocates as a more palatable way of saying "nonexistent." Then Feb. 15, on the eve of what was expected to be a no-confidence vote in the next day's Parliament session, Meciar's government suddenly approved a whopping 27 direct sales. As Parliament deputies were tossing in their sleep, deciding whether or not they should chuck Meciar's minority government, the Privatization Ministry was working around the clock, selling off chunks of the state-owned sector. "I always stay here this late," insisted deputy Privatization Minister Ivan Lexa at 11:30 p.m. Feb. 15. Lexa's secretary and the secretary for the ministry's economic director both said they never worked that late, but didn't want to be quoted. When the dust cleared Feb. 17, with the opposition once again failing to unify and set a date for new elections (which would have paved the way for a no-confidence vote), the disheartened deputies began to question just what had happened on the night of Feb. 15-16. But HZDS deputies and the handful of Meciar loyalists from the splintered Slovak National Party (SNS) saw nothing abnormal in the sudden massive activity. "You blame us because we speeded up privatization at the last Cabinet session? You've been asking for it, you've been criticizing us for slow privatization," said then Environment Minister Jozef Zlocha. The opposition was sufficiently alarmed to launch an investigation Feb. 18 and ask the Prosecutor General to rule on the legality of two of the 27 sales. Ivan Miklos, the pre-HZDS privatization minister, said the privatization projects approved during the Feb. 15 fire sale fell far short of meeting the basic requirements mandated by law, such as approval by the Anti-Monopoly Office. While the ministries that owned the properties (which makes them responsible for initiating privatization) in many instances recommended public tenders, the government ignored their requests and sold off the businesses to pre-selected people, Miklos said. Former Economics Minister and ex-SNS Chair L'udovit Cernak, who resigned from Meciar's government a year ago, summed up the prevailing view on the Parliament floor Feb. 17: "What else but a plunder can we call the process going on here these days?" "The fact that the Privatization Ministry worked all night from Feb. 15 to Feb. 16 suggests a lot about the way Vladimir Meciar's government approves direct sales," said Miklos, once a member of the now-defunct Public Against Violence, the broad movement that spearheaded the 1989 revolution in Slovakia. During Miklos's last six months in office, the Slovak government approved a total of 676 projects (181 direct sales, eight public tenders and 407 in coupon privatization). After HZDS took over, Meciar vowed to improve on Miklos's record. "The government will push through legislative changes to speed the process and dampen the negative side effects...and will give preference to competitive principles in order for privatization to be more transparent," he promised. But in three times as long, Meciar's government privatized less than one-sixth as many companies as its predecessors. Coupon privatization, a runaway success in the Czech Republic, was dropped because the Slovak government said, it couldn't provide the cash infusion necessary to revive Slovakia's suffering economy. HZDS Vice Chair L'ubomir Dolgos resigned as privatization minister in June 1993, accusing the government of deliberately stalling the decentralization process because it was unwilling to give up power. In place of Dolgos, Meciar nominated his close ally Lexa, but President Kovac refused (he had previously rejected Lexa to head the Slovak Information Service, the country's intelligence agency). So Meciar himself took the helm of both the Privatization Ministry and the National Property Fund. "Privatization, warped beyond recognition by Meciar's ambition to shape the new market economy, has ground to a halt," wrote Chandler Rosenberger, an American journalist who lived in post-revolution Bratislava for three years, in the fall 1993 issue of WORLD POLICY REVIEW. Meciar's "scheme," Rosenberger and a chorus of observers say, had much more to do with leverage and power than concern for the economy. "Deputies from the [SNS] and Meciar's own [HZDS] drove an efficient privatization program through a meat grinder of special interests," wrote Rosenberger. "Meciar's coalition is a clumsy alliance of special interests and privilege. Meciar's success depends not on enforcing open competition between companies, but rather on managing a vast array of alliances, information and threats." Kovac's dramatic allegations March 9 on the Parliament floor--all of them hotly denied by Meciar--stated the equation in simple terms: Meciar saw privatization as a way to stuff HZDS's campaign war chest, and that's why he wanted his good buddy Lexa running the Ministry of Privatization. "His reasons were that HZDS had no money even for salaries, that early elections would probably happen soon, and that HZDS just needed money," Kovac said. "He further said that no one but Lexa could provide him with that service." International financial institutions have taken notice. Both the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Union have recently come out with reports slamming Meciar's mishandling of the economy. The premier's penchant for flexing the state's muscle to keep the media in line has attracted even more international headlines. Several critical individuals have been removed from state-owned television, radio and print media; privatization of the newspaper printing and distribution monopolies were put off indefinitely; state subsidies to publications have been openly based on editors' political stances. "Over the past year, the government has shown a strong propensity to hold on to whatever control it has over the media," wrote Jeremy Druker in a July 1993 report for Freedom Forum. The Feb. 15-16 deal that raised the most eyebrows was the cheap sale of the successful Skloobal Nemsova, a glass bottle producer where Meciar worked as company lawyer from 1974 to 1989, to its current managers. Last year, Skloobal had profits of 22.2 million Sk ($700,000 US), according to the Slovak economic weekly TREND. Its assets were estimated at 726 million Sk ($23 million US), including 66 million Sk ($2 million US) in the bank, according to government documents. Since there was no public tender, a competing privatization project that had lined up foreign investors from Italy, France and Germany, was left out in the cold. Skloobal management, under the name Obalsklo Ltd., purchased 67 percent of the company for 120 million Sk ($3.7 million US). Under the purchase agreement, the company management must pay the government 27 million Sk ($850,000 US) the first year, with the rest spread out in installments over the next 10 years. Obalsklo was asked to invest 500 million Sk ($15 million US) by January 1995, but the agreement was written without any provisions for penalizing the company if it doesn't live up to its end of the bargain, TREND reported. And the conditions for further payments have not yet been set. So, essentially, a bunch of Meciar's old comrades privatized a profitable company for less money than the company itself has in its bank account. "That is not just a handout of state property, it is the liquidation of all the competitors," wrote TREND deputy editor in chief Oliver Brunovsky in a commentary. "The privatization projects of last week revealed the true privatization policy of the HZDS." Privatization has been at or near the center of the manifold political dramas that have rocked Slovakia into its current status: a 15-month-old country with a troubled reputation, a grim economic outlook and a populace that has faith in neither its elected officials nor the concept of market reform. Meciar's demand that Lexa be appointed as part of a November 1993 HZDS-SNS coalition and Kovac's angry refusal launched the power struggle between the country's top two officials which the president eventually won. The opposition complained for months that the minority government spelled instability for the country, but actual gridlock did not occur until Feb. 2, when Meciar loyalists stormed out of Parliament to protest an opposition bill that would have given the legislature oversight of the privatization process. (The law passed, but Meciar refused to sign it.) From then on, the only real debates Parliament held dealt with the questions of early elections, referendums and no-confidence votes. Through it all, Meciar has convinced many people that he is the only man with enough moral purity to ensure that the privatization process--and government as a whole--will be run cleanly. The premier has waged public campaigns against corruption (accusing, for instance, at least three political parties of trying to bribe him), while privately saying that political support is best won through state gifts. (In December, for instance, Meciar bragged of giving the 600-million-crown Neografia publishing house to the nationalist organization Matica Slovenska for just one crown. "They won't support anyone else but HZDS anywhere," he said. "They gave us this promise.") When campaigning against the "federalists" of Jan Carnogursky's pre-HZDS government, Meciar pounded home the lasting image of a corrupt government selling off the state interests of the Czech Republic. "Those who own companies will decide the fate of Slovakia. Will it be the unbribable and honest Meciarist entrepreneurs or the corrupt Czechoslovakist Mafia?" asked Jan Smolec, editor in chief of the government-owned nationalist daily REPUBLIKA in a Feb. 15 open letter to Carnogursky, who chairs the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH). "The only party with anything resembling a sensible economic program is [KDH]," Rosenberger argued in his WORLD POLICY REVIEW article. "But it labors under the weight of false but effective rumors that Carnogursky's family, prominent on the Slovak political scene for most of the 20th century, is corrupt." Meciar remains convinced that his ear for what Slovaks want to hear will deliver him once again to the promised land. "Those of you who are even slightly realistic," he told Parliament shortly before getting the ax, "you know we will win those elections."
