She was speaking to a news conference held after she addressed the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. Benazir Bhutto said she addressed the Commission in order to mobilize international public opinion and force India to take solid steps to allow human rights organizations into occupied Kashmir, release detained Kashmiri leaders, permit television crews and journalists to visit Kashmir, and reduce the number of troops there. She said the world should not ignore human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. Keeping this in view, it is imperative to implement the UN resolutions. This problem is pertinent not only for today, but also for the future. When the prime minister was asked whether Pakistan will consider demands for a sovereign Kashmir, she said that no such demand has yet been made. This so-called demand will resurrect the entire issue of the 1947 partition of the subcontinent into an independent Pakistan and India. She said that while reviewing this demand, the demands for freedom by Sikhs, Tamils, and other groups in India should also be kept in mind. The prime minister said that Pakistan has presented proposals to India at the international level time and again on the issue of nuclear nonproliferation, but India has rejected all of them. Regarding her visit to Bosnia today, Benazir Bhutto said she and her Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller are visiting Bosnia to express their solidarity with Bosnian Muslims. She said their efforts are intended to ensure the implementation of the London Accord on Bosnia. She said that decisions to lift the arms embargo and implement a cease-fire should be made within the purview of the London Accord. Earlier, addressing the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Benazir Bhutto urged the international community to take steps to stop the carnage in occupied Kashmir and exert pressure on India to withdraw its troops from the occupied valley. She said: It is time for the international community to force India to release the Kashmiri leaders; lift all of its draconian emergency laws; stop its Army from committing atrocities in Kashmir; and allow international human rights organizations and representatives of humanitarian institutions and the mass media to visit occupied Kashmir, ascertain the facts, and provide help to the suffering Kashmiris.
