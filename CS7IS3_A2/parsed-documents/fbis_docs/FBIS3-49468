Does this mean you are dissatisfied with the policy adopted by the present Hungarian Government toward your neighbors? [Horn] Close relations with Western integrative groupings is, of course, a priority of our foreign policy concept. Considerable progress has already been made here. We have been a member of the Council of Europe for more than two years and we have observer status in the Western European Union. On the other hand, there are a number of problems in the economic sphere. Many of the Western companies that enter our market, unfortunately, suspend production in a number of branches instead of concentrating on restructuring outdated capacities. We receive second- or third-rate technology from the West. In some cases, this technology represents a risk to the environment. On the other hand, the opportunities we have for gaining access to Western markets are somewhat limited. This, however, makes no difference to our priorities. Improving relations with its neighbors is another key issue for Hungary and its security. Our main objective is to achieve a historic settlement. We have to agree that the issue of the borders and the historic peace treaties is closed for us. Nevertheless, we desire -- or request -- that the rights of the Hungarian minorities in neighboring countries be respected. There can only be a real improvement in relations if these two aspects are combined. Apart from this, we should not allow economic cooperation to be limited hereafter to neighboring countries, although, following the collapse of CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] and the Warsaw Pact, this is -- to a certain extent -- a natural phenomenon. [Zizka] Do you also regard the Czech Republic as a neighbor? [Horn] Yes, it is an indirect neighbor; there are significant traditions here from the era of the former Czechoslovakia. In view of the difficulties in cooperation with the West, we should pay more attention to the economic integration of Central Europe. The first step should be the establishment of joint banks, joint enterprises, and the expansion of mutual trade. Whether the specific form of expanding trade is considered modern or not is not so important. If possible, it is necessary to implement a form of barter. It is important to find a market for our products. If our party assumes responsibility for the government after the next elections, it will definitely pursue a very active policy toward our neighbors. [Zizka] Nevertheless, if you are talking about improving relations with your neighbors, then -- obviously -- you are not happy with current government policy. [Horn] Two sides bear responsibility for the current situation -- not only Hungary. Understandably, some of our representatives should avoid making speeches that offend our neighbors. However, the representatives of neighboring states should also somewhat alter their stance toward us. As a representative of one of the left-wing parties in Hungary, I would like to point out that the Socialist International has incorporated into its program a item on guaranteeing collective rights for minorities. Guaranteeing linguistic and cultural autonomy and self-administration still does not automatically mean separatism. [Zizka] What, then, is the difference between your party and the government in the minority issue? [Horn] In principle, there are no major differences here. I think our policy would be imprinted with greater activity. It is essential to approach mutual talks more actively and to initiate specific proposals for improving relations. That would probably be the main difference. [Zizka] What is your party's view regarding the initiative by local organs in south Slovakia to establish an autonomous Hungarian region? [Horn] It is necessary to specify exactly what comes under the demand for autonomy. In my opinion, this would mean that they could really make decisions on the issues that concern them. The majority of people in this region are Hungarians. It is logical, therefore, that they are demanding something that is already standard in Europe. [Zizka] You said you regard the Czech Republic as an indirect neighbor. Not long ago, however, you proposed that a regional group be established comprising Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Austria -- but not the Czech Republic. [Horn] For some time I have been of the opinion that the Czech Republic is not very interested in the Visegrad Group. This was perhaps due to the fact that your representatives wanted to distance themselves a little from our region. I understand this; there are many conflicts here and perhaps it is better for the Czech Republic not to be here. Maybe Czech representatives feel that, if they do not enter into the initial stages of integration with us, they will be able to integrate themselves more quickly into West Europe. Your Prime Minister Klaus has made a number of statements in this regard. On the other hand, however, we bear in mind the fact that you signed the free trade zone agreement in Krakow. [Zizka] The opinion prevails in Prague that the original aims of the Visegrad Group have already been fulfilled. President Havel has also said this. [Horn] In my opinion, it is impossible to describe any aim as fulfilled. Economic cooperation has just begun and we still have far to go before this aim is fulfilled. It is necessary to maintain and further develop the Visegrad Group's activity. It would be desirable to include other countries -- Slovenia and Croatia, especially if the war there comes to an end. The participation of Austria is very important. The issue involves cooperation throughout the entire Central European region. [Zizka] You proposed recently that the Hungarian parliament begin discussing the issue of entry into NATO. At the same time, however, you emphasize that this must be decided in a referendum. [Horn] I suggested this because many people doubt that joining NATO would be beneficial to our country and even consider it to be a bad move. It is not true that there would be a nationwide consensus on this issue. I was intent on making sure that parliament considers this issue. It does not only depend on the people understanding what NATO membership will mean. It is such a serious matter that it is impossible for any government to request admission without the prior agreement of parliament. As far as a definitive, official request for admission is concerned, in my opinion, it has to be preceded by a referendum. [Zizka] What is your party's view on possible entry? [Horn] I, for example, am definitely in favor. As foreign minister, I made a statement at the beginning of 1990 in which I called for closer relations with NATO, relations that would result in membership. This met with great opposition from many people. In the end, the right wing also added its support to entry. I think many people do not realize what NATO membership actually means. It is necessary to clarify this in parliamentary discussions and to consider the commitments and rights arising from it. [Zizka] The Americans have come up with the "Partnership for Peace" security initiative. What do you think of it? [Horn] I have reservations about it. This proposal is in fact a temporary solution. It is intended to show us the workings of NATO, how we could restructure our armed forces, and the kind of commitments arising for us from mutual cooperation. I am not explicitly opposed to it, but I have no illusions in this context. It is -- sui generis -- a manifestation of the fact that the NATO countries also do not know what to do with Central and Eastern Europe. On the one hand, they are aware of the great pressure from our countries and of the request for security guarantees. On the other hand, they are hesitating; they do not want to provoke Moscow. They will be even more cautious following the recent events in Russia. It will be a long time before we have real security guarantees in our region. [Zizka] You said that you do not rule out the possibility that your party will enter into government after the elections. Are you anticipating this? [Horn] Everything depends on the election results. This is the key issue for us. If we achieve a result entitling us to participate in the government, we will assume the responsibility. It will also depend on whether we reach an agreement on the main policy issues with a potential coalition partner. [Zizka] Are there potential coalition partners? [Horn] Of course. Those who are now in the opposition -- the Union of Free Democrats and the Union of Young Democrats, FIDESZ. Smaller opposition parties, for example, the Republican Party, the Agrarian Union, and so on are also being taken into consideration. That is, those who give priority to pragmatism and resolving specific problems over ideology. [Zizka] However, FIDESZ representatives are not displaying much willingness about entering into a coalition with you. [Horn] They have not issued any such statement. They have merely said that they do not want to form a preelection coalition with us. This is understandable; we also do not want this. A government coalition is something else, however. It is a matter for the future.
