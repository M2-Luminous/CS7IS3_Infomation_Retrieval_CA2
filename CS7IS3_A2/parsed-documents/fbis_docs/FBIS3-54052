[passage omitted] In a telephone interview, Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, Jordan's ambassador in Washington and head of the Jordanian delegation to the bilateral negotiations, said these meetings are meant as consultation between the heads of the four delegations, in addition to the Israeli side, regarding the date and venue of the next round of negotiations. Al-Tarawinah said that there will be a comprehensive assessment of the progress of negotiations on all tracks. In light of this assessment, the parties will examine the usefulness of holding another round of talks. They will also look at ways to reduce differences or obstacles that could obstruct the Arab-Israeli negotiations. [passage omitted] Answering a question on the topics to be discussed on the Jordanian-Israeli track in the next round, al-Tarawinah said: No doubt, there have been many political developments since the end of the last round of the bilateral talks, and specifically since the signing of the Declaration of Principles between the PLO and Israel on 13 September 1993. A Jordanian-Israeli agenda was also signed, and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited the region. Add to this the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva and finally the Jordanian-U.S. summit in Washington. Dr. al-Tarawinah added: Regarding the Jordanian-Israeli track, the items on the agenda have not been discussed since the signing of the agenda on 14 September 1993. This is because there has not been a round of talks since then. The head of the Jordanian delegation said: I think that in the new round we will discuss the agenda items. This is in addition to the meetings of the working groups on water, the environment, energy, security, borders, refugees, among others. He added that there is now a new dimension, which is the Palestinian-Jordanian economic agreement signed this month in Amman. [passage omitted]
