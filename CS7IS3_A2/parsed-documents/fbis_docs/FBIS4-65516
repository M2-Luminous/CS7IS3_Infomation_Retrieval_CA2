[Mancino] No, not yet. The party's leadership and the Senate caucus will both be meeting today. After listening to its policy statement, we will publish our overall assessment of the government, both as regards its makeup (which is rather poor, frankly speaking) and its platform's contents. [Ballardin] Seven or eight PPI senators (among whom Grillo, Delfino, Costa, and De Gaudenz) have already made it known that they intend to be absent, when the vote of confidence is taken, in order to ensure the government's viability. [Mancino] I hope our 27 senators, as well as our 33 deputies, will all vote the same way. How? We must decide this together by Wednesday. But we must be an opposition party both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate. [Ballardin] Are you prepared, however, to assume responsibility for the government being defeated, which may result in new general elections being called early? [Mancino] I am aware that voters have pronounced themselves in favor of a coalition which has a reasonable majority in the Chamber of Deputies, but not in the Senate, where it must build such a majority each time as need arises. So far, in the Senate, the government coalition had luck on its side, both on the occasion of the appointment of the Senate speaker, and when it came to appointing the chairperson of Immunity Committee. However, we do not have the duty to ensure governability. This task falls to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. [Ballardin] In an interview with LA STAMPA, [former Christian Democratic Party, DC, Secretary] De Mita suggested the following: We refuse our vote of confidence to the Knight, the government is defeated, Berlusconi resigns, and he is replaced by Berlusconi Two, who will negotiate with us before addressing parliament. Have we correctly interpreted the meaning of the former DC secretary's words? [Mancino] No, he did not say "negotiate with us." He only said that, at a later stage, the absence of a majority in the Senate would become even more noticeable. [Ballardin] Hence the PPI's decisive role. [Mancino] A power over life and death. [Ballardin] According to some, the Berlusconi Two option suggested by De Mita looks like a mirage in the Sahara desert. In your capacity as Senate floor leader, are you prepared to instruct your fellow senators to vote against, at the risk of having to go back to the polls? [Mancino] Once upon a time nobody even dreamt of asking an opposition party this kind of question. In any case, we cannot be a mere appendage of the majority, and therefore we confirm our role in opposition. As a matter of fact, we are currently considering the best way of stating our position in the house. [Ballardin] If I may ask, out of curiosity: Whom do you prefer: Berlusconi, [National Alliance leader] Fini, or [League Secretary] Bossi? [Mancino] One of them, namely Bossi, is a territorialist, and therefore he favors the country's political fragmentation. Next, Fini, in relation to us, the PPI, is poles apart. As regards Berlusconi, he was chosen as the winning coalition's leader not by us, but by the voters. Why should we question the voters' decision? [Ballardin] Some PPI members are saying: If Berlusconi jettisons the fascists, it may be possible to reach an agreement with him. [Mancino] Undoubtedly, there is an alternative solution in parliament. In fact, we might envisage a dialogue between AD [Democratic Alliance], any willing Socialists, and the PPI. Added to the League and Forza Italia, they could form a majority, both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate. This, however, is not an immediate prospect, because Silvio Berlusconi, having won the elections with a specific coalition, is not in the position to make such a move, which, however, could be considered by the parliamentary groups, acting autonomously. [Ballardin] Such a move, then, might become a real possibility in the future. [Mancino] Yes, we might work in that direction.
