Qian said the stable and long-standing good-neighborly and friendly ties between the two neighbors not only are important to the two peoples but also have influences over peace, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region and even the whole world. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries, their relations in all aspects have gained a sustained development and the exchange of visits by their senior officials has increased, he said. China is satisfied with the development of bilateral relations in recent years, said Qian, whose current visit to Moscow is mainly aimed at making preparations for Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia in September. Kozyrev said the Russian side attaches great importance to the upcoming visit by Jiang and believes his visit to Russia will be of profound significance to the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. On Russia's "Partnership for Peace" relations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Chinese foreign minister said it is understandable that European nations are concerned about the security of their own as there have been great changes in the continent in recent years. He expressed the hope that every arrangement for security in Europe should be in accord with not only the interests of nations concerned, but also security, peace and stability in the world. Kozyrev said Russia also holds the view that NATO should be transformed into a new international organization after the Cold War. He said Russia will not join any military or political organization, whether in the West or the East, directed against a particular nation. Russia attaches equal importance to its relations with China and NATO, Kozyrev added. The two sides also exchanged views on the situation on the Korean peninsula.
