First, Kim wants to check out the overall security situation on the Korean peninsula in connection with the North Korean nuclear issue and dispel ordinary citizens' anxiety amid a rising sense of crisis. Secondly, the president wants to discuss measures to counter any possible developments resulting from a failure in negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) before Feb. 21. No deadline has been set for Pyongyang and the IAEA to agree on IAEA inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, but the United States has said it will have to refer the issue to the United Nations Security Council if the two sides cannot arrange for comprehensive inspections before the IAEA convenes a Board of Governors' meeting on Feb. 21. Despite obvious efforts to minimize the seriousness of the problem, reports reaching Seoul from Washington, Pyongyang and elsewhere are disquieting, to say the least. A North Korean Foreign Ministry statement on Jan. 31 threatened withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if the United States keeps pressing Pyongyang with its "unjustifiable" demand to accept comprehensive IAEA inspections. North Korea has openly talked about the possibility of another Korean war breaking out on the peninsula, envisioning a total defeat for the United States. The IAEA can only conduct limited inspections, Pyongyang has said. In view of the North Korean position, the United States is showing a much more resolute response than before. Washington will no longer use a "carrot" in its efforts to persuade North Korea to accept IAEA inspections before Feb. 21. Instead, the United States has made it clear it will have to refer the question to the United Nations. The United States briefed the other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- China, Russia, Britain and France -- over the weekend and requested their cooperation for action the United States will ask the world body to take against North Korea. Moreover, there have been reports that if North Korea provokes another war against South Korea, the United States would not only defend against aggression but launch a counterattack, pushing the aggressors all the way back to Pyongyang. Judging by these latest developments, the chances of the two sides reaching a dramatic breakthrough at the last moment are slim. In other words, "the worst possible situation" is envisaged rather than a resolution of the question through dialogue. This is what prompted President Kim to hastily convene Tuesday's meeting. Consequently, President Kim and his ministers will take a close look at North Korean military movements and overall security on the peninsula. The Kim administration thus hopes to reassure the people, whose anxiety "has been amplified unnecessarily" of late. The National Unification Board, and the Foreign and Defense Ministries all publicly say that "there has been no urgent development or North Korean military provocation that warrants immediate attention." Tuesday's meeting, therefore, could very well make the official pronouncement that "the sense of crisis" touted by certain segments of the U.S. Government and press is exaggerated. President Kim and the ministers are also expected to discuss in depth South Korean Government measures against every possible North Korean action. Although there may be many aspects of North Korean nuclear policy, they can be place into two broad categories. First is what Pyongyang will do if and when the nuclear issue is referred to the U.N. Security Council. The second concerns a sudden turnaround by North Korea in accepting IAEA inspections at the last minute. The Seoul government is most likely to reaffirm its position of striving to persuade Pyongyang to follow the second course of action: South Korea believes that the North Korean nuclear question has to be resolved through dialogue. In any event, Tuesday's meeting will also discuss what Seoul can do if North Korea pushes the issue over the brink.
