FBIS4-17537 "drsov079_e_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-079 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 UKRAINE International Affairs Kravchuk Phone-In 23 April Kravchuk Phone-In 23 April LD2304185494 Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in Ukrainian 1200 GMT 23 Apr 94 LD2304185494 Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service Ukrainian BFN ["At the Crossroads of Opinion" live phone-in with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, moderated by Viktoriya Popovych and Vadym Zadorozhnyy] [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Popovych] We will begin our conversation with the president by analyzing the economic situation in Ukraine, for the economic situation directly affects the political situation in our state. And so, Leonid Makarovych, the state of Ukraine's economy at the moment when it acquired independence and today, and the objective and subjective factors, which have affected and are affecting our economy, please. [Kravchuk] Well, if one is to compare the figures, then naturally the state of the economy on the day of independence was better than today. But those were different economies -- the one on the day of independence and today's economy. There was the economy of the post-Soviet period. It has not exhausted precisely these features even now. But the shoots of a new economy, a market economy, are now beginning to appear. They are appearing everywhere -- in industry, in the agrarian sector, in construction. That is, a new structure is now emerging. Proprietors are emerging. And the reform of the economy into a market one is proceeding gradually. It is difficult, but it is proceeding. Naturally this process of transition from one economy to another one cannot be painless or easy, therefore, the level of the decline of production naturally is great, that is, if one is to look only at the process. But there are subjective factors, as you rightly say. These are Ukraine's great dependence on energy-carriers, which have increased by tens, hundreds, thousands of times recently, I mean the prices. There is the problem of management. There is the problem of personnel. There is the problem of the purely functional dependence of our economy on the economies of other states of the former Soviet Union. There are links that truly cannot be in the same mode as they were in before. They should change. They should improve. They should acquire an entirely different substance and nature, not centralized or administrative, but namely the search for the best paths, the best way out of the situation. And we already see, although it is too early yet to speak of some sort of successes, but there are already, well, say, some kind of healthy processes too. The rate of inflation has decreased. Even the price of the consumer basket has decreased somewhat. That is, well, there are complex processes proceeding in parallel with the birth of the new. This is the singularity we have today. [Popovych] Yes, Supreme Council chairman Ivan Plyushch gave these figures at the final sitting yesterday. He gave them and spoke of the decline in production too. He cited (?43) percent and at the same time these positive points -- the increase in the containment of hyperinflation from (?191) percent in December of last year to (?5.7) percent in March this year. Retail prices --we have noticed this too -- have not been rising recently, and have been decreasing for some goods. And this is the question: Can one explain this by the fact that the deputies of the previous convocation were busy with the election campaign, did not assemble for plenary sittings, while the government and the president had the chance to work and conduct measures planned by themselves, and there was no one to block them? [Kravchuk] Well, I would not say this, but one thing that is well-known: that when the parliament is engaged in its affair, the government in its affair and the president in his affair, that is not verbally, but realistically, [words indistinct], the result is better, and there is no doubt that when deputies assemble, say, or assembled, instead of elaborating normal, (?say) necessary laws, legislative acts, normative acts, were reduced to hearing about and studying, say, the situation, and it was difficult to take realistic steps to improve the situation -- this was (?not) reflected in the government's work, undoubtedly, but I cannot say this was the result of the Supreme Council not assembling. [Passage omitted] I can stress that the vigor, purposefulness, and energy of the government administrative structures are now directed precisely at overcoming the economic crisis. This is true. [Popovych] Please tell us, then, does this period of stabilization -- the beginning of stabilization -- signify that Ukraine is now approaching the peak, the culmination, and that a levelling out will begin now, that we will go up? [Kravchuk] Well, I would like to think, just like you, and I hope that it will happen namely like this, if we do not shake up, say, the political situation in the country, if we do not stir up differences, if that for which we are calling all the time, both the Supreme Council and the president -- for national accord, for civic reconciliation, for unity around lofty aims, around lofty tasks -- statehood, independence, the market economy, democracy -- if we have all this, then I hope that the next parliament, which will assemble with these tasks, and if we all work, work together energetically, then this beginning can then become some kind of course, some kind of stable course towards overcoming the crisis. [Zadorozhnyy] So that you can again convince us, and possibly our listeners, that this stabilization is nevertheless an objective process and, thanks to the efforts of our government officials, deny this assertion by some specialists, who believe that the containment of inflation is a consequence of nonpayments, that is neither the producers or consumers have any money, and that a new inflationary spiral supposedly awaits us in the middle of May when the monetary printing press will be started up again, and another monetary emission will take place. [Kravchuk] Well, you know, here one has to take account of the fact that money is not given, but earned. I know that many producers are making their products for the warehouse. There are trillions of karbovantsi worth of products in warehouses at present. [passage omitted] But if a commodity is needed, if a cheap quality product is made, then it will always find a consumer in a market environment. Therefore, money cannot be issued for, say, unearned goods, unfinished (?poor-quality) goods. Then it is clear that the monetary and payments crisis is also explained by the fact that namely these market mechanisms have not been elaborated yet -- demand, the consumer's possibilities, the producer's possibilities, the production structure, the consumption structure, the balance of payments, the cash possibilities of Ukraine and directly of consumers, and producers, I mean producers and consumers as people who consume food products, for example, every day, or other domestic products. Time is needed for all of this. Therefore, clearly if some people want to throw unearned money into production, or into indexation, or to add trillions to circulating assets, then clearly inflation will creep upwards, because there can only be and should only be as much money as goods produced. [Popovych] Leonid Makarovych, tell us, please, some people in Ukraine, most of all, for example, members of the Hrynyov-Kuchma Interregional Bloc of Reforms assert that all our economic setbacks can only be overcome by renewing economic ties with Russia. But will the unification of two exhausted paupers do much good? For example, we know it from the Ostankino TV programs that large enterprises are coming to a halt in Russia, such as ZIL [Likhachev automobile works], a large harvester plant was mentioned, oil wells are standing idle, andmachinery does not go to the fields. [Zadorozhnyy] In the same manner, they are not paying producers. [Popovych] People are failing to receive their wages for several months. So how shall we unite and renew these relations? What will they give us? [Kravchuk] Here we should look at the problem as follows: the production and market relations within the framework of the CIS are necessary and I do not want anyone to doubt this. They are necessary, because the CIS market is so far a determining market for us. Not the European market, but CIS. We have not yet approached the European market and have not entered it seriously, structurally. Although, steps have been made, and what is more, significant steps. However, when they talk about renewing ties, there is a detail which needs to be explained. I can show it to you on one example only. There is a missile-carrying ship in Nikolayev called the Varyah. As far as I remember, approximately more than 1,500 enterprises of the former USSR were building it, I have in mind its components. Now, when we offered Russia to renew the construction of this ship and then dispose of it appropriately, this has already become impossible for objective reasons, because as many as nearly 500 enterprises, which had been earlier working for this ship, ceased to exist as such. And the same happens in every industry. Rather complicated processes are under way. Enterprises are being closed down, new enterprises and production shops, which manufacture new products, are commissioned. Then how can we renew in full measure the ties without taking into account the situation which has already taken shape. If someone wants to renew the ties in full measure, this means to renew the Soviet Union in full measure, to renew the planned-centralized economy in full measure, in other words, to renew everything as it was before. But this is just impracticable. This is why I am talking not about the renewal but about the development and expansion of ties on the new principles, in accordance with the market situation. Because, if Russia goes further on along the road of market and we will be lagging behind, it will become just impossible to renew these ties on the new principles. I am speaking not only about Russia, but about other countries as well. That is to say, one should approach this issue in concrete, not general terms. If the idea is to establish economic ties of the new nature and new systems, I fully support exactly these ties. As for the developments in Russia, you see, the situation is complicated everywhere -- in Russia, in Belarus, and in Ukraine -- because the entire economy is being reformed and its structure altered. Complicated processes are under way. Someone makes it better and someone makes it less good, however, everywhere difficulties are of a broad-scale nature. [Zadorozhnyy] It happened that there is competition between Ukraine and Russia, in terms of comparisons. But we have already touched upon the issue of the CIS. On 15 April in Moscow, Ukraine acceded to the CIS economic union as an associate member and signed all the economic agreements. Mykola Riznyk from Australia wants to know the difference between an associate and full member of the economic union. Is the associate membership of Ukraine in CIS fraught with danger to Ukraine's independence? [Kravchuk] I will give only one example to answer Mykola Riznyk. The treaty on the economic union emphasizes that the full members of the economic union cannot accede to other unions. As far as the associate members, they can do so. In other words, Ukraine, in this particular case, is free to accede to the European Union as well, if it is ready for this. By the way, an associate member has more freedom of action and more opportunities as far as international relations with other countries are concerned. But it also has every opportunity to participate, as fully as possible, within the framework of the economic union. [Popovych] Mr. President, tell me, what advantage does Ukraine have or will it have from being a member of the CIS, from the agreements that have been signed? For example, any commonwealth envisages that its members have certain concessions and advantages. It seems that the CIS does not have this, because if one takes into account the fact that Russia sells us energy sources at the highest world prices... [Kravchuk, interrupting] This is an interesting question. It is fairly apt. For example, for there to be competition within the framework of the CIS and for there to be normal conditions, producers should have identical conditions. If, say, a Russian producer buys energy soruces twice as cheaply as a Ukrainian one, then what kind of a free, let us say, free CIS market, with competition on equal terms, can one speak of? This is difficult. Let us say the same about free trade. It is free when there are no restrictions. But for the time being, Russia has made certain exceptions for itself, for its goods, say, in the document, which we have signed, although it will not come into force tomorrow. And this concerns primarily energy soruces. Thus trade is sort of free, but with certain reservations and certain exceptions. So, this is right. Take the European Union. There they watch pricing, quotas, customs duties, and such things very closely so that one country does not experience losses from a market that is not regulated or coordinated with other countries. We do not have this yet. This is the main reason for all of these complexities that we have in trade, in settlements, and so on. [passage omitted] [Popovych] Let us return to the issue of the CIS. Mr. President, the CIS' acquisition of observer status at the United Nations, the desire to acquire this status at the CSCE, the endorsement of a CIS flag and emblem, to me these are all signs of the creation of a state, which, in addition, is, as before, under the aegis of Russia, because Russian representatives occupy almost all of the leading posts in CIS structures, and Russia will continue to be in the chair at sittings until the end of the year. Is this not so? Is this the revival of the old empire or the creation of a new empire with the economic union being used a means to bring CIS countries into this process? Belarus has already made a step into Russia's embrace. [Kravchuk] Well, the European Union also has its parliament. It has its flag, it has its emblem. It even has certain executive structures. And it does not evoke any doubt in anyone that it is some kind of empire or suprastate. This is not the only point. The point is something else: that only independent states with all of the institutions and attributes of statehood -- a currency, a financial and banking system, institutions of power, troops, everything of its own that it can have -- should enter a union, any union. And then this problem does not arise. As far as Belarus is concerned, there is another problem here. Belarus is already going beyond the feature that the European Union has -- yes, they are going toward the ECU there, but for the moment each country has its own currency. This is the main thing in economic independence. Their currencies unite Belarus with Russia. Then the problem of integration is considerably deeper. It is so deep that it can then turn into some kind of political, let us say, integrational processes. But this is then the affair of Russia and Belarus. This is their affair. Ukraine occupies a different position. We occupy the position that every state should have all of the attributes of statehood both in the economy and in policy -- in military policy and in international policy. This is the most important thing. And if we have this, if there are no encroachments from anyone on these institutions, then one can enter any union and have any pennants, any flags. They are not state ones. Incidentally, no one endorsed them. They were simply looked at and approved. There was no endorsement and no one put their signatures to this. [Zadorozhnyy] And in the context of the question put by Viktoriya, the question about unions, what is your attitude to the idea of Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev of creating a Eurasian union? [Kravchuk] Well, this is a continuation of the subject. Clearly, Nazarbayev and many leaders of CIS states have a problem with the effectiveness of CIS work. Frankly, We see that it works with a very low coefficient of usefulness. Although I have insisted and insist that it is fulfilling its role, and I am convinced that without the CIS resolving interstate and internal state problems would be even worse. This is a fact. So, each has ideas about searching for a more effective system. Well, Nazarbayev proposed a Eurasian union. This is the outline of, let us say, the European Union, and I am saying that I do not see any, well, complexities in being able to draw nearer to a closer economic union. This is very important. I am speaking about economic integration. I am not talking about political integration, but for this, it is necessary to draw nearer. It is necessary for the conditions to evolve. For example, we cannot become a full-fledged member of the European Union at the moment, because neither our economy nor our domestic and other problems are ready to enter into cooperation with them. This is simply unrealistic, and at present, the Eurasian union is simply an idea, but its implementation is simply unrealistic at present. The right conditions have not evolved for this. That is, one has to proceed by stages. I have said several times and am saying again that Europe was going toward the European Union for more than 35 years after the Rome sitting, in 1957 I think. This is how long it took for you to come to the creation of the European Union. And now take a look at the plan for it. With what tolerance, with what respect, with the confirmation of legal, international and other (?norms) this is being carried out, by means of polls, referendums, and so on. One cannot think thus: heads of state assemble, sign, and then there is a Eurasian or some other kind of union. One has to move toward this. [Popovych] Well, returning to the issue of flags and emblems, I think that we have already replied to Mr. Oleh Antonyuk from London, Great Britain. Because he is asking: if Ukraine is an associate member, then what are flags, emblems, joint borders and their protection, a joint command, doing there -- everything is there, and God knows what else that we do not know about, but it has already been written down and signed by you. He is addressing you here. [Kravchuk] We did not say anything about flags. Neither did we talk about joint borders. We talked only about joint protection of borders. That is, where there are borders, for example, between Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, we signed a declaration, a document, on cooperation between our border troops to protect the borders, and not on joint borders. [Zadorozhnyy] I think that Boris Yeltsin [word indistinct] at a news conference, perhaps mistakenly. He said that namely joint borders had been agreed on. [Kravchuk] Well, it was probably a mistake. The document says that the three of us -- Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus -- signed a declaration -- what is it called -- a memorandum on joint protection of common borders -- that is, common ones where we come into contact with each other and not joint ones as such. For example, the border between Ukraine and Russia. It is a common border for the two of us. This means that its joint protection is the cooperation of border troops, and not that there is no Ukrainian border at all or there is no Russian or Belarusian border. [Zadorozhnyy] Mr. President, another listener wants to put a question to you. We are listening. Speak, please. [Sayuk] Yuriy Sayuk from Bavaria speaking. Mr. President, I have two questions. The first question: the existence of the state of Ukraine depends on energy resources. However, the terminal has not been built yet, the Arab and Iranian possibilities have not been fulfilled. [words indistinct] (?helplessness). This is the first question. The second question concerns [passage indistinct]. Esteemed Leonid Makarovych, I would like your guidance. Where is the limit to accommodation? You have already partly touched on the matter. But I am interested in the issue of joint communications, joint citizenship, language, and suprastate structures. And another thing, has the older brother [Russia] in the friendship of peoples, and Slavic ones too, handed over anything from joint property abroad for Ukraine's embassies and missions yet? Thank you for your attention. [Kravchuk] With regard to the terminal, this issue has already been presented for practical resolution. There are firms ready to begin implementing it. And we are also conducting business talks with Turkey on constructing part of a pipeline, approximately 300 kilometers long, which should transport, say, some part, some amount I would say, of oil and energy sources to Ukraine, to the Black Sea, and maybe to Europe. So this issue is being resolved. I would simply like to remind you that issues of such a large scale, which you mentioned, are not resolved so easily, especially as Ukraine does not have its own currency [as heard]. It has to search for such firms and forms of cooperation so as to attract funds from elsewhere. One has to bear this in mind, because our desires and our possibilities very often do not coincide. Now, regarding the older brother. There is a certain exaggeration. I have said and say that fate has dealt with us in such a way that we live in friendship and equal partnership with Russia. History has not given us another way, because to have such a large neighbor and not to find cooperation with him, not to find accord with him, not to find understanding with him on any issues, equality above all, I stress, partnership, would constantly threaten Ukraine's statehood and independence. We, you, are doomed by history to act namely thus. If someone thinks that there is another way, exacerbation of the situation with Russia, this way will not lead to the normal development of Ukraine, and not only Ukraine. It is even about wider problems, problems of a European and world scale. That is why we will act precisely in this way. [Zadorozhnyy] Mr. President, Mr. Yuriy Sayuk also had a question concerning the Arab-Iranian agreement and the former USSR property abroad. But, please, be brief because other listeners are waiting. [Kravchuk] There are examples. I am just not ready now to speak from memory. I did not know what questions I would have to answer. There are examples of Russia enabling us to use the premises abroad for our embassies and consulates. Of course, we make appropriate payments for the rent. This is true. However, at the official level, let us say, at the interstate level, this issue has not yet been solved. There are many problems here. As far as the Arab project is concerned, I have already said that we link all the issues pertaining to the construction of the oil pipeline with Turkey. [passage omitted: caller from UK asks whether people of Ukrainian descent who live in the UK have the right to Ukrainian citizenship. Kravchuk explains that only persons who arrive in Ukraine for permanent residence can obtain Ukrainian citizenship] [U.S. caller Filimonchuk] Highly esteemed Mr. President, I have three questions. The first one is this: It was a fatal mistake to recognize Crimea, to grant Crimea autonomy. How is Ukraine, the Government of Ukraine going to get out of that situation [words indistinct]? The second question: Why was former Defense Minister Kostyantyn Morozov dismissed? Why was he not appointed to the post of prime minister? The third question: Why is Ukraine procrastinating with the introduction of the hryvna into the Ukrainian monetary system? Thanks. [Kravchuk] As far as the autonomy of Crimea is concerned, if we regard ourselves as a democratic and law-governed state, then the expression of people's will is a norm for all the civilized states as far as their desire to have any structure is concerned. A referendum was held in Crimea that showed that the majority of the population of Crimea expressed its will that Crimea should become an autonomous republic. This is the first thing. The second thing is that the decision was made at the time when the Soviet Union was still in existence. If we, for example, had ignored the will of the people of Crimea, something different could have happened. The USSR Supreme Soviet and the USSR Congress of People's Deputies could have solved this issue without any, let us say, major consent on the part of Ukraine. The USSR, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were still in existence then, and you know how things were done then. Then we could have lost Crimea, let us say, as a result of a decision by the USSR Supreme Soviet which was empowered to solve these issues. If, for example, any documents were required on the part of Russia and Ukraine, these could become available because at that time, I repeat this, there was no independent state here, at that time it was still the USSR. As far as Kostyantyn Morozov is concerned, this is the post which is approved by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. I submitted Morozov's candidacy request to the Supreme Council of Ukraine to be appointed defense minister. However, Kostyantyn Morozov came to me and asked me to withdraw his candidature for the post of defense minister. He explained this by the fact that the Supreme Council would not support him. Therefore, I withdrew his candidature at his own request. Third, as far as the hryvna is concerned, a stabilization fund is required to introduce the hryvna. At present, we are carrying out intensive, active work with the IMF and with the World Bank so that they would give us a stabilization currency fund for the introduction of the hryvna. If such a fund becomes available we shall be able to introduce the hryvna with the hope of real success and without apprehension of possible inflation. If there is no stabilization fund...[pauses] and inflation may lead to great damage, to grave losses, and to removing strong, authoritative currency -- the Ukrainian hryvna -- from the agenda. [Belgian caller Omelyan Koval] [passage omitted] My second question deals with the sovereignty of Ukraine and the inviolability of its territory stemming from international agreements. It is known that Russia is trying to keep the Crimean shores for its Black Sea Fleet. How does this conform with the principle of independence of the state and inviolability of its borders? The third issue deals with foreign trade and export of state and private property worth billions of dollars beyond the borders of Ukraine at a time when only a small part of its value returns to Ukraine, and the rest is replenishing private bank accounts. What has been done by the government to make these billions return to Ukraine and help stabilize its own currency and its convertibility? [Kravchuk] [Passage omitted] Concerning the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Crimea and how this conforms with Ukraine's sovereignty: Well, you see, there are two aspects of this problem. There were many countries where the U.S. Navy was based; however, this did not endanger the sovereignty of the countries concerned. This is the first thing. Second. We should take realities into account. If Russia has relevant bases today for its Black Sea Fleet in Crimea, Sevastopol, and so on, one cannot make Russia leave these bases by force. We have to agree with Russia by signing relevant agreements, relevant documents which would deal with the leasing, let us say, of the bases on the territory of Crimea for a certain period of time, until this issue is solved on a widescale basis. That is to say, I would not like this to be closely linked with sovereignty. The main thing is how to solve the issue, on what principles. Second, is there a possibility today of solving this issue any other way? I, for example, do not see such a way. Those who think that it can be solved by means of, let us say, diktat or the use of any sanctions or force must see that this is impracticable today. We have to solve this issue in accordance with realities. On foreign trade, you are right to say that part of the money, I just do not know what part -- unfortunately I do not have the figures which are available to you -- billions or any other figure -- but I also know that part of the money fails to return to Ukraine. There are two ways here: an administrative one, that is, the implementation of such measures as, let us say, blocking the borders, perhaps, to take some other measures -- however, in a democratic society this way is doomed to failure, after all -- and another way is to create prerequisites in Ukraine for investments. When we have convertible currency, when we have the right conditions for investment, when we have the right conditions for trade, the commodity producers or private individuals will have no desire to transfer money from Ukraine, but will be interested in investing the money in Ukraine, because here it will give better results and yield higher profits. That is to say, we must approach the situation in exactly this way. We are moving in this direction step by step. [passage omitted on use of Ukrainian language in parliament] [U.S. caller Stovbunenko] [Passage omitted] Will Ukraine reserve the right to have its own nuclear weapons for self-defense? [Kravchuk] [passage omitted] As far as nuclear weapons are concerned, I would like you to understand that today Ukraine cannot maintain nuclear weapons for objective, subjective and any other reasons. It inherited these nuclear weapons, although it has neither scientific nor technical servicing ... [pauses] Ukraine has no structures whatsoever to manufacture, service, and equip nuclear weapons. This is why nuclear weapons here in Ukraine could even endanger Ukraine itself, and not only Ukraine, rather than protect it, if there is no possibility to maintain, equip, service, test and manufacture them. In this case this is a dangerous weapon on the territory of the state and we proceed exactly from this fact. Meanwhile, to build all this Ukraine would need hundreds of -- I emphasize this -- billions of dollars. And we are now looking for at least one billion. This is why we are acting in line with our possibilities. But this does not mean that we are not looking for the other ways toward consolidating defense capacity and ways to use such a weapon which will be highly effective, although non-nuclear. Like all other countries we are looking for exactly these ways. [Zadorozhnyy] [Passage omitted] Of late, there has been a tendency for the left- wing forces to return to power in countries where parliamentary elections have been held. Ukraine has not been an exception. However, if the return of the left-wingers in other states means, well, a change in the economy or in foreign policy, Ukraine may even face the danger of losing its independence. As has been reported, in the near future you are supposed to meet Petro Symonenko, the leader of the Ukrainian communists. What are you going to clear up first and foremost during this meeting? [Kravchuk] I have already met Petro Symonenko. We discussed issues of interest, it seems to me, for both the left-wingers and the right-wingers and for the centrists; in other words, issues of our state's independence, development of market relations, development of normal, goodneighborly relations with the CIS countries, and not only the CIS countries. In other words, we discussed a whole range of issues. It seems to me that the communist leader understands the situation and I did not feel, I say this sincerely, that he had any thought of casting doubt on the independence of our Ukraine. He doubts the way toward, let us say, this independence. This is connected, above all, with the economy and with the social protection of people. This was the keynote. I put questions straightforwardly to receive straightforward answers. If they are sincere, well, I hope they are, there was no indication that the left-wing forces in parliament would immediately raise the question of Ukraine's independence or dependence, or whatever you may call it. It is impossible today to assess the left-wingers in a negative way only and, let us say, the right-wingers in a positive way only. The left-wingers are not a homogeneous mass, excuse me for the word mass, the same as the right-wingers. Life is much more complicated than just labelling this or that deputy either a left-winger or a right-winger. [passage omitted] [Popovych] Mr. President, I will put several questions all at once, as a listener has now broached this subject. We have had very many calls to the editorial office during the week, ahead of this program, on this subject -- that is, presidential elections. The first question I will put to you is: Are you thinking of putting forward your candidacy for president for the next term? That question is from Vasyl Semak from England. He also expressed the view that presidential elections should not be allowed this year at any cost, because, according to him, Kuchma will get in and it will be worse. Vasyl Semak from England thinks this. Also Mykola Lazarenko from England. Highly esteemed Mr. President, can a person with a very limited knowledge of the Ukrainian language be nominated as candidate for president of Ukraine -- I mean Leonid Kuchma. If in mockery of the Ukrainian nation a Russian-speaking president is elected, then is there a danger that he will appeal to his northern fellow Russian-speakers to defend him. Vyacheslav Dymovyy, a lawyer from Moscow and a Ukrainian. This is a slightly different question. Mr. Kravchuk, do you accept the appearance of Kuchma as your mistake? Is Kravchuk intending to bear responsibility for the fact that he will leave the post of president without a struggle? [passage omitted] [Zadorozhnyy] To complete this group of questions, for the listeners are listening, they put questions to us before the program, and naturally they are checking to see if their questions are going to be heard. This is also on the same subject. This is from Vasyl Kucherenko, from Toronto, Canada. Mr. President, is it expedient at the current stage -- when Ukraine is only just becoming consolidated in the international arena, constructing its own policies and economy, resolving domestic and foreign issues and issues of the social system and government, forming a new multiparty parliament, and does not yet have a legal constitutional court or an approved basic law, Ukraine's constitution -- to elect a new president, spending a total of 1.618 trillion karbovantsi on this, plus 462-billion karbovantsi on run-off voting? Mr. President, you took upon yourself the heaviest burden and responsibility for the fate of independent Ukraine and of the Ukrainian people at the most difficult time for Ukraine, in December 1991. Can individual little groups, little parties, and collectives or associations decide whether to elect or not to elect a popular president? Only the whole Ukrainian people can elect you or show no confidence in you. [Kravchuk] Well, I want to answer briefly with certain theses. In Ukraine too at present there is also the opinion among deputies of all levels and among collectives that the election of a president at the present time is premature, (?but) no one is raising the issue of elections of a president in general, whether preterm or new elections, although our Constitution does not envisage preterm elections. The preterm suspension of powers following a referendum is envisaged. But the new Supreme Council has to decide this. I am inclined to think that the Supreme Council cannot remain outside this important question. I have had meetings with deputies, with leaders of parties and forces, and have said that if the the old Supreme Council of that convocation adopted such a law under pressure of, say, and under certain conditions, then the new Supreme Council, which will take over responsibility for four years, should express its attitude, whether it confirms or whether it does something else. But it cannot remain outside this issue. I have to appeal to the new Supreme Council with a request to express its attitude toward the election of both the president and local bodies of power. If the Supreme Council is inclined to this, well, it will be up to the Supreme Council. [Zadorozhnyy] Do we understand that your stand concerning yourself as a candidate to run in the coming presidential election remains unchanged? [Kravchuk] You see, if I join these election processes today, at once, without knowing the Supreme Council's clearly expressed opinion, this means that I am inclined to and I take part in the election which is not envisaged, let us say, in a full-fledged, full-blooded manner, either by the constitution or by all our legitimate laws. In other words, I cannot agree to this today. However, if the Supreme Council clearly expresses its opinion of the status and confirms, at least by constitutional majority, or simple majority or in any other way, its attitude toward this, then I will be able to say about this more distinctly. Now, at this stage, I cannot say anything else. [passage omitted on Moscow listener's comments establishing he is on air] [Unidentified Moscow caller] I am very indignant at yesterday's statement on Ostankino television by Mr. Grachev regarding Ukraine's Navy and its location. I would like to hear from the president what his attitude to this is. [Kravchuk] Regarding the issue with Russia, I cannot see any other way of reaching agreement than by adopting the principles of legality, recognized by the international community, and settling this issue. As for the details, they always are...[pauses] one side is saying one thing -- a Russian minister can say one thing and a Ukrainian one will tell you another, but this does not mean that what ministers are saying is objective truth, let us say, subject to no appeal, as this is a very complex and large-scale problem. We are to settle this issue conclusively with the president of Russia and the government of Russia, and this is what we shall do. I would only like these problems not to be exacerbated prematurely on the basis of some preliminary talks and meetings between ministers and delegations or to be interpreted as the Ukrainian president's position. This is searching for ways, while the Ukrainian president has expressed his position. It is that we shall support Russia's interest in having a Russian naval base in Sevastopol. We shall back, shall we say, Russia's position on the use of the infrastructure that there is and the accords that exist between Ukraine and Russia -- the four documents signed in Yalta, Zavidovo and, let us say, Moscow and Massandra -- for everybody after all to get together and settle this issue. However, no one -- neither Ukraine nor Russia -- can enforce diktat or a unilateral wish or unilateral advantages. This is a complex problem which should be tackled wisely and calmly in order not to fall out or conflict. [Zadorozhnyy] In that case, can it be understood that the next stage of negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet and its division will now be tackled by both presidents directly, that of Ukraine and that of Russia? [Kravchuk] At any rate, today I had a conversation with the leadership of Russia. I talked with Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin. I offered to meet him, now either at governmental or presidential level, with appropriate ministers and experts seated at our side, and make a decision, because this is the issue that will not be settled by ministers. This is to be settled by the presidents and governments. Documents and estimates, however, are of course to be produced by specialists, including military specialists, but this is not the issue that can be settled by military ministers. I just would not like any, let us say, far-reaching conclusions to be made yet on the basis of the meeting in Crimea that was held. It was difficult, it was not easy and there is no need to investigate now who is right and who is not -- especially on the basis of speeches by ministers and their meetings with journalists. This, I would like to repeat, cannot be done. This is only searching for ways rather than resolving the problem conclusively. The final settlement of the issue is up to the presidents. [Popovych] Mr. President, the situation has become so aggravated. Please tell us: Can such a situation arise -- I will repeat this -- in which Ukraine will have to turn to international organizations or seek participation of such countries as, for example, the United States of America in the solution of this issue? By the way, there was a news item saying that the U.S. side expressed its readiness to help resolve the Crimean issue. [Zadorozhnyy] [word indistinct] concerning nuclear disarmament. [Kravchuk] This is a matter of a specific nature. Nuclear states.... [changes thought]. For example, why was the United States involved in this situation? Because an agreement on nuclear arms reduction was signed between the USSR and the United States of America. We also inherited the treaty that was signed, and we are now responsible for it. So, the participation of the United States here is logical, and not just logical but also concrete. As far as the Black Sea Fleet is concerned, I believe we must resolve this issue with Russia, and I am convinced that we will resolve it. [Zadorozhnyy] Were there any statements concerning a third party? Because a statement by President Boris Yeltsin's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov has already become available to us. According to the statement, Yeltsin said the following, in particular: Russia will not allow any outside interference in the resolution of the Black Sea Fleet issue. [Kravchuk] As far as I know, I have never said this anywhere; neither Yukhym Zvyahilskyy nor Ivan Plyushch have been saying this. Therefore, I do not know the source of this news. I have always said that there is a state policy, and there are opinions of certain political parties and forces. Therefore, if Zhirinovskiy says something, I will not refute him at the state level. I will, however, if Yeltsin says it. I have never said this, and I have never expressed myself in this connection. [passage omitted] [Popovych] We have received another fax; this one is from Mykola Plavyuk. I do not think it is necessary to explain who Mykola Plavyuk is [former Ukrainian president in exile]. Does the (?experience) of the elections to Ukraine's Supreme Council help in completing work on Ukraine's constitution, and what are the prospects of the Cabinet of Ministers beginning real reform of Ukraine's economy in the very near future under your leadership? [Kravchuk] With regard to the Constitution, I think that one will be able to speak of the new parliament's real possibilities for starting on the constitution after the additional elections to the Supreme Council have been held. At present, 338 deputies have been elected. It was said at the Supreme Council on 22 April that the authorities of 335 deputies had been confirmed. This number of deputies is evidently insufficient for a constitutional majority, however; that is 300 votes. Therefore, to say now that the Supreme Council can start on the constitution immediately, before the additional deputies are elected, is impracticable. When a full-blooded parliament that represents all of Ukraine and all of its electors is elected, however, I believe that this is the largest and most important task--with which the old parliament did not manage to deal. This was the greatest fault in its work. As far as the economy about which you speak is concerned, I already said something at the beginning of the program about the fact that some kind of positive, perhaps not processes, but rough outlines--I am saying this very carefully--regarding the economic situation are already taking place. We should begin wide-scale, let us say, privatization of small, medium, and large enterprises. The reforms that will take place to improve banking, credit, and structural reconstruction are all on the agenda. They are not only on the agenda, but in practice are already under way. [Popovych] Another question on the elections from Yosyp Lesiv from Belgium. Elections to local bodies of power in Ukraine's oblasts and rayons are proposed in conjunction with the new presidential elections. According to my understanding of the current electoral law, the elections to local bodies of power will abolish the institution of presidential missions. As an observer of Ukrainian political life, I believe that Ukraine needs strong executive power now. This is the stand of our listener. [Kravchuk] Well, I can only perceive this is as a stance, although I have also said this in my domestic usage that the president--if he has powers as head of state and as the executive power--he should also have corresponding powers in the local bodies of power and in the corresponding structures. I am convinced that the Soviet representative form and the presidential executive form do not relate to each other. This is my conviction. There are also other points of view, but I support the one that says that if the president should have strong authority, then he should have the corresponding strong structures. If the president has representative authority, then he is another type of president. One should even begin to think about how to elect him, when to elect him. Is it necessary for a president with only representative functions to be elected by the public? These are the main problems. Without resolving them, it is difficult to speak of the seriousness of our intentions. [passage omitted] [Popovych] I have a question, Mr. President. Returning to the Crimea's problems: Yuriy Meshkov himself, the president of the autonomy, is stirring up anti-Ukrainian sentiments in Crimea. His calls on the eve of elections show this. In general, this is some kind of a paradox for the president to call on voters not to vote for deputies to Ukraine's Supreme Council. So do his current decrees on personnel changes in the power department structures--in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the security service. Now he has decided to replace the justice minister. Will new measures be taken, as his decrees have been revoked, as we know. Will new more efficient measures be taken with regard to Meshkov's anticonstitutional actions? Perhaps in connection with this, here is a question from Taras Voytenko from Moscow as to whether there will be political autonomization of the regions in order to avoid conflicts such as in Moldova and Georgia. [Kravchuk] Well, naturally there is some kind of link here. As far as the decrees by Meshkov are concerned, I have already been saying that all the decrees issued by Meshkov will be rescinded by the president of Ukraine if they violate the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine. This will be done without fail. I am speaking about the economic decrees only. There may be relevant easements in relation to these, because the idea is to give more economic freedom, to apply the Ukrainian president's decree that grants additional opportunities for the economic liberalization of the economy, and so on. Here we will calculate the situation stemming from this decree and from our laws. Those laws and decrees that contradict our constitutional norms will be rescinded. They mean, as far as I understand, that the more political independence granted to the regions will lead to easing the situation. Well, this is an opinion. I regard Ukraine as a unitarian state today, and there may be some prospects for steps forward in this direction. However, if political autonomy is granted today to all oblasts, if this is what they mean, this could lead to the disintegration--I say this sincerely--of our statehood. As far as economic autonomies, economic freedoms, as far as the broadest possible freedoms are concerned, I support this. However, any talk about political autonomy is premature. [Popovych] What do you mean by political autonomy? Do you mean free economic zones in certain regions, or do you mean all of Ukraine somehow? [Kravchuk] No, this means, for example, oblasts receive great powers, say, in dealing with property and utilizing budgets. More account is taken of their needs and of the sources for covering their expenditures, for example, with regard to issues connected with quotas or restrictions and the possibilities to make use of products to sell in order to replenish hard currency funds. That is quite a lot. I have only named a few points. These are economic freedoms whereby it is not necessary to go to Kiev, to the center, about every little thing. It can be decided there, on the spot. As far as economic zones are concerned, however, that is another matter. It is envisaged in the law and should be examined in every specific case for each territory. What I said about economic autonomy applies to all territories. [Popovych] Another listener, Vasyl Semak from Nottingham, Great Britain, asks whether the president believes Ukraine will survive to the end of your term, because the foreign press writes that Ukraine will be divided. [Kravchuk] Well, everyone is making predictions. As one says, curse the tongues of those who say this about Ukraine and about its possibilities, and praise God that Ukraine has survived now for two and a half years since independence was declared. It is surviving, working hard, laboriously reaching for economic heights, overcoming crisis, and creating its political institutions and laws. We do not succeed at everything. Not everything is appropriate to our possibilities, as one says. This is true. The foreign press writes what it wants to see, however. We do not want this. We listen to the foreign press and say that you may bark if you really want to bark at Ukraine so much, but the show goes on. [passage omitted] [Zadorozhnyy] Petro Dyadyk from Poland points out that the anniversary of the deportation of the Crimean Tatars will be commemorated and asks why Poland is silent about the Wisla operation. Presumably, he would like to know Ukraine's position on this. [Kravchuk] Well, we raised this very issue when I met President Walesa at the parliament during my visit to Poland. We instructed our relevant institutions, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, to study it more and to submit the appropriate adjustments and an appropriate stand on this issue. That is, it has not been left unconsidered. [passage omitted] [Kravchuk] You know, I would like to say something else. We often hear on the surface of our statehood, for example, in political circles, at rallies, in squares, and even in the Supreme Council, many words that disturb people because the words are against Ukraine. When I talk to people, however--for example, in collectives, in collectives in the East, in the West, in the South, and in the North--I am even more convinced that the issue of statehood, the issue of independence, is now internally characteristic to our people of all nationalities. This is very important. These years did not pass in vain. [passage omitted] Goodbye. I wish all of you radio listeners -- Ukrainians and non- Ukrainians abroad -- good health, happiness, and all good things. [passage omitted]
