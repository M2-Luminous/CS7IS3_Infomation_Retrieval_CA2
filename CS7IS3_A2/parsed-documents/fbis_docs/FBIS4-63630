Some of the refugees have already lived here for more than a year, paying between 20,000 and 30,000 rubles a month for a tiny room. Twenty-six families are housed here, while approximately 6,000 such people have been registered, in all, in Samara alone. Since many plants in the city are idle or are "half-working," it is very hard for the newcomers to find work. The refugees' prospect of acquiring housing is also virtually nil. The municipal budget is inadequate to house even those on its own waiting list. According to Oleg Sysuyev, the city's mayor, Samara has given up practically all it could to accommodate the refugees -- rest homes, guest houses, tourist bases.... The situation in Samara is archetypal for many cities in Russia. As of 1 January this year, according to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, there were 609,085 refugees and displaced persons in the Russian Federation, and this figure is growing. The average percentage of the number of refugees and displaced persons in the Russian Federation as a whole stands at 0.47 percent. The North Caucasus region is most saturated: The Ingush Republic -- approximately 50 percent of the size of the local population; North Ossetia -- 7.5 percent; Stavropol Kray -- 3.5 percent; Krasnodar Kray -- 2.7 percent; Rostov Oblast -- 0.7 percent. The percentage of refugees and displaced persons is higher than the average for the Russian Federation in certain oblasts in the Central Region: Belgorod and Tambov Oblasts -- 0.8 percent; Orel Oblast -- 0.6 percent; Kaluga Oblast -- 0.5 percent. In 1992, as is known, the Russian Federation Government adopted the long-term republic program "Migration" geared to supporting refugees and displaced persons from countries in the near abroad. But it is being implemented with tremendous difficulty. Until our economy starts working in the new, market way, the country will be unable to substantially ease the lot of migrants and other categories of people who find themselves in dire need.
