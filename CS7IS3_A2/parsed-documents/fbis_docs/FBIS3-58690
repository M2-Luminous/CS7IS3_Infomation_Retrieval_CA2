According to Ciampi, the dialogue with Russia must be constructive. This dialogue must see the West committed to spurring Moscow to carry on with its reforms, while at the same time aiding Russia to overcome this difficult and lengthy transition period, Ciampi said. During his speech to the summit, Ciampi said that giving greater political emphasis to the coming G-7 summit meant making a valid contribution to a dialogue for even greater rapprochement between Russia and the West. Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta Monday [10 January] also stressed the need for a tie-in between NATO and the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, stating that CSCE peacekeeping missions, above all in Asia and in the republics of the former Soviet Union, cannot help but draw on Russian national interest which must, however, be internationalized, not an instrument of an imperialistic policy. While on the subject of peace-keeping, Andreatta said that the experience in Somalia and Bosnia has suggested that the use of military units is not always the most suitable instrument for operations having a large humanitarian content. There is a need to find crowd control measures which are not lethal in nature, he said. Italy has also called for greater and more analytical ground observations so as to better identify those responsible for truce-breaking.
