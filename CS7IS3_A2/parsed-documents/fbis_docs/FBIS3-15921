Their number increases by something like one hundred people a day, announced on Thursday an official in the Russian Federal Migration Service. "Russia will accept only those who qualify as refugees", Yuriy Arkhipov, the head of the department on external migration, declared in an article with ITAR-TASS. "No one will be able to get that status automatically". Arkhipov holds the opinion that Russia has ended up with a crisis situation in the immigrant sphere because the law adopted on refugees and the act on Russia's accession to the United Nations 1951 convention "on the status of refugees" were not very well thought out. At the same time, he noted, "the Western countries quickly evaluated the situation and, as soon as Russia signed the convention, made their entry laws much stricter". At that time, a regional office representing the Department of the UN High Commissioner for Refugee Affairs was formed in Russia, with the goal of solving the problems of immigrants who were already in the Russian Federation. Therefore, Arkhipov said, "Russia, without being aware of it, became the country which received the whole flood of migrants from the countries of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East". In order to solve the problems created by immigrants from developing countries, it is necessary to, first of all, "regulate the situation on the border through legislation and international agreements", said the migration official. That does not mean, he cautioned, that we "should erect an iron curtain, but we cannot put up with the transparency of the Russian borders any longer". Arkhipov expressed his opinion that every country in the Commonwealth of Independent States should take the responsibility for the security of its borders upon itself. Otherwise, "trying to limit the flow of immigrants is like bailing water with a sieve". Besides, Arkhipov said, Russia should let the world community know through the mass media that it "is not considering establishing any aid programmes for massive waves of immigrants from third-world countries". Explaining the way the immigrants operate, the official said the majority of them do not immediately apply for refugee status as soon as they cross the border, as they should under the law, but try to get to Moscow. "The country's capital is not a reception point". The migration services, even after they grant refugee status to somebody, "do not then settle the immigrant in the Moscow region". Moscow already holds about 180 thousand immigrants, who have created a whole mass of problems. "They do not respect Russian citizens, ignore the laws of the country sheltering them, and do not obey law enforcement representatives", he claimed. Arkhipov said the situation can be changed only by "the creation of a clear mechanism for determining the legal status of foreign citizens on Russian territory as a basis for adopting the following appropriate decisions".
