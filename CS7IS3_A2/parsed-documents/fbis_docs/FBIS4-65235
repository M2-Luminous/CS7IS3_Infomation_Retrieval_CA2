FBIS4-65235 "drweu093_q_94006" FBIS-WEU-94-093 Daily Report 10 May 1994 TURKEY PKK's Bayik Comments on Fighting Among Kurds PKK's Bayik Comments on Fighting Among Kurds NC1305101094 Istanbul OZGUR ULKE in Turkish 10 May 94 p 4 NC1305101094 Istanbul OZGUR ULKE Turkish BFN [Text] Kurd-A/Zalkah--With the clashes between the Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK] and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] in south Kurdistan [north Iraq] about to end, Cemil Bayik, head of the Workers Party of Kurdistan's [PKK] Kurdish People's Liberation Army, has informed Kurd-A [KURDISH NEWS AGENCY] that the fighting was the outcome of direct and indirect provocation by various countries. Stressing that the fighting involves those who want to maintain the status quo and those who oppose it, Bayik said the people are against bloodshed among brothers. He asserted: "Eleven organizations have established two separate groups to work to end the clashes. But some circles want to change the status quo in the south. France, Turkey, and Iraq want to have the status quo changed in favor of Mas'ud Barzani. They want to further the concept of autonomy. The United States and Britain want the situation to stay as it is." Defending the view that the people can influence the effort to end the clashes, Bayik said they will try to strengthen the people's opposition to the fighting. He asserted: "The PKK has made an intensive effort to obstruct the fratricide since the clashes began. It considered the wish of the people for an end to the fighting and received significant support. The people's strengthening opposition shows that support. Professional establishments, mass organizations, and students are part of the protest move. The success of that effort depends on the stance of the DPK and PUK. More effective results can be achieved if a concerted effort is made. Time will show how effective the effort that is being made will be. The clashes may escalate because the DPK and PUK do not trust each other. They do not seem willing to end the fighting. We are trying to strengthen the people's opposition. We will make it more effective. The people are opposed to the clashes. They are uneasy. They want the fratricide to end as soon as possible. The people have protested the issue and delivered warnings. Those who do not heed them will be unable to account for their behavior."
