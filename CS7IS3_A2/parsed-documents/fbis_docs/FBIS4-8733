The letter reads: You are aware that the aggressor has been attacking the protected zone of Gorazde for 20 days now, using troops and military equipment brought from Serbia and Montenegro. The aggressor's forces have occupied a large part of the protected zone and destroyed and burned down 21 villages around Gorazde. Some 230 people have been killed and 800 wounded in the town center. Civilian facilities in the centre of Gorazde are being destroyed with all available weapons. Tens of thousands of people are facing death from shooting or starvation, the letter says. It is a fact that the United Nations and its representatives in Bosnia-Herzegovina did not use their mandate and powers granted to them by UNSC resolutions 824 and 836. As a consequence the population which -- through the arms embargo -- has been denied the right to self-defense has been left without any protection. We therefore consider those who make decisions within the UN as being responsible for what has happened, the letter says. We demand that the UNSC urgently take appropriate measures in keeping with Article 7 of the UN Charter, which means to use force to stop the attacks by Serb aggressor's forces against Gorazde. We repeat that this is an aggression by Serbia and Montenegro against the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has been going on for two years. We demand the urgent establishment of an exclusion zone around Gorazde, from which the aggressor's troops and military equipment must withdraw. Mr. President, we are talking about tens of thousands of civilians who, together with the rest of the world, expect that the peace-keeping forces will fulfill their duty, the letter says.
