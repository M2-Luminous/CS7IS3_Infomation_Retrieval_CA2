But no subsequent clarification can change the fact that Ms. Raphel's remarks constitute the most dramatic and inexplicable turnabout in U.S. foreign policy since the Clinton administration came to power. It is not impossible that Ms. Raphel did not mean to question the validity of the Instrument of Accession, but despite being inundated with queries from Washington think tanks and newspapers all over the world, the U.S. State department has not issued a contradiction. Policy makers in New Delhi have no option but to take Ms. Raphel's statement seriously and fathom the motives behind it. The shift has not really been sudden. Ms. Raphel started several weeks ago by saying that the U.S. considered the whole of Kashmir a disputed territory. She has since elaborated that the U.S. no longer considered the Simla agreement a valid basis for the settlement of the dispute. In support of this she cited the fact that there had been very few discussions under the agreement in the last 20 years. At this point observers in India assumed that the U.S. was considering reviving the U.N. resolutions of 1948, which proposed a plebiscite in the State once peace had been restored. But in her latest briefing Ms Raphel has broken entirely new ground. The U.N. resolutions envisaged only two choices for the people of Kashmir, whether to belong to Pakistan or India. If Ms. Raphel's briefing truly reflects government policy, the U.S. has explicitly delinked itself from that resolution. It now believes that the Kashmiris must have the right to choose independence if they so wish. What is more this right must be exercised by the people in the whole of the princely state of Kashmir, i.e., both Jammu and Kashmir and `Azad Kashmir,' including Gilgit, and the other areas that Pakistan has already explicitly annexed. The possibility can no longer be ruled out, therefore that the U.S. is now questioning the validity of the Instrument of Accession that made Kashmir part of India because it would not mind seeing a fourth nation in the subcontinent, carved out of bits of India and Pakistan. If this is indeed so, Ms. Raphel's remark questioning the accession was only undiplomatic and not inaccurate. What is genuinely surprising about the above stance is its illogicality. To begin with, it is simply not true that the U.S. did not accept India's sovereignty over not only present day Jammu and Kashmir but over the whole of the original princely state as it existed in 1947. During the Security Council debate in April-May 1948, the U.S. permanent Representative, Warren Austin stated categorically that with the signature of the Instrument of Accession sovereignty over Jammu and Kashmir passed from Maharaja Hari Singh to the government of India... That was why, he said, it was India that had come to the U.N. as the petitioner (Security Council Official Records, Vol. 1-15, Page 371). The acceptance of Indian sovereignty is implicit in the U.S.' support for the Security Council resolution of May 1948 which called for the vacation of the entire state by Pakistani forces, the maintenance of a sufficient number of troops by India to ensure the return to peace, and a plebiscite after an unspecified period of time to be held under Indian auspices. Thenceforth every time the U.S. endorsed a plebiscite, it willy nilly endorsed the fact that Sovereignty over the whole of Kashmir vested in India till the time when it was held. Ms. Raphel's remark that the Simla agreement ought to be scrapped because very few discussions had been held under it, turns logic on its head. Every border between nation is the result of an agreement, sometimes explicit, at others implicit. When both countries recognise the border there are no discussions. These arise only when there is a dispute. Between 1972 and 1990 there were very few such discussions because Pakistan accepted the LoC as the de facto international border. They began to question it once more only when an insurrection, carely fomented by them for four years, broke out in 1990. It was India's mistake that it even agreed to discuss Kashmir in any form or shape after that. That has given the opening to the U.S. that it may be seeking to exploit today. In questioning the Instrument of Accession the Clinton Administration has questioned the basis of not only the accession of Kashmir to India, but of more than 600 princely states to India and Pakistan. What is more, since the Instrument was the lynchpin of the transfer of British paramountcy over the princely states to the successor governments of India and Pakistan, it calls into question the transfer of power itself, and consequently the legal basis for the existence of Pakistan and India. Why on earth should it want to do so? If one were to believe its protestations it is with the noblest of motives -- Peace and Human Rights. Both of these are reasonable, even unexceptionable goals. But so far as the maintenance of peace is concerned, the U.S. would achieve it far more easily if it put pressure on Pakistan to stop fomenting rebellion in Kashmir, told it to forget its legal claim to `PoK' [Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir] and told both countries to respect the status quo and turn LoC into the international boundary, with perhaps minor modifications, as was envisaged beyond a shadow or doubt in the Simla agreement. As for the Human Rights, Ms. Raphel who was in India when the Babri Masjid was demolished and quizzed several senior journalists, including this writer, about its fallout on Hindu-Muslim relations, knows better than anyone else in the State department just how tense these relations are today. She can hardly be ignorant of the holocaust that would follow if Kashmir was snatched away from the country. The U.S. did start down the road outlined above in 1991 and to curb Pakistan activities in Kashmir it put the country on the terrorist watch list, and it repeatedly urged both countries to settle the dispute under the Simla agreement. But that was the policy of Mr. George Bush. To gauge what this might be just take a look at where Kashmir -- the whole state and not just Indian Jammu and Kashmir -- is situated. Kashmir is like a broad dagger thrust between Sinkiang and Tibet. What is more it is ideally suited to dominate the largest of the Central Asian republics, Uzbekistan. A free Kashmir, acutely vulnerable to both India and Pakistan, because it is dependent on both for markets, tourists and access to the sea, will immediately look for a Godfather. Who could fill the bill better than the Americans? There could be a secondary purpose also. This would be to drive a physical wedge between China and India. Unlike our own intellectuals, U.S. analysts could not have failed to grasp the significance of the Sino-Indian agreement on the Border areas, of Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao's nearly four hours of talks with the Chinese Premier, Mr. Li Peng, the great importance that China attached to the visit, and the unmistakable hints given by the latter that he expected much closer cooperation with India on international issues in the future. It is even possible that the outcome of Mr. Rao's visit to China tipped the scales within the U.S. administration in favour of the policy that it is now unveiling. The above analysis admittedly gives a concreteness to U.S. design that could be misleading. U.S. analysts must know that an independent, united Kashmir will be resisted by both India and Pakistan. They have also learned from the public's reaction to the involvement of U.S. troops in Somalia, that Americans are not deeply interested in international affairs, and especially in military adventures abroad, if these mean a loss of American lives. Despite this when India's very nationhood is at stake, if the government's repeated assertions do not bring forth an explicit endorsement of the validity of the Instrument of Accession, it will do well to put the worst construction on Ms. Raphel's statement. The first need is to explore afresh whether Pakistan realises that it has finally reached a situation where it stands to lose more from its adventurism than to gain from it. If so, an agreement to settle somewhat along the LoC and then work jointly to give the Kashmiris the maximum possible autonomy within existing boundaries, may begin to look a lot more attractive even to them. If it does not, then India will do well to close the Kashmir dispute unilaterally, by declaring unambiguously that the accession of the State to India is no longer open to debate. Secondly, India will do well to strengthen its bridges with China. China faces similar problems with regard to Tibet and may therefore welcome cooperation on this issue in its own self-interest.
