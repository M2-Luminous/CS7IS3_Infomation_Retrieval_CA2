These attempts were made during the Central Committee meeting in Tunis last Saturday [18 June]. The meeting was devoted to discussion of completion of the arrangements for transporting some of Fatah's cadres to the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. The source said that 'Arafat did not give a specific answer to the members' request but they understood that he linked his decision to the results of the visit of Ahmad Quray' (Abu-'Ala'), head of the PLO's Economic Department and economy minister in the Palestinian Authority, to the United States and his talks with World Bank officials on the aid the bank intends to give the Palestinian Authority. A Fatah Central Committee member said that 'Arafat would probably move to Jericho around the middle of next month after his visit to Paris on 6 July to receive the Houphouet-Boigny peace prize along with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, and after a clear and accurate picture emerges about the financial situation of the Palestinian Authority in the light of the meeting of the donor states in the second week of July.
