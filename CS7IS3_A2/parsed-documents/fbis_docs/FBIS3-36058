In the following recording, you will hear an assessment of this forum given by Birkavs at the airport right after he returned to Riga: [Begin Birkavs recording] Defining the Baltic lands in Europe and the world...in fact, one must conclude that what the previous economic forums defined--declaring in 1973 that they were going from fixed to floating exchange rates in the world--that this is the end of the economic consequences of World War II. And in 1989, when the Singing Revolution and all other kinds of revolutions began in Europe, they declared that that was the end of the political consequences of World War II. Neither the economic nor the political consequences of World War II have, in fact, been liquidated, and, in this sense, the Baltic question is one of those consequences of World War II that have not been liquidated. This was very significant--especially because it was not a Baltic seminar, but a Baltic-Nordic one, and this is where we were linked. The question of Baltic unity: It was a fairly fundamental emphasis to demonstrate our unity even though Russia was trying to introduce a certain dissonance, for which perhaps there is some small basis. And there was talk from the rostrum that only two countries, Estonia and Latvia, have developed in a direction that distances them ever further from Russia. Lithuania is bound by its policies more to Russia. At the World Economic Forum, nearly all the conversations ended, one way or another, with Russia. The world is concerned about Russia's future because the high inflation [words indistinct] and the view that the ultimate result will lead to some sort of cataclysm, the prognosis for which at the moment is relatively difficult. In practice, we have felt the clearly expressed view from everywhere that we have gone quite far. Four countries have distanced themselvesa from Russia more: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, and Latvia. Estonia is being described as the locomotive of central and eastern Europe, with the most rapid development.
