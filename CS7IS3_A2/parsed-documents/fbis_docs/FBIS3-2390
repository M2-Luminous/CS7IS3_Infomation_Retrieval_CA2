A taxi driver estimated that only about 10 percent of the drivers continued with the strike yesterday. In front of the communications building, taxis again formed a long line to wait for passengers. The driver said: The strike ended quickly as a result of the involvement of the taxi company. The company issued a circular to taxi drivers, saying that if they continued to strike, they would not be allowed to hire taxis. The drivers had no alternative but to return to work. But some drivers who were still on strike said that they would take further action after collecting views from people in the same trade.
