On Sunday Andel said that "neither himself nor SNS honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes knew about Molnar's visit to Moscow to attend the congress organized by Russian ultra nationalist and Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Zhirinovskiy. SNS Chairman Jan Slota said on Monday that Molnar was sent to Moscow by the SNS leadership as an observer. Molnar said that although Andel could not know about his visit due to illness, Prokes was informed about it. According to unofficial announcement provided by the SNS today it neither had established nor intended to establish contacts with any liberal party as it does not share liberal values. Informal and unofficial consultations with LDP representatives could not be considered the SNS's orientation towards the LDP's political line just as the presence of Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) at the Bratislava Central Market place cannot be considered proof of the SDL's inclination towards a market economy, says a SNS statement. Molnar declined to answer the question of whether or not he would meet Zhirinovskiy during his anticipated visit to Slovakia.
