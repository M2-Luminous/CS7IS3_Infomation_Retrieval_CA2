In this difficult struggle we have managed, along with all the other Serbs who have been vilified for demonstrating solidarity with us, to resist all the pressures which fundamentally aimed to bring about Serbian divisions and rifts, Krajisnik said. Krajisnik maintains that there has been no justice or law in all these assaults on us, something that is best borne out by the European Union [EU] stands, as it in fact encouraged the Muslims to first gain a foothold in central Bosnia and then to take on the Serbs in the spring. We will, of course, be ready for them, Krajisnik cautioned. Asked by a Obrenovac radio reporter whether a change in the leadership of Herceg-Bosna would tilt the balance of forces on the ground, Mr. Krajisnik said that the possibility of Mate Boban being replaced by Akmadzic would result in better relations between the Croats and Muslims, something that in its turn would not bring about changes to the Serbian negotiating position. "All the more so since neither of them takes any steps, as this is done by Mr. Tudjman, the Catholic Church and the Vatican. In any case, as far as the Muslims are concerned, there will be no further concessions, as it has already been proved that they cannot reach their goal. Concessions in western or eastern Bosnia would jeopardize the continuity of the republic of Srpska," Krajisnik said.
