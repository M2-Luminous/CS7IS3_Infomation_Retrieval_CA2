The gist of the New Year address was reported by the Nepalese papers HINDU DAINIK, NEPAL POST and KUER PRASAD, the BBC television of India, the SANA News Agency, radio and television of Syria, the Syrian papers AL-SAURA and TISHRIN and the Thai paper BANGKOK POST. The Yemeni paper AL-THAWRAH January 2 said: "President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in his New Year address said it is the United States that has created the fictitious `doubt about nuclear development by the North', and it is the United States that has actually shipped nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula and has been threatening the Korean people. "Pressure or threat will have no effect on the Korean people, President Kim Il-song said, warning that such an attempt may invite catastrophe, far from finding a solution to the problem. "He stressed that the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula must on any account be settled through Korea-U.S. talks." The Malaysian paper STAR January 2 quoted President Kim Il-song as saying "since a joint statement has been adopted by Korea and the United States, the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula can be settled fairly if both sides keep and implement the principles that have been agreed upon." The Malaysian radio and television and newspaper NEW STRAITS TIMES also reported the same content.
