According to Hizballah sources, a Hizballah delegation in Damascus for the past two days has met Syrian officials but no member of the U.S. delegation. The U.S. delegation was expected to arrive in Lebanon yesterday afternoon but the visit was postponed until today following contacts between the Lebanese Government and the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. The delegation is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri and Lebanese areas and villages. It is unlikely that Speaker Nabih Birri will receive the U.S. delegation. Sources close to 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah say Fadlallah is not interested in the delegation or its mission. According to diplomatic sources, Israel has conveyed an offer to the delegation saying it is ready to release all the Lebanese and Palestinian detainees once Israeli pilot Ron Arad is released. Hizballah leaders have said they refuse to meet the U.S. delegation face to face but noted that this [communication] may take place through friendly powers. Hizballah Political Bureau Chairman Husayn al-Khalil said there is no connection between Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah's current visit to Damascus and the visit conducted by the U.S. Congressional delegation. He added that Nasrallah's visit was scheduled a week ago for talks with Syrian Vice President 'Abd-al- Halim Khaddam. Al-Khalil said: Khaddam did not discuss this issue with us and no efforts are being exerted in this regard. Al-Khalil said Hizballah officials refuse to meet face to face with any U.S. official but he expressed willingness to look into the issue through an honest mediator who is not biased toward Israel. Al-Khalil said: We cannot give the Americans the honor of negotiating with us in this regard. Al-Khalil said any party wishing to play this [mediation] role should guarantee the release of all the Lebanese and Palestinian detainees captured in Lebanese territory, including Shaykh 'Abd-al- Karim 'Ubayd.
