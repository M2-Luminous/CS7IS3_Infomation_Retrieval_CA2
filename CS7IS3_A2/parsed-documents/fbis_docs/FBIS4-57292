A high-ranking PGR official disclosed that an investigation of money laundering in Nuevo Leon began by presidential order in 1991 and has not concluded. "We have fully identified about 70 businessmen who live in Monterrey and have investments in Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, and Tamaulipas," the official said. "Each drug trafficker we investigated led us to other people involved. What were believed to be simple covers turned out to be part of a gigantic money laundering network of international proportions" the interviewed officer said. All of those involved are directly connected with the Matamorros Jail, and their leader is Juan Garcia Abrego, the officer added. The mafia's money, he said, is invested primarily in 15 types of industries and businesses. "There are narcobusinessmen in construction, telecommunications, automobile dealerships, real estate, and medium-sized export and foundry companies," he said. He added: "There is also some involvement in art agencies, travel agencies, transportation, buildings, finance companies, the media, electronics purchases and sales, cattle ranching, investments, and air cargo." The PGR official said there are specific cases where only a few of the partners in a consortium have committed the crime, not every business partner. The results of the huge investigation, he added, have just now been made public, and he guessed that this is only the beginning of a long chain of arrests and searches. "These investigations have been the most complicated the PGR has had to face during this six-year term," the source said. Some of the businessmen involved in narcodollar money laundering have left a trail and been identified, and there is evidence against them. "These are people from middle-class families who are suddenly millionaires overnight. They make their first appearance in society as owners of gigantic businesses," he said. According to the high-ranking official, the businessmen involved in money laundering are known to everyone. They appear in newspapers, create publicity for themselves, and enjoy much prestige. "They obey all laws, pay taxes, keep their bank accounts in good order, request loans pretending to have financial problems, and even go to church," he said. "They keep everything in order except their business money comes from drug trafficking," the official said.
