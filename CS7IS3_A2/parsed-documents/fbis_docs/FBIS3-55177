"This does not correspond to reality", the press service said and blamed the lawyer of Lukyanov, who is standing trial for organising the 1991 abortive Soviet coup, for misinformation. The press service said that the president had sent a message of greetings to all the lawmakers elected to the new parliament in which he expressed hope for joint constructive work. However, the lawyer of Lukyanov presented the message, while speaking in court, in such a way as if it had been sent personally to Lukyanov. "Unfortunately, reporters failed to realise this `nuance' which exposes defects in professional ethics of the lawyer", the press service said.
