FR941020-0-00018 FR941020-0-00005 B. Specific Issues 1. Affiliate's Role in a Transportation Transaction In the final rule, the Commission required pipelines to post discount offers when affiliates are involved in a transaction, even if they are not the shipper. The Commission reasoned that if a pipeline knows of an affiliate's involvement in a deal, it may offer a discount to the actual shipper to benefit the affiliate. The offer of a discount in this situation would be no different than providing the discount directly to the affiliate. MGS/Natural and Tenneco contend this provision is anticompetitive because shippers will be loathe to deal with affiliates if the details of their deals are disclosed. They contend that maintenance of the discount information under ยง250.16 is all that should be required. TGPL requests clarification that posting is required only if the pipeline knows of the affiliate's involvement when granting the discount; it asserts subsequently acquired knowledge of involvement should not trigger a posting requirement or an obligation to make the discount available to other shippers. Panhandle Pipelines request clarification that knowledge of the discount refers only to knowledge by those granting the discount and does not apply to general corporate knowledge held by others in the company, but not communicated to those negotiating discounts. The Commission will retain the obligation to post discounts when an affiliate is involved in the transaction, but is not the shipper. Such disclosure should have no different effect than disclosure of the same deal when the affiliate is acting as the shipper, and MGS/Natural and Tenneco do not explain why the effect should be any different. The Commission, however, will clarify that in posting such offers, the pipelines need not disclose the name of the actual shipper. They must only report that a discount has been offered in an affiliate transaction. The Commission grants TGPL's request that discounts need to be posted only when the pipeline knows of the affiliate's involvement at the time the discount is made. Only if the pipeline has current knowledge of the affiliate's involvement could the role of the affiliate be a basis for offering the discount. With respect to Panhandle Pipelines' request, the Commission agrees in principle that discounts need to be disclosed only when the officials involved in granting the discount are aware of the affiliate involvement. Pipelines, however, are responsible for establishing organizational procedures in order to dispel questions about whether the responsible officials have learned of information about affiliate involvement that may be held by others in the organization. 2. Posting Period The final rule required affiliate discounts to be posted for a 90 day period. Several pipelines contend that the 90 day period is longer than necessary to effectuate the purposes of the rule, because discounts are often available only for a short time and become stale. They further contend that posting for 90 days will clutter EBBs with unnecessary information. The range of alternatives they propose extends from 7 to 30 days. The Commission will modify the posting requirement to require that the discount information be posted for 30 days from the date of first posting. 30 days of posting is sufficient time for shippers to monitor affiliate discounts. Since many discounts last for only a month, a 30 day posting requirement will help ensure that the posted information is current. 3. Posting of the Transportation Path The National Registry requests clarification that if discount offers are dependent on the use of more than one receipt point, all such points must be disclosed. Indicated Companies contend that Standard H should be amended to require disclosure of the full transportation path of the affiliate discount. The Commission will clarify that Standard H requires the posting of all conditions of an affiliate discount. Thus, if the discount is based on the use of a particular transportation path or one or more receipt points, that information must be posted. The Commission is not sure whether Indicated Companies is requesting that the pipeline post the full transportation path even when the path is not a condition of the discount. If that is the request, it is denied. Pipelines must post the delivery points for every affiliate transaction. Requiring the posting of receipt points could be voluminous and is unnecessary unless the use of certain receipt points is a condition of the discount, in which case the information would need to be posted.
