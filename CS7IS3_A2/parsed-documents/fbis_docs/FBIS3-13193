The talks, which were initiated by the Islamic Republic of Iran, had significant outcomes for the solution of the Tajikistan crisis. To inform you of the views of the Tajikistan opposition, the following are remarks by Akbar Turjanzadeh, head of the Tajik opposition delegation to the talks, from an interview with our correspondent: [Begin Turjanzadeh recording, in Tajik] The outcome of our talks was good because the basic preconditions we had set before holding any talks with the regime in Dushanbe were met and we held a meeting with a high-ranking Russian envoy, Anatoliy Adamishin, in Tehran. Our basic preconditions for holding talks in Moscow were that the full security of the participants in the talks be ensured and that observers and mediators from Iran, Russia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan be present. Russia did not formally accept this precondition. But after two days of talks, Russia accepted this precondition. In the talks that will be held in Moscow and then in Tehran or other countries, we will discuss topics; the most important ones are the creation of an interim government council consisting of neutral personalities who did not participate in this fratricide, the complete disarmament of both sides, and the holding of free elections two years after the establishment of tranquility and stability in Tajikistan with the participation of various parties. [end recording] As far as efforts by the Islamic Republic of Iran in solving the Tajikistan crisis, Morteza Bank, director general of the East European Affairs Department of the Foreign Ministry, said: [Begin Bank recording] Various steps have been taken by the Islamic Republic of Iran within this period. The most important step was coordination and cooperation with the United Nations and representatives of the UN secretary general, with whom we held very good talks during their two visits to Tehran. Also, our diplomatic mission in Tajikistan was extremely active in this issue and was able to inform the UN representative of the situation inside Tajikistan. Another effort was our continuous contacts with important regional countries, namely Russia, including the visit by the Russian foreign minister to Tehran, the two visits by the special envoy of the Russian president to Tehran, and the visit by the Russian deputy foreign minister to Tehran. We held extremely good and detailed talks with these officials, who were briefed on the views of the Islamic Republic of Iran. We also had continuous contacts with the Tajik Government, met with Tajik officials--the president and the foreign minister--in various sessions, such as the Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO] session in Istanbul and the ECO session in Tehran, and discussed various viewpoints. And finally, a strong contact was established with the opposition--both the national faction and especially the Islamic faction. [end recording]
