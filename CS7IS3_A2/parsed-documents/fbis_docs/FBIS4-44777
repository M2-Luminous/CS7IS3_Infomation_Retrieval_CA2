Norbert Winands and Karl-Friedrich Koch, fellow scientists of Professor Koenig (chair and laboratory for machine tools and operational instruction and the Fraunhofer Institute for Production technology), introduced the new process of "heavy duty lathing in lieu of grinding." Whereas cooling lubricant has to be used when grinding, it is possible even to dry tool hardened steel components, for example, with tools of coated hard metal, ceramic cutting material and cubic boron nitride [CBN]. Cooling can be dispensed with in the case of such cutting materials because of their highly elevated temperature hardness and chemical stability. It would even produce unfavorable results since cooling could lead to temperature stresses that in turn entail micro-splinters and edge-notching. Since the absence of cooling can lead to thermal deformation, other designs have to be developed to eliminate heat in the case of precision tooling. Heavy duty lathing represents a sensible substitute to grinding. Not only is complexity decisive for the choice of the production process, so are the required dimensional tolerance and surface finish of the component. Drawing dies, pressure rams and inner-raceway roller bearings are not only exposed to high mechanical stresses, but they have to satisfy extreme quality standards. Consequently, the production stages of such components are costly and numerous. Heavy duty lathing appears an attractive alternative since it is possible to realize accuracies of International Standards Association [ISA] Tolerance [IT] six and surface finishes from return to zero [Rz] -- two to three micrometers using dry tooling. Such grinding values, however, still are not up to the highest precision standards. One significant advantage of dry tooling using geometrically defined cutting is doing without ecologically questionable cooling lubricant. Acquisition and disposal costs have soared, justifying an equivalent replacement even in terms of competitiveness. From a production engineering optic, the high flexibility of the process yields its most important aspect since non-form-bound tools are employed. When grinding, for the most part, each tooling operation uses a process adapted for it. That is why a number of chuckings are frequently required for the tooling. In the case of heavy-duty lathing even complex component shapes are produced with a single chucking. Such high process flexibility results in shorter throughput times and can be used in both small batch production and in mass production. Using heavy duty lathing it is currently possible to realize dimensional tolerances that previously were reserved for grinding. Cases from industry verify that substituting heavy duty lathing for grinding can yield not only ecological but also economical advantages. As much as a quintupling of basic quantity is feasible coupled with definitely shorter production times. This even holds true if the costs of disposing of cooling lubricants and wheel swarfs are left out of the equation. Fresh and further developments in the production resources sector, such as machine tools running on fully hydrostatic bearings and magnetic tension designs, in the future, will allow final cutting processing of hardened components having production tolerances that can currently be realized only with cost intensive precision grinding or honing operations. Hence heavy duty cutting opens up new prospects for currently proven production processes.
