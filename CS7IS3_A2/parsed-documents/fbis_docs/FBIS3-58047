Following a one and one-half hour discussion, he told the media he hoped for a partial cease-fire in Bosnia. Immediately afterward, Kinkel met Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the most important mediators in the Balkan conflict and the cochairmen of the Geneva conference on Yugoslavia. The intensity of the new efforts also became clear in parallel telephone talks between Kinkel and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who asked about the latest developments. The talks took place in the run-up to a meeting of the presidents of Bosnia and Croatia, for which Franjo Tudjman and Alija Izetbegovic are coming to Bonn on Saturday [8 January] at their own request. The Federal Government gladly made itself available as hosts, Kinkel said today. It offered its "good offices" and made available the guesthouse on Petersberg hill. The bilateral presidential conference, which will, according to Kinkel, take place without any specific German participation and may go on until Sunday, will also be attended by Lord Owen and Stoltenberg, the two mediators. The head of the Bosnian Government thanked the German Government for its intervention and addressed an urgent appeal to the international community to "stop the carnage in Bosnia." Kinkel also spoke of "oppressive human suffering," particularly in Sarajevo, but in other areas of Bosnia as well. A solution would have to be found "that secures viable areas for the weakest, and that means the Muslims." The Bosnian-Croatian presidential conference is taking place without Serbian participation. Diplomats pointed out that the most that could be achieved would be a limited armistice [begrenzter Waffenstillstand] or a cease-fire [Feuereinstellung], which would then be restricted to the war between Croats and Muslims in central Bosnia.
