They are hiding among refugees. It is understandable for one to take refuge, especially if one does not want to assist the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] combatants in fighting the war. However, it is not understable for one to take refuge and hide one's identity. How would one know there is no other objective? Why do the soldiers want to hide among civilians? We have spoken on several occasions about the mistreatment of people in our country. Enemies hide where civilians are taking refuge and then start killing them. There is that possibility. Let us hope that the government forces who are fleeing and hiding do not have such plans. They should not try to hide. They should wear their military uniforms while in hiding. There is war so they can flee but they should present themselves to the Ugandan authorities who will show them where to stay. They should not stay in the country disguised as civilians. It is better for them to identify themselves rather than to disguise themselves.
