He told a meeting of Liberal Democratic Party executives that LDP members should unite in the election, party officials said. But he said he intends to have a "fair fight" with the ruling coalition, which has yet to choose its candidate to succeed Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his intention to step down last Friday. Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the LDP, supported Kono, saying it is natural for a party leader to run for the premiership, the officials said. Kono rapped moves within the LDP to put forward former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe for the premiership, insisting that he as party president should be the candidate. Backers of Watanabe argued that the party president need not be the automatic candidate, and Taku Yamasaki, deputy general secretary of the party, voiced opposition to Kono's comments. Yamasaki belongs to an LDP faction headed by Watanabe.
