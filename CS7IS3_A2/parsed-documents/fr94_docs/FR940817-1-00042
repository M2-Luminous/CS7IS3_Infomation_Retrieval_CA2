FR940817-1-00042 FR940817-1-00013 Extension of Inspection Authorization Duration Under the proposed rule, the duration of an inspection authorization would be extended from the current 12 months to 24 months. Extending the duration of the inspection authorization would make the authorization consistent with FAA practices regarding the issuance of other renewable certificates, such as the flight instructor certificate, which is renewed every 24 months. A 24-month renewal cycle would relieve the public of a significant regulatory burden and FAA Flight Standards District Offices of a considerable administrative burden without compromising safety. Modifying the existing training and currency requirements to coincide with the adoption of a 24-month renewal cycle would give holders greater flexibility in meeting regulatory requirements. Expansion of Inspection Authorization Renewal Options The proposal would permit the holder of an inspection authorization to use a combination of annual inspections, inspections of major repairs or major alterations, and progressive inspections to satisfy the renewal requirements for the inspection authorization. Such a provision would give the holder of an inspection authorization much greater flexibility in meeting renewal requirements. To better facilitate the combination of these inspections for the purpose of certificate renewal with other inspection periods currently designated in months, the proposal would change the currently specified 90-day periods for inspections to 3-month periods. The proposed rule would also permit the holder of an inspection authorization to use participation in current inspection programs recommended by the manufacturer or other inspection programs established by the registered owner or operator under §91.409(f)(3) or (4) to satisfy renewal requirements. Although an inspection authorization is not required by an aviation maintenance technician in order to participate in these inspection programs, the FAA asserts that the experience gained through participation in such inspection programs is commensurate with the experience currently accepted to obtain the inspection authorization renewal. This proposal would benefit holders of an inspection authorization who are employed by operators that maintain aircraft under a current inspection program yet also maintain an insufficient number of aircraft under other annual inspection programs to provide the holder of the inspection authorization with sufficient renewal options under the current rule. The proposed rule would neither change the privileges of the inspection authorization nor compromise safety because the types of aircraft normally maintained under a current inspection program are often more complex than those maintained under an annual inspection program. Under the current regulation, the holder of an inspection authorization may renew the inspection authorization by attending and successfully completing a refresher course, acceptable to the Administrator, of not less than 8 hours during the 12-month period preceding the application for renewal. Because the proposal would modify the duration of the inspection authorization to 24 months, it would require that an inspection authorization refresher course or series of courses consisting of a total of not less than 16 hours be taken in the 24 months preceding the application for renewal. The proposed rule would not change the total amount of instruction an applicant is required to complete in the 24-month period preceding the application for renewal. Section-by-Section Analysis Part 65 Under the proposal, the title of Part 65 would be amended to reflect the removal of Subparts D (Mechanics) and E (Repairmen) from this part. The proposal would amend the title of Part 65 by revising the title of the part and would specifically list airmen whose certification would continue to be regulated by this part. The title would be changed from ``Certification: Airmen Other than Flight Crewmembers'' to ``Certification: Air-Traffic Control Tower Operators, Aircraft Dispatchers, and Parachute Riggers.'' Section 65.1 Section 65.1 currently states that Part 65 is applicable to air traffic control tower operators, aircraft dispatchers, mechanics, repairmen, and parachute riggers. Under the proposal, certification of mechanics and repairmen (aviation maintenance technicians and aviation repair specialists under the proposed rule would be regulated by Part 66. The proposal would revise §65.1 by limiting the applicability of this part to air traffic control tower operators, aircraft dispatchers, and parachute riggers. Section 65.3 Section 65.3 prescribes the certification requirements for foreign mechanics. Because the proposal would place the certification for all mechanics under Part 66, this section would be removed from Part 65 and reserved. An equivalent section, §66.3, is proposed for inclusion in Part 66. Section 65.11 Currently, §65.11(d)(2) prohibits a person whose repairman or mechanic certificate is revoked from applying for either of those kinds of certificates for 1 year after the date of revocation, unless the order of revocation provides otherwise. Because the proposal would place the certification of all mechanics and repairmen under Part 66, this paragraph would be removed from Part 65; an equivalent paragraph, §66.11(d), has been proposed for inclusion in Part 66. Part 65 Subpart D and Subpart E The proposal would completely remove Subpart D (Mechanics) and Subpart E (Repairmen) from Part 65 and would establish Subpart B (Aviation Maintenance Technicians) and Subpart C (Aviation Repair Specialists) under Part 66. The new subparts would be based upon the subparts originally found in Part 65.
