THE TEHRAN TIMES informed that Iran is willing to try reconciliations between Pakistan and India in order to establish peace in South Asia. The Foreign Ministry representative, in his weekly report, gave a brief glimpse of the Indian atrocities in Kashmir. The spokesman said that even Indian newspapers and news agencies have reported that the Indian troops during the last few days have increased their atrocities against the Kashmiri people. During the night of 4 and 5 December, the Indian troops killed 17 Kashmiris, and are now throwing even old Kashmiri leaders into jails. The Indian government just cannot justify its troops' bestial atrocities in Sopur. The fact is that India knows well that it cannot establish its rule even by allowing its hundreds of thousands of soldiers to commit atrocities against the people of Jammu and Kashmir. The Kashmiri people will get rid of the barbarous Indian occupation whenever they find an opportunity to do so, and they will succeed in their desire to join Pakistan. Therefore, in addition to trying to suppress their struggle through these abominable activities, it is also involved in their genocide in order to change the balance of the population so that it can establish its rule there. What is necessary in this situation is that Pakistan and other Islamic countries force India to stop its atrocities and give the Kashmiri people the right to autonomy according to UN resolutions. The Islamic world, however, is helpless, and Pakistan, without the support of the Islamic bloc, is not in a position to do anything. India is aware of this weakness of Pakistan, and it is not willing to sway from its position of considering Kashmir an "integral part." Because of its open acts of inhumanity, the whole world has become concerned, and India's mask of secularism and peaceful designs have been removed. India stages its fake desire to hold talks just to fool the world and spoil the philosophical and ideological unity between Pakistanis and the Kashmiri people. It also raises slogans of decreasing tension between the two countries. Recently, when the Hazratbal shrine was taken over and the Kashmiri people succeeded in focusing the eyes of the world on the Kashmir issue, we expected that Pakistan, by presenting a resolution in the United Nations, would unmask India. There was a good possibility of this resolution being passed; however, India, through the United States, gave Pakistan the false hope of holding talks and stopped it from presenting the resolution. It also agreed to set aside 1 January for holding talks. However, India neither stopped the siege around the Hazrat Bal shrine nor did it stop committing atrocities against the Kashmiri people in order to establish atmosphere for bilateral talks. It did not decrease its propaganda against Pakistan, either; instead, it increased its activities against the Kashmiri people. The bloody incidents of Sopur also occurred after India's announcement that talks would be held. According to news reports, the Indian soldiers have started to drink alcohol in the Hazrat Bal shrine. In such a situation, the people are not very hopeful, and the government will also lose hope for holding peace talks with India, keeping in mind India's record of backing out of its promises. The way India increased its atrocities in Kashmir after this announcement of talks was made, and Pakistan's decision to not introduce a resolution in the United Nations, causes us to expect an increase in tension between India and Pakistan after reconciliatory talks. That is what our experience tells us. According to some sources, India will also hold talks to discuss Wooler Barge and Siachen. It is true that Wooler Barge is situated in occupied Kashmir; however, both these issues are India's favorites, because a return of soldiers from Siachen would help reduce negative effects on India's economy. The construction of Wooler Barge is also beneficial to India. The talks that were held over Siachen at the secretary level have not produced anything. India has not followed up on its promises. We should make it clear that talks should be held over Kashmir first, and decisions should be made according to the UN resolution. Later, we can discuss Siachen and Wooler Barge. Therefore, the government, instead of being mislead, should be practical. It should not discourage the Kashmiri freedom fighters and the people by talking about peace discussions. A deputation of U. S. senators is coming to Pakistan under the leadership of Larry Pressler on 13 December. On the outside, they will be here to discuss the Pakistani nuclear program and the Pressler Amendment, however, the Kashmir issue will also be on their agenda. The change that occurred in the U.S. policy after Assistant Secretary of South Asia Robin Raphael's visit to this region recently calls for us to be on the alert. We hope it does not turn out that our "friend" pressures us again to make a decision in support of India. At present, in addition to India and the United States, our Foreign Ministry and the foreign minister are also "remembering" the Simla agreement. India's definition of the Simla agreement is not acceptable to Pakistan at all. Recently, by not introducing a resolution in the United Nations, we accepted the Indian definition. This means that the Kashmir issue cannot be raised in an international forum. We hope it does not happen that they make us sign some sort of Kashmir agreement at Camp David. By trusting our "friends," who have always been untrustworthy, we will lose again. Our friendly relations with Iran are above any suspicion. Iran's stand on the Kashmir issue is also very encouraging, but any talks about arbitration between the atrocious nation and the victim, and tyrants and the oppressed, are beyond our understanding. Therefore, our government, policy makers, and the bureaucrats in the Foreign Ministry should, instead of discussing any formulas for arbitration, increase their pressure for imposing economic restrictions against India and to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir. We should get the support of world opinion and awaken our Islamic brotherhood. We shall benefit from this, and that is our duty.
