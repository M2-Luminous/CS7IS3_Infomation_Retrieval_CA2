FR940504-2-00037 FR940504-2-00034 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION [DA 94&hyph;420] Meeting Held To Discuss Role of Cable in Proposed Changes to the Emergency Broadcast System April 28, 1994. The Federal Communications Commission is nearing completion of a rulemaking proceeding to modernize the present Emergency Broadcast System (EBS), Docket FO 91&hyph;171 and FO 91&hyph;301. One of the areas under consideration is the inclusion of cable television systems as an equal partner with broadcast stations in a new emergency alerting system. On Wednesday, April 27, 1994, members of the Commission staff met in Washington, DC with some of the cable television equipment manufacturers and cable operators that had filed comments in the docket on the integration of cable systems into an alerting system. The purpose of the meeting was to attempt to clarify and further document the estimated costs of emergency alerting equipment in cable systems. Such costs include the purchase of equipment, and the operation of such an alerting system over the multi-channel cable systems. While the discussions centered upon comments already filed with the Commission, it was hoped that this further discussion would enhance the Commission's understanding of the nuances and details for cable implementation of an alerting system. An audio recording of the meeting was made and has been placed in the record as a part of the official proceeding in the docket. The public and all interested parties are invited to review this recording which consists of approximately six hours of discussion by the approximately 25 participants. For further information contact the EBS staff at (202) 632&hyph;3906. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary.
