FR940617-1-00060 FR940617-1-00012 The general safety aspects of povidone-iodine that concerned the agency in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1234 to 1236) are addressed elsewhere as follows: (1) The effect of povidone-iodine on wound healing. Based upon submitted data, the agency concluded in the first aid antiseptic segment of this rulemaking that non-surfactant iodophor products (povidone-iodine) do not delay wound healing. See comment 42 of that document (56 FR 33644 at 33662). Also, the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Antimicrobial II Drug Products reviewed povidone-iodine's effect on wound healing in its report on topical antifungal drug products and concluded that the drug did not affect wound healing (47 FR 12480 at 12545). (2) The effect of povidone-iodine on thyroid function. In comment 41 of the tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644 at 33661), the agency discusses studies that indicate that topically applied povidone-iodine does not cause thyroid dysfunction. (3) The proposed warning about the interaction of starch-containing products with iodophors resulting in serosal adhesions and other undesirable effects, i.e., ``Caution: Do not use this product in the presence of starch-containing products. Starch can adsorb iodophors and the resulting complex can cause serosal adhesions (abnormal union of the serous membranes) and other undesirable effects in the body'' (43 FR 1210 at 1221). The agency has reevaluated the proposal and decided that the warning is not supported by the data. (See section I.I., comment 16.) (4) The agency's concern regarding molecular weights of povidone-iodine greater than 35,000 daltons not being excreted by the kidney and causing lymph node changes. In section I.I., comment 18, the agency discusses a previously proposed warning regarding this subject and determines, based on more recent data, that larger povidone-iodine molecules are not a risk when the product is limited to the topical uses included in this tentative final monograph. The agency's concern about the need for expiration dates (not to exceed 2 years after manufacture) because of the lack of stability data for several iodophor preparations, which relates to the effectiveness of the product, can be satisfied by compliance with the current good manufacturing practices regulations (21 CFR parts 210 and 211). These regulations include, among other things, requirements regarding stability testing and expiration dating (see §§211.137 and 211.166). Therefore, as discussed in comment 40 of the tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644 at 33661), data on the stability of povidone-iodine and the proposed 2-year expiration date are no longer considered needed in this rulemaking proceeding. A second agency concern relating to effectiveness was the rate of release of ``free'' iodine from the complex and whether there was evidence of germicidal activity over a period of time in clinical application (43 FR 1210 at 1235). As discussed in the tentative final monograph for OTC topical acne drug products (comment 5, 50 FR 2172 at 2173), iodine is released from the povidone-iodine complex within milliseconds, thus resolving this concern. With regard to the effectiveness of health-care antiseptic uses subject to this rulemaking, the agency has reviewed the data and information on povidone-iodine's germicidal in vitro and antiseptic in vivo effectiveness (Refs. 1 through 19) and concludes that the data are sufficient to reclassify this ingredient from Category III to Category I. A series of in vitro controlled studies (Ref. 1&hyph;C133, Volume 1) included a broad spectrum of test micro-organisms which were associated with between 40 to 60 percent of the nosocomial infections in the urinary tract, surgical wounds, pneumonia, and bloodstream, reported by the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (NNIS) for the period from January 1985 to August 1988 (Ref. 2). In most instances, these test micro-organisms, as proposed in §333.470(a)(1)(ii) (see section I.C., comment 6), were killed after 0.5 to 5 minutes exposure to povidone-iodine. A minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) study (Ref. 1&hyph;C133) using 30 cultures, both American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and recent skin isolates, was also included in this series of in vitro studies. The results indicated a range for MIC from 87 parts per million (ppm) to 492 ppm for dilutions of povidone-iodine solution and 83 ppm to 476 ppm for dilutions of povidone-iodine surgical scrub depending on the test micro-organism. Tests with controls, neutralizer, and organic load using a serial dilution method were included in the study. Gocke, Ponticas, and Pollack (Ref. 3) evaluated the susceptibility of 230 clinical isolates from blood, urine, sputum, and wound cultures to the bacteriocidal activity of povidone-iodine. These clinical isolates contained over half the organisms included in §333.470(a)(1)(ii). Results indicated that 106 of the 230 organisms tested (46 percent) were killed when 1 mL of a standardized suspension containing 108 organisms was exposed to a 10 percent povidone-iodine solution for 15 seconds. Povidone-iodine showed its highest activity against gram-negative isolates, with 72 of the 94 isolates (75 percent) being killed after a 15-second exposure. Only 34 of the 134 (25 percent) gram-positive isolates were killed under the same conditions. However, further testing of organisms not killed after a 15-second exposure indicated that increases in exposure time to 120 seconds killed all of the previously ``resistant'' isolates. The study design incorporated the use of a neutralizer and controls.
