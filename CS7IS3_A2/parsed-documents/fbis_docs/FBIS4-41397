"There are thousands of criminal trials carried out due to this fact. For example, the products of industrial enterprises in many regions is quite competitive with imported goods brought by commercial structures and criminal elements urge that these enterprises export their production outside the region. A director is forced to obey because he does not want to subject his own life and his family to danger." "Not to speak about those commercial enterprises which cannot make a single move without the knowledge of the mafia," Kostoyev added. "I know that in the Western world the mafia also exerts certain pressure, but it does not touch upon state enterprises. We have already left the West far behind in this sphere, he pointed out. Given the current situation it is necessary to use emergency measures to combat organized crime but it should be done in the frameworks of precise laws so that innocent people do not suffer," Kostoyev said.
