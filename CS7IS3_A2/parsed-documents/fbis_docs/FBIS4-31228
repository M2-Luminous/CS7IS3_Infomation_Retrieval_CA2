The PD(FSN) declaration continues by saying: With indignation we reject the diversion with respect to the so-called plot for the toppling by use of force of the current regime, President Ion Iliescu, and the installing of King Mihai before 17 June 1994. Mr. Ion Iliescu was among us during the revolution, in the struggle fought for its victory, and, regardless of our political stances, which may vary, his merits cannot be denied, as no one can deny the legality and legitimacy of his having been elected as head of our state. The declaration in conclusion requests that the Romanian Senate withdraw parliamentary status both from Corneliu Vadim Tudor and, quote, from all people who, by their deeds, promote views that are particularly dangerous for the country, the law-governed state, and the opus of national reconstruction, unquote. The declaration is signed by the PD(FSN) Steering Collegium.
