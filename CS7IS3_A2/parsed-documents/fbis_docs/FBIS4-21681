FBIS4-21681 "jptnd009___94068" JPRS-TND-94-009 JPRS PROLIFERATION ISSUES 3 April 1994 INTERNATIONAL UN Security Council Statement on DPRK Inspections UN Security Council Statement on DPRK Inspections DPRK Foreign Ministry Issues Comment SK0304234594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2115 GMT 3 Apr 94 SK0304234594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2115 GMT 3 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Statement by DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman issued in Pyongyang on 4 April -- read by announcer] [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the following statement regarding the UN Security Council's [UNSC] announcement of the president's statement making irrational demands [tangchi anun yogudul] on us: On 31 March, the UNSC announced the president's statement making irrational demands while urging us to allow additional unjust [pudanghan] inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. The nature of our nuclear issue is not one to be referred to the UNSC for discussions. We have already allowed enough inspections of our nuclear facilities to guarantee the continuity of safeguards, as we agreed with the United States and the IAEA. There is no room for any doubt here. Even if there had been some differences in opinion in the course of the inspection, that should be settled between the agency and the inspected country, the actual parties concerned with the inspection. Why on earth, despite these facts, did the UNSC finally discuss the referred issue on inspections of us and adopt the president's statement? The intrinsic nature of the problem is clear. The United States needed the UNSC, a stage for political discussions [chongchijok toui madang], and had to make the president's statement, a venue for pressure [amnyok konggan] to realize the hostile policy to crush [apsal] the DPRK. The UNSC, whose mission is to guarantee peace and security of the world, discussed our issue based the IAEA Board of Governors' unjust and biased conclusion [pudanghago pyonggyonjogin kyollon] noting that the scope of the noncompliance with the safeguards accord has been broadened [tambo hyopchong pulihaengui pomwiga hwaktae toeoddanun]. This clearly contracts the purpose and principle of the UN Charter. Today's reality is that the United States and some Western forces [ilbu sobang seryoktul], who see our socialist system as a thorn in their flesh, can have international organizations at their beck and call [che maumdaero chwauji halsu innun], if necessary, to plot to harm small countries, such as our country. No one can deny this. If the UNSC indeed wants to fulfill its mission, it should raise an issue [munjesi] with the United States, which is posing grave threats to peace and security on the Korean peninsula with an immense number of nuclear weapons while creating obstacles to the solution of the nuclear problem, and the South Korean authorities, the perpetrator [hasuin] of the United States. What cannot be overlooked, in addition, is that the UNSC has unjustly raised an outcry over us, who are conducting peaceful nuclear activities [pyonghwajok haek hwaltong], while ignoring those countries that are playing the dangerous nuclear game [wihoman haek changnanjil] under the U.S. protection. This shows that, applying a double standard, the UNSC is being used by the United States for realizing its hostile policy to crush the DPRK. The UNSC intentionally ignored the nature of our nuclear issue and raised an issue regarding the implementation of the safeguards accord in the president's statement encouraged by [pyongsung] the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK. The validity of the safeguards accord has virtually been suspended since we temporarily suspended the effectuation of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] for the DPRK-U.S. talks. Up to the present, we have allowed inspections only to guarantee the continuity of safeguards as a self-imposed and well-meant measure [chayulchogin sonuiui chochiroso] with the desire to prove the transparency of our nuclear activities. These inspections coincide with our special Position [uriga chohae innun tuksu chiwie puhaptoenun]. Since the United States and the IAEA could not deny this, they agreed to conduct the restricted inspection only to guarantee the continuity of safeguards, not regular or irregular inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi]. Accordingly, raising an issue on the implementation of the safeguards accord and additional inspections is senseless to us since we are in an authorized special position [kongindoen tuksu chiwi]. We do what we say we are going to do, and do not do what we say we are not going to do. We are invariably adhering to a firm independent policy and a correct line on external relations. We have never changed a position that we once declared. The UNSC should first take steps to fix the unjust action by the IAEA Secretariat, which has widened the area of unjust treatment of us [urie taehan pulgongjongsongui pomwirul hwaktaesikigo innun], currying favor with large countries, before demanding our additional inspections. The IAEA Secretariat ought to apologize for the fact that it has widened the area of unjust treatment, openly joining the U.S. anti- Republic maneuver. Far from apologizing, the IAEA Secretariat has gradually expanded its unjust treatment of us. We will repay [kyesan] this without fail. The United States is more openly stirring up the maneuver of international pressure against the Republic [kukchejogin pangonghwaguk amnyok sodongul touk nogolhwa hago itta], using the IAEA Board of Governors and the UNSC. Furthermore, the United States is carrying into extremes its military pressure, saying that it will resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise and that it is ready to trigger the second Korean war [cheiui choson chonjaengdo pulsahagetta]. All facts clearly prove that the United States has no intention to resolve the nuclear issue at all and that its main aim is to realize its hostile policy of crushing Korea [taechoson choktaesi apsal chongchaek] by deliberately aggravating the situation of the Korean peninsula. Complying with this as well, by continuing to introduce nuclear weapons and stepping up their nuclear development, the South Korean authorities are attempting to persistently stage a nuclear war exercise against us in conspiracy with a nuclear possession country. This shows that the South Korean authorities are, in fact, not interested in the joint declaration of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula but are rushing toward the criminal road of nullifying it. Under the present situation in which the United States is clinging to pressure alone [migugi amyok ilbyondoro naonun hyon sanghwangeso] after overturning all promises made to us we have no choice but to conduct on a normal basis our peaceful nuclear activities [chongsanghwa hajiannulsu opke toeyotta] which we had unilaterally frozen for the DPRK-U.S. talks. The United States and the South Korean authorities are attempting to escalate their commotion of pressure on us with the presidential statement of the UN Security Council as an occasion. However, this cannot fool us. The more the United States and its follower forces scheme to crush the socialist system of our own style, the firmer the singleheartedly united might of our party, the people, and the People's Army will be. Responding to force with force and to dialogue with dialogue is our firm and invariable will and policy. The U.S. hostile policy of crushing Korea will not escape ruin. Our position to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully is consistent [sijong ilgwan hada]. [Dated] 4 April 1994, Pyongyang.
