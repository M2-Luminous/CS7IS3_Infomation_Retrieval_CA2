This time, however, we held this conference prior to the New Year, two months earlier than previous years. Yesterday morning, in an effort to seek early results, leaders of the municipal agricultural departments and various districts, counties and bureaus (general companies) and cadres of some townships, towns, sections and second-grade companies, a total of over 1,000 people, attended the 1994 rural work conference to plan, mobilize, and implement earlier than in previous years. Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, and Mayor Li Qiyan attended and addressed the conference. Vice Mayor Duan Qiang delivered a work report, entitled: "Emancipate the Mind, Seek Truth From Facts, Deepen Reform, Expand the Degree of Opening Up, and Make Economic Construction of Suburban Areas Enter a New Stage." [passage omitted] In his report, Duan Qiang put forward the guiding ideologies of the 1994 economic work of suburban areas on behalf of the municipal party committee and the municipal government: Firmly grasp the "nose of the ox," which is to emancipate the mind and seek truth from facts, strive to explore new ways and new moves in line with the target of establishing the socialist market economic new system, and use them to promote change and solve difficulties, deepen reform, expand the pace of opening up, accelerate economic development and the pace of becoming well-off in an effort to stimulate the suburban economy to enter a new stage. The general fighting objectives of economic and social development in suburban areas in 1994 are: Total industrial and agricultural output value should reach 100 billion yuan, total social output value should reach 125 billion yuan, an increase of 46 percent and 42 percent respectively over the previous year. There should be four counties each with a total industrial and agricultural output value exceeding 10 billion yuan, one district with a total social output value of 10 billion yuan in the urban and rural areas and 10 townships each with a revenue of over 1 billion yuan. The average per-capita income of peasants should reach 2,000 yuan, up 350 yuan over 1993. The average per-capita income of workers of 60 outlying townships and towns in the mountainous areas should reach 1,200 yuan, up 150 yuan over 1993. In addition, new achievements should be made in village and town construction, afforestation, and other aspects. To realize the aforementioned objectives, we should actively advance the work in 10 aspects in 1994 and make new strides forward. Of these, the major ones are: To establish the ideology that we must rely on high efficiency to realize high returns in agriculture, follow the path of promoting large-scale production and greatly raise labor productivity and make new strides in developing "high yield, high quality, and highly efficient farming"; make new strides in developing industrial areas and building small cities and towns because they are the places where the hopes and momentum of suburban areas lie; make new strides in "carrying out large-scale projects, developing an export-oriented economy, making new plans, implementing new mechanisms, and using new technological equipment" because township enterprises are now entering a new development stage; establish the ideology that we must rely on using the export- oriented economy, science and technology to bring along economic development, and make new strides in linking with the international track and rely on scientific and technological progress; and establish the ideology of adopting policies of opening the mountainous areas to the outside world and make new strides in the "project of making the mountainous areas prosperous." In his speech, Duan Qiang said: We should uphold the principle of taking a two-handed approach and be tough with both to strengthen party building, ideological and political work, and the building of spiritual civilization. It is necessary to regard the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping as strong motivation and continue to actively promote the emancipation of minds. We should strengthen the building of the ideology and work style of leading bodies at and above the township and section levels, strengthen the building of grass-roots party organizations and strive to build them into strong fight bastions for leading the masses into entering the market, become well-off and enter a new stage. We should persist in fighting corruption and promoting honesty and strengthen the building of a clean government and diligent administration, a socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system.
