FBIS4-30854 "dreeu105_p_94009" FBIS-EEU-94-105 Daily Report 31 May 1994 POLAND Poll Results on Party Popularity Evaluated Poll Results on Party Popularity Evaluated WS3105120094 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 31 May 94 pp 1-2 WS3105120094 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA Polish BFN [Report by Renata Wrobel: "Public Opinion Research Institute for RZECZPOSPOLITA; The Left Goes Up, Peasants Go Down"] [Text] The most surprising result of the latest opinion poll on Sejm election preferences is the low position of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], which received merely 12 percent of the "votes." This is half as much as the score of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] (a considerable improvement of its position in comparison with April), and only a little higher than the result of the Freedom Union [UW]. The rating of the latter is much lower than might be expected if we simply added former supporters of the Democratic Union [UD] to the supporters of the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD]. The center right is hardly making up for the losses that it incurred in last year's elections. The poll was carried out at the request of RZECZPOSPOLITA by the Public Opinion Research Institute [PBS] in Sopot in mid-May. Disillusioned Peasants After gaining favorable (24-25 percent) ratings at the end of last year, the support for SLD has been at the level of 20 percent since January; in May, however, it "went up" quite noticeably. The increase in the electoral popularity of the left coincided with a decrease in the number of supporters of the other government coalition member -- PSL. The decrease in its popularity had been continuing for several months then; however, since January it has plummeted by as many as 5 percentage points. The opinion has become quite popular that PSL is in a luxurious situation in comparison with other Polish political parties, because it has an exceptionally stable and faithful electorate, which consists first of all of peasants and inhabitants of rural areas. As this opinion poll suggests, however, this may turn out to be only an illusion. The disillusionment of the peasants toward PSL is quite clear; the popularity of PSL in this group is obviously decreasing. Figures speak for themselves. As recently as December and January, 59 percent of peasants would have voted for PSL; in March -- 52 percent; in April -- 46 percent; and in May -- only 38 percent. Every fifth peasant would now prefer to back SLD, every eighth -- Polish Peasant Party--Peasant Accord [PSL--PL]. Among the persons who supported PSL in the September elections, nearly 60 percent of the respondents would make the same decision today; however, almost one in five would now back SLD. PSL also ceased to be the most popular party among the inhabitants of rural areas: it can count on the support of 21 percent of the representatives of this group, whereas SLD can count on 24 percent. In the electoral "local" polls, the rating of PSL is still quite good. This may mean that many voters separate the party's policy on the state level from the moves made by popular local activists. Two Plus Two Does Not Necessarily Make Four Those who thought that the merger of UD and KLD would immediately ensure the new party at least a 20-percent support, as it was suggested by the last ratings of UD and KLD, can speak about disappointment. The result achieved by UW is much poorer. Some voters most certainly did not accept the merger; others are waiting for programmatic and tactical corrections; still others are simply not very familiar with the name. For the time being the hopes of the leaders of the new party are not coming true: The leaders are hoping that their party will attract persons from outside UD and KLD, even though it must be admitted that the number of former voters of the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR] who now declare support for UW has slightly increased. In accordance with earlier guesses, the UW is a particularly popular party among the youngest respondents, well-educated persons, persons with good incomes, persons in high posts, school and university students, as well as inhabitants of big towns and cities. Most of the September supporters of UD (63 percent) and KLD (67 percent) are ready to vote for the new party. An interesting thing is that persons working "on their own" do not really burn to support UW, which is contrary to the image built up by the KLD circles. They more readily declare support for the Labor Union [UP] or SLD, and equally readily for BBWR and the Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN] (private entrepreneurs are a group characterized by probably the most diversified party preferences). Dissatisfied Head for SLD Talking about electorates. It is worth noticing a certain process that can be observed among the voters of SLD. The grouping is losing supporters with higher education (at the end of last year it would have received the support of 35 percent of the representatives of this group; now -- only 24 percent) and persons in high posts (34 percent and 20 percent respectively). The party is becoming increasingly popular among voters with elementary education, manual workers, especially unskilled workers, persons with the lowest incomes, as well as senior citizens and disability pensioners -- that is, part of the classical "dissatisfied electorate." The Center of the Table More Stable The popularity fluctuations are far smaller outside the first three positions. For the last several months UP has regularly achieved the level of 8 to 10 percent of the "votes"; BBWR and KPN -- from 4 to 5 percent each; and the Union for Real Politics is slowly joining this group. The exception is "Solidarity" ["S"] the rating of which noticeably increased in May. Incidentally, its rating has improved four times since the period immediately following the parliamentary elections. Only the next poll will show whether this increase, probably caused by the latest "offensive" of the union, will be lasting. "S" is now particularly attractive for voters with vocational education, with an income ranging between one million and one and a half million zlotys a month per capita, and for unskilled workers. The greatest losers in the September elections -- the parties of the center right -- are regaining their influence rather slowly. The five groupings that were taken into account in our poll (the Center Accord, Christian-National Union -- ZChN, PL, UPR, and Movement for the Republic) jointly receive 14 percent of the "votes," whereas right after the elections, in November last year, the result was 12 percent. However, the relation between such simple addition and the actual influence of a party that is formed as a result of a possible merger is shown by the example of UW. Materials used in the report include opinion polls conducted every month by PBS for RZECZPOSPOLITA; the last one was carried out on 14 and 15 May (a 1,010-person representative sample of adult inhabitants of the country).
