Levi, V.Ya. Bessonova, M.M. Livshits, Moscow Disinfection Station; UDC 579.8.083.13] [Abstract] The complexity and shortcomings of existing physical, chemical, and bacterial test methods of sterilization control prompted the development of color nutrient media which would make it possible to take into account the outcome of bacteriological control by a change in the color of the medium itself. This would also make it possible to relax the bacteriological skill requirements in evaluating the control procedure outcome and thus expand bacterial control applications. The following three formulations are developed as a result of an exhaustive preliminary experiment: a prepared Hiss medium with a bromocrezol purple (BKP) indicator, a color nutrient medium with a bromocrezol purple indicator, and a color medium with a bromothymol blue (BTS) indicator. The sensitivity of each medium was assessed by its ability to change color after inoculation by small microorganism doses. A comparison of the color nutrient media sensitivity to Bacillus stearothermophilus and B. licheniformis, a comparison of the B. licheniformis spore growth at 37 and 55�C temperatures, the effect of temperature on the B. licheniformis ability to grow in the bromothymol blue medium, and the Hiss medium sensitivity with an addition of glucose to the growth of B. stearothermophilus spores are summarized. The effort made it possible to develop workable color nutrient media for analyzing the outcome of bacteriological control of sterilization and recommend the Hiss medium as the most efficient; if spores of the B. stearothermophilus bacteria grow, the medium changes color from the original lilac to yellow. The use of color media makes it possible to assess the results by the medium color after an inoculum exposure to 55�C in a thermostat, since the growth of foreign microflora at this temperature is almost impossible. Color nutrient media have successfully passed tests in numerous practical institutions with invariably good marks. Tables 4.
