Speaking to the press following a luncheon of life senators, offered by Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio, the Fiat chairman explained how the government economic program aimed at stimulating economic growth while, at the same time, limiting risks. The positive aspects of the program, outlined by Berlusconi to the Senate yesterday, included, Agnelli said: the commitment to curb public spending; boosting the economy through investments and greater flexibility on labor costs. Turning his attention to tomorrow's confidence vote in the Senate, Agnelli said "I hope the government makes it" in reply to those who asked how he would vote. Asked to comment on the positions of the other life Senators, the Fiat chairman said "I believe that each senator maintains his own opinion. On the other hand, life senators are individuals and each decides for himself". The other life senators attending the luncheon were ex-president Francesco Cossiga, former Senate Speaker Giovanni Spadolini, Giulio Andreotti, Francesco De Martino and Paolo Emilio Taviani.
