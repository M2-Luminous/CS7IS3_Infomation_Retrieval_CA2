FR940418-2-00120 FR940418-2-00072 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33893; File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;13] Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Options Clearing Corporation; Notice of Amendment to Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Proposed Rule Change Amending the Valuation Rate Applied to Securities Deposited as Clearing Margin April 14, 1994. On May 4, 1992, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 relating to the valuation of securities deposited as clearing margin (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;13). On June 8, 1992, OCC filed a technical amendment with the Commission. 2 Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on September 17, 1992, to solicit comment from interested persons. 3 Two comments letters supporting the proposal were received by the Commission. 4 On March 9, 1994, OCC again filed an amendment with the Commission. 5 The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments on the amendment to the filing and to approve the amended proposal on an accelerated basis. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b) (1988). 2 For a description of the June 8, 1992, amendment, refer to note 9. 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31169 (September 10, 1992), 57 FR 43041. 4 Letters from Robert D. Noble, Principal, Morgan Stanley & Co., Incorporated, to Gerry [sic] Carpenter, Division of Market Regulation (December 15, 1993); and Anthony Miserandino, Chairman, Options Operations Committee, National Options and Futures Society, to Gerry [sic] Carpenter, Division of Market Regulation (December 23, 1993). 5 for a discussion of the March 9, 1994, amendment, refer to note 11. I. Description of the Proposal A. The Proposal The proposed rule change amends the rate used to value equity and corporate debt issues deposited for clearing margin purposes pursuant to OCC Rule 604(d)(1). 6 Currently, OCC Rule 604(d)(1) provides that deposited stock and convertible bonds shall be valued on a daily basis at the maximum loan value permitted under the provisions of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``FRB'') 7 or at such lower value as the OCC Membership/Margin Committee may prescribe, and that non-convertible debt shall be valued on a daily basis at 70% of current market value or at such lower value as the Membership/Margin Committee may prescribe. 8 Interpretations and Policies (``I&P'') .09 to OCC Rule 604 currently provides that for clearing margin purposes equity and debt issues shall not be valued in excess of 50% of current market value. 9 The proposal permits OCC to value deposits of stocks and bonds 10 at 60% of current market value or at such lower rate as determined by OCC's Membership/Margin Committee. 11 6 OCC Rule 604(d)(1) sets forth the requirements for the use of preferred and common stock and corporate debt issues as forms of margin. In addition to these valued securities, Rule 604 permits OCC to accept U.S. Government securities and letters of credit in lieu of cash margin. 7 12 CFR 221 (1993). Section 221.8. (a) of Regulation U [12 CFR 221.8. (a) (1993)] provides that the maximum loan value of margin stocks, other than options, is fifty per cent of their current market value. 8 The OCC Membership/Margin Committee is a committee of six members of the OCC Board of Directors that reviews membership applications and makes margin policy. Telephone conversation between Jean M. Cawley, Staff Counsel, OCC, and Thomas C. Etter, Jr., Attorney, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission (May 7, 1992). 9 In its June 8, 1992, amendment, OCC notes that an I&P .09 to Rule 604 was approved by the Commission in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29576 (August 16, 1991), 56 FR 41873 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;88&hyph;03] (order approving proposed rule change involving valued securities program), but because of an oversight, it was never included in OCC's rule book. As a result, a later I&P to Rule 604, which was approved by the Commission in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29920 (November 15, 1991), 56 FR 58105 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;91&hyph;04] (order approving proposed rule change relating to cross-rate foreign currency options), was entered into OCC's rule book as I&P .09. Thus, there are currently two I&Ps to Rule 604 which were filed and approved as .09. The June 8, 1992, amendment corrects this misnumbering. 10 The filing also amends OCC Rule 604(d) so that both convertible and non-convertible corporate bonds are treated consistently for margin purposes and are referred to simply as corporate bonds. 11 The March 9, 1994, amendment modified the loan value rate from 70% to 60% of the current market value. Letter from Jean M. Cawley, Associate Counsel, OCC to Jerry W. Carpenter, Chief, Branch of Clearing Agency Regulation, Division of Market Regulation (March 8, 1994). The initial proposal had called for increasing the loan value to 70%.
