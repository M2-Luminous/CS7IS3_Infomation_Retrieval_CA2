This agreement, which was welcomed by popular and political Palestinian circles, ends the conflict between these two groups which had been going on for the past few months, and opens a new chapter of fraternal ties between them. Prior to the signing of the agreement halting hostilities between Hamas and the Fatah Hawks, the Zionist regime officials expressed concern about this and threatened the PLO, which is engaged in talks with that regime. They described the agreement as a sort of division of labor between Hamas and Fatah. The Zionist regime's environment minister, who is playing an active role in the PLO-Tel Aviv talks, stated: If the PLO believes that it is carrying out a division of labor by this action and is giving Hamas permission to carry out anti-Israeli operations while engaging in talks itself, it is mistaken. He added: If the PLO signs an agreement with Hamas, it cannot sign any agreement with Israel. In order to sow further discord in the Fatah and PLO ranks--headed by combatants of the Islamic Movement and 'Arafat, respectively--the Zionist regime threatened the PLO that in the event of continued anti-Zionist operations by Hamas, talks will be suspended. Despite the Zionist regime's efforts to the contrary, the agreement between the Hamas and Fatah Movements opened a new chapter of bilateral relations. This agreement was signed when Hamas was able to organize four important anti-Zionist operations--in a short period of time--in revenge for the blood of the martyred fasting worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi shrine in al-Khalil [Hebron]. As a result of these operations, 14 Zionists were killed and 77 were wounded. Following the shattering debacle of the al-Khalil carnage, Hamas had pledged that it would carry out five operations in revenge against the Zionists. So far, it has carried out four operations and a fifth one is expected. What imparts greater significance to the cessation of hostilities between Hamas and Fatah is the approach of the time when the security of the Gaza-Jericho autonomous regions is to be delegated to Palestinian police. Israel is very optimistic that the Zionist-Palestinian confrontation will be transformed into a Palestinian-Palestinian war. However, the Palestinian Islamic Movement's sensitivity to this issue and its principled attention to confrontation with the Zionist regime has resulted in the closing of this path before such a calamity takes place. The PLO leaders hope that this agreement will result in halting Hamas operations in the autonomous Gaza-Jericho regions following the withdrawal, or in more precise terms, a rearrangement of the array of occupationist forces takes place, so that the struggle is transferred to other parts of the usurped territories. It does not seem likely that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Movement believe in any boundaries as regards their anti-Zionist operations throughout the occupied territories. This has left some ambiguities in the accord but the PLO is well aware that without an agreement with Hamas it cannot administer these affairs. In any case, the negative reaction of the Zionist regime is in itself enough indication of the importance of such an agreement for the Palestinians.
