FR940620-0-00028 FR940620-0-00009 Comments Before adopting this interim regulation as a final rule, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted to Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), ยง1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and ยง103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulations Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings, U.S. Customs Service, Franklin Court, 1099 14th Street NW., suite 4000, Washington, DC. Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date Requirements Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a), public notice is inapplicable to this interim regulation because it is within the foreign affairs function of the United States. A failure to have this regulation in place at the earliest practicable date would provoke undesirable international consequences. In addition, because this regulation sets forth procedures which the public needs to know in order to claim the benefit of a tariff preference under the NAFTA, it is determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that notice and public procedures are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. Furthermore, for the above reasons, it is determined that good cause exists under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1) and (d)(3) for dispensing with a delayed effective date. Executive Order 12866 Because this document involves a foreign affairs function of the United States and implements an international agreement, it is not subject to the provisions of E.O. 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for interim regulations, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do not apply. Drafting Information The principal author of this document was Francis W. Foote, Office of Regulations and Rulings, U.S. Customs Service.
