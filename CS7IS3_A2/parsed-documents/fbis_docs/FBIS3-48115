Bentsen "seemed to be placing heavy weight on the framework talks," said Takatoshi Kato, director of the ministry's international finance bureau, briefing reporters after a one-hour meeting between Fujii and Bentsen. But, Kato stressed that "no specific requests" were made by Bentsen, including any reference to "numerical targets," and the two sides just "confirmed commitments for further progress" to make the February 11 Japan-U.S. summit in Washington "successful." Fujii, speaking to reporters as he left the meeting, said he and Bentsen agreed to try to conclude bilateral talks in time. On Japan's economy, Fujii said he told Bentsen that Japan is trying to take steps to boost the economy, despite the turmoil in the wake of the upper house's rejection Friday of the government-proposed political reform bills. "Please trust us," he said to Bentsen. The two leaders did not discuss specifics of planned Japanese economic-stimulus measures, such as a much-discussed income tax cut, Fujii noted of the meeting, also attended by Ambassador Walter Mondale and Lawrence Summers, Treasury undersecretary for international affairs. Bentsen and Summers declined comment as they left. Bentsen said he will comment at a news conference after he meets Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at 4 P.M. Fujii vowed "serious and vigorous efforts" to launch a new stimulus package including tax cuts, and explained that a joint economic forum of the government and coalition parties will continue discussing tax issues to come up with an "acceptable decision," Kato said. Bentsen expressed "hopes on contributions to spur domestic demand," Kato said. On the upper house's failure to pass the political reform bills, Fujii sought support for Japan placing priority on the measures by explaining the latest surveys showed public support for reform and that Japan intends to focus on reviving the bills for passage over the next week before the current Diet session closes on Saturday, Kato said. Referring to reported possible postponement of the Hosokawa-Clinton talks, Kato stressed that the financial leaders based their talks on the February 11 summit as scheduled. Fujii and Bentsen also reconfirmed their cooperation for a "successful" meeting of finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum slated for March 18 and 19 in Hawaii, Kato said, noting they did not discuss specifics. The two leaders also agreed on further support toward Russia and its reform, he said. No new support measures were discussed, but Bentsen voiced concern over the recent cabinet reshuffle there, Kato said. Bentsen stopped over in Tokyo on his way back home from Russian and Asian tours and had requested the meetings with Fujii and Hosokawa. The meetings came during a crucial time for the Japanese Government which failed to pass the political reform bills through the upper house and attention is fixed on what Japan will offer to the U.S.
