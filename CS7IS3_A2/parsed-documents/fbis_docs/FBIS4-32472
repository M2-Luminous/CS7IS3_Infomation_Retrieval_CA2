Peter Nahimi has been nominated to the only parliament clerk position the MDF can fill. Peter Boross, departing prime minister, has been nominated to the position of chairman of the parliament's National Security Committee. The MDF also obtained a chairman position in the Budget Committee: Bela Kadar, former minister of International Economic Relations, will chair this committee. According to the six-party agreement, the MDF is entitled to four deputy committee chairman positions. Thus, the position of deputy chairman of the Constitutional Committee will be filled by Katalin Kutrucz, a former member of the committee; Gyorgy Csoti will become deputy chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee; the position of deputy chairman of the Cultural Committee will be filled by the previous chairman Attila Zsigmond, and departing minister of Transportation Gyorgy Schamschula will be the deputy chairman of the Auditing Committee. At the founding session of the new parliamentary group of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] held on 22 June, Lszlo Kover was given the task to head the Fidesz group until September 1994. The deputies accepted the proposal of the party leadership to refrain from selecting a new parliamentary group head for the time being, because the upcoming Fidesz congress scheduled for 9 July 1994 will also be able to express its opinion regarding this issue. After several preliminary consultations, the Fidesz parliamentary group decided to divide the committee positions given to the Fidesz. Thus, the Fidesz parliamentary group will nominate Janos Ader and Jozsef Szajer to the Constitutional Committee, Laszlo Urban and Csaba Sumeghy to the Budget Committee, Zoltan Rockenbauer and Zsolt Nemeth to the Foreign Affairs Committee, Lajos Kosa and Laszlo Madi to the Economic Committee, and Tamas Deutsch and Gabriella Selmeczi to the Local Government Committee. Lajos Kosa and Laszlo Urban will be members of the Agricultural Committee, Szilard Sasvari will be a member of the Cultural Committee, and Gabriella Selmeczi will go to the Welfare Committee. Laszlo Madi will go to the Employment Committee, Tamas Tirts to the Human Rights Committee, Tamas Deutsch to the Environmental Protection Committee, Janos Ader to the Auditing Committee, Jozsef Szajer to the Immunity and Mandate Control Committee, and Laszlo Kover to the National Security Committee. Viktor Orban will be nominated as chairman of the European Affairs Committee, and Zoltan Pokorni will be nominated to the deputy chairman of the Educational Committee position. Tamas Wachsler will be chairman of the Defense Committee, and Bela Gyuricza will be member of the same committee. Szilard Sasvari and Zoltan Trombitas will be clerks of the committee. Laszlo Kover told us that Karoly Eperjes did not make it in any committee because he is sticking to his earlier statement that he will hand in his parliamentary deputy mandate very shortly, at the best possible time for the parliamentary group. (He will probably be replaced by Mihaly Varga, whom the Fidesz group wants to use as a budget expert). Szekesfehervar Mayor Istvan Balsay cannot exercise his rights as parliamentary deputy because of the incompatibility rules, so he cannot be committee member either. At the same time, he will accept his mandate and will participate in the foundation session of the new parliament. If the situation changes and Balsay accepts the parliamentary deputy position, he will probably get into the Local Government Committee. Both the parliamentary group deputy heads and the new heads will be elected at the end of this summer. Laszlo Kover and Jozsef Szajer will be nominated to the respective positions. However, Jozsef Szajer has not yet decided whether he will accept the nomination or not.
