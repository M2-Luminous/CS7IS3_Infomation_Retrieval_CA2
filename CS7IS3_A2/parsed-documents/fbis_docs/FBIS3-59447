Unfortunately, there are very few things of which Romania can boast. Things such as the most-favored-nation status or the country's admittance to the Council of Europe remain mere empty phrases for the man in the street as long as he does not feel, in some way or other, that he does not have to put up with cold and hunger any more. Apart from that, there is nothing but a persistent post-socialist sadness, despite the oscillations of the political pendulum. No incompetence, no partial reforms, no unraveled economic structures have been admitted by anyone, and this has exhausted our economy and required enormous sacrifice on behalf of the Romanians, who are trying in every way to make sense of the years that followed the collapse of the Ceausescu regime. Dear readers, I have to tell you that we [journalists] try very hard to present the good things and the positive results as well. Unfortunately, disastrous results are far more numerous in our country. Their list is topped by inflation, which has increased by over 300 percent. The Vacaroiu cabinet has survived solely because it could count on the support of the nationalist-communist parties. Just one of them, the PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party], was rewarded with a number of offices of prefects, state secretaries, ministry directors, or FPS [State Property Fund] directors. Now that the political auction has begun at Cotroceni [interparty talks initiated by President Iliescu to strike a political pact], these parties are demanding portfolios. As it is known, the PUNR wants those ministries that deal with reform. [Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania Chairman Victor] Surdu also wants about five portfolios for his party. The PUNR kept threatening the government that it would withdraw its support, but eventually it did nothing of the kind. It is true, our country is not run by a single party any more, but the rulers still do as they wish, because they are holding all the control mechanisms of a totalitarian regime in their hands. In that sense they are behaving like the members of a single party, because that is what the government coalition, which has monopolized all sectors, actually is. And single parties never acknowledge the mistakes that they make; on the contrary, they try to hide the truth and increase the confusion. No matter what consequences their mistakes have, they never admit them. The sole thing that they failed to control is the press. But they found a solution to that problem as well: They ignore it and they publish as many government dailies as they can, which are then extensively quoted on radio and television. The president is still dreaming of a reformed government of national unity. But all he is doing is acting as a stand-in for the executive. However, the supreme state institution has strayed away from reality. Mr. Iliescu's current "consultations" are mere propaganda meetings intended to make the parties put their swords down and to make the people think he is holding the opposition on the leash. Considering the way in which the consultations started, I am quite sure that the whole thing will eventually turn into a manifestation of devotion for the president. By mid-January Mr. Iliescu will certainly summon the trade unions as well to come to Cotroceni for "consultations" to conclude a "social pact." The idea of such a pact must have come to him at the end of this dark year, after he had invented the concept of a "political pact." Having clearly announced that talks would begin with the parties represented in parliament to examine the possibility of setting up a coalition government, Iliescu began to sing another tune, the planned negotiations turned into "consultations" intended to conclude a "political pact," and what is even more, he launched the idea of a "minimal platform to be signed by every party, regardless of its orientation." The political pact is just an alibi for Mr. Iliescu, so that he can rule authoritatively afterward. He wants to line up all the parties and then manipulate them as he wishes, without renouncing his political monopoly. Cotroceni Palace admits that "the current situation has to be surmounted," but it does not want a different government any more, but rather merely a "political pact." The moment the trade unions and the civic forces slacken their pressure, they immediately feel free to invent formulas that even children would refuse to accept. The message of the unions is clear: no more talks with this government. Mr. Iliescu pretends not to understand and advances his bombastic "political pact." And what kind of political pact? What did Cotroceni Palace concretely propose? Everyone knows what the unions and the opposition want. In the opinion of the rulers a political pact means that the opposition should freeze, hold its hands up, and say "yes" to everything that is concocted and issued as government decrees by Mr. Vacaroiu's apparatchiks. The amendments formulated in categorical terms by the IMF are not exactly the best reason for Romania's population to jump for joy. They are long-term measures aimed at implementing the reforms, the establishment of a market economy and a fully democratic society. The parliamentary majority, including the PDSR's [Social Democracy Party of Romania] allies, which have continuously attacked the IMF, do not want public debates and a referendum on that issue, to see who favors and who is against that package of laws, that -- although quite unpopular -- would still mean the beginning of reform. That is why they came up with the idea of having it passed in a concealed way, in the form of government decrees [issued during the parliamentary recess], that is, actually bypassing parliament. Or, the intention of IMF was exactly the opposite: Have the memorandum passed though the Caudine Forks of parliament. The reason invoked by the government coalition: The parliamentary recess is too long to do that. And everyone knows that parliament has not yet sanctioned the decrees issued by the previous government and, besides, by the time the ordinances reach parliament, not much can be altered anyway. Another reason for their preference for the bill empowering the government to adopt the reform measures requested by the IMF is to protect the PDSR against the attacks of the nationalist extremists in parliament, as the latter would have been put in a delicate position: Should they vote in favor of the very things that they have been cursing all along? So they prefer to have the measures that mean the beginning of reform adopted without anyone noticing and have the decrees cover up for the disaster caused by the mismanagement of the country. The opposition, which is fighting for reform, cannot reject the bills requested by the IMF either, but it combines them with other reform measures that cannot be adopted unless debated in parliament. The opposition wants details about the compensation to be offered to companies operating in the red. Otherwise, what is the use of having a parliament? And why should reform be promoted covertly? This time the parliamentary majority made use of its strength and voted, while alone in the hall, to empower the government to rule by decree. Despite the fact that the necessary quorum was lacking, that the altering of fiscal bills can only be decided by parliament, and that [Chamber of Deputies Speaker and ruling party executive chairman] Adrian Nastase is talking all the time about the observance of the Constitution, he is the first one to take the liberty of ignoring it by submitting a bill to the vote when the quorum is lacking. By validating the results of the ballot held under these circumstances, he actually introduced a dictatorship in disguise. He created a dangerous precedent by using pressure and violating both the Constitution and the rules on the functioning of parliament. [Chamber of Deputies Deputy Speaker Dan] Martian and Nastase proved that they are prepared to do anything and they would call for a ballot even if just the two of them were present to vote. The extremists are making open threats. [Greater Romania Party Chairman Corneliu] Vadim [Tudor] is warning Iliescu that he will "pay with his head" if the government coalition is joined by CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania], because that would mean that the extreme nationalist forces would be left outside the coalition. It serves Iliescu right, let them accuse him of treason! Let him have Vadim in opposition! He would make such a fierce opposition -- C.V. Tudor cautions -- that the president's political career would last no longer than just a few weeks. Despite this, relations are cordial between the PRM [Greater Romania Party] and the PDSR. Mr. Nastase and Vadim seem to understand each other without having to utter so much as a word, despite the fact that the PRM has recently begun to attack [Romania's National Defense Minister Lieutenant General Niculae] Spiroiu as well. The ruling coalition is visibly irritated. The PUNR has been negotiating with the ruling party [PDSR], Cotroceni Palace has seemed to favor a PUNR-PDSR coalition as a solution, and a great deal of promises have been made to the PUNR. The latter claims that it even has an agreement in writing signed by the PDSR. The PUNR wanted a cohabitation, just the two of them, and it desperately wanted to join the government. Now that it has struck an alliance with the PDAR [Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania], they both want portfolios, especially that of national defense. Funar wants to replace General Spiroiu, a minister who has survived three governments, and wants to appoint [4th, Transylvanian Army Commander General Paul] Cheler to that office. Cheler is the one who was threatening to open fire on us, and now that we see that the oppression has continued in Romania, we are ready to believe that he would really have done so. The trade unions accept the "social pact," a phrase also taken over by the Presidency and used instead of the old term, "consensus." The unions have also declared that no further dialogue with the government would make any sense. It is true, resignation has especially overtaken the poor. But let us not forget that about 11 million people in Romania are poor. The government has repeatedly postponed the deadline for the implementation of what it promised during the negotiations with the unions, which do not reject the reform, and rather favor it. By telling people, via all channels, that privatization causes unemployment, the PDSR is continuously trying to distort the claims advanced by the unions. The message of the unions was clear: They intended to mobilize the parliamentary majority to vote in favor of the censure motion, that is, to depose the government. What more does the parliamentary majority expect besides the trade unions' consent to close down companies that are counter-productive, operating in the red, and to reconvert industry and the labor force? Meanwhile the trade unions have become quite radical as they realized that the state authority is lying to them and immediately forgets the plans put down on paper without ever implementing them. What else is there in the top list of 1993? The corruption among officials should also be included. The corruption disease is one of the most powerful forces acting for social-political disintegration. The general confidence placed in state institutions is vanishing just as the dossiers of the corruption cases that have reached their climax will. We will become accustomed to corruption. The deadline for parliament to report on corruption cases was set for the end of 1993, but the law- makers forgot about it. They did so for the very simple reason that the hotbed of corruption is Cotroceni. Corruption seems to be the moral and juridical basis of the democracy promised by Mr. Iliescu. Messrs. Florica and Hortopan [former high-ranking Interior Ministry officials who made disclosures about a number of corruption cases] have convincingly revealed in the press how the mechanism of lies and corruption functions. However, everything remained the way it used to be, because that is what the state authority wanted. It admitted that there is corruption, but denied that there are corrupt people. Which means that we did not go far enough with our revolution. The corrupt state has not yet collapsed because it is still under the control of those who emerged on top of the ruins of communism and who are the enemies of radical reforms. And there are no signs that the executive, the top of the state, will soon be purged to eliminate political banditry. Everywhere in the world the heads of mafia bosses and corrupt ministers are rolling, except in our country, where they appear smilingly on television as the champions of reform. While compiling the 1993 top list we should not forget Caritas [the large-scale money-multiplying pyramid scheme]. That was possible only because the Romanians, fed up with promises and poor, are all trying to work out a magic formula that would bring them luck and make them rich quickly. One of the publishing houses even came out with a book titled "Caritas or the Romanians' Salvation by Themselves." Anyway, Caritas has managed to make a laughing stock of us Romanians all over the world. Tiraspol should also be included in the list with its illegal death sentence passed against Ilascu. Ilascu's fate has made us forget about the chance, which we missed, that emerged immediately after the Moscow coup attempt on 23 August 1991, when Bessarabia, after it declared its independence, could have united with the mother country. And last but not least, the top list should also include his majesty the king, who is trusted by an increasing number of people as a force that could really bring about reconciliation. The king announced his intention to join the Romanian nation on the day of the 75th anniversary of the Great Union, saying he did not know whether he would live long enough to see another round anniversary celebration of the Great Union. The fact that he was denied an entry visa proves that the old system is still alive. Such was, in broad terms, the year 1993. Somber. How 1994 will look depends on us, but also on parliament, which in its extraordinary session scheduled to begin on 3 January will not allow the installment of dictatorship, albeit in disguise.
