In this connection the redeployment has started of the blue berets in the region where military operations may take place. Russian blue berets also received this order, but they have refused to obey it. We contacted Leonid Kerestedzhiyants, Russian ambassador to Croatia, by telephone and asked him to comment on this decision. [Begin Kerestedzhiyants recording] It was not only the Russian battalion that received this order, but a number of other battalions as part of a plan to reinforce the blue berets' positions in Sarajevo, to separate the opposing sides. The battalion did not obey this order in agreement with Moscow because the action which is currently being undertaken in the area around Sarajevo with regard to the possible bombing of the Serb positions, an issue that has been resolved without the involvement of Russia and only within the framework of NATO frees us, in our opinion, from now acting, obeying the orders of commanders who do not regard it possible to take into account our position, our approach to untangling the Bosnian- Sarajevo knot. Our battalion is located in the Vostok sector, a long way from Sarajevo, and in general it does not border on Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is on the frontier between Croatia and Serbia. We do not consider it possible that our battalion, our soldiers should find themselves in the zone where military action may take place, which we are opposed to in principle. [end recording]
