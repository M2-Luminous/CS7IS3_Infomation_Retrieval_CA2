FR940810-1-00004 FR940810-1-00001 Finally, although the earlier notification rule did not cover wet leases other than code-sharing arrangements as then defined, other wet leases appear to present similar opportunities to mislead consumers into thinking that they are buying transportation from one carrier, when in fact the transporting carrier will be different. The Department continues to believe that the public interest is best served by permitting carriers to engage in code-sharing and wet-lease arrangements, so long as the public is given reasonable notice. 2 These arrangements can expand the price and service options available to consumers. Moreover, several of our international agreements specifically authorize code-sharing arrangements. We have determined, therefore, to limit this rulemaking to whether more notice is necessary to assure adequate public disclosure. We will not expand it to entertain comments on other issues, such as whether code-sharing should be banned. 2 For this reason, we deny the petition for rulemaking filed by Donald Pevsner in Docket 48710 to ban code-sharing entirely. Inadequacy of the Current Rule Experience with the increasing number of code-sharing arrangements in recent years, combined with consumers' receiving only haphazard disclosure, has tentatively persuaded us to modify our rules. A recent DOT enforcement investigation found that airlines and travel agents failed to disclose code-sharing arrangements 30% of the time. In the case of two particular airlines, failure to disclose was the norm. The Department has taken enforcement action against those companies, including the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the assessment of civil penalties and the issuance of warning letters. However, enforcement action alone will not solve the overall problem. Failure to disclose the relationship and the identity of the actual flight operator is deceptive and can result in confusion, hardship and inconvenience to consumers. It can also increase the costs of travel unexpectedly. For example, the Department receives complaints from consumers who mistakenly assumed that their carrier would use jet aircraft, rather than propeller-driven aircraft. Consumers enrolled in the frequent-flyer program of the airline whose code was on the ticket have found that they got no or fewer miles when they flew on the code-sharing partner's flights or that miles could be earned but not used on such flights or vice versa. Consumers have reported not knowing where to check in, a problem that can result in missed connections. Elderly or physically challenged passengers needing particular equipment have complained that the failure to disclose the code-sharing arrangement and the actual operator's identity has inconvenienced them. Travelers have only discovered at the airport that their flight was being operated by an airline they preferred not to use, a situation that can occur whenever a wet-lease arrangement is involved. Finally, consumers have complained that a service held out as on-line was in fact interline and there was no integration between the two airlines. These problems can also occur with certain wet leases. The Department believes that consumers can make travel decisions to avoid such problems if carriers and ticket agents notify them adequately. Proposed Changes First, the Department has tentatively concluded that no basis exists for differentiating among U.S. air carriers, ticket agents doing business in the United States, and foreign air carriers in the requirement to give full disclosure. Thus, we propose to expand the rule to cover the latter two classes explicitly. Ticket agents (including travel agents) sell about 80% of all airline tickets issued in the United States. Secretary's Task Force on Competition in the U.S. Domestic Airline Industry, Airline Marketing Practices: Travel Agencies, Frequent Flyer Programs, and Computer Reservations Systems at 7 (1990). A requirement that applies to only 20% of ticket sales affords the public too little protection. We therefore propose to require ticket agents doing business in the United States and foreign air carriers, when giving information about air transportation involving code-sharing arrangements, to disclose these arrangements and the identity of the transporting carrier, just as U.S. airlines are currently required to do. This should not be a burden to ticket agents since, to avoid misrepresentations, they are already required to tell consumers when asked that the carrier holding out the service is not the same as the one operating the flight. Ticket agents should also be able to identify code-shared flights easily, since computer reservations systems already identify them and airlines can update those systems to reflect changes very quickly. As noted above, extending the notice requirement to foreign air carriers merely conforms our rules to agency practice when we approve code-share applications. In this way, we hope to assure that all U.S. consumers have a complete understanding of the transportation they are buying at the time when they make a travel purchase decision. Some domestic code-sharing arrangements consist of several commuter carriers that operate under a ``network'' name, e.g., Northwest Airlink, Delta Connection. In disclosing the transporting carrier for purposes of this rule, it is permissible to use such a network name if that is the name in which the service is generally held out to the public. Since the purpose of this rule is to prevent confusion, we do not wish to require disclosure of a corporate name that is not the name used by the carrier to identify itself in airports or in advertisements and will thus mean nothing to consumers. However, we remind airlines and ticket agents that the proposed rule requires disclosure not only of the name of the transporting carrier or network, but also of the fact that this entity is not the one shown on the ticket. Since many network names may connote a special type of service rather than a different carrier, the transporting airline should be identified with a statement such as ``our affiliate, Northwest Airlink'' or ``our partner in travel, Delta Connection.''
