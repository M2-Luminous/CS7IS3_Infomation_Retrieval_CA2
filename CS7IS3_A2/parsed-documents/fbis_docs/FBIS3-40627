The Permanent Parliamentary Committee has given details of when and how India's attitude of submission to the Dunkel proposals and GATT in its report yesterday. Appropriate responses to two comments made by the Congress (I) in the Parliament is also included in this report. One comment was that V.P. Singh had discussed the agreement positively when he was India's finance minister in 1986 just before the Uruguay conference. The comment was used in a wrong way. It was mentioned in a way to imply that V.P. Singh had endorsed it in the Uruguay session. The second comment was questioning why the V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar governments did not get out of GATT? Why is the Narasimha Rao government being asked to get out of GATT? The Permanent Committee of the commerce ministry after reviewing the report has raised the same concerns over the Dunkel proposals that are bothering the people around the country. According to this report, this whole agreement is a device to make all the developing countries economic colonies. The Permanent Committee warned that if there is even a small understanding of the history of verbal assurances, we should not trust them. Even the officials of GATT have said after repeated analysis that GATT has become an instrument in the hands of developed countries to crush the developing countries through trade. V.P. Singh's comments on this agreement are included in this report, and these show that India had not bowed down in the beginning. The report says that this will affect our country's autonomy and the interests of the poor will be affected. The real compliance began in April 1989. Rajiv Gandhi's government agreed that talks can be held with GATT over intellectual endowment. The second important turn was taken in January 1992 and a few months before it. Anvarul Huda, then special secretary in the commerce ministry and now the assistant director of GATT, said, "India did not think it important to make final decision over Dunkel in January 1992. In the January 1992 agreement, all the participating nations had to present their final decision." If we look at the history, at a time when the whole world was ready to present a clear stand, the Indian government did not even want to discuss Dunkel proposals with any one. The actions of the governments led by V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar are written in the history. No decision was made over GATT during either of these two governments. The Permanent Committee had presented its preliminary report to the Parliament on 10 May 1992. It had tried to warn in that report also. The history of GATT and the Uruguay conference fully shows how India is helpless and alone on this last chance to approve the Dunkel draft and how much control the United States has. For more than four decades, the international trade followed GATT regulations in customs tariffs. It was felt after the World War ll that there should be a common agreement on international trade. This agreement combined with the World Bank and the IMF gave a new form to the international economic system. It was believed that this organization would function without any bias and will keep in mind each nation's developmental needs to avoid wars like the WWII caused by economic rivalries. The goal was the protection of humanity, fairness, and equality. Therefore, 23 nations started a general agreement over trade and tariffs. This agreement later evolved into GATT. However, the United States and its allies started their games soon after GATT was formed. The race to make the international trade their personal property started. The United States refused to accept the Havana Charter in 1948 and stopped the formation of the international trade organization. The United States had its eyes on controlling world trade after WWII and did not wish for any international body to control trade. Only an ad hoc organization like GATT, which it could pressure into submission, could protect its interests. GATT has been in this format for the last four decades. Its rules change depending on the needs of the United States. The first five meetings of GATT were called just to give an international color to the U.S. mutual trade laws of 1934. When its trade increased in 1962, the GATT meeting of Kennedy era (1962-67) was held to absorb this increase. The Tokyo meeting of 1973 was held to facilitate the proposed 1974 U.S. trade law. The Uruguay conference in 1986 was held to give an international form to it all-encompassing trade and competition law of 1988. It was clear during the '50s that GATT did not belong to all and was not to protect everyone's interests. After one decade, GATT concluded that it was not fair to the third world countries. The Herbler Committee made it clear to all. It said that the developed nations block consumption of third world countries' products. It was against the GATT rules. The developing countries brought this issue in the United Nation to stop this monopoly in GATT. At that time this organization still had some clout and the UNCTAD (United Nations Committee for Trade and Development) was formed. Its first general secretary, Raul Prebish, investigated GATT and concluded that it could not relate trade with the development structure. GATT had to accept under the pressure of the developing countries that developed nations and developing countries are not equal where trade was concerned. Every nation has its own unique developmental needs and this should be kept in mind when discussing trade. However, the UNCTAD efforts were limited to paper only. The developing countries brought up GATT again in the Tokyo meeting and called it a club of few rich nations. It does not help poor nations' trade as is proved by its trade figures. In 1966, the developing countries had 11.2 percent share in the world trade. Twenty years later, in 1986, this share increased to 13.8. Thus GATT did not help reduce the trade chasm between the poor and rich nations. This situation of status quo was until 1986. At that time GATT only decided customs and tariff rates. It was not used to interfere in other countries internal policies or put limitation on their economic autonomy. The richer nations, first stealthily and later openly, started to control economic space of other countries after the Uruguay conference. First the question of unrestricted exchange of services was brought up. Japan and other countries had beaten the United States in manufacturing. It felt that it can keep its autonomy on international trade only by controlling services. Then agriculture was brought up because the European Common Market countries had beaten the United States in this area. The idea of protecting intellectual property was introduced by the back door by saying that the things manufactured by copying should be restricted. Later, this was changed to autonomy over intellectual property. It does not matter if Pranab Mukherji says that no other laws except patent laws will be changed. However, India has said many times in the Uruguay meeting that it has to change many of its laws if it agrees to the proposal. It is important to mention here that India received the Dunkel Draft in December 1991. However, for 9-10 months, the Indian government could not even say what amenities it wanted in this agreement. The report of the Permanent Committee clearly indicates that the perfunctionry act of getting information by the government was performed under pressure from the people.
