Alimov, attending a ministerial meeting of the 10-member Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) in Tehran, told AFP he appreciated an Iranian offer to help end the civil war in Tajikistan, where government forces have been fighting Muslim fundamentalists for more than a year. However, Tajikistan "prefers the crisis to be resolved through wider efforts undertaken by the United Nations," he added. Alimov said the government intended to hold general elections in July and called on Tajiks inside and outside the country to take part. Last week Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister 'Abbas Maleki said Iran had launched mediation efforts to end the conflict, following a request from four other Muslim central Asian states -- Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. He said Iran was determined to use its influence to restore security to Tajikistan, and had already held talks with Tajik opposition leaders. Pro-communist forces seized power in the Tajik capital Dushanbe in December 1992, toppling the ruling coalition of democratic and Islamic forces. Iran has so far adopted a low profile toward the conflict to avoid antagonising the newly-independent central Asian states, with which it has been trying to boost economic and cultural ties. Iranian President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani opened the fourth session of the ECO Council of Ministers in Tehran on Tuesday with a call for an end to conflicts in central Asia and the Caucasus. Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati told AFP the crisis in Tajikistan may be discussed during the two-day meeting. The ECO was founded in 1985 by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan and expanded in 1991 to include Afghanistan as well as the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
