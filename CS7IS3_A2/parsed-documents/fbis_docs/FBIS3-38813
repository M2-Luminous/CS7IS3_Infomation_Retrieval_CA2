The time has come to apportion blame, Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos said this morning as he arrived at the entrance of the building where the European Union [EU] Council of Foreign Ministers will meet today. Our correspondent in Brussels Nikolaos Bellos reports that discussion of the tragedy in Sarajevo will take place late this afternoon chaired by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. The meeting will seek to form a unified stance by the 12 EU members to deal with the problem. The development of the discussion cannot be determined right now because most member countries have not made their positions public. Our correspondent reports that the only thing certain is that at least three countries, Germany, France, and Belgium, will ask the others to agree to harden the EU position.
