Staroverov: "Russia Stretches Out Helpful Hand to Sevastopol"] [Text] Upon his return from a trip to Moscow, Sevastopol City Council Chairman V.M. Semyonov held a press conference. He said that at present, Ukraine is not capable of providing subsidies to Sevastopol and that the goal of his trip was to ensure that the Russian budget finances the part of city's infrastructure and social sector that is connected with servicing the Black Sea Fleet (which represents about one-fourth of all expenditures in this sector). It is expected that 52-53 billion rubles will be earmarked for this purpose. This amount was announced during the last trip by V.M. Semyonov to Moscow, last April. At that time, Russian President Boris Yeltsin jotted "Please take this into consideration when drafting the budget" on the written appeal. Aid to Sevastopol should not be a one-shot deal, but permanent. This is Russia's duty, V.M. Semyonov stressed, because the Black Sea Fleet is, and will be, Russian with its base located in Sevastopol. In Moscow, the mayor of Sevastopol reached an understanding with Russian Finance Minister Yuriy Dubinin and N. Gonchar, head of the commission for budget and currency regulation and tax policies in the Federation Council. Russia's budget participation and the financing of Sevastopol's needs will be conducted on the basis of interstate agreements. In his report, V.M. Semyonov touched upon the mechanism for funneling funds from the Russian budget to Sevastopol. This issue was also discussed during his visit to Moscow. He held meetings with a number of leaders of large industrial companies and enterprises. In particular, interest in Sevastopol was expressed by one science and production amalgamation from the machine-building industry, also known as the major enterprise manufacturing "Proton" carrier rockets, "Polet" satellites, and "Salut" and "Almaz" space stations. It proposed to use high-technology developments in the manufacturing of solar energy collectors and generators, as well as water purification equipment.
