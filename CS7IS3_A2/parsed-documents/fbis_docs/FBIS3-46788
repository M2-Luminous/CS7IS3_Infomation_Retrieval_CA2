With a view to enhancing efficiency in personnel management, the Foreign Ministry also plans to degrade 17 of 47 vice minister-level special first-class grade officials to a lower first-class grade, and to readjust its overseas missions. The Foreign Ministry will readjust the diplomatic organizational network that was established at random in an era of confrontational diplomacy between the North and the South. It will close down some of its missions in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe and augment others to carry out additional functions.
