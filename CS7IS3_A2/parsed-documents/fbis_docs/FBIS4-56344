The speech announcing his election was followed by shouts of "viva Gonzalo" and the singing of the "Three Trees" march. Aguirre spoke for almost an hour. He placed special emphasis in his Wilsonist roots [late Blanco Party leader Wilson Ferreira Aldunate], expressing support for a liberal economic policy and a future coalition government. The ceremony to announce his candidacy was held on 16 April and attended by 4,000 people. There were flags, placards, and signs of the List 97.70 headed by former Deputy Carlos Rodriguez--the strongest candidate to be Aguirre's running mate--and List 4 headed by Senator Julio Grenno and his Canelones colleague Bari Gonzalez. Several telegrams congratulating the candidate arrived during the ceremony. They were sent by Herreraist [Blanco Party faction] candidate Juan Andres Ramirez, Senator Walter Santoro, former Minister Alvaro Ramos, former Senator Enrique Veltran, Maldonado Mayor Domingo Burgueno, and former law school dean Adolfo Gelsi Bidart, among others. Aguirre said Wilson Ferreira was "the most important national and National Party figure in the past decades." He cited Ferreira several times in his speech when mentioning "decentralization, the main problem the country has to solve." He recalled that "this was the last great job" undertaken by the late National Party leader. Aguirre said his option is "not a third option or an intermediate one (...). It is not a third option because in electoral times citizens and their votes determine who is first. It is not an intermediate option because it is not located between other party forces. Our option is located in a space determined by our definitions and the personality of our candidates." Aguirre said that during his campaign "they will not indulge in personal attacks" or the "systematic criticism of other parties' governments, at the national or departmental level." He said: "No matter who wins, we will help the creation of a coalition government with all our strength. A true coalition supposes a political alliance to exercise government duties based on guidelines agreed upon by coalition members and not unilaterally imposed by the president of the Republic." The elected candidate said his government will not be "a copy" of the present administration, although he will continue "its work" of "maintaining a healthy economy and fighting inflation and the fiscal deficit" in a "distinct way and with our own style and image," because "for us economic policy must not be dogmatic (...) or constitute an end in itself." During the speech that was frequently interrupted by applause, Aguirre mentioned the topics that in his opinion will be the main campaign issues: decentralization, education reform, the state's role's definition, social security reform, an analysis of the tax system and its eventual reform, and the creation of new jobs. Aguirre expressed support for a liberal economic policy. "We will support liberalism, but social liberalism (...) a policy where the state does not suffocate private initiative with regulations, its presence, and state monopolies. A policy where the state does not neglect the basic needs of the people or stop giving priority attention to education, housing, and health."
