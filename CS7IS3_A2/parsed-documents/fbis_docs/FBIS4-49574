These forums, mostly organized by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec), are the Chinese Government's latest response to foreign investors gripped by "China mania." Late this month, Moftec will orchestrate a massive trade delegation that will visit Hong Kong to promote investment. The promotional trip will be the first to Hong Kong organized by Moftec. But officials declined to give details about the Hong Kong forum. Local analysts said the trade forum takes on added significance as it follows the issuance of HK$3 billion (US$380 million) in Hong Kong bank notes by the Bank of China. From June 1 to 9, Moftec Vice-Minister Gu Yongjiang will head another big delegation to Australia to promote trade and investment. The delegation, of around 200 people from 20 provinces and cities, will leave on May 30 and return on June 11. "More than 500 Chinese projects (seeking Australian investment) will be announced in Melbourne from June 1-3 and Sidney from June 7- 9," said an official with the foreign investment administration of Moftec. Of the projects, 53 involve infrastructure; 428 are in manufacturing; 18 in agriculture, forestry and husbandry; 17 in services; three in science; and one in research. Australia hopes to be further integrated into the Asia-Pacific region. Through last year, Australia had pledged some $1.3 billion to 1,310 projects in China. The actual input was $338 million. This makes Australia one of the top 10 overseas investors in China. During the Australian visit, the China National Technical Import and Export Corp and the China National Machinery Import and Export Corp will seek to facilitate imports and exports, Moftec officials said. From late May to early June, Moftec Minister Wu Yi will lead a delegation to Japan to discuss bilateral trade and investment opportunities. Besides attending a meeting with the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Wu will attend a conference in the capacity of Chairperson of the China-Japan Investment Promotion Committee. Wu's visit comes at a time when more Japanese companies, such as NEC, Mitsubishi and C. Itoh, are seeking more business with China. Last year alone China approved 3,488 projects involving $2.96 billion worth of pledged Japanese investment. The actual input was $1.32 billion. By 1993 Japan's total promised investment in China was $8.86 billion in 7,182 projects. The actual input was $5.17 billion. Moftec will also organize a large trade and investment delegation to Italy and France late next month, officials revealed. Altogether 100 people from 14 provinces and cities will offer 330 projects for investment. The projects mainly cover chemicals, foodstuffs, machinery, leather, light industry, textiles, building materials and medicine.
