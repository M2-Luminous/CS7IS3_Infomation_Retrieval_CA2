Even the souls of Hitler and Mussolini are feeling ashamed of the manner in which the Indian security forces have been carrying out the heinous and appalling crimes in the savage massacres of the Kashmiris including children, burning their homes, and gang-raping women on the pretext of their being connected with the Hizbul Mojahedin and the Movement for the Freedom of Kashmir organizations. India has done as much as it could to cover up these brutalities by carrying out anti-Pakistan propaganda, but Western countries and the international human rights organizations have now become fully aware of the actual situation and have been voicing strong protests against the gross violation of human rights in occupied Kashmir. Lately, besides Asia Watch and Amnesty International, several members of the British Parliament and prominent Indian parliamentarian Indrajit Gupta have also joined these protests; and the Indian Government, after getting tired of this situation, has flatly refused to allow a delegation of the Amnesty International to visit occupied Kashmir. Under these circumstances, the advice from India's old ally -- a staunch supporter of New Delhi on the Kashmir issue in the past -- to find a just solution to the Kashmir dispute reflects the increasing awareness and concern in the entire world for an early resolution of this issue. India will not be able to counter these pressures for long and will, therefore, be forced to settle the problem in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. Considering this situation as a good augury, Pakistan will have to further intensify its struggle to fully apprise the international public opinion of its stand on Kashmir.
