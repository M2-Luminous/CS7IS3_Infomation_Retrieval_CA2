Joe Clark first met with Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ambassador Ozdem Sanberk. In a statement he made prior to the meeting, Ambassador Sanberk stated that Turkey sees an atmosphere of insecurity in Cyprus, and therefore supports the confidence-building measures package. Clark, in turn, stated that the solution to the Cyprus problem depends on the leaders of the two communities. Clark noted that he will submit a report to the UN secretary general concerning his visits to Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey. Clark further stated that he hopes Turkey will continue to extend its constructive help to find a solution to the Cyprus issue. Clark later visited Foreign Ministry Deputy Under Secretary Tugay Ulucevik and conferred with him for some time.
