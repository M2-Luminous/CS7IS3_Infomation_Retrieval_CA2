On the contrary it [deterioration of situation] has been increased. The Parliamentary coup, as a result of which the dynasty of ex-Prime Minister Abdumalik Abdullodzanov fell, became the theme of a lot of talks in different circles in Khujand. According to a report on Radio Liberty, this event in particular became the reason for the intense rivalry between the ethnic groups and political disputes between the dynasties which are fighting for power. A well known Tajik journalist [word indistinct] writes: The existence of the groups and the dynasties which are fighting for power in Tajikistan is a reality which one cannot deny. At no other time was the government of Tajikistan in such a state of disarray and mistrust. The politicians are developing the spirit of the local tendencies by their actions among the citizens and explain all their mistakes and failures only because of the existence of misunderstandings between the groups and the dynasties. Recently, thanks to the efforts of the so-called Kulyabi dynasty, the representatives of the Khujand dynasty [words indistinct] Abdullodzanov, former chairman of the Council of Ministers and his relatives, Homidov, chairman of the executive committee of Leninabad oblast and his supporters were removed from power. Abdulmadjid (?Dostiyev), first deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan and Abdulmadjid Samadov the new prime minister arrived in Khujand during the final days of 1993. They have relieved (?Abujalil Homidov), [chairman of the executive committee of Leninabad oblast] as well as the prosecutor of the oblast, the head of department of Internal Affairs and the head of the National Security Committee of the oblast of their posts and have appointed to these posts the people who are loyal to the Central government. According to the latest news, (?Homidov) is at present at the government hospital of Tashkent city. Ergash Kurbonov, the other representative of this dynasty who was the head of the Leninabad oblast National Security Committee and who took the initiative in killing and arresting hundreds of opposition supporters have fled the oblast. Kurbonov, being an experienced employee of the KGB and former chairman of Committee on Legislation and the Human Rights of the Parliament of Tajikistan, has played a big role during the bloody events of Tajikistan. In particular, he took a great part in formation of the people's front in Syrkhandarya oblast of Uzbekistan and exerting big pressure on the people's deputies in the town of Khujand during the historical [16th] session of the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan. And it was Ergash Kurbonov, who by the order of Rakhmanov forced the deputies of Leninabad oblast to abandon their separatist views and to come to Dushanbe for the 18th session of the Supreme Soviet. But all these worthy services of the latter could not change the decision of Dushanbe with respect to him. The oblast [Leninabad] calmly reacted to the forced resignation of its leaders. According to many analysts, the reason of this is that Abdullojonov and Homidov have transformed the new economic structures in oblast into their dynasty's monopoly and caused hindrance to dozens of businessmen and entrepreneurs. That is why this middle class of the Khujandi society have approved the sudden changes; but on the contrary the reaction of the leadership of the neighboring Republic of Uzbekistan to these events was provocative. Right after the resignation of the top persons of Leninabad oblast, two platoons of the army of Uzbekistan left Tavildarinskiy rayon and one platoon left the mountainous region of Mastchoh and Aniyskiy, former Zahmatobod, rayon and returned to Tashkent. The relations between Imamali Rakhmanov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan and Uzbek President Islam Karimov have become further complicated. All of these are evidence to the fact that lately the leadership of Uzbekistan had relied on Abdullojonov and Homidov. In particular the proposals related to revival of the presidential structure and nomination of (?Homidov) to this post could be the evidence of this. It is thought that these proposals have been started from Tashkent. The support given to the above- mentioned proposals by Uzbek speaking deputies of the Parliament and the Society of Uzbeks of Tajikistan also point to the same conclusion. The measures of Tashkent with respect to Imamali Rakhmanov took place at the time when the latter has established close relations with Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani. It is possible that the latest events in Afghanistan may be connected with these political games. At present, the units and companies of the Uzbek Army have only remained in the border region of Shaartuzskiy rayon and their presence is because of the events in Afghanistan. Similarly, protection of the Tajik-Uzbek border in the north has been reinforced after the changes in Khujand. Tashkent fears that in the case of the deterioration of the situation in Khujand oblast [as heard], the unrest could spread to Fergana, Syrdarya, Tashkent, Dzhisakh, Samarkand and Bukhara oblasts. According to the opinions of the local observers, the action of Imamali Rakhmanov related to relieving the leadership of Leninabad oblast of their post as well as resignation of Abdullojonov took place because of Russia's support. Essentially, all these rivalries are the result of contradictions between Russia and Uzbekistan in order to have influence in Tajikistan. However, according to analysts, the course of events could completely destroy the situation in the region and cause even greater bloodshed. The experts say that only finding a way of reconciliation between the government of Tajikistan and the Tajik opposition can solve this case.
