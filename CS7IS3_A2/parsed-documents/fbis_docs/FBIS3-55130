Not a single national radical has made it into the supreme legislative organ this time. In electing 72 deputies for the next four years from 224 candidates, the republic's population definitely showed its preference for centrists. Between 18 months and two years ago the republic experienced an upsurge of national extremism -- there were open-ended rallies in Nalchik's main square attended by thousands of people calling on the authorities to resign, protest hunger strikes, and even an attempt to storm Government House. In order to defuse the situation, V. Kokov then relinquished his powers as chairman of the republic's Supreme Council. Tired of living under the threat of violence, the people rejected the extremists' calls and in the first presidential elections plumped for V. Kokov from among the many candidates. His policy of stabilization, consensus, and unity with Russia is supported today too. Confirmation of that was the first joint session of the chambers held just before the New Year. It elected the chamber chairmen and deputy chairmen backed by President V. Kokov. The Council of the Republic is headed by Vice Premier Z. Nakhushev, who is a Kabardin. The Council of Representatives is headed by M. Zhaboyev, technical director of the Tyrnyauz Tungsten and Molybdenum Combine (Europe's largest), who is a Balkar. The deputy chairmen are Russians -- L. Fedochenko, deputy director of the Uplands Geophysical Institute, and Ye. Golovko, director of a sewn goods enterprise. A note of consensus was struck by the voters themselves. Contrary to the fears that people would vote only for representatives of their own ethnic group, the Russian Mayskiy Rayon elected as parliamentary deputy the Kabardin Yu. Shomakhov, while Nalchik plumped for a Kabardin, a Balkar, and a Russian. But the republic is most proud of the fact that a confident victory in the elections to the Council of Representatives was won by A. Shkhagoshev, a senior official at the Kabardino-Balkar MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Administration for Combating Organized Crime, who lost his hands when confiscating a grenade from a participant in the open-ended rally outside Government House 18 months ago. People from different ethnic groups collected money to pay for him to be treated in Germany. The German doctors managed to achieve the inconceivable -- they sewed his hands back on. Adalbi Lyulevich can now do a great deal with these hands -- he even drives.
