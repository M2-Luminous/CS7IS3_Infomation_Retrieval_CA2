This decision certainly nullifies the April 1992 national peace pact signed between the Malian Government and the Tuaregs. The pact notably stipulated the incorporation of former rebels into the regular national Army. "The risk of an outbreak of violence has never been so high since two years but in-fighting within the Tuareg community explains the attitude adopted by each group toward the pact," the same source added. The 10 and 12 June clashes led to the death of 30 Tuaregs belonging to the Unified Movement and Front of Azaouad [MFUA]. During the incidents one of the movement's component groups, the Popular Movement of the Azaouad [MPA], was targeted by the three others and now the MPA remains the only group the government can negotiate with. The three other MFUA member groups -- the Islamic Arab Front of the Azaouad [FIAA], the Revolutionary Army for the Liberation of Azaouad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Azaouad have asked their "fighters" integrated into the Army to return to their bases in northern Mali. Furthermore, the FIAA's representative to the government, Zaha Bi, is no longer in Bamako. The Malian Government, which is criticized by the political parties for being lax about Tuareg demands, has for several months been pressurized by MFUA, notably over the issue of integrating former rebels into the Army. [passage omitted] The military hierarchy has always been reticent about incorporating Tuaregs into the Army and is opposed to their recruitment to the grade of officers. The MFUA puts the number of former fighters at 7,000 and says that "massive incorporation" is the only way to stop the attacks. [passage omitted]
