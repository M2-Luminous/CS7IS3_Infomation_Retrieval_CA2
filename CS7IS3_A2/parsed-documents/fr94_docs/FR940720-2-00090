NRC Project Director: Walter R. Butler. Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;424 and 50&hyph;425, Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Units 1 and 2, Burke County, Georgia Date of amendment request: March 31, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed amendments would change Technical Specification 3/4.7.1.1 and its Bases regarding maximum allowed reactor thermal power operation with inoperable main steam safety valves. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The new power range neutron flux high setpoint values will ensure that the secondary side steam pressure will remain below 110 percent of its design value following a loss of load/turbine trip (LOL/TT) when one or more main steam safety valves (MSSVs) are declared inoperable. Therefore, this transient will remain classified as a Condition II probability event (faults of moderate frequency) per ANSI_N18.2, 1973 as discussed in Section 15.0.1 of the VEGP Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). Accordingly, since the new power range setpoints will maintain the capability of the MSSVs to perform their pressure relief function associated with a LOL/TT event, there will be no effect on the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant equipment, and no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component. The new power range neutron flux high setpoints will maintain the capability of the MSSVs to perform their pressure relief function to ensure the secondary side steam design pressure is not exceeded following a LOL/TT. Therefore, since the function of the MSSVs is unaffected by the proposed changes, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated is not created. 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The algorithm methodology used to calculate the new power range neutron flux high setpoints is conservative and bounding since it is based on a number of inoperable MSSVs per loop; i.e., if only one MSSV in one loop is out of service, the applicable power range setpoint would be the same as if one MSSV in each loop were out of service. Another conservatism with the algorithm methodology is with the assumed minimum total steam flow rate capability of the operable MSSVs. The assumption is that if one or more MSSVs are inoperable per loop, the inoperable MSSVs are the largest capacity MSSVs, regardless of which capacity MSSVs are actually inoperable. Therefore, since the power range setpoints calculated for the proposed changes using the algorithm methodology are more conservative and ensure the secondary side steam design pressure is not exceeded following a LOL/TT, there will not be a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
