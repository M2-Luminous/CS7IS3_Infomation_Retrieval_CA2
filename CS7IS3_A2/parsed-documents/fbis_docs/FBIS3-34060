He said there has also been a positive response from General 'Abdorrahim [as heard] Dostam, when the acting consul general of Pakistan contacted him at Mazar-e Sharif. The spokesman said Pakistan would continue to provide humanitarian relief to the displaced people at Jalalabad. He said Pakistan was pressing all parties to the conflict to accept a cease- fire.
