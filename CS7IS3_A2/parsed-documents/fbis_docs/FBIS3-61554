B. Renard, A. A. Chizhov, V. S. Vlasov, and M. P. Malafeyev; UDC 546.791.6+546.799.4] [Abstract] The distribution of uranyl and plutonium nitrates and nitric acid in the PUREX process has been well studied and the results for systems employing 30 percent TBF (tributyl phosphate) solutions in paraffins have been presented. However, a gap remains in the published experimental data: missing are data on the distribution of uranium and plutonium in this system at higher temperatures. Interest in these data intensified following publication of a method for the joint extraction of uranium and plutonium at a higher temperature (55� C), combining the uranium and plutonium into the raffinate to 2 grams/liter and 20 mg/liter, respectively. This approach to the extraction of these metals may be used in the regeneration of spent nuclear fuel. In the present work a study was made of extraction equilibria in aqueous solutions of (UO[.sub]2[/])(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/]- Pu(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]4[/]-HNO[.sub]3[/] in 20 and 30 percent TBF in n-dodecane at 25 and 60� C. The data were obtained in the stable region of a two phase system. The regions in the vicinity of the critical point were also studied (formation of a second organic phase at high plutonium nitrate concentration), as well as the behavior of protactinium in the system.
