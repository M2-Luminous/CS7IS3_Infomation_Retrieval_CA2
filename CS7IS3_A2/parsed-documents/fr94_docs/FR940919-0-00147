FR940919-0-00147 FR940919-0-00017 Issue 30: The Service received a comment that requested an explanation of the applicability of Hoffman Homes Inc. v. EPA to vernal pools. Service Response: Hoffman Homes Inc. v. EPA, 916 F.2d 1310 (7th Cir. 1992) held that an isolated wetland, with no shown effect on interstate commerce, was not within EPA's nor the Corps of Engineers' jurisdiction to regulate. That decision was vacated in the same year ( Hoffman Homes Inc. v. EPA, 975 F.2d 1554) and the issue reheard by the same court in 1993 ( Hoffman Homes Inc. v. EPA, 999 F.2d 256). In its final interpretation of the issues presented in that case, the court held that waters whose use, degradation, or destruction could affect interstate commerce, were waters appropriately regulated by EPA and/or the Corps (emphasis added). Based upon the facts as presented in that case, however, the court could not find sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that the wetland in question could potentially affect interstate commerce. As such, the court determined this particular water body to be outside the realm of EPA or Corps jurisdiction. The Service is not aware how the EPA or Corps view this case relative to vernal pools. Regardless of the interpretation, however, it is the animal (as opposed to habitat) for which the Endangered Species Act will afford protection with this final regulation. Should it be determined that neither the Corps nor EPA have jurisdiction over these wetlands, and that section 7 is not therefore applicable, then the property owner may comply with the Endangered Species Act through section 10 of the Act.
