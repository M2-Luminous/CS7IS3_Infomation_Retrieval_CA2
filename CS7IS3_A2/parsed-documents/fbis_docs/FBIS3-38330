Accused by former Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic Security Service] agents, threatened by assassination plots, and challenged by his former DC [Christian Democratic Party] friends who are against holding early elections, President Scalfaro is under attack. However, he does not seem to be giving up. "No, I do not think he has any lost weight at all. In fact, he wanted me to give him the Donald Duck pin I always wear in my button hole. Of course, he is tense, but he is holding up well. And I have understood why. He is sustained by two great resources: His Roman Catholic upbringing has taught him patience; and his experience as a magistrate has given him the conviction that, sooner or later, he will be able to unravel this mess." PSDI [Italian Socialist Democratic Party] Secretary Enrico Ferri is also a magistrate and is also up to his neck in troubles with a party that is dissolving and with the upcoming elections. But on Tuesday, 11 January, he went to the Quirinale, and now he speaks, with the affection of a friend, about the drama of Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. The gentlemanly President Scalfaro has been muddied and threatened with new disclosures and even attempts on his life. He was the man chosen to ensure and guide the transition to the Second Republic. Now he is in danger of going down with the First Republic, whose end he himself wanted to hasten, by accepting Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's resignation and dissolving Parliament after only 21 months. So, the Quirinale is living the most difficult moments of the Scalfaro era. The palace is under maximum surveillance. On duty inside are the body guards, and outside, the ROS [Special Operations Section] units of the Carabinieri are even equipped with laser weapons. The presidential secretary general, Gaetano Gifuni, has strictly forbidden Scalfaro's entire staff, even his highest level colleagues, to release statements to the press. Even when he leaves the palace, reporters are no longer allowed to approach the head of state. When he visited Catania before Christmas, an army of 800 agents was mobilized to ensure his safety. More and more often, Scalfaro goes to mass in the chapel inside the Quirinale. He constantly changes his routine without notice: spending one night in his private home in the Forte Bravetta quarter and the next night in the Quirinale. He can use the small apartment in the little Fuga palace, which was Francesco Cossiga's favorite for his afternoon rests, or else the other rooms that have been readied for the emergency from among the 2,000 rooms in the great palatial residence. In a couple of months, the presidential apartment will also be ready at the end of the Manica Lunga wing, which has remained uninhabited since the times of [former President] Giovanni Leone. It is a 500-square-meter apartment in the shape of a T, with four bedrooms, two living rooms, a kitchen, a private dining room, and another enormous dining room for receiving guests. Scalfaro is a man alone. It seems ironical that, in order to portray him, we cannot avoid using the adjective, "alone," which had become the distinctive characteristic of the last moments of Cossiga's presidency, that seven-year term that Scalfaro had to banish. And now he, too--just like his predecessor who visited him on the afternoon of Friday, 7 January, to offer his full support--finds himself threatened and surrounded by a wall of ice. This is not due just to the disclosures about the Sisde scandal. His own party, his beloved DC, does not forgive him for his decision to call for immediate elections, which was as much a slap to those tortured by the nightmare of not getting reelected as it was to Mino Martinazzoli, who is in great need of more time to build his new Popular Party. Rumors that Scalfaro would resign immediately following the elections were rampant and even expressed out loud by DC group leader Gerardo Bianco. They indicate a hostility resembling a vendetta carried out in words. Today, most of Parliament, which was his great love, regards him with scorn. It is not convinced of the new, unknown direction the head of the state has chosen. "Of course it does not, because for the first time in the history of the Republic," says constitutional expert Augusto Barbera of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], "the Quirinale is not dissolving Parliament because it cannot resolve a governmental crisis. It is doing so because it no longer feels Parliament represents the country and because it wants to allow a new electoral law to be implemented." That is the refrain that Scalfaro obsessively repeats to everyone he encounters. But it is a subjective evaluation and an extremely delicate one. It has only two precedents, both in distant times: in 1913, when universal suffrage was granted, and in 1919, when they passed from a majoritarian electoral system to a proportional one. It is a hard pill to swallow. Even an old friend of the president, Alfredo Biondi of the PLI [Italian Liberal Party], went to the Quirinale on Wednesday, 12 January, and gave vent to his rage: "Oscar, you cannot offer the Italians a musical instrument that cannot be played yet. It takes time to make a majoritarian system work. You can see that, can't you? The alliances are far from complete, and we risk having more confusion than ever...." It is causing the head of state a lot of mental anguish. Almost all his traditional reference points are against him, while at his side he--who has always been anti-Communist--finds Achille Occhetto, who hopes to come away a winner in the spring elections. The private portrait of the besieged president is a mixture of anguish, nervousness, and a display of serenity worthy of a Christian martyr. Enzo Bianco, who as mayor had welcomed him to Catania, recalls with affection that he had often caught him gritting his teeth--the only, almost imperceptible sign of tension. Tuesday, 11 January, as he was leaving the palace of the Constitutional Court, where he had gone for the 1994 opening session of the Court, was the first time Scalfaro responded rudely to a reporter who had managed to approach him. This is another sign of his distress. At the reception at the Quirinale during the holidays, the head of the Lega Senators, Francesco Speroni, had approached Scalfaro warmly and remarked on the abundance of Piedmontese specialties in the buffet. He received a cold response: "My maitre d' attended hotel school in Stresa." There are even moments of anger. There are whispers about the rage of the president when he read a comment attributed to Martinazzoli that "the Quirinale is a hostage of the PDS." There was a phone call that attempted to clarify the matter between the two men, but the incident has not been totally forgotten. So there have been many dark moments. However, they have been tempered by the resources of a man who has a very strong character. Capuchin Friar Igino Ciabattoni, who was Scalfaro's spiritual advisor for many years and is now involved in a drug rehabilitation facility in the Marches, waxes lyrical about his friend Oscar. He says that because he "is a Franciscan lay brother, he has a clear conscience as big and deep as the ocean." Christian Democrat Luigi Granelli, another old friend who went to see him on Tuesday, 11 January, mentions a rare moment of happiness. They had discussed the pope's letter to the Italian bishops. "It is a different field," said a pleased Scalfaro, "but the call for Italian unity from such an authoritative source is moving." The Nightmare of Misfortune Among the things that soothe the president are the flower arrangements his daughter Marianna expertly composes with blossoms from the Quirinale gardens and the hearty bowls of pasta seasoned with hot red pepper that he puts away. This is the head of state's favorite dish, and he has not cut down on its consumption in recent weeks. His official activity has not fallen off either. On the contrary, he has made a show of remaining very busy, almost as if he wanted to emphasize his role of trustee in all aspects of the country's life. For example, military leaders, the Palermo Prosecutor Gian Carlo Caselli, and the anti-Mafia Prosecutor Bruno Siclari have all visited the president since the beginning of 1994. While the First Republic is in the throes of death, the nightmare of misfortune that has befallen all the DC presidents since the days of Antonio Segni again hangs over the presidential palace. The prince of astrologers, Peter Van Wood from Holland, had told Scalfaro in a restaurant near Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies building] a year before it happened that Scalfaro would be elected president. Now he is predicting his early resignation, "by his own choice, however, out of moral revulsion." But Mayor Bianco did notice something during the presidential visit to Catania before Christmas. After kneeling in prayer in the Cathedral of Sant'Agata before the skull of the saint covered in porcelain and precious stones, Scalfaro invited the chorus that was chanting the "Hallelujah" to sing in the Quirinale at Christmas time in 1994.
