Bosnian Moslems have been attacking for days Serb positions on Mount Ozren east of Doboj, Mount Vlasic north-west of Travnik and Mount Majevica near Tuzla in north-eastern Bosnia. Cease-fire was also violated by intensified sniper fire and fire from other weapons in Sarajevo while in other parts of Bosnia the situation is more or less normal, only with sporadic clashes, Eckhard told reporters. At the ministerial meeting of the United States, Russia and the European Union in Geneva on Friday, the participants asked Bosnia's warring sides to stop fighting for a period of four months. The Serb side accepted the proposal but said it preferred a permanent truce while the Moslem leadership rejected it. Eckhard said that about eight shells had been fired on Tuzla airfield during the landing of an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] plane which carried equipment for locating mortar positions and which will be positioned around the Moslem-controlled town of Tuzla and Brcko, a Serb town in northern Bosnia around which the Moslem side has been massing troops lately. No casualties were reported in the attack, said Eckhard and added that the shells were believed to have come from the Serb side. While the Moslem offensive is escalating, the U.S. media is almost completely ignoring it, which is evidently the old recipe of never mentioning Moslem assaults so that a possible Serb counter-attack could be later presented as an "act of aggression." Such a scenario was applied in the case of Gorazde, where the Bosnian Serb Army in March stopped a Moslem offensive -- launched from the U.N.-proclaimed "safe area" which should have been demilitarized last year -- and pushed back the Moslem forces towards the centre of Gorazde in a counter-attack.
