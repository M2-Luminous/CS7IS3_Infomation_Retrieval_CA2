He is leader of Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP], which won September's elections and marked the return of the former communist left in Poland. [passage omitted] LA LIBRE BELGIQUE met Mr. Kwasniewski on Wednesday morning and asked him what he thought of the partnership offered by NATO. [Kwasniewski] It is obviously in Poland's interests to be a full-fledged member of an effective European security structure. NATO is the only real structure. We understand that the integration process takes time. But that is not enough for us. I do not want, as Chancellor Kohl said in Davos, a border between the two Europes running between Germany and Poland. We must do two things. On the one hand, integrate our economies, make them more open because, without this, a new economic wall will be created between the two Europes. Also, we must change the thinking behind European security. Before, it was one of opposition--opposition to Russia, opposition to the Warsaw Pact, and, on the other side, opposition to NATO. And this change in attitudes must take account of Russia. [Lamfalussy] Of Russia? [Kwasniewski] Yes, because Russian politicians believe that a NATO strengthened by Poland and other Central European countries will oppose Russia. What is happening in Russia is not a resurgence of geographically limited nationalism. It is the feeling that the great Russia has lost land. Russia and Ukraine must therefore participate. [Lamfalussy] What form of participation? [Kwasniewski] That is up to the Russians to say. It is impossible to totally integrate Russia, which is bigger than Western Europe. [Lamfalussy] Do we need a European Army that can intervene in domestic conflicts, such as in the former Yugoslavia? [Kwasniewski] Rather than a large army, it would be useful to develop cooperation instruments between well-prepared troops, which would be able to help resolve such local conflicts. [Lamfalussy] The association accord between Poland and the European Union entered into force on Tuesday [1 Feb]. How can this help the Polish economy? [Kwasniewski] For the past two years, we have had a trade deficit with the EEC: We import more than we export. Protectionist barriers exist, principally for our agriculture and the steel industry. We hope that this accord is going to help us to export more. It is also important to give Poland the prospect of membership. It would be good to be members of the European Union by the year 2000. [Lamfalussy) Which countries are the major foreign investors in Poland? [Kwasniewski] The United States is the most active. The Netherlands, Italy, and Austria follow. Paradoxically, Germany ranks no higher than fifth, probably because it has been so busy with the rehabilitation of the former GDR.
