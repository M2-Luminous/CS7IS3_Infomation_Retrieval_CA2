Netanyahu vehemently objected to the impending release of hundreds of security prisoners and demanded that the state commission of inquiry also investigate the government's responsibility for the terrorist acts perpetrated against Jews. As for the restrictions placed on the hardcore extremist settlers in the territories, this is what Binyamin Netanyahu had to say: [Begin Netanyahu recording] If steps are called for against agitators or against people who assist or participate in acts of terrorism, then such action is legitimate; however, if the government's intention is to expand the scope of these measures to include large groups of settlers, who are the vast majority -- to say the least -- of the settler population, then it will constitute an abuse of authority that must not be sanctioned. Selective, strictly pinpointed action against lawbreakers is acceptable to us. [end recording]
