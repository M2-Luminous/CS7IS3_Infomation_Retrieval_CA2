FR940104-2-00041 FR940104-2-00029 In September 1986, we asked OHTA to conduct a full assessment of the safety and effectiveness of diagnostic tests for impotence and the methods for treating impotence. To conduct this assessment, OHTA solicited information from manufacturers, researchers, other government agencies, other components of PHS, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). OHTA also evaluated the latest scientific studies, medical literature, information from medical specialty groups, and respondents to the March 19, 1987, notice entitled ``National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology Assessment; Assessment of Medical Technology'' (54 FR 8648). In that notice, OHTA announced that it was assessing the safety and effectiveness of diagnostic tests and treatment methods for impotence. OHTA researched and analyzed published medical and scientific literature and relevant studies and reports. At the time we received the OHTA assessment on the diagnosis and treatment for impotence dated October 31, 1989, we asked for an assessment on sleep disorders. (Since December 1989, OHTA has been a part of PHS' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.) The OHTA assessment, ``Sleep Disorders,'' dated February 3, 1992, did not raise issues that would result in further coverage changes. Although OHTA's assessment on the diagnosis and treatment of impotence was issued 3 years ago, we have determined that the medical evidence and conclusions of the assessment are still accurate based on our own medical expertise and a thorough review of all the medical literature on the subject since 1989. The OHTA assessment, ``Public Health Service Assessment_The Diagnosis and Treatment of Impotence'' includes a bibliography of studies evaluating the effectiveness of various types of impotence testing and treatment. (Copies of this assessment may be obtained from the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Publications Clearinghouse, P.O. Box 8547, Silver Spring, MD 20907; Toll Free: 1&hyph;800&hyph;358&hyph;9295.) In the assessment, OHTA concluded that reliable tests for evaluating impotence include Doppler ultrasound, arteriography, cavernosography, cavernosometry, hormonal assays, and electrophysiological testing. NPT testing by plethysmography and other monitoring devices in the clinical setting or in the home is determined to be unreliable. According to OHTA, there are no accepted standards for NPT test results. Results cannot be compared among laboratories because each laboratory has its own set of standards by which to evaluate NPT. False-positive and false-negative results occur frequently indicating that NPT testing is not a reliable index for differentiating organic from psychogenic impotence, thereby making it impossible to choose the appropriate treatment. Also, OHTA does not consider other in-home monitoring devices to be reliable for diagnosing impotence. II. Provisions of This Proposed Notice Based on the conclusion of the OHTA technology assessment that scientific evidence indicates that NPT testing is not a reliable index for evaluating impotence, we have concluded that NPT testing does not meet our criteria for effectiveness. Therefore, we propose to revise our national policy by withdrawing coverage for NPT testing in the sleep disorder clinic. We do not have a national policy regarding NPT testing in other settings. Therefore, we propose to exclude coverage for NPT testing, rather than withdraw coverage, in all other settings. Because NPT test results are not standardized and are frequently inaccurate and have a high rate of false-positive and false-negative results, the appropriate treatment cannot be determined. The provisions of this notice would not affect existing Medicare regulations. However, they would affect the following manual instructions: •Section 2055 of the Medicare Carriers Manual (HCFA Pub. 14&hyph;3). •Section 3112.5 of the Medicare Intermediary Manual (HCFA Pub. 13&hyph;3). •Section 35&hyph;24 of the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual (HCFA Pub. 6).
