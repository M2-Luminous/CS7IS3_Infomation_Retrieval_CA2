FR940916-1-00108 FR940916-1-00016 Section 232.307. This section describes the circumstances that would trigger the requirement to perform a Class 1 train brake system test. FRA proposes to require that a Class 1 brake test be performed at all initial terminal points for that train. FRA defines ``initial terminal point'' for a conventional freight train as (i) that point where the train is originally assembled and (ii) each point where the train is required to have a new Class 1 brake test due to the fact that it has travelled the maximum permissible distance since its last Class 1 brake test. As will be further explained in the discussion of ยง232.309, FRA proposes to eliminate the current 1,000-mile inspection requirement and implement a program that allows trains to travel anywhere from 500 miles to 3,500 miles depending on such factors as the quality of the inspection performed on the train. The 1,000-mile test, like its predecessor the 500-mile test, has failed to live up to its intended role in the power brake safety regime. An increasing number of such tests are conducted by train crews. In some cases locations designated for these tests are on line of haul and not conducive to careful scrutiny of the train braking system. Increasingly, FRA finds that some railroads appear to alter the location of tests to frustrate enforcement. At the same time, little evidence has accumulated to support the proposition that the 1,000-mile test is critical to safety. FRA is aware of statistics offered by the BRC indicating that a large number of ``bad order'' cars have been identified in 1,000-mile inspections conducted at Salt Lake City, Utah and North Platte, Nebraska. FRA recognizes that these statistics argue against the elimination of 1,000-mile inspections. However, FRA believes many of these ``bad orders'' at 1,000-mile inspections were due to problems that should have been uncovered during the initial terminal brake test. FRA proposes to address this problem by requiring minimum qualifications for both train crew members and other employees that perform brake inspections and tests and that these inspections and tests be spot checked by qualified supervisors. Trains inspected by crew members will be limited to 500 miles of travel between Class 1 brake system tests. Only trains initially inspected and tested by qualified brake inspectors will be allowed to travel more than 500 miles between required brake system inspections and tests. Furthermore, many of the problems uncovered at 1,000-mile inspections were not defects under Part 232 and would not have affected the operation of the train brake system. FRA proposes to address these type problems by requiring a mechanical safety inspection as part of the Class 1 brake system test for trains that are to travel more than 500 miles between Class 1 brake system tests. FRA believes these proposed provisions of the new regulations eliminate the need for the 1,000-mile test. Accordingly, FRA believes that reliance should be placed on the more thorough Class 1 test (the functional equivalent of the current initial terminal test) at whatever point a new inspection of the train braking system is required. This section requires that certain records be maintained by a railroad in order for a train to travel in excess of 500 miles. The method for maintaining these records is not specified because FRA believes that each railroad is in the best position to determine the most efficient and accurate method for acquiring and storing the information. However, FRA intends that no matter what method is chosen by a railroad, the required information must be available to FRA upon request in order to allow FRA to monitor train movement and ensure compliance with these proposed regulations. This section also requires that a Class 1 brake test be performed on all cars added to a train that have not yet received a Class 1 brake test and on all cars disconnected from a source of compressed air for longer than four hours. FRA agrees with several commenters that our longstanding administrative interpretation of only allowing cars to be ``off air'' for two hours was established prior to the development of new equipment that has greatly reduced leakage problems. Contrary to several commenters' contentions, FRA does not believe that cars should allowed to be ``off air'' for extended periods without being retested. FRA believes that the longer cars sit without a compressed air supply attached, the greater the chances are that the integrity of the system will be compromised, either by weather conditions or vandalism. FRA believes that four hours is the maximum time that cars should be disconnected from a source of compressed air without compromising safety. Section 232.309. This section details the required tasks comprising a Class 1 brake system test on conventional freight trains. A proper Class 1 brake test ensures that a train is capable of traveling to its destination with minimal problems enroute. Specific tasks of the Class 1 brake test include most of the tasks currently required in initial terminal brake tests with some modification in the interest of standardization. FRA proposes a standardized brake-pipe reduction of 20 psi for all brake inspections and tests. FRA agrees with both labor and management commenters that a standard brake-pipe reduction will simplify train brake tests and will make it easier to train workers. The 20-psi standardized reduction was suggested by both labor and management commenters.
