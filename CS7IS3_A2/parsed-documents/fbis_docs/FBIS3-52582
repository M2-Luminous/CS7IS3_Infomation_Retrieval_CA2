As far as the contents are concerned, Peres said the Cairo understandings will serve as the basis for the continuation of the Taba talks. Minister Peres told our political correspondent Udi Segal that the Palestinians have learned that Israel is serious when it says it will not compromise on security issues and that this is not merely a matter of tactics and bargaining. The foreign minister said that the contacts between Nabil Sha'th and himself lasted for several days because Israel wanted to make it clear to the Palestinians that it is acting cautiously and is not pressed for time. Our political correspondent notes that Israel wants the Taba talks to go on continuously in order to attain quick progress. A short time ago, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin also commented on the resumption of the Taba talks next week. According to Rabin the negotiations, which will be based on the Cairo understandings, are aimed at attaining a detailed agreement on Gaza and Jericho. This morning, Rabin visited the settlement of Na'ama where he met the local residents. Our correspondent in the territories Golan Yokhpaz brought this report from the Allenby Bridge border crossing: [Begin recording] [Yokhpaz] A short time ago, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who is visiting this crossing point, said that the Taba talks will be based mainly on the understandings reached by Israel and the Palestinians in Cairo. The prime minister arrived here accompanied by Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq and, together with other IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers, they visited the settlement of Na'ama in the Jordan Valley. Local settlers have claimed that in the framework of the Jericho autonomy plan, their settlement will turn into an enclave within the Jericho area. Rabin told the settlers that Israel considers the Jordan Valley a security zone because of the area's importance for the country's security. This is what Rabin said regarding the resumption of the Taba talks next week: [Rabin] In Taba we want to reach a detailed, clear, and lucid agreement. In everything relating to Gaza-Jericho First, the talks will be based on the Cairo understandings. If they backtrack.... [pauses] Everything we said hinges on compliance with all the components of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. [end recording] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0900 GMT on 6 January adds: "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that there is no territorial controversy or security problems between Israel and Jordan, but Amman is unwilling to be the first party to sign a peace treaty with Israel. During his visit to Na'ama and the Allenby Bridge, the prime minister also said he is opposed to discussing the permanent agreement at this point, not only because of our commitment to the Madrid conference but also because he is opposed to uprooting settlements and to negotiations on the issue of Jerusalem. Our settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman reports that the prime minister told Na'ama settlers that he understands their grievances, but Israel is interested in solving the conflict with the Palestinians."]
