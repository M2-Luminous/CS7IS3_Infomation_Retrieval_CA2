This is how the president's office has reacted to General Discua's saying he did not know why this type of military service was being proposed if young people do not even want to go to the movies voluntarily. [Begin secretary recording] Any opinion which differs from that of the commission, which will study this issue, will have to be taken to the Bipartite Government-Armed Forces Commission so it can reach an agreement. [end recording] The conflicting statements clearly show, however, at the very minimum there is a lack of clear communication between the heads of the executive branch and Armed Forces. [Begin secretary recording] Especially if they say how the country will stand on an issue which is of general interest, particularly for young people; this is easily resolved, however. [end recording]
