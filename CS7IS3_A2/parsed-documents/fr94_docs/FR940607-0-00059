FR940607-0-00059 FR940607-0-00017 Most of those opposed stated as the basis for their opposition that an increase in the threshold would cause substantial losses for depository institutions, and thereby for the deposit insurance funds. To support this view, commenters generally cited the thrift failures of the 1980s and asserted that an increase in the threshold would lead to the same result. A total of 74 comment letters provided data on loss experience. The institutions providing the data varied in size, and included large regional multi-bank holding companies, as well as small banks. This data is discussed below. For the reasons set forth below, the agencies have decided to raise the threshold from $100,000 to $250,000. Such an increase will benefit consumers and lenders and will not threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions, particularly as an evaluation will be required for all loans exempt under the threshold. Benefits for Consumers and Lenders of an Increase in the Threshold. Many commenters stated that an increase in the threshold would benefit consumers and lenders. Numerous bank and thrift commenters pointed to the cost and time needed in order to obtain an appraisal as an impediment to lending. The appraisal was cited by several commenters as the most important factor causing delay in small business lending, and the cost of the appraisal was described as high, especially for commercial borrowers. Commenters reported that appraisal fees for commercial transactions between $100,000 and $250,000 could cost 5 percent of the loan amount to the borrower. Banks and thrifts also commented that increasing the threshold would reduce regulatory burden associated with making loans below $250,000. Many appraisers, however, commented that appraisal costs have remained relatively steady. Many appraisers also stated that appraisals by certified or licensed appraisers are necessary to protect the consumer. The agencies believe that this assertion mischaracterizes the role of the institution's determination of collateral value in a typical consumer transaction. The regulated institution obtains the appraisal or evaluation as part of its loan underwriting process in order to make certain that it is adequately secured. Any appraisal ordered by a financial institution is not designed, and generally comes too late, to assist the consumer in negotiating a contract price. In a purchase of real estate, the purchase offer is generally made before financing is sought and the financial institution orders an appraisal. Therefore, the appraisal represents an after-the-fact cost. Further, even when a Title XI appraisal is not required, nothing prevents a consumer from independently obtaining an appraisal by a licensed or certified appraiser for the consumer's own use in the negotiating process. Moreover, the agencies' rules require an institution to obtain an appropriate evaluation of the real property collateral for transactions below the threshold, and that evaluation would be available to the consumer. The agencies believe that many of the concerns about consumer protection are addressed under statutory and regulatory programs other than Title XI of FIRREA, which focuses on bank and thrift safety and soundness. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) establishes procedures for lenders to disclose to consumers the charges for a variety of settlement services, including appraisals and evaluations. To comply with the letter and intent of the Board's Regulation B (implementing the Equal Credit Opportunity Act), regulated institutions must either disclose to the borrower the right to receive a copy of the documents the lender uses to value the collateral in an application for a loan secured by a dwelling, regardless of whether the documents constitute a Title XI appraisal or evaluation, or, as a matter of course provide the borrower with the appraisal or evaluation. Thus, to the extent that a borrower benefits from knowing the value the lender places on the property the borrower has contracted to purchase or pledged as collateral, the borrower should be able to benefit from that knowledge whether it is in the form of a Title XI appraisal or an evaluation. Furthermore, although such a disclosure is not required by RESPA, Regulation B, or Title XI, the agencies believe that a regulated institution should advise consumers whether the institution intends to have a licensed or certified appraiser prepare the estimate of value. This should be done early enough in the loan application process to allow the consumer to make an informed decision that the intended method of estimating the real estate's value meets his or her needs. Effects on Safety and Soundness of Financial Institutions. The agencies have concluded that a $250,000 threshold would not threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions. Benefits to Safety and Soundness. The agencies believe that the increase in the threshold will have affirmative benefits for safety and soundness. A decrease in appraisal requirements should relieve regulatory burden for banks and thrifts and thereby improve their competitiveness with non-regulated lenders. Appraisal costs represent a significant expense for certain small loans, making such lending less attractive to a potential borrower or less profitable for the lender. Numerous comments from lenders supported this conclusion. The problem is particularly troubling for lenders in small towns, who must pay a premium for a licensed or certified appraiser to visit the town. A GAO survey of bankers in connection with a study of small business lending revealed that the minimum cost to perform the necessary appraisal on commercial real estate property used as collateral for small business loans was approximately $3,000. 1 See GAO Report GGD&hyph;93&hyph;121, Bank Regulation: Regulatory Impediments to Small Business Lending Should Be Removed (September 1993). 1 The GAO noted that a survey performed by the American Bankers Association reflected a lower average cost. Experience with the $100,000 Threshold. The Board has had a $100,000 threshold in place since August 1990, and the other agencies have had a $100,000 threshold since March or April 1992. The experience of the agencies has demonstrated that the $100,000 threshold has posed no risk to safety and soundness. A survey by each of the agencies of its senior examination staff indicates that over a period of many years, with a few possible exceptions, 2 no bank or thrift has failed or suffered significant losses as a result of appraisal problems with loans under $100,000 or even up to $250,000. Each of the regional representatives of the Board, the FDIC, and the OCC supported adoption of the $250,000 threshold as consistent with safety and soundness. Representatives of the OTS suggested that the threshold should only apply to healthier thrifts. As described below, this concern has been addressed by the agencies in the final regulation. 2 The Central Region of the OTS was the only OTS respondent to identify failures attributable to inadequate appraisal practices. The Central Region identified fewer than six failures over the previous twelve years where appraisal issues for loans under $250,000 were a major contributing factor to a thrift's failure. The Central Region noted that in those failures where inadequate appraisal practices were a problem, other areas of loan underwriting were usually found to be equally deficient. One OCC survey respondent reported that one institution had failed because of residential and commercial loans between $100,000 and $500,000. The respondent noted that the problems occurred before 1987, when the OCC issued guidelines that would have prevented the institution's real estate valuation problems.
