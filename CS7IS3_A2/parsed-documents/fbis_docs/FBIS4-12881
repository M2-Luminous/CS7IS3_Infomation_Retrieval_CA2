He said rumors on this are attempts to sow discord and undermine the government. He said he expected a Lebanese-Syrian summit soon. Answering questions from Editors Association Doyen Milhim Karam, Minister Dallul explained that the investigation into the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church is being handled by the judiciary and is continuing. An indictment is expected soon. [passage omitted] Regarding the issue of Gen. Michel 'Awn, Dallul said French officials have expressed their disappointment with his violation of the agreement that was sponsored by France. He added that the Lebanese Government has not demanded his extradition because Lebanon's problems are much more important than Michel 'Awn. Dallul said the amnesty law contains certain conditions to which Gen. 'Awn must adhere. If 'Awn continues to violate these conditions, the amnesty law will no longer apply to him. [passage omitted]
