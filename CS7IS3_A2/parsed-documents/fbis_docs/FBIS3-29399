The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "the cut was made in consideration of the domestic economy and I think it's an appropriate measure. "It will have a good effect on the European economy as well," the source said. The Bundesbank announced it will reduce the discount rate to 5.25 percent from 5.75 percent, effective Friday, while leaving the Lombard emergency financing rate unchanged at 6.75 percent. The move will have "no particular impact on Japan's financial policy," the source added.
