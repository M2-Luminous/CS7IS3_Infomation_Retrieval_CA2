The Haitian Ministry of Information reported that the agreement, signed on 27 May in Italy by the Holy See and representatives of the acting Haitian Government, establishes that the Holy See will deliver 75,000 tons of wheat worth $32 million. A communique issued by the Ministry of Information states that "the acting president (Jonassaint), on behalf of the people of Haiti, who have been subjected to a criminal and unjustified blockade, thanks the Vatican and Pope John Paul II for their understanding and growing concern." According to diplomatic sources in Port-au-Prince, this agreement recognizes the Haitian regime, installed following a coup d'etat that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a priest, on 30 September 1990. The Vatican approved the removal of Father Aristide from the Salesian Order shortly before he assumed office "for inciting violence and class struggle." In 1992, the Vatican recognized Joseph Nerette's acting government (without international recognition). The Haitian clergy is experiencing serious division between its hierarchy and some of its rank and file, who are members of the "Ti Iglesia" and faithful to Aristide. On 7 January 1991, during a foiled coup attempt led by former "Tonton Macoute" leader Roger Lafontant, alleged followers of Aristide burned the Apostolic Nunciature and humiliated the nuncio. The Catholic Church hierarchy in Haiti has issued periodic condemnations of the embargo decreed to force Haiti to return Aristide to power because it believes the sanctions represent much suffering for the Haitian people.
