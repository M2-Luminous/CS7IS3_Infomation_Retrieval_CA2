"The car was stopped around 5.30 p.m. by armed gunmen, they were taken out of the car and ordered into the bush," an embassy official said. The taxi driver was then ordered to drive on, he said. The three, who were only identified as a male and female from Britain and a woman from Australia, were abducted near Sre Ambel about 130 kilometers (75 miles) south of the capital, the official said. The embassy official refused to call the incident a kidnapping. "No ransom has been demanded and there is no reason to believe one will be," he said. A local police officer told AFP by telephone that he believed the Khmer Rouge were responsible. "If it was government soldiers they would just ask for money or cigarettes," the officer said. The embassy official said two of the three abducted were residents here and one was a tourist. [passage omitted]
