A maritime route, the Portuguese coast has been used systematically, for cocaine and hashish trafficking in particular. However, this is not a passive participation. The major drug trafficking networks, controlled mainly by Galicians, but also by Italians and Netherlanders, have their accomplices here. Only in this way can their activities succeed. The trafficking routes still remain effective, and nothing is left to spontaneity or improvisation: The traffickers have human accomplices and warehouses; they know roads that bypass potential checkpoints; and they have contracts signed for boats providing transportation. For months, PUBLICO attempted to reconstruct many of those routes, and to assess the Portuguese component in this business. The results are surprising. At least, it can never again be claimed that Portugal has been relegated to a passive role in the international drug traffic. J. works for everyone, provided that they come suitably "recommended." From Sito Minanco and Laureano Oubina to Andelo Casas, who, two months ago, escaped from the Braga penitentiary (he sawed the bars), any Galician drug dealer known on the market can use the "passageway" in the central Portuguese city where J. is established. With good contacts in the ex-Customs Guard [GF] and the Maritime Police, J. prepares for the landings after clearing an area adjoining some naval shipyards. The "uniformed ones" close their eyes on the sand bar, at their posts, and on the surveillance motor boat, also guaranteeing "protection" for the landing. Even the guard at the shipyards himself closes his eyes, when he is paid a lump sum of 20 contos. However, J. not only guarantees the landing, but also provides warehouses for storing hashish and tobacco (cocaine is less common, but not excluded from the business). Furthermore, he ensures transportation to Spain on light trucks with refrigerated bodies. J.'s system is to some extent repeated along the entire Portuguese coast. Minho is everyone's territory: a kind of free trade zone for the groups that have increased since the annihilation of some of the oldest Galician "families" in Operation Necora. In the district of Viana do Castelo, all the groups in the territory have good contacts. The Viana do Castelo mountain ridge, an area controlled by a sergeant from the defunct Customs Guard, is a site used as an alternative to other landing points, especially Belinhos, in Esposende, when the sea is choppy. In Belinhos, where the GF post was deactivated, the landings occur often, because it is considered one of the safest sites on the Portuguese coast. Here, too, protection is guaranteed by members of the paramilitary forces, who bar the access roads, order the movement of vehicles parked in the area (lovers, those spying on them, etc.), and monitor the landing operation from a distance. The boxes (of hashish, cocaine, and tobacco) are unloaded, and then continue their journey on light trucks along municipal road 1794, or on other alternative dirt roads adjoining the area's small farming establishments. All of this is well disguised, and follows strict timetables. The "product" is delivered to the purchaser in Spain, with its safe passage guaranteed at the border in Valenca, Moncao, or some other border locality where the contacts are more than plentiful. On the Customs Guard Motor Boats One of the most sophisticated systems has been adopted on a beach north of Mondego. Next to a shipyard, they unload hashish, cocaine, and tobacco that the paramilitary forces' motor boats will search for on the so-called "mother ship," at anchor two miles from the sand bar. There could be no better protection. The system is totally controlled by members of the paramilitary forces stationed in the area. PUBLICO is in a position to claim that these incidents described are not isolated. The groups guaranteeing the reception of drugs and tobacco and their transportation to Spain are organized along the Portuguese coast, which is divided into areas of influence. Nearly all their members are former maritime smuggling bosses who have started working for the Spanish purchasers of large volumes of hashish and cocaine in Morocco and South America. They have vessels at their disposal, cheap labor, warehouses for storing the drugs, light trucks for carrying them to Spain, and protection given by members of the paramilitary forces: all just as it was in the "old" contraband. One of the differences from the past lies in the sophistication of the methods. And it is not merely that of speedboats, which were all the rage in the late 1980's, but are less often used now. On a site located north of Douro, one of the most active groups in the landing business has a radar system, installed in a residence, which covers a distance of 25 miles. Of course, it is accompanied by very powerful communications equipment that facilitates the monitoring of the operations on board, also affording great accuracy in logging the date, time, and conditions of the landing. Once they are on land, the drugs are transported to Spain, using a dozen alternate routes. From Minho to Algarve There are routes and systems leading down from Minho to the Alentejo and Algarve coast which, during recent months, have been given preference by Spanish and Portuguese drug traffickers because they have seas and shores with little surveillance. The presence of the Italian "Mafioso," Emilio di Giovinni, in Algarve, as well as in southern Spain, between 1991 and 1992, prompted an increase in the landings in this area. An importer of hashish and owner of a production farm in Morocco, with entry into Italy ensured by contacts that he had in Calabria, Giovinni activated the southern part of the peninsula, which began acquiring a kind of "new market" in this Italian. Up until that time, the Spaniards, some of whom had good partners in Portugal, with names that remain a mystery, were almost the only large purchasers operating. The Alentejo coast (over 50 km of beaches and small coves with few or no visitors and without surveillance) has been in great demand by traffickers during recent years. This is, moreover, quite obvious in cases reported among the population of small fishing communities. In Rogil, a village south of Odeceixe, a fisherman who recently committed suicide following an emotional episode had several tens of thousands of contos in a bank. This was an abnormal situation, considering the income that his occupational activity earned him, and the lack of any inheritance. The explanation was discovered by the police: he had been retrieving packages of hashish and cocaine left at marked fishing floats, and later delivering them to a contact in Faro. Early this year, also near Odeceixe, in Azenhas do Mar, a fisherman was arrested with 700 grams of hashish in his house. The amount of drugs in C.'s possession was not large, but the volume of information held by the police on his landing activities was considerable. C. was one of the main contacts for recruiting unloaders or enlisting boats to receive the product on the high seas, in the Odemira area. However, there were also indications of his involvement in drug distribution following the temporary "storage" of large amounts of hashish and other smaller quantities of cocaine, which he was selling directly. A few weeks before his arrest, he had offered 20,000 contos in "cold" cash to a friend, to give up "that life." Now he is to be tried, and will hardly escape a stiff sentence. In the fishing communities of Vila do Bispo, Odeceixe, Azenhas do Mar, Milfontes, Porto Covo, and Sines, it is now difficult to evade this reality: the landings yield far more than fishing does. A local merchant confided: "The gang comes here on some winter nights, wearing rubber boots and all bundled up; and I know they aren't going fishing." People hereabouts have always made their living from smuggling tobacco, "until one day, the boxes began to be heavier." This comment was made by a fisherman, indicating the shift from tobacco to drugs. Everyone is aware of this, but no one is willing to discuss the subject. There are stories without names or faces. At one particular juncture, the activity was so appealing, enjoying impunity, that some recall "certain incidents" involving persons known to them who suffered "accidents" for trying to enter the business on their own, in defiance of the groups established in the territory for a long time. They cite an episode that occurred over five years ago, involving a "buddy" who showed up in a deserted area with his legs broken and his face "turned into pulp." He reportedly tried to "go it alone with the landings." On the Alentejo coast, as in Minho or Algarve, certain small fortunes appear and disappear as if miraculously. In some localities fortunes, always owned by the same persons, are known to have been converted into real estate and land, and lost through the vice of card-playing. A few months later, the rumor of certain businessmen going bankrupt is dispelled, because they begin showing new outward signs of wealth. Alentejo Summit On the night of 18 August 1992, the heat was stifling, both at the Luz Stadium, where the Benfica team was facing Real Madrid in a game preparing for the new season, and at the Monte Mouro nightclub near Odeceixe. At the stadium, Portuguese and Spanish policemen were embroiled in old Iberian soccer rivalries, after a lengthy work session to prepare for the seizure of 3 tons of hashish. At the nightclub, a "summit" meeting was being held by traffickers attempting to reach an understanding on this business of the 3 tons of hashish, owing to problems that arose with the contacts for Spain, after the landing. They had to determine who was the middleman for that country, and the purchaser (there were several interested parties, with different middlemen). The drugs ended up not reaching Spain, and were intercepted at Vila Verde, following a police operation in which one of the traffickers was killed. But this "summit" involved another fundamental issue: the reorganization of the maneuvering space for the traffickers "on the periphery" of the major groups operating in the area, to prevent wars between them. The south, because it had little surveillance, would gain ground in comparison with the Minho coast, where both the Portuguese and Spaniards had reinforced their surveillance. PUBLICO has learned that the penetration of Portugal's air space and sea by Spanish police surveillance aircraft and ships, because they consider the national patrolling inadequate, is a fact known to the Portuguese police authorities. The "aviocars" and vessels regularly heading down to the vicinity of the Mondego Basin or entering by way of the Algarve coast belong to the Customs Surveillance Services. Some results emerged from the "summit" in terms of reorganizing the contacts through middlemen between the landing groups and the Spanish purchasers. An investigator specializing in information gathering told PUBLICO: "It was essential for them (the traffickers) to find out who was talking to whom, because there was much confusion there, and suspicions between them." The Minho Clan The territory in Minho has belonged to the Viriatos clan. Jose Manuel Alonso dos Santos and Antonio Alonso dos Santos are two brothers to whom the police have attributed the status of the most powerful group in the north moving illicit merchandise. It ranges from tobacco to drugs, received in Portuguese waters and destined for Spain. Jose Alonso has a permanent residence in La Guardia, and his brother, Antonio, in Caminha: houses almost in view of one another, although located in different countries. Separating them is only the Minho River, an old smugglers' route, every bend in which is familiar to the Viriatos brothers. In 1991, however, life did not go well for them. During that year, they agreed to work with the Spaniards, Francisco Javier Oubina Pinero, Ramon Buballo Martinez, and Jose Constante Pinero Bua, all from Cambados, in the Pontevedra district. They proposed to import hashish from Morocco. The Viriatos were to ensure the transport by sea and the reception, jointly with the Spaniard, Jose Casas Andelo. For this purpose they had a trawler, registered in Nazare, and owned by Jose Manuel Alonso. Since it had already become well known to the authorities for having made other landings, particularly of tobacco, its former name of Fe was changed to Joi. The business (the continued hashish dealing activity) fared badly, because the boat was apparently jinxed. It was damaged on several occasions, and ended up being seized with 2,200 kg of hashish on the high seas at Vila Real de Santo Antonio. The Alonso brothers were arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison. After their capture, other groups emerged in Valenca, Moncao, Cerveira, and Caminha, ensuring the transportation and "protection" of the merchandise on its passage to Spain. They have good contacts in the Customs Guard and the Civil Guard in Tuy, Porrino, Pontevedra, Valenca, and Moncao. Most of these groups have been engaged in contraband for decades, and are familiar with all the historical figures linked with this criminal activity in Galicia. Virtually all of them find a way of camouflaging their real activities with businesses connected to the hotel sector or night life. They have coffee shops, bars, and restaurants useful to them for making contacts; but also strong logistical support structures, such as light trucks, cars with good cylinder capacity, houses, and storage places, on both sides of the border. Inside the grounds of one of their houses, PUBLICO saw, on one evening, five luxury vehicles, as well as two jeeps and a light truck with an open chassis, also a four-wheel drive type. We were later able to confirm that all of them belonged to the same family. The Kingdom of Peniche In central Portugal there are several options for landings which, as a rule, are controlled by a powerful group in Peniche. It has a long-standing complicity (dating from the tobacco times) among agents assigned to the local Customs Guard post. According to the DEA (an agency specializing in combating the drug traffic) report sent to the Spanish police in 1989, Peniche had, for many years, been a strategic locality for the Galician drug trafficker, Laureano Oubina, and for his presumable Portuguese "partner," mentioned in the document, Eduardo Maria dos Santos. Owner of Edumar--Shipping Agents, a company that ceased its activity in 1991, Eduardo Maria dos Santos is a businessman in the fishing sector, with headquarters in Peniche and Lisbon. The U.S. police, and later the Portuguese, identified Eduardo Maria dos Santos as a representative of Laureano Oubina, and Edumar as a kind of support facility for repairs to speedboats belonging to the Galician trafficker. The vessels were detected in cocaine landings made on the northern coast. South Divided Southern Portugal is a good example of the country's division by the Portuguese trafficking groups, and of how they have developed their business with the powerful clans of Galicia and even in Latin America. The coast extending from Vila Real de Santo Antonio to Setubal is controlled by three stronger groups, with headquarters in Setubal and Vila do Bispo. They have close contacts with other peripheral organizations in Portimao, Faro, and Sines. The activity of their principal members has long been documented by national and foreign police, given the major dimensions of the contacts that they maintain. The latter exist, specifically, with the Galician group headed by Laureano Oubina (now under arrest in Spain), and with some South American cocaine producers. Fishing boats have been operating in the service of the three groups, with emphasis on a trawler that has had its name changed several times. A few years ago, it was registered in Cascais in the name of Jose Manuel Viegas. During 1992 alone, the vessel, with the name Estrela do Mar, was mentioned in three hashish landings, until its seizure in northern Portugal with a shipment totaling several tons. Some of the preeminent figures in the south were mentioned in prior investigations by the Portuguese and Spanish police, as well as the DEA . In 1989, the Americans sent a report to the Spanish police identifying Vital Nunes de Carvalho, a former local government official in Vila do Bispo, elected by the PCP [Portuguese Communist Party], as one of Oubina's contacts in Portugal. At the time, Nunes de Carvalho denied any involvement with Spanish drug traffickers or with the former owner of the Estrela do Mar, Jose Manuel Viegas, nicknamed "Grego." The latter was also a defendant in the contraband proceedings relating to what is known as the Setubal Connection. The main defendant in those proceedings was Jose Ribeiro, identified as one of the historical figures in contraband, on a par with the "Serafins" clan, currently being tried in Aveiro for involvement in the network running the tobacco and whiskey trade there. Viegas maintains economic interests in Algarve, where he owns several hotel enterprises, including the hotel at Salema beach (he even has a partnership with the Sporting establishment president, Sousa Cintra, according to Spanish police documents). He was also owner of the vessel, Micheline, seized by the Maritime Police in 1979 during an unloading of contraband.
