The true motivation behind the 20-fold indexation of the most important banking standard is not apparent either to the overwhelming majority of bankers or to Central Bank personnel themselves, although from the official point of view the actions of the Central Bank constitute a normal step on the path to achieving convergence of the Russian monetary system with international standards. These include: mandatory increase of the minimum amount of authorized capital to 5 million ECU ($5.6 million) by 1 January 1999; registration of new banks, effective 1 March 1994, with minimum amount of capital not less than 1 million ECU; and establishment of the norm for including material assets (building, equipment, etc.) within authorized capital--their share must not exceed 20 percent during the first year of the bank's operation, and cannot be less than 10 percent subsequently. All these measures are directed, in the words of Dmitriy Tulin, deputy chairman of the Central Bank, towards "enhancing the responsibility of banks for services afforded" and overcoming "the absurd situation existing when it is easier to open up a commercial bank than a booth." According to data as of 1 January 1994, 28 banks had ownership capital amounting to more than R5 billion; that of 138 banks ranged from R1 to R5 billion. Thus, not more than 7 percent of all Russian banks have any real prospect of falling within the norm established in accordance with recommendations of the European Community. With a more stringent valuation of fixed capital (factoring out translation gain/loss and undistributed profits, for example), their number is limited to just 100. The overwhelming majority of banks (about 1,500) have capital ranging from R100 million to R1 billion, and 272 of them--less than R100 million overall. The flea-sized dimensions of many banks reflect the fact of the shortage of capital, so deplorable for the Russian economy, while the main problem in the poor quality of banking services is still the consequence of unmanageability of the banking system on the part of the Central Bank. This unmanageability is explained primarily through appreciable criminalization of the most profitable sector of the economy today, and therefore the indexation of capital in and of itself will not force banks that are violating legislation to alter their behavior. Nevertheless, the increase in minimum amount of bank capital could be characterized as a first step of the Central Bank to improve the banking system if it is incapable of taking other, more radical steps, or if these are impossible by virtue of the system's high propensity for crime. However, another decision of Viktor Gerashchenko adopted several days earlier--on the virtual reconstruction of a very large special bank in the form of "the holding company Promstroybank"--is somehow too closely related to his telegram of yesterday to appear coincidental. If this theory is confirmed, then the resoluteness with which Mr. Gerashchenko is pursuing European standards will indeed rid the newborn special institutions of tiny competitors, and will rid Russia--not suffering from an overaccumulation of capital as things are--of 95 percent of its banks.
