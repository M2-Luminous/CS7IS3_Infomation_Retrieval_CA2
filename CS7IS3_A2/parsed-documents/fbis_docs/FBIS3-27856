The new program will be an expanded version of the program put forth in 1992 by the administration of then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to make Japan a "lifestyle superpower," the sources said. Hosokawa's new plan will include an increase to the 430 trillion yen in public works spending over ten years promised by Tokyo in 1990 to the United States during the bilateral structural impediments initiative (SII) talks. The new scheme will also contain an actual spending list for enhancing the infrastructure, such as housing, parks, and telecommunications, they said. Hosokawa will seek advice on the program from the economic council for compilation by the end of the year, they said. By telling President Bill Clinton about the new plan in their summit meeting on February 11, Hosokawa hopes to induce an expression of appreciation from the U.S. on Japan's efforts to boost its domestic demand and thereby slash its mammoth trade surplus. Hosokawa is also expected to present to Clinton the government's new economic stimulus package that will include 5 to 6 trillion yen worth of income and residence tax cuts. Washington, in apparent frustration about the lack of progress in the current bilateral "framework" trade talks, successor to the SII talks, has been urging Japan to inject a strong and sustainable stimulus into the feeble economy. Japan has vowed to reach market opening agreements in several priority sectors, such as autos, by the February summit. U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said during his recent visit to Tokyo, "If we do not have credible agreements by the time of the summit, we would have to reexamine the basis of the framework ... we will not settle for any cosmetic agreement." The Miyazawa program stipulated measures to enhance living standards, spelling out such goals as lowering the prices of houses and condominiums down to five times a salaried worker's annual income, and shortening an employee's annual working hours to 1,800 or below. Hosokawa originally intended to inherit the Miyazawa plan, but changed his mind after his success in political reform raised the chances of a long tenure, the sources said. The Hosokawa administration already received a call from a blue-ribbon advisory council to increase the government's public works expenditures. In line with the November recommendations of the advisory group for economic restructuring, last November, Hosokawa's new economic program will contain steps to promote deregulation, a review on taxation and insurance systems in light of the aging population, and assistance to farmers following Japan's acceptance of the partial opening of the rice market. The measures spelled out in the premier's "vision for the 21st century," which he announced at the start of this year, will also be incorporated into the plan. In the "vision," Hosokawa called for lowering housing costs by one third and tripling the per-capita park area.
