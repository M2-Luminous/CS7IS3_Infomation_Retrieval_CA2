What Japan agreed to do in the phone trade talks is not anything like a "government guarantee," said the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, who declined to be identified. The comment came in response to remarks by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on Saturday's settlement of a dispute involving Motorola Inc. and Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) over the U.S. company's access to the Japanese cellular phone market. Referring to part of the accord that says Tokyo will take "all available measures to ensure compliance with the commitments" undertaken by IDO, Kantor said the expression "validates the result-oriented approach" Washington wants in the future. The MITI official said Japan cannot accept an interpretation that would lead to the setting of "numerical targets," an idea Tokyo has adamantly turned down in its trade talks with the United States. MITI fears that the difference of interpretation between the two countries over the wording in question might develop into another source of bilateral contention, the official said. Under the private-level agreement between IDO and Motorola that was reached before the governmental accord, the Japanese cellular phone company promised to open 159 new relay stations for Motorola-format phones.
