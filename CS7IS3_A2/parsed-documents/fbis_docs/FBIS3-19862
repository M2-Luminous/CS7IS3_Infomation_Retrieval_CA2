Both consider it necessary to have the closest possible contact with their Russian counterparts. Bonn does not expect a smooth development concerning the major power in the East which is split socially and destroyed economically, but which wants to become a superpower again. Thus, Bonn does not want to miss any opportunity to exert influence as long as possible. For this reason, the foreign minister is again visiting his Russian counterpart in Moscow -- to accelerate the lengthy talks on the return of cultural goods, for example, but, above all, to continue the dialogue on security in Europe. Two tendencies are beginning to emerge -- a reassuring and an alarming one. On the one hand, it seems possible to transform relations between Germany and Russia into normal bilateral relations. On the other, however, Russian and Western interests seem to diverge. According to U.S. ideas, Russia should be a partner, but it might also develop into an unpredictable competitor. In fact, Kozyrev is considered a Western-oriented man. Yet if one analyzes his statements about Moscow's role in Europe and the world, they reveal a new imperialist claim. Thus, Bonn also wavers between hope and fear when the few reformers that Yeltsin still has spell out what they understand by "strategic partnership" (Kozyrev) with the United States and collective security in Europe. It is now the task of German foreign policy to avoid setting the wrong course. The close personal contact with the rulers in Moscow is advisable for Bonn because the diplomatic development between the two capitals is not free of friction. The Russian ambassador to Bonn, Vladislav Terekhov, was Soviet ambassador before the fall of the Wall. At the beginning of the coup against Gorbachev, he came to the Chancellor's Office to announce the names of the new partners in the Kremlin. He must know a great deal to survive for such a long time in his position in Bonn, members of the diplomatic corps have pointed out. Recently, Terekhov has again been behaving in a way that made Bonn officials believe that they have missed another coup. The following may serve as an example: Those who doubt that the Baltic republics belong to Russia are told by the Russian ambassador that this region has been part of Russia for 250 years and that it is nobody's business when the troops withdraw. The smooth withdrawal of the Russian soldiers from Berlin and East Germany is an absolutely positive result of the new relationship between Bonn and Moscow. Chancellor Kohl ensures that the withdrawal of the Red Army, which advanced as far as Central Europe under Stalin, is taking place without any humiliation. One can only hope that justice will also be done to the Western Allies who were the protectors and not the occupiers of Berlin. Attentiveness vis-a-vis the East requires an explanation to the West if it is not to be misunderstood. For Germany, Russia is a major power that must be integrated in a new system of European security and whose isolation should be prevented. Bonn also shows understanding that such a big country does not want to be treated in the same way as smaller states from its former sphere of influence. However, Russia's ideas about the future balance, which seem harmless at first sight, conceal Moscow's hegemonial claims. The Russians want NATO to be subordinated to the seemingly dead CSCE. The Western alliance could then ensure order in its sphere of influence, and Russia could do the same in the CIS states. In fact, the West also believes that Russian soldiers should end the bloodshed in the Caucasus. Yet NATO does not want to give them a permanent mandate or a blank check. Russian troops should only be allowed to refer to the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris upon the wish of all parties to the conflict. The West believes that everything else would be assistance in reawakening the former Soviet Union. However, there is no longer any place for "vital spheres of interest" in Europe, as claimed by Moscow, after the fundamental changes that have taken place. Thus, the "Partnership for Peace" must not be the final response to the desires of the reform states in Central and East Europe for security under NATO cover. Moscow has intensively looked to Bonn for some time because only Germany has provided substantive financial aid so far. At the moment, the Russians are focusing on the United States. They can only be confirmed as a world power by the United States. After all, their determined attitude vis-a-vis Bosnia and the fear of being humiliated by NATO and the United States led to the cease-fire of Sarajevo without air strikes. For Bonn, Moscow is a Janus-faced partner. Should it look to the future? Or should it look back in anger? It is going in both directions at the same time.
