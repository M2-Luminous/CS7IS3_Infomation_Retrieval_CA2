More details now with Herve de Haro from Cherbourg: [Haro] Le Triomphant is a high-tech marvel. With a displacement of 12,640 tons and a length of 138 meters, it is much larger than its predecessors. It is faster too and should also be extremely quiet, one of the quietest in the world -- it could even be called a stealth submarine. Its propeller is classified top secret and protected from preying eyes and to make it even more silent. Le Triomphant is now in its natural element. It will sail in a few months time for its first sea trials. The first concern of the DCN [Direction of Navy Shipbuilding] is to monitor all noise made by the equipment on board the submarine. It will be recorded and analyzed.
