It was a kind of time-out taken by the sides in view of the first break in their work. And there is some consulting to be done. All the contradictions were on display at the general sitting -- not only the established ones, but those that were vigorously developing in the course of the negotiating period prior to the opening of the session. As is known, at the very start of the process the moderate conservative deputies' majority had the chance to organize its faction properly. It was to comprise Zyuganovist Communists, supporters of Travkin, Agrarians, and, perhaps, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, women, and the part of the body of deputies that chooses to be nonfactional. This kind of majority would have been able not only to block any initiatives by "Russia's Choice," but also to implement its own. But the alliance did not come about. Instead the four biggest factions -- the Russian Federation Communist Party, the Agrarian Party of Russia, Russia's Choice, and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia -- sat down to negotiate the allotment of spheres of influence in the Duma. At first glance this is inexplicable. The position of Zyuganov and Lapshin enabled them to manage without any negotiations, while Gaydar and Zhirinovskiy had always appeared to them to be the least desirable partners (simply odious to them). Actually, it was the quadripartite negotiations that made the Communists' and Agrarians' potential allies ill-disposed toward them. What made the conservatives commit such a fatal error? We have learned from reliable sources that information has filtered down to the Duma from circles close to the president that the four major factions will be authorized to participate not only in the formation of the presidium and the committees but also in the reorganization of the Cabinet of Ministers. If this is to be believed, then it is clear what kind of bait the Communists and Agrarians have taken. Actually, their ideological inspiration -- V.I. Lenin -- taught that opportunism would bring no dividends and that no one would voluntarily share power. So they have themselves to blame. The quadripartite negotiations broke down, of course. "Choice" never really made any secret of the fact that its true aim was not to join Zyuganov and Zhirinovskiy in allotting spheres of influence but to prevent them from exercising influence on the Duma. The sole result of the roundtable was that all four big factions were cut off from their potential allies -- the small factions and independent deputies. Now the former are obviously gravitating toward an alliance with Shakhray, whose hopes of getting the speaker's chair have therefore now undergone a revival. Now, that is the problem: even if something turns up for themm, this alliance will not have even a relative majority without the Communists and Agrarians, but will merely be the fifth large faction. The former will try, of course, in the very near future to return to the original idea of creating a moderate conservative majority faction. Except that the old confidence they used to command will no longer be there. Things have moved on, so to speak. It is true that Russia's Choice, as a member of the "big four," is also isolated from its potential allies in the reformist camp -- the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin, and the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms. But its leaders hardly had any illusions on this score before. Their complaints about a lack of unity among the democrats are clearly a pretense, except perhaps in the case of S. Kovalev, who is far removed from the larger political arena. Even during the election campaign they knew that this unity would not exist, and they are merely seeking to shift their share of the responsibility for this onto the remaining democrats. Their real objective, at least at the present state, is not to create a united democratic front but to prevent any of their opponents (be they left-wing or right-wing) from forming a Duma majority. This was the aim behind their demand for the minimum size of deputies' group necessary for registration to be as small as possible. This would have made it possible to break up the body of deputies into a multitude of small groupings and "drown the Duma's work in verbal diarrhea," as N. Travkin put it in his own inimitable manner. These tactics have already been dubbed "chaos management" by our political scientists. One of the Russia's Choice leaders, Sergey Yushenkov, was blatantly demonstrating them at his recent press conference.
