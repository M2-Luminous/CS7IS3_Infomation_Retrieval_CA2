FR941206-0-00131 FR941206-0-00018 A trip limit is defined at 50 CFR 663.2 as the total allowable amount of a groundfish species or species complex by weight, or by percentage of weight of fish on board, that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed from a single fishing trip. Trip limits may limit the amount of fish that a vessel may legally land per fishing trip or cumulatively per unit of time, or the number of landings that may be made by a vessel in a given period of time. A daily trip limit is the maximum amount that may be taken and retained, possessed or landed per vessel in 24 consecutive hours, starting at 0001 hours local time. Only one landing of groundfish may be made in that 24-hour period. A cumulative trip limit is the maximum amount that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel in a specified period of time, without a limit on the number of landings or trips. Cumulative trip limits for 1994 apply to calendar months. Background Sablefish: The 1994 sablefish harvest guideline of 7,000 metric tons (mt) north of 36 ○00 ’ N. lat. is divided among several fishing groups (59 FR 685; January 6, 1994). After subtracting 300 mt for the Washington coastal treaty Indian tribes, the remaining 6,700 mt is allocated 6,070 mt for the limited entry fishery and 630 mt for the open access fishery. The limited entry allocation is further subdivided 3,520 mt (58 percent) for the trawl fishery and 2,550 mt (42 percent) for the nontrawl fishery. At the Council's October 1994 meeting, review of the best available information on sablefish catches indicated that, at current catch rates, the limited entry allocation for the trawl fishery would be reached by November 4, and if not curtailed, would be exceeded by about 529 mt, or 15 percent, by the end of 1994. By October 8, 1994, the nontrawl limited entry fishery had already exceeded its allocation by 681 mt, or 27 percent. The open access sablefish fishery has not reached its allocation, 630 mt, and is not likely to before the end of 1994. Nevertheless, the overall harvest guideline north of 36 ○00 ’ N. lat. has already been reached and is projected to be exceeded by about 9 percent in 1994 if landings are not curtailed. To keep landings from further exceeding the harvest guideline in 1994, the Council recommended closure of the commercial sablefish fishery north of 36 ○00 ’ N. lat. for the remainder of the year, beginning December 1, 1994. NMFS agrees with the Council's recommendation, and is implementing a closure by setting the trip limit for sablefish at zero for all commercial gear types north of 36 ○00 ’ N. lat. Although closure of the entire sablefish fishery results in closure of the open access fishery for sablefish as well, it was considered necessary to prevent the transfer of effort from the limited entry fishery, which could result in the open access allocation quickly being reached and the harvest guideline being further exceeded. Even with the closure in December, the 1994 harvest guideline for sablefish will be exceeded by an estimated 4.7 percent. Since the 1994 sablefish harvest guideline does not apply to the area south of 36 ○00 ’ N. lat., that area remains open to sablefish fishing under existing trip limits. Those are 350 lb (159 kg) daily for limited entry nontrawl and open access fisheries, and for the limited entry trawl fishery, 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) cumulative per month, with a per-trip limit of no more than 1,000 lb (454 kg) or 33.333 percent of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole, whichever is greater. Limited Entry Trawl Fishery_Dover Sole and Thornyhead Trip Limits In the limited entry trawl fishery, Dover sole, thornyheads, and sablefish are managed collectively as the ``DTS complex,'' because they are unavoidably caught together. If the trawl trip limits for Dover sole and thornyheads are not reduced to minimal levels, substantial amounts of sablefish are likely to be caught and discarded. In order to minimize the incidental catch and wastage of sablefish in the trawl fishery for Dover sole and thornyheads after the retention of sablefish is prohibited, the Council also recommended reductions in the trip limits for these species. NMFS agrees with this recommendation. The Dover sole cumulative monthly trip limit is reduced from 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) to 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) and the cumulative monthly trip limit for thornyheads is reduced from 8,000 lb (3,629 kg) to 1,500 lb (680 kg) beginning December 1, 1994. Because sablefish cannot be landed, the cumulative limit for the DTS complex, which was designed primarily to protect sablefish, is no longer needed and will no longer apply north of 36 ○00 ’ N. lat. At the Council's October 1994 meeting, the best available data suggested that, at then-current rates, 58 percent of the coastwide harvest guideline for Dover sole (16,900 mt) would be utilized (9,854 mt), and the harvest guideline for thornyheads (7,000 mt) would be reached near December 15, 1994, with about a 2 percent overage by the end of the year. These trip limit reductions will exacerbate the failure to achieve the harvest guideline for Dover sole, but may keep landings within the harvest guideline for thornyheads.
