FR940725-0-00141 FR940725-0-00019 2. §1915.12 Precaution Before Entering Spaces. OSHA has made several significant changes to §1915.12. First, OSHA has reformatted this section to address more appropriately the order of atmospheric testing to be conducted by competent persons when determining hazards within confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres prior to employee entry. Second, OSHA has raised the minimum level of oxygen for entry and addressed oxygen-enriched atmospheres in this section. Third, the Agency has specified when and under what conditions an employee may enter a space that has been found ``not safe for workers.'' Finally, OSHA has added new paragraphs to this section to address: (1) The training of individuals who enter dangerous and confined spaces (paragraph (d)), (2) rescue teams (paragraph (e)), and (3) the exchange of hazard information between employers (paragraph (f)). OSHA is also making the requirement to visually inspect each space explicit in this final standard. In the NPRM, comments were solicited on whether the shipyard competent person should be required to conduct a physical examination of the tank and pipelines when making an inspection. Many commenters supported OSHA's decision (Ex. 6&hyph;4, 6&hyph;10, 6&hyph;12, 6&hyph;13, 6&hyph;15, 6&hyph;18, 6&hyph;24, 6&hyph;28, 6&hyph;31, 6&hyph;33, 6&hyph;34). For example, NFPA (Ex. 6&hyph;10) stated: NFPA strongly supports the inclusion of a requirement that in addition to atmospheric testing the shipyard competent person should also be required to conduct a physical examination of the space and associated pipelines. NFPA 306, 2&hyph;1 requires the Marine Chemist to conduct a physical inspection and to conduct test within the space. For high flash point, low vapor pressure products such as diesel, a test for flammable or combustible vapors is not sufficient, since at atmospheric temperatures there are not enough vapors being evolved for the combustible gas indicator to detect. It is essential that physical inspections be conducted. OSHA has decided that a visual inspection is a crucial element in ascertaining that confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres are safe for entrants. Based on the visual inspection and other information available to the employer about non-atmospheric hazards, the employer is required to take specific actions as required by other subparts. For example, precautions to be taken for electrical hazards are covered by §1915.181 (shipboard) and §1910.147 (shipboard) and machinery is addressed by §1915.164 (for vessels) and §1910.212 (land-side). In paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of final §1915.12, OSHA is requiring atmospheres to be tested for oxygen content first, flammability second, and toxicity third. The format of the previous standard implied that atmospheres be tested for flammability first, toxicity second, and oxygen deficiency third. Even before the revision of Subpart B was proposed, Newport News Shipbuilding and Harbor Testing Laboratory commented that the proper sequence is testing for oxygen, then flammability, then toxicity (53 FR 48096). To address this problem, OSHA proposed to present the testing requirements in the proper sequence. However, as noted in the NPRM, the proposed rule would not have required testing in any particular order. OSHA believes that it is important for atmospheric testing to be conducted in the proper sequence. The Agency reached the same conclusion in the rulemaking on §1910.146, which adopted a rule requiring atmospheric testing in the correct order in that final rule, for the following reasons: A test for oxygen must be performed first because most combustible gas meters are oxygen dependent and will not provide reliable readings in an oxygen deficient atmosphere. In fact, the Johnson Wax Company (Ex. 14&hyph;222) stated that ``there is [a] specific (sensor dependent) oxygen level below which the combustible gas sensor will not respond at all [emphasis was supplied in original].'' Combustible gases are tested for next because the threat of fire or explosion is both more immediate and more life threatening, in most cases, than exposure to toxic gases. [53 FR 48096] This reasoning applies to the revision of Subpart B as well. Atmospheric testing in confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres in shipyards is basically the same as atmospheric testing in general industry permit spaces. Therefore, the revision of §1915.12 requires shipyard employers to perform atmospheric testing in the following sequence: oxygen content, flammability, toxicity. In paragraph (a)(1), OSHA continues the requirement (in §1915.12(c)(1)) for competent persons to test atmospheres of specific spaces that may contain oxygen-deficient atmospheres. These spaces are listed specifically as follows: (1) Spaces that have been sealed, (2) Spaces and adjacent spaces that contain or have contained combustible or flammable liquids or gases, (3) Spaces and adjacent spaces that contain or have contained liquids, gases, or solids that are toxic, corrosive, or irritant,
