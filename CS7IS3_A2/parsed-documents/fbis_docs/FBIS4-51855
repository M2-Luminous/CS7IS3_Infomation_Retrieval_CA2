Korean Religionists" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the Korean Religionists' Council issued a statement Monday calling on all religionists of South Korea to rise up in a struggle for the convocation of a national conference. The statement says the Kim Yong-sam group of South Korea shows a negative attitude toward the North-proposed convocation of a national conference and it is resorting to criminal moves to unleash a nuclear war despite the unanimous protest and denunciation from people at home and abroad. This is a heinous treachery to reduce South Korea to a market for U.S. weapons and victimise the nation for big powers, the statement notes, and continues: Achievement of the great unity of the whole nation is the only way for our nation to overcome the grave difficulties caused by the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet group and realise peace and peaceful reunification of the country. The religionists and religious organisations in the North, South and overseas should show their will for great national unity by a practical action by taking an active part in the patriotic struggle for the convocation of a national conference. We earnestly call on all religionists of South Korea to turn out as one in the struggle to check and frustrate the South Korean authorities' confrontational moves for war and realise the national conference, irrespective of denomination and order. The statement expresses the hope that all religious organisations, clergymen and laymen the world over will extend unstinting support and encouragement to the Korean nation in the efforts to build a unified country of justice and peace with love and reconciliation.
