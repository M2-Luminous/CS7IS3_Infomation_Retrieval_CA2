The talks brought together 176 religious leaders and "Ugases," or traditional chiefs, from the clans of warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid and his enemy self-styled president Ali Mahdi Mohamed. Several other smaller clans were also represented. But the warlords themselves did not attend the meeting, chaired by a prominent Islamic leader, the Imam of Hirab, Mohamoud Omar, revered both by General Aidid's Habr Gedir subclan and Ali Mahdi's Abgal. "This is the beginning of a peaceful settlement in Somalia and Allah will support us," Imam Mohamoud told reporters after the agreement calling for peace between the clans and the return of property looted in the civil war was signed at the Kah hotel in Ali Mahdi's north Mogadishu enclave. "I believe this meeting was fruitful because the people are fed up with war. Ali Mahdi and Aidid are clansmen and so they must follow all the agreements reached by their clans," said the Imam, wearing a red-and-gold embroidered tunic and white turban with black sunglasses. Previous peace accords between the warlords, however, have come to nothing, and UN-brokered talks in Addis Ababa last month broke up without agreement. But Italian ambassador Mario Scialoja, who visited the Imam during the talks Sunday, expressed optimism that pressure was building on the warlords to make peace. "I am confident that this agreement between the Habr Gedir and the Abgal will lead to reconciliation between the two clans," he said before driving away with an Italian military escort. "This could lead to a political agreement," Scialoja said. "In another few weeks we might reach a breakthrough."
