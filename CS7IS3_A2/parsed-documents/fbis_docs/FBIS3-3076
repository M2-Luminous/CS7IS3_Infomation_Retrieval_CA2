Commenting on a report in the local press that the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia invited President Li to attend its party convention, Chien noted that it would be impossible to make arrangements for Li to visit a foreign nation in just two weeks. The UNITED DAILY NEWS quoted the Ostankino National TV of Russia Tuesday as saying that the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, currently the biggest opposition political party in Russia, invited Li to attend a party convention scheduled to open April 2. Meanwhile, Chien, speaking during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, reiterated the government's policy of practicing parallel recognition. Chien noted that Taipei did not ask the 10 foreign governments which established formal relations with the Republic of China [ROC] in recent years to sever diplomatic ties with Beijing in accord with the policy. As Taiwan and Mainland China are two separate political entities under different rule, Chien said, Taiwan should also be allowed parallel recognition alongside Beijing in major international organizations. Chien singled out Vanuatu as an example of the policy. The ROC and Vanuatu signed a communique of mutual recognition on Sept. 26, 1991, despite Vanuatu's relations with Mainland China. The communique specified that the two countries would not intervene in the other's foreign relations. Chien explained that while there is a large gap between "recognition" and "formal ties," good mutual relations can be reached between two nations on the basis on mutual or parallel recognition, even without formal diplomatic ties, he said.
