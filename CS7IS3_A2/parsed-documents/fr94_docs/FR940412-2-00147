FR940412-2-00147 FR940412-2-00104 LIBRARY OF CONGRESS Copyright Office [Docket No. 94&hyph;3] New Post Office Boxes AGENCY: Copyright Office; Library of Congress. ACTION: Copyright Office establishes new post office boxes. SUMMARY: The Copyright Office publishes this notice to inform the public that it has established two new post office boxes to facilitate timely receipt of mail from copyright owners and users that demands immediate attention. This notice is intended to explain the purposes of the post office boxes and the specific kinds of mail that should be addressed to each box. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marilyn J. Kretsinger, Acting General Counsel, U.S. Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington, DC 20540. Telephone (202) 707&hyph;8380. Telefax (202) 707&hyph;8366. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993 abolished the Royalty Tribunal as an independent agency and transferred its responsibilities and duties to ad hoc Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels (CARPs) to be administered by the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office. To assure that time sensitive mail relating to CARP business is not delayed in the general incoming mail the Office receives, the Office has established a separate post office box that is to be used only for CARP claims, filings, and general correspondence. Such mail should be addressed to: Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP), P.O. Box 70977, Southwest Station, Washington, DC 20024. A second special Copyright Office post office box has been established for other limited uses only, as follows: (1) Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, (2) section 411(a) notice and copy of complaint for infringement actions after Office refusal to register a claim, (3) comments submitted in Office rulemaking proceedings, (4) requests for Copyright Office speakers, (5) requests for approvals of computer generated application forms, (6) requests to the Reference and Bibliography Section for expedited search reports needed for litigation, customs or publishing deadlines, and (7) requests to the Certifications and Documents Section for expedited additional certificates, certifications, copies of deposits, correspondence or Copyright Office records or copies required for inspections which are needed for pending or prospective litigation, customs matters, or contract or publishing deadlines. Such special mail may be sent to: Copyright GC/I&R, P.O. Box 70400, Southwest Station, Washington, DC 20024. Requests for regular services to the Reference and Bibliography Section or the Certifications and Documents Section must not be directed to this post office box. Copyright registration applications, deposit copies, or correspondence must not be directed to this post office box either. To do so will delay Office handling of that material and may also result in a later effective date of registration. Dated: April 7, 1994. Mary Levering, Deputy Register of Copyrights.
