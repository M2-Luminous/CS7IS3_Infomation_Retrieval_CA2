A rally organized by the intifadah committee of the engineers association at the al-Rashid hall in the professional unions' complex last night to celebrate the 18th anniversary of Land Day had to end prematurely because of differences between those who supported and those who opposed a peace march among attendees. Only 30 minutes into the rally, and with only two of the five scheduled speakers heard, a row broke out between those who support and those who opposed the peace process. The altercation began with the raising of slogans and shouts and ended with a fistfight and the throwing of chairs. The fight ended after a few minutes and there were no casualties. The master of ceremonies, Muhammad Abu-Taha, exerted great but unsuccessful efforts to continue the rally but the audience started leaving the hall through doors and windows. The rally was addressed by Muhammad Nayil 'Ubaydat, doyen of the dentists association, and Muhammad al-A'raj, known also as Abu-al-Ra'id, one of the founders of the Fatah Movement. Taysir Khalid, member of the PLO Executive committee and a Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine official; Muhammad Nazzal, Hamas representative in Jordan; and Ahmad Nawfal, a professor at the University of Jordan, had no chance to deliver their speeches at this important annual event. This is the first time the intifadah anniversary celebration has failed since the beginning of these celebrations 18 years ago.
