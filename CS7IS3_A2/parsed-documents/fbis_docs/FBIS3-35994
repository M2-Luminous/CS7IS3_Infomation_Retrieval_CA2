At a recent news conference, he said that the branch had completed the past year successfully. The situation with the extraction of oil and gas had stabilized and the rates of construction had not decreased. Agreements have been signed on the deliveries of natural gas from Russia in amounts similar to last year's; agreements on oil deliveries will be signed soon. Do not ask me about prices or tariffs, because they constitute a commercial secret. I will only say that the agreement is mutually advantageous and will enable our national economy to function successfully. If only there are funds -- there will be energy sources! This year, it is planned to purchase 32 million tonnes of oil from Russia. The Committee for Material Resources will be in charge of the deliveries -- partly through direct purchases and also in accordance with so-called Surgut [geographical name] agreements. A large part of the deliveries will be made through the group of companies "Nordex," which, last year, pumped 1.74 million tonnes of oil, for which Ukraine has a debt of $123 million. The committee pins great hopes upon the implementation of the national program "Oil and Gas by the Year 2010," which specifies priorities in the development of the branch.
