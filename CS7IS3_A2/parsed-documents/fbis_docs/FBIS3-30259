Jiri Halousek reports: [Halousek] Vaclav Klaus is staying today at Wolfsberg Castle near Ermantigen, at the invitation of the Union Bank of Switzerland. [passage omitted] Klaus held a news conference for representatives of the Swiss communications media this afternoon. The prime minister first pointed to the differences that exist between the Czech Republic and the majority of the other former communist countries. These differences exist in both the political structure and the economy. While, for example, in the majority of postcommunist states privatization of large enterprises is only beginning, it will be completed in our country this year. Klaus went on to say that the fact that there is low unemployment in our country is the consequence of our having managed to secure the correct ratio between labor productivity and wages. In the West, on the contrary, this ratio is troublesome at the moment. The current 3.5 percent of unemployed will not be possible to maintain on a long-term basis, but unemployment will grow in a balanced way. Klaus expects the growth of unemployment this year to be 0.1 percent a month. Inflation should be under 10 percent. The Czech prime minister then said he was convinced that what our government has done has general validity. Despite various national differences, other postcommunist countries must proceed basically in the same way if they want to succeed. We do not need help from the West, only security guarantees, membership in international institutions, and open markets. We are interested in entry into the EC. However, as Klaus continued, on the other hand, we also have worries similar to Switzerland's. We do not like bureaucracy and state interventionism. About the Maastricht Treaty, Klaus said that we need common markets, not a political union. We are seeking our own identity, which we lost during the years of proletarian internationalism, and we fear that we might lose it again in a too-unified Europe. We want to get to Europe, but we do not want to dissolve in it as a lump of sugar in a cup of coffee, Klaus said literally. Large nations do not have these worries, but small countries such as the Czech Republic have them. Klaus then went on to say that he was on the side of Slovakia in the conflict between Slovakia and Hungary. [passage omitted]
