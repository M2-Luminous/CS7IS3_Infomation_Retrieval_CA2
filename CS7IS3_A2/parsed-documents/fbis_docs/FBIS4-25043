In his speech, Gao Siren said: The current outstanding problem endangering the city's social and political stability is that the covert struggle is extremely acute, and the activities of subversion, infiltration, and division carried out by espionage agencies from outside the borders against our country have never ceased for a moment. The joining hands of the hostile forces at home and abroad has posed a threat to Guangzhou's stability. He pointed out: It is necessary to further mobilize to set up a mass national security precaution structure, attach importance to carrying out education in covert struggle, enhance the alertness of the broad masses of people to the enemy's presence as well as their sense of secrecy and of national security so that everybody will foster the idea that it is everybody's duty to safeguard national security and so that they will dare and be good at using the law to struggle against all actions endangering national security. Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu also spoke at the meeting. He pointed out: Some people have slackened their vigilance. They only see prospects for economic prosperity and development and are not alert to the enemy's presence and the sense of secrecy. They leak out economic, scientific and technological, and commercial secrets which should have been safeguarded. Some people are afraid of strengthening secrecy for fear of scaring foreign businessmen away. They are quite wrong. Leaders at all levels should frequently stress the issue of secrecy and should always keep it in mind.
