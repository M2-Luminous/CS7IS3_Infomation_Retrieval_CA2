In any case, one of the reasons Boris Fedorov cited in explaining his reluctance to stay as finance minister was linked with subsidies for agriculture and Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha keeping his post. [Fedorov] Why is our grain more expensive than in the world market? Who has run up grain-related debts? It is Mr. Zaveryukha, the government, and so on by fixing too high a price. They knew perfectly well that the budget did not have this money. But for me, what is not in the budget does not exist. [Chernyshova] In addition, Boris Fedorov believes that he cannot stay in his post if, instead of the 80 percent inflation at the end of the year which he promised, 300 [percent] is offered today, while the issuing of 10 trillion rubles planned by the Finance Ministry for the first quarter is being replaced with 15 trillion by the prime minister. [Fedorov] In any state, the finance minister is someone responsible for economic policy. When a situation takes shape that turns him into a cashier paying out money, I do not accept such a situation. [Chernyshova] The former deputy prime minister cited all these arguments at the morning meeting with the president in the Kremlin, but found no understanding. [Fedorov] He tried to persuade me, nevertheless, that there was no tragedy today, generally speaking, and that it was possible to go on working. I for one did not agree with this point. [Chernyshova, addressing Fedorov] Why has not your resignation been accepted for such a long time? [Fedorov] Neither the prime minister nor the president have ever complained to me about my performance. Many people are saying that there is a tendency to use individual reformers as a screen, a cover for changing the policy. [Chernyshova] So Fedorov has been removed from work at his own request, removed or departied at a time difficult for the country. Some observers view the former minister's step as a position of principle, others as an escape from real difficulties. Many people, however, see this as a political [chess] castling and predict that both he and Gaydar will return but to an already new government. The prime minister has invested our agriculture with political importance, too. He has just made a trip to Orel Oblast where he met with representatives of 18 central Russian oblasts which produce almost one-third of all agrarian output. They agreed on drafting a federal program for central Russia's revival which would require about 30 billion rubles. Also while there Viktor Chernomyrdin made a statement on an intent to return 4 trillion in the first quarter to pay back debts to the defense industry and the agrarian complex, something which, on the whole, showed the government's new tendencies. The prime minister stressed that this money should not be used for the needs of consumption, but who will be able to control this? At today's news conference which, in fact, was devoted to Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to Italy, something transpired about domestic matters, too. [Chernomyrdin] I am rather stingy and do not like to give out or pay back, therefore, if we are to go ahead with that, we will do this the way you mentioned. And the debts -- this relates especially to debts -- and the credits which should be given because credits should be used and enterprises will use credits -- today we demanded that a mechanism be developed. This relates to the military-industrial complex, defense enterprises, and the agrarian complex. We want clarifications to be tabled on how this money is going to be used and where it will go. [Chernyshova] The prime minister laughed, or only pretended to laugh when asked about the agrarian deputy prime minister's request for 40 trillion rubles to support the efficiency of agriculture. [Chernomyrdin] As regards Zaveryukha's statement, he said that it was meant by the year 2050, that was how he explained it yesterday. As regards claims that he asks for these 40 trillion immediately now, it is simply someone's wish to turn Zaveryukha into a scapegoat, someone would just love this. They heard one figure but do not care about what followed. [Chernyshova] In the main the conversation with journalists followed the usual pattern. Viktor Chernomyrdin promised that this month inflation would be 22 percent; he categorically rejected conjectures about alterations to the reform policy and, for Italian journalists, spoke about Italian plans. We will have enough time to describe them to you when it starts.
