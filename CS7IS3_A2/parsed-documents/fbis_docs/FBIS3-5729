Exactly what kind of guests they will be has yet to be determined. The junta's representatives could be arriving as special friends of Thailand or as guests of the regional grouping as a whole. The invitation, which has been agreed to in principle by senior Asean officials meeting in Bangkok, is to be made despite moves by the United Nations to censure Rangoon for its brutal rule and continued detention of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. The United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva was recently told that a system of repression is still in place in Burma which violates the fundamental rights of the Burmese people. Nonviolent critics of the Rangoon junta are continually being arrested and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment and a climate of fear prevails in the country. Human rights are the same everywhere and their protection is the responsibility of the international community. Ideologies, national boundaries and local legal codes should not be obstacles to speaking out on behalf of others. Sadly, Asean seems to have overlooked this fact. As the saying goes, nothing should be allowed in the way when there's a baht to be made. Rationalizing the decision, Foreign Ministry spokesman Suwit Simasakun said on Tuesday that "the isolation of Burma, as suggested by the Western countries, won't contribute to the development of this region". The term "development" as espoused by the Foreign Ministry has little to do with moral principles and obviously much to do with economics. The current trend of thought among Asean leaders is that individual countries have the right to tackle human rights issues in their own way and that development has a priority over civil and political rights. Since crushing pro-democracy protests in 1988 and securing its position in power, the reviled State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) has embarked on a programme to revamp the economy, motivated by little more than self-preservation. Recent visitors to Rangoon have said that Slorc appears to be "succeeding" in breathing life into the long moribund economy, but Burmese have testified that their lives seem to be getting tougher with inflation running out of control. The military junta itself has said that only when economic rights have been looked after will they (if ever) think about providing "political luxuries" such as a democratic government. Clearly, Slorc is rationalizing its human rights abuses now with the argument that it's all in the interests of economic progress, and that the Burmese people would rather have a full belly than a vote. But it has been indicated clearly that even if the Burmese people are allowed to vote -- as in 1990 -- their verdict will be disregarded if the security of the regime is not enhanced in the country. Sadly, the West's push for trade sanctions has failed because Burma has forged closer ties with its giant northern neighbour China. Trade between the two countries, despite traditional suspicions, is flourishing and China is now Burma's biggest trading partner. For Asean, rather disgustingly, nothing matters more than profits and because of this they have obviously decided they can no longer wait to bring Burma into their circle. With China willing to run a trade deficit with Burma in return for the development of a strategic "friendship", this would seem to be a perfect justification. But double standards prevail within the regional grouping, especially when it comes to Malaysia and Indonesia. Both Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta, which denounced the West for not doing enough to protect Muslims in Bosnia, seem to have forgotten their objections over Slorc's treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority. Of the 288,000 Rohingyas who fled to Bangladesh in early 1992, 230,000 remain in camps along the border in Bangladesh because they fear military persecution. Much to the disappointment of this paper, it seems Asean is unwilling to reverse its decision with regard to Burma's invitation to be in Bangkok in July. By this, the regional grouping has hammered another nail into the coffin of the pro-democracy movement in Burma. The generals in Burma marched into power over the corpses of young pro-democracy protesters, yet they are embraced with open arms by Asean. Frankly, such things happen only in nightmares. In this region, however, nightmares become realities when there's money to be made -- regardless of whether despots respect their own people.
