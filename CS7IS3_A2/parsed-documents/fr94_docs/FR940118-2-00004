SUMMARY: This notice announces the Market Promotion Program for Fiscal Year 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Service, Marketing Operations Staff, room 4932&hyph;S, 14th and Independence Avenue, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;1042, Telephone: (202) 720&hyph;5521. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 203 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended, directs the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to ``carry out a program to encourage the development, maintenance and expansion of commercial export markets for agricultural commodities through cost-share assistance to eligible trade organizations that implement a foreign market development program.'' Assistance under this program may be provided in the form of funds of, or commodities owned by, the CCC, as determined appropriate by the Secretary. MPP will be implemented in accordance with the regulations set forth in 7 CFR part 1485, subpart B, (56 FR 40745), August 16, 1991, as revised by the interim rule published in the Federal Register on November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60549). The Administrator of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), who is Vice President of CCC, is authorized to enter into agreements with nonprofit trade associations, regional associations of state departments of agriculture, state groups, and U.S. private firms and cooperatives to provide cost-share assistance to carry-out approved export promotion activities. Eligibility for promotional support will be limited to those agricultural commodities or products which are at least 50 percent U.S. origin by weight, excluding added water. Except for activities conducted by small-sized entities operating through state groups, promotional activities will only be undertaken to counter or offset the adverse effects of a subsidy, import quota, or other unfair trade practice of a foreign country, through cost-share assistance, in order to encourage the development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities and products. Assistance may be provided for brand promotion activities when such activities are determined by the Administrator, FAS, to be an effective means of carrying out the purposes of the MPP. To be considered by CCC, applicants must fully comply with the procedures specified in 7 CFR part 1485. Criteria for the allocation of CCC resources in the MPP are set forth in 7 CFR 1485.15. The applicant must provide the information required by 7 CFR part 1485 and may include any other factors the applicant deems appropriate.
