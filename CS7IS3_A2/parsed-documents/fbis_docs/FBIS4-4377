FBIS4-4377 "dreas062_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 North Korea UN Security Council Urged To Observe Impartiality UN Security Council Urged To Observe Impartiality SK3103114794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1119 GMT 31 Mar 94 SK3103114794 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- Now that we have undergone an inspection enough for the continuity of safeguards as we had agreed with the IAEA, the United Nations Security Council has no reason or justification to discuss our issue, declared a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry today. The continued discussions of our issue at the U.N. Security Council only give the impression that the international organisation is courting the favor of a country and this may be a living example that even international organisations are used for the attainment of the U.S. egoistic aim, the spokesman said. Answering questions put by KCNA about the attempt of the United States to justify its campaign for pressure on the DPRK with the allegation that the DPRK did not allow a proper inspection for the continuity of safeguards, the spokesman went on: If the U.N. Security Council truly wants to discharge its mission, it must not argue about the DPRK, the victim, but argue about the acts of the United States, the assaulter, and put pressure on it. If the U.N. Security Council, departing from the principle of impartiality, defends the United States, the assaulter, for the reason that it is a big power and puts unwarrantable pressure upon the victim for the reason that it is a small country, the small countries will no more trust the United Nations. The U.N. Security Council must not be used as a rostrum for putting unreasonable pressure upon the DPRK over the nuclear issue. In order to pave the way for a solution to the nuclear issue, the United States must no more pursue a hostile policy toward Korea, first of all. Since the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused by the U.S. policy to stifle our system, if it is to be solved, the United States must take measures first for removing the nuclear threat to us and giving up the hostile policy. It is nonsensical to urge us to accept an additional inspection, the spokesman said, and went on: If the United States continues to misuse our sincere efforts to resolve the nuclear issue, we would no longer pin hope on the DPRK-USA talks and will counter any pressure to the end. But, if the United States put a stop to the international pressure campaign against the DPRK and proceed with the reestablishment of the foundation of the DPRK-USA talks, we would not oppose a negotiated solution to the issue.
