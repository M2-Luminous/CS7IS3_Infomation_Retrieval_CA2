But as Cliff Bale reports, the appointment is likely to be criticized by legislative councillors. [Begin Bale recording] Dr. Townsend was appointed as Chief Executive Officer one year ago following the sudden departure of Richard Allen. He was seconded from the International Bechtel which is in charge of the project management of the airport core program. The Provisional Airport authority said in a statement that Dr Townsend would now sever his links with Bechtel and the Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod was quoted as welcoming the three-year appointment. He said he was sure Dr Townsend would provide the authority with the confidence and continuity needed to complete the airport to the maximum extent possible by mid-1997. However that is unlikely to calm the worries of legislative councillors over the appointment. The infrastruture spokesman for the United Democrats, Albert Chan, says that the move violates the authority's localization and open recruitment policy. He will discuss the issue with the Secretary for Economic Services, Gordon Siu, this afternoon [end recording].
