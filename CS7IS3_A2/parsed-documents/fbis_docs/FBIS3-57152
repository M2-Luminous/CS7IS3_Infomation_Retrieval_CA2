As Interfax learned in the government, this resolution is likely to be signed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. At the same time the former government newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, which declared independence in early January, will be "made free" without any state subsidies. However, in expert opinion, this decision may cause a conflict between the government and the State Duma, which will most demand the return of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. In early October last year the former newspaper of the Russian Supreme Soviet was reorganized by its then general director Pavel Gurin, former press-secretary of Viktor Chernomyrdin. The ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA problem will be probably discussed at a meeting between Chernomyrdin and Speaker of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin, which is expected to take place this week. If they reach a compromise another solution is possible, whereas ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will return to the parliament and ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI to the government of the Russian Federation in a reorganized form and under the title DERZHAVA. Otherwise the Duma will have to create a new newspaper of its own which would require additional multi-million expenses, which is is unlikely in the present economic situation.
