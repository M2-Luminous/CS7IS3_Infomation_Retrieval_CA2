It was presided over by Governor Ruan Chongwu and attended by Executive Vice Governor Wang Xiaofeng; Vice Governors Chen Suhou and Liu Mingqi; Liu Xuebin, special assistant to the governor; and government Secretary General Cui Zhongjun. The leaders of relevant provincial departments attended the meeting as guests. The participants analyzed and discussed the province's economic situation in the first quarter of 1994. The meeting stated that by and large, the province's national economy grew steadily and normally in the first quarter of this year, with the province's total accumulated industrial output value reaching 2.089 billion yuan, representing a 3 percent increase over the corresponding period last year. The province's early wheat, tropical fruits, and aquatic products grew rapidly and well, and registered substantial output increases. The province's town and township enterprises also registered dynamic growth, with their output value registering a 120 percent increase over the same period last year. The province's investment structure underwent drastic readjustments, with the result that the province's total fixed-asset investment reached 1.922 billion yuan, up by 68.4 percent over the same period last year, and the province's total investment in key projects reached 887 million yuan, up by 177 percent over the same period last year. The meeting noted that since last year, the province has made unreserved efforts to develop commodity housing. As a result, the province's total area of commodity housing in the first quarter of this year registered an 81.8 percent increase over the corresponding period last year. In the first quarter of this year, the province's sales and area of commodity housing increased by 260 percent and 140 percent, respectively, compared with the corresponding period last year. The province's total foreign trade volume, including both import and export trade volumes, reached 538 million yuan, representing a 25.5 percent increase over the same period last year. The province's social commodity retail volume reached 2.249 billion yuan, up by 39 percent over the same period last year. In the first quarter of this year, the province actually used a total of $1.4 billion in foreign funds, representing a 34.7 percent increase over the same period last year. Moreover, the province maintained a balance between revenue and expenditure, and enjoyed a basically stable financial situation. The meeting also pinpointed a series of problems plaguing the province's economic operations, including a drastic drop in grain- and sugarcane-growing areas, an excessive slowdown in industrial growth, a rapid drop in the output value of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, slow light industrial growth, a slight drop in export volume, and a sustained shortage of funds, as well as a drastic drop in revenue and soaring prices on the part of some cities and counties. The meeting held that the province's difficulties have resulted from a multitude of contradictions. Given the current nationwide macroeconomic retrenchment, the province should make more energetic efforts to press ahead with all sorts of reforms, optimize the economic structure, raise economic efficiency, and maintain sustained economic growth in hopes of eventually bringing the province's economy back into a benign cycle. The meeting emphatically called for enhancing the province's economic work in the months ahead by improving macroeconomic supervision and control; speeding up readjustment of the industrial structural and the product mix; further developing production; bringing about sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth; increasing effective investment in both agriculture and the construction of key projects; guaranteeing sufficient funds for the production of readily marketable products; continually and vigorously quickening the pace of reforms; stepping up price control and market building; and energetically improving the investment environment.
