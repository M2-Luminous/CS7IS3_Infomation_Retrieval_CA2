['Abd-al-Majid] Thank you. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Could you tell us about the talks you held with various officials in Damascus? ['Abd-al-Majid] Actually, I came to Damascus to attend the annual session of the Arab agriculture ministers, which is sponsored by the Arab Agricultural Development Organization. During the meetings we looked into the agricultural strategy of the Arab World in light of developments in the region. In my opening speech, as well as in the talks I held, I emphasized the importance of peace in the region as well as of confronting the economic blocs that are being formed in other parts of the world. It is essential that the Arab World takes a clear position on these blocs, particularly following the signing of GATT and other economic agreements. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Let us talk for a while about the Arab economic strategy that the agriculture ministers are discussing. What is the Arab vision of this strategy, particularly in view of the current regional and international developments? ['Abd-al-Majid] The Arab vision has several parts. The Arabs need to maintain their food and water security. The Arabs should also find a way to confront the economic blocs that have sprung up in other parts of the world, particularly following the signing of GATT, an agreement that will affect [trade in] agricultural crops. This topic....[pauses] The timing of the current meeting in Damascus was good. GATT was signed in December. The official signing ceremony will take place in April and then the agreement will be ratified. Among the topics discussed during the meeting was ending the subsidies to agricultural products and farmers. This topic was given much thought in many countries during the GATT talks and the earlier talks in Uruguay. The Arab ministers are focusing on these issues. We hope that, by the end of the meeting in Damascus, a fuller picture will emerge of the Arab agricultural strategy. Such a strategy is needed to protect the Arab food and water supply, for it represents a part of Arab national security ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Let us have a look at the other challenges facing the Arab World, such as the issue of water. ['Abd-al-Majid] The issue of water, as I said, is one of the challenges preoccupying the Arab public in the entire region. Of course, this and other topics will be discussed again at the coming meeting of the Economic and Social Council, which will be held in Cairo in February, God willing. The Arab League Council will also review these topics during its regular session in March. The timing of the meeting here was good, as well as the preparations. There is no doubt that the meeting and the discussions will help create a joint Arab position. This is all I have got to say on this subject. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do you see the future of Arab economic cooperation, especially in light of what is being touted as the possible establishment of a Middle East [trade] area? ['Abd-al-Majid] I have commented before and in length on the matter of the Middle East market. First of all, we have to discuss it with each other and see where we stand before we begin talking about a Middle East market involving non-Arabs. But, for starters, we should not be afraid of the prospect of a Middle East market. We should get our act together and see where our interests lie. I think that nothing can be imposed on Arab countries. These countries are sovereign and will not accept anything that contradicts their regional and pan-Arab interests. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There is a question on the minds of all Arabs, private citizens as well as officials. What is happening on your initiative to achieve Arab reconciliation? How far has this initiative gone? ['Abd-al-Majid] Hopefully, it is still alive and well. The responses I have received so far have been limited. Actually, I have received only 13 responses from the heads of states. But I believe that there is a possibility for further consultations about it. In the end, we will have to agree that it is in our interest to clear the Arab atmosphere and restore Arab solidarity, for this will strengthen the entire Arab World. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do you see these efforts proceeding? Is there hope for genuine reconciliation among the Arab brothers? ['Abd-al-Majid] I see some factors leading us somewhat toward clearing the Arab atmosphere. What is needed is more efforts. I am confident that the Arab World can exert these efforts. Arab reconciliation should be based on frankness. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you. ['Abd-al-Majid] You are welcome.
