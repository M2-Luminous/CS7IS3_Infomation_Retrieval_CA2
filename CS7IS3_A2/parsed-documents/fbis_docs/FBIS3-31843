FBIS3-31843 "dreeu038_i_94020" FBIS-EEU-94-038 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Feb 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Interview With President Izetbegovic LD2202231494 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian 1903 GMT 22 Feb 94 LD2202231494 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network Language: Serbo-Croatian Article Type:BFN [Rebroadcast of Sarajevo TV interview and phone-in program with Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, by unidentified announcer in Sarajevo on 22 February -- recorded] [Text] [Announcer] Let us begin with what interests our viewers and listeners the most -- yesterday [21 February], the expiry of the NATO ultimatum, and everything that happened. You declared last night that our spring was at hand, that the withdrawal of Serb heavy artillery was a victory for us, but that it was not complete and flawless. [Izetbegovic] Yes. Some had commented that my statement was overly optimistic, and, indeed, it was pronouncedly optimistic intentionally. All day long I was listening to people moaning about how all this was not good. I could not understand why. I am afraid we are becoming slightly inclined to fall for enemy propaganda. The Serbs tried to convince their own people that this absolute moral, military, and political defeat was in fact a victory for them, and they tried to convince us as well. I heard certain defeatist statements to that effect, so I wanted to counter it by making a slightly overly optimistic statement. However, it is a fact, in my opinion, that it was a moral, military, and political defeat. Why? Moral because they withdrew. That is undeniable. One must pack up and go -- it a moral fiasco. Political because the dreams they had been dreaming for two years on those hills about conquering the city were finally jettisoned. They were certainly not up there for the fun of it. Although their initial and main objective was to diminish our numbers by striking at the civilian population, their paramount objective was to conquer the city. They were compelled to give that up and leave. Militarily? Because they left most of the weapons behind. [Announcer] We saw all they had withdrawn -- all those tanks, cannons, howitzers, mortar launchers. In the long run, it must be said that this was their defeat. If they could keep us encircled with all those weapons without accomplishing anything except for killing civilians.... [Izetbegovic, interrupting] I am not sure anyone noticed that it has become clear only now what we had to put up with for almost two years. The world has been taken aback by the sheer might of all that iron, the tanks that remained here, and those armored personnel carriers, those barrels that remained, and those that were withdrawn -- all that has been registered by television cameras belonging to foreign TV networks. Those columns of vehicles. All those things were overlooking the city. We managed to get rid of all that, we liberated ourselves from that, and we certainly have to consider that as our victory. And another thing. Our people say: He who punches strongly is not the tough one, but he who endures the punch. We have endured those punches. [Announcer] UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] units have been deployed along the separation lines, although it remains to be seen whether they will stay there. How do you view the future of Sarajevo in the light of the proposals for it to become a UN- administered city? [Izetbegovic] The immediate future of Sarajevo is UN administration. Of course, it is a temporary solution which will last for less than two years. Not longer than two years, maybe up to two years. It is a period in which it will be possible to salvage what we have always wished to do to have an undivided city. We think that first at the beginning.... [pauses] Naturally after.... [pauses] The first was by all means necessary, the first condition above all other conditions was to stop shooting, to stop the immediate killing in the city, although I must say straight away, perhaps it is partially a reply to the question put a while ago, we cannot think that there will be no killing here and there. Their infantry is still there. Of course, we are going to resist that infantry much more successfully than before. If you can remember the city was full of snipers in the first couple of months of the spring 1992; we have managed to mop up all those, we have silenced them all. We are probably going to silence them gradually, even more so because now that their artillery has been withdrawn. Without their artillery they are nothing. They are used to having a heavy gun next to them. When the gun is gone, they are going to be something completely different. But still, here and there they are going to snatch a victim or two. Therefore, people should be wary of that. That is past. However, we are now trying.... [pauses] The next step would be gradually to restore communications. Let people meet, let them see each other, let them go; we shall see whether it is possible to achieve that thing, that our people go to Serb-held Grbavica, let people from Grbavica come here. People are something different from their soldiery that was deployed there. [Announcer] And criminals who were there? [Izetbegovic] They are not going to be able to come here. But ordinary people who suffered in Grbavica as much as we suffered here, who shared our suffering and hardships, maybe we shall understand when we have a look at each other that we are not monsters. I think that communication is the next step, after that a bit of trade will come. Before that, normalization in water and electricity supply. Somewhat better food supplies, better and more regular humanitarian aid. That would be a path to preserve the city as a whole. One day a question will probably be asked on what Sarajevans want from Sarajevo. And that is the real question. See, we have all been discussing the issue of Sarajevo. The question is how much we are authorized to resolve the Sarajevo issue. Sarajevo has to be resolved by the Sarajevans. And most probably one day we shall demand a referendum. Sarajevo has to be resolved by the people of Sarajevo and, most likely, one day we shall ask them whether they want a divided or undivided Sarajevo and let it be the way the people want it. I have almost no doubt at all that the people will say they want to live together in the city. How would the people from Grbavica [words indistinct]. Where will people ask for medical help? You can see that the city cannot be divided The city is an organic entity, and I have no doubt that, if asked how they want to live, the city will be opened. [Announcer] [Question indistinct] [Izetbegovic] [words indistinct] I must be honest and say that nobody ever said that any new UNPA [UN protection area] zones should be created here -- the UNPA zones in Croatia have proven to be a bad solution. Something like that has not been on offer here. Here we accept only patrols and control points, not even the demarcaton lines, or control points, but lines. I think such a possibility does not exist. [Announcer] Mentioning that, those people on Pale and Trebevic have celebrated this as a great victory. They have after all got what they have always wanted -- the Russians. [Izetbegovic] Let me say, as we are talking about the Russians. I sent a letter today to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali asking him what happened to the Pakistani soldiers whose arrival was expected six months ago. Then it was delayed until September, then till November, etc. They have not arrived -- ostensibly the problem was how to equip 3,000 people, for they were soldiers without any equipment. It cannot be possible that the West cannot provide equipment for 3,000 people to come here. Obviously this is a case of some other kind of games. I demanded his reply to this question. After I had talked this morning with Turkish Foreign Minister Cetin -- who, as you know, has offered 10,000 people to come here, which is really too many -- I also demanded in the letter that 2,000 or 3,000 Turkish soldiers be sent here. As to the arrival of the Russians. They did not come because of the Serbs. Anyone who understands anything about politics knows very well that this is in fact.... [pauses] You know that their arrival was supported by the Americans. The question arises: why did they support it? They gave it their support, most importantly, to help Yeltsin at a very difficult time in Russia. Since Yeltsin began to make some more radical moves in Russia, he has managed to shut up whatsis name. [Announcer] Zhirinovskiy? [Izetbegovic] Yes, Zhirinovskiy. He has shut him up a bit. I believe that in such a situation the Americans and the West wanted to strengthen Yeltsin's position. I think that was a good move. They succeeded in strengthening his position. The tide there had to be stopped, the nationalist tide in Russia, which does not suit us or the West either, the nationalist tide, and its derivative, Nazism. A strong wave of Nazism is being felt in Russia and is reaching Europe as well. I believe that in this way they have managed to suppress it a little, in the general interest of the free world. I therefore think that the arrival of the Russians was not motivated by the desire to simply help the Serbs. It helped Yeltsin. [Announcer] As we are speaking about the Russians, we have had an opportunity to see pictures shot by foreign TV companies. We have seen the kissing, hugging, and even the three-finger salutes [Serbian] through the little window of the Russian armored vehicles, where a gun should normally be positioned. We have seen them giving away cigarettes and even exchanging hats. Generals exchanging hats! [Izetbegovic] Yes, and I have been told that today, as they were passing by the Bosnian Presidency building they did approximately the same thing. I held talks last night with Sergio di Mello and General Rose, and we drew their attention to the Russian behavior. They apologized for that, for these Russians are, after all, UN soldiers. They said they would talk to the Russians and warn them strictly about their behavior. We said that the Russians would get correct treatment in exchange for correct behavior. [Announcer] We shall see now what was happening. For this program we have selected a video for our viewers to see once again, although majority of them have already seen, but as electricity supply was restored we have received requests from Tuzla, Zenica, and other areas, Kakanj, Sarajevo, to repeat this video. Here is officer asking where your people are and so on and so on. Let us recall once again in brief what and how [words indistinct] those that arrived in Grbavica to keep peace, here you can see the infamous three-finger salute from an armored personnel carrier. Can we trust them in their supervision of that heavy weaponry? [Izetbegovic] We can trust them as much as we can trust UNPROFOR. We can trust them [word indistinct] with some reserve. They are UNPROFOR soldiers, and I hold that.... [pauses] There are between 12,000 and 13,000 UNPROFOR soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The number of 400 Russians represents a couple of percent. [Announcer] Have there been discussions about a higher number? [Izetbegovic] There have been discussions, but I think that it will not happen, but we shall demand some other troops to be deployed here parallel to them. As I said earlier we have called.... [Announcer, interrupting] Here you can see these pictures. [Izetbegovic] We have called others, if the Russians can come, the Turks can also come. [Announcer] And other [word indistinct], of course. Today we received an interesting report. On the border between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbs have blocked an UNPROFOR unit. Several tanks are also mentioned in the report, and the news speaks about calls for NATO air force to act but only by carrying out overflights. Will the Sarajevo issue trigger off NATO actions in this area. And here we have another question from Sarajevo: will there be air strikes against Serb positions or is that story nearly finished? [Izetbegovic] I think that at least we can say one thing for sure: air strikes have not been ruled out. Their likelihood has considerably decreased since the evening when Chetniks accepted to hand in their weapons, to withdraw or to abandon them. They simply abandoned some of their weapons, being unable to withdraw them and being unwilling to die sitting next to those weapons. They simply abandoned them and informed UNPROFOR that they had left them in the snow up there. People who were overflying Sarajevo could see many pieces of abandoned weaponry, abandoned heavy guns. Since then the likelihood has decreased because it was important for UNPROFOR whether Chetniks would shoot. As they were claiming they would not shoot, UNPROFOR informed their relevant commands up there, and they postponed it. It would be best to say that this is something that has been postponed. In case they shoot on the city, no matter where from, either from within the 20-km radius, or outside this radius, or if they attack UN troops anywhere else, air strikes will probably be applied. I think that in this respect, this is my impression, there will be no hesitating. Of course, they are trying to avoid that. Let us make it clear, they were very happy not to carry out attacks. They were not enthusiastic about carrying out attacks. As you know there was a trick with a report that was launched at the last hour saying that the infamous shell was fired from our positions. That was an attempt to somehow avoid a decision to carry out air strikes. What is strange is that a good part of the international press and some responsible people accepted it as something that had to be seriously examined. They would be very happy if something like that could be proven to avoid air strikes. Then they would not have to intervene, and so on and so on. Simply they are not enthusiastic about doing that, but I think that in case of flagrant violation of the agreements and conditions of the declaration, in case the city comes under shelling, if UN troops are attacked, I do not doubt that air strikes against attackers would take place. [Announcer] Do you believe NATO forces will react somewhere else if UNPROFOR does not? [Izetbegovic] That could happen in two instances: in case Sarajevo was bombarded and attacked and in case UNPROFOR units were attacked. In these two cases they would.... [pauses] It would all depend on the intensity of the attack, whether the troops were in danger. In case they were attacked and suffered casualties, there is no doubt they would retaliate. [Announcer] Let us return to the shell. A viewer is asking: They formed a commission to find out who fired the shell at Markale on 5 February. What can you say about that, let us link your reply to what was said on French television's Channel Five. [Izetbegovic] Yes. I recently replied to that question. You see, it was a little cynical. People ask themselves where a shell came from. What about the other 300,000 shells? Who slaughtered 1,300 children, who maimed 10,000 children, who wiped out so many thousands of Sarajevans, who destroyed everything in Sarajevo, the city hall.... [pauses] Who fired hundreds of shells at the military hospital? This person is asking about this one shell?! Finally, it would be very difficult today to technically establish who fired the shell, no one can say for sure. That is all that can be said at the moment. Therefore, they wished to say this: well, as it is known that it would be technically impossible to establish who fired the shell -- it cannot be established -- then the air strikes cannot be carried out. Approximately that line of reasoning. Thank God, it did not go down well this time; people could not be fooled this time. What I told you a minute ago is very interesting. How false information fabricated by a reporter and launched at a critical moment, a dramatic moment when decisions were being made, how that information was accepted by a certain group of people with relief because they said to themselves: fine, now we do not have to intervene because that would be inconvenient. But I want to say that it is an insult to the dead, the people buried here, the commission is an insult to those dead people lying in our graveyards, as well as to the living. [Announcer] All the more so as it as it was proven who had fired the shell at Dobrinja the day before [4 February], who fired the shell at that part of Alipasino Polje, and so on and on. It can always be proved who killed up to 10 people, but when it comes to more than that it suddenly becomes impossible. [Izetbegovic] A shell landed on Dobrinja the day before; those children were killed. It was established with certainty that the shell had come from Serb positions, they did not even bother to deny it. It was concluded that the shell in Markale was of the same kind, of the same make. In any case, let us not waste time on that, things are perfectly clear. It was fired by those who had fired the other 300,000 shells. [Announcer] What can be done to deblock other towns -- Bihac, Mostar, Maglaj, and now, particularly at this time, Tesanj -- and to have heavy weapons withdrawn from there as well? [Izetbegovic] We shall have to see what further arrangements we shall accept. We accepted the arrangement with Sarajevo without hesitation because it was in any case envisaged that Sarajevo should be UN administrated, which is good. [Announcer] If I am not mistaken, only Mostar is also envisaged to be EU administered. [Izetbegovic] We shall probably demand that this is also applied in the case of Mostar. As to other towns we shall have to think seriously whether to accept this. I am afraid that this could bring about the freezing of the situation on the ground. We would be willing to have these lines positioned elsewhere, not on the actual front lines. We are analyzing the question. It is very complex. Admittedly, such a solution prevents the Chetniks or the other ones making further advances into our lines, but it also prevents our struggle for freedom. It prevents us from liberating those lines. So, we shall have to think seriously what to do about it. I can only tell you that the question is just being analyzed -- it is very complex. [Announcer] The same principle could be applied in protected areas -- Bihac, Gorazde, Srebrenica. The same principle as in Sarajevo could be applied there and, after all, that has to be done. [Izetbegovic] Not exactly the same principle. That is where the difference lies: in Sarajevo we agreed to surrender our weapons as well. According to Resolutions 824 and 836, it is not our obligation to surrender our weapons in the safe areas. We knew that here the Chetniks would have been delighted if we had disputed this, they would have then procrastinated the decision forever. After the contacts with our friends, we decided to accept the well-known point seven of the NATO decision, for it suited us in this case. But in other towns we shall demand consistent implementation of Resolutions 824 and 836, which specify that the Serb weapons, and not ours, must be withdrawn from the safe areas. This will be our demand. [Announcer] The situation in Bihac is almost the most critical, as critical as in Maglaj and in central Bosnia. [Izetbegovic] We are defending ourselves there with a lot of success, and there would probably be no problems there if it was not for the unfortunate [Fikret] Abdic on our back. I believe that our people would not accept a Sarajevo-type solution in Bihac. We would accept Resolution 836, and that is what we shall insist upon. General Rose and Akashi wanted to bring it up two or three days ago, on Friday or Saturday. I asked them to postpone it until this week, to avoid complicating the situation in Sarajevo. We want to resolve the question of Sarajevo, and anyway General Delic is travelling to the UNPROFOR base in Zagreb for the talks with Akashi, General Rose, and General Cot. [Announcer] To sum it up now. If the West decides, as it has decided this time, to issue a threat, it means that something can be done. [Izetbegovic] We have earlier said that the recipe is to combine negotiations and pressure; that is force. This is the only formula leading towards the achieving of some objective. We have been constantly told, throughout the 18 months of the war, to negotiate and negotiate. We said that it could not produce any results. It can, if combined with a pressure on the aggressor. It has been proven here that this is the only successful and efficient formula. [Announcer] One interesting question: the Serbs got the corridor in Posavina. Why cannot we get such a corridor linking us with Bihac? [Izetbegovic] People often ask that question. I think that the wrong verb is used here. They did not get it, they took it. They are holding the corridor militarily. We cannot take it back from them. If we can, we shall take it. In this war one does not get anything, nobody gives anything to anyone as a present. Everything has to be taken. They have taken it. Please, let our people bear this in mind when they say: why are you giving them something. We are not giving them anything. They have simply, as you know, taken it by force, a vast force in comparison with our forces, and they will not give it back. They will not give it back although our rights to it are evident. But they have seized it, we have not given it to them. [Announcer] Let us end this part of our program with a report from the White House. Today again a warning has arrived from there that the ultimatum is still in force, and that all heavy weapons within the 20-km zone that are not under UN control will be targeted by air attacks. [Izetbegovic] In that respect the U.S. position is very clear. The French and German positions are clear up to a point, the English one to a lesser extent, the Russian almost not at all. But the important thing is that in this respect the American position is very clear. I think that they are leading the game here. [Announcer] We have received many questions for you. Let us start with politics. We have received some new initiatives. Russia launched an initiative that was rejected. Now we have a French initiative again. What is really taking place in connection with the global resolution of problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Izetbegovic] Something is taking place behind the scenes. Nothing is happening on the main stage. Talks involving experts were held in Bonn today [22 February]. I do not know the outcome of the meeting. I think it ended late this evening, an hour or two ago. I do not know if the results will be made public. Experts from several states involved in the problem took part, including America and Russia and some European states. They were supposed to make some kind of project, perhaps some kind of plan for that hypothetical summit that was discussed and that would have Bosnia on its agenda. As far as our activities are concerned, as you are aware, we held negotiations with the Croatian side two days ago in Frankfurt, between Silajdzic and Granic. Silajdzic has been in the United States since yesterday. He held talks with Christopher yesterday and I think he will meet him again. Today he held talks with other American officials. Therefore, something is cooking, but most of it is taking place behind the scenes. We shall see the outcome. We know our positions and we will defend them adequately. We have several options in mind, depending on the direction in which the things move. However, our people's interest will be protected in all options. [Announcer] Nothing has been solved in Geneva. Are we finally going to ask the UN Security Council to take everything in its hands? [Izetbegovic] It is most likely that another round of talks will take place and, should it fail, there is nothing left to do but to return to the United Nations again. If that happens we would remind them of their resolutions, of the London Conference, and so on. However, I think that another round of talks will take place, yet another attempt to find a solution based on previous projects. [Announcer] The issue of Croatia and the presence of its regular army in Bosnia-Herzegovina is on the agenda of the UN Security Council. What do you expect will happen with that problem? [Izetbegovic] Well, I did not watch the evening newscast because I was on the way to your studio. I do not know if the Security Council discussed the issue today. I have instructed our delegation to delay a decision on the matter for a day or two because we are holding intense negotiations with the Croats over certain issues. Delic is going to Zagreb tomorrow where he is supposed to meet General Roso. Delic will demand the withdrawal of Croatian troops again, although Roso has denied the presence of these troops in a recent statement. What counts is UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Force] verdict according to which at least 5,000 well- equipped troops are present. They will have to withdraw them or they will face sanctions. We have no doubt about this and neither does the international community. It is only a matter of days for some kind of peaceful solution to the problems. [Announcer] You mentioned the talks between Messrs. Silajdzic and Granic, but after the talks it was said that another meeting would be held at the highest level. Does that mean that you and President Tudjman will meet? [Izetbegovic] Yes, if any results are achieved. I must be frank: It does not seem at the moment that there will be any results. I am not an optimist regarding a solution to the problems between us and Croatia, which are not our fault. We are trying to solve those problems. After all, I do not think we should fight if we can solve this by agreement for people to stop suffering. Our people in Vitez -- in the old part of Vitez -- in Novi Travnik, and Mostar are in a very difficult situation. The situation in the old part of Vitez is particularly difficult. There are about 1,000 of our citizens there who have been cut off for a long time. Of course, there are more hotspots, such as Gornji Vakuf. [Announcer] It seems that the situation is calming down there. There was not much fighting there today. [Izetbegovic] Yes, it has quieted down somewhat. UNPROFOR has been trying: They bring up the Sarajevo solution; whether it would be possible to apply a similar solution there. That is why Gen. Delic will go to Zagreb tomorrow. We have tried to organize the meeting here, but Akashi could not come to Sarajevo because he has a lot of work to do in Zagreb tomorrow. I was very enthusiastic about Akashi's presence. He offered for the meeting to take place at Sarajevo airport without him or at Zagreb airport where he would be present. So we agreed for Delic to go there because we are interested in finding a solution. I am not a great optimist concerning all this, judging by certain indications that I have had. However, miracles are possible. [Announcer] There has been talk about new proposals of a confederation. It has been said that the West and the United States want it. [Izetbegovic] The U.S. wish, which has been conveyed to us, is that we solve our problem with Croats. They believe that this is in the interest of both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. When they said Croats, they referred to our internal misunderstanding with Bosnian Croats and to the two states. They advised us and suggested we try to find a solution because that would greatly simplify the problem of implementing the agreement. On the other hand, they said very clearly that they would lend their support to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia concerning their joining future European integrations, and they would give us assistance for a speedy reconstruction of both countries and so on. Therefore, they have given us very appealing offers to encourage us to proceed in that direction. [Announcer] We have to remember that Boban has been replaced. A new president of the so-called Herzeg-Bosna has been elected, but Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic has said that Mostar will be the capital of that parastate. In that area there is nothing new. [Izetbegovic] We have always said that the replacement of Boban was important, for moral reasons as well. We believe that he is to blame for the suffering down there. He organized the war crimes in Herzegovina, and partly here in Bosnia. But we have always said that it was not important to replace Boban, but to change the policy. I am afraid that there has been no change in policy. [Announcer] Convoys have reached Zenica -- if I am not mistaken -- and Nova Bila. I think that the one for Maglaj has failed to go through again. [Izetbegovic] The one for Maglaj has unfortunately not passed through because of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] objections. However, these indications of a change in the policy are very unconvincing. Much more should be done to be able to say that a change in the policy is on the agenda. I cannot see that for the time being. I know that Germany and America -- primarily those two countries, but also other European countries including Belgium and Holland -- insist on us solving our problems with Croatia. They insist the Croats do too, they exert pressure on them too. They have also suggested to us that a solution is in our interest. We will see whether all this yields result in the next few days. Unfortunately, for the time being I cannot see any progress. [Announcer] We have received many questions from our viewers. We have already answered most of them. I will try not to repeat questions. Still, there are a lot of questions that have not been answered. Let us start from here: Has Bosnia-Herzegovina been divided despite all these negotiations? [Izetbegovic] Regarding the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina: Some kind of draft, a project on this has been made -- that is true. Specifically, this is the reconstruction of Bosnia- Herzegovina, which some people call division and which at the same time could and could not be a division depending on the direction things develop in the future. Optimists could interpret the union as a form, a way of keeping Bosnia together at this most critical moment when it is in the greatest danger, when there are three armies operating within it, and when the situation cannot possibly deteriorate further but only improve in the future. Therefore, the union would be a guarantee for a future reintegration of Bosnia, because the framework would be preserved. Pessimists believe that this is a phase in the disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina. History is not prefabricated. What Bosnia will become depends to a large extent on us. It depends on our efforts, on our struggle. We will try to preserve Bosnia-Herzegovina, to realize the beliefs of the optimists. I explained on one occasion how we imagine this if it turns out that no solution is possible other than the union and the three republics, which is currently on the agenda because nothing else has been offered. In fact, we did offer the internal set-up envisaging cantons, but I think that neither the Serb nor Croat sides accepted it. If we are talking about solving the problem by agreement, that will not work. Bosnia- Herzegovina could perhaps be reunited by military means on some new basis. The solution that seems to be rather realistic today, the direction in which things are going, is the union and the republics, among which our Bosnian republic would be the example of a democratic country that would exert influence on the integration of Bosnia-Herzegovina by the strength of its political model. Therefore, what Bosnia-Herzegovina will turn out to be if it becomes a union depends to a large extent on us. [Announcer] We have answered many of these questions: Is this a division of the city? Is this the freezing of the situation in Sarajevo? But there is one interesting question. A viewer called and asked whether you know about new concentration camps -- for example near Han Pijesak, in Mrkalj, and in Pjenovac -- whether the International Red Cross knows about them and what is being done concerning that? [Izetbegovic] We have heard about these things and informed Mazowiecki -- you know that he is the UN secretary general's envoy for human rights on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. His latest report was made public yesterday [21 February]. We have also informed the Red Cross. However, it is difficult to reach those areas. If commissions come to inspect, the Serbs relocate the camps and hide the inmates. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to solve that problem with them. However, we have people who deal exclusively with that issue and who follow the problem of human rights, the concentration camps, and crimes. They are in constant contact with the Red Cross and relevant bodies. We have managed to do a lot in that area. Many camps have been discovered and many people released owing to those efforts. Many people have been exchanged and saved. We have recently held talks on the release of some of our civilians from Kiseljak. We are talking about 500-600 civilians. I think that we will manage to free them in the next two or three days. [Announcer] How do you comment on this escalation of evil, violence and everything else that has befallen us in almost 23 months in this region? [Izetbegovic] It is a phenomenon that will probably attract the attention of the world's scientists. It has truly had no precedent -- and this is not an empty phrase. It is difficult to find something to compare it with in the history of the past few hundred years. We are talking about the killing and expulsion of people, about the destruction of cultural monuments, and so on. The question arises of how such evil could happen here. Some people will say: The root of the evil was in Nacertanije [writings on Serbian national issues] by a Serbian nationalist late last century and early this century. But Nacertanije existed before too. It is a very interesting question -- how this evil has been brought about. I have a feeling that no moral force rose in opposition to the evil. I think that the 40 years of Communist rule here will probably have to be included in the explanation of this phenomenon. That ideology propagated that everything is allowed. If you read the Communist Manifesto, you will see that they say that morality is an illusion and so on. Morality is only that which is useful for a future aim, or -- as they used to say in the better part of their rule -- what is useful for the working class and then what is useful for the ruling class. Everything is allowed. In my opinion, that destroyed all moral buttresses. Nationalists came to power in a moral wasteland, and they implemented their policies without any obstacles. No moral values opposed them. There are nationalists such as we see today in Russia, such as Zhirinovskiy. There is xenophobia in, for example, Germany. There are always people who will preach evil, but they fail to implement it on a large scale. [passage indistinct] I have a feeling that nothing opposed the evil here. Very little in people rose in resistance. Something was destroyed in people -- their criteria, their moral values. People grew up and were educated with the idea that everything was allowed in the name of authority. All that was needed was for bad authorities to come to power to do whatever they wanted. And that is precisely what happened. I think that while explaining why it was in this region that such evil happened, my explanation is that the communist ideology also bears the blame for it. [Announcer] Let us continue with questions from our viewers. In Zenica, they have an electricity as well as a phone link with Sarajevo. Is the president familiar with the serious situation in Zenica and, above all, with the fact that the citizens are dissatisfied with the work of the Zenica government? The following question arises: Why does the Zenica government not want to accept the UNHCR's offer whereby it would take over the bakery and provide bread? The UNHCR claims it can solve this problem. [Izetbegovic] I was not aware of that. I know that there is some criticism. I am aware of some complaints, although-- given the distance--Zenica is almost a two days' walk from here. You know, I find it easier to know what is going on in the United States. It is a matter of five minutes. Whereas, for example, I have no phone link to Konjic. All kinds of things may take place in Konjic, but it can take me five days to learn of them, until the couriers who operate there arrive. Communications have been disrupted. I have to admit there are complaints as far as Zenica is concerned. The police, the authorities, are being criticized, etc. People always complain. You cannot simply take every complaint and criticism at its face value. You have to examine every element. Still, this detail about the UNHCR and, as you mentioned, the bakery.... [Announcer, interrupting] Or what about another example. Why is it impossible to organize in Zenica the distribution and production of bread in the same way as in Sarajevo? In Zenica, the price of flour is 20 German marks. Adem Dervisevic from Zenica. [Izetbegovic] These are good questions. I hope the people of Zenica as well as Zenica's authorities are listening to this. Let them try to explain this issue to those people there. [Announcer] Here you go. Can the state do something to help workers, particularly those who are now living in Zenica but who worked and lived in the temporarily occupied areas? [Izetbegovic] That is a totally justified question. It should be addressed to the government. As you know, the government has recently, government representatives have been doing some field work, examining this situation, and talking to people. They have been trying to find some solution. There are a large number of reports indicating that the situation in Zenica is extremely grave with regard to the humanitarian situation and food. It seems that the highest prices are being charged there at the moment. There is no flour. I can take notice of this.... [Announcer, interrupting] That was probably the reason behind such a question. [words indistinct] [Izetbegovic] It is also a message to the local official there, so they can perhaps take a hard look at what they are doing if their citizens are making these complaints. I will take notice. All I can say is that tomorrow I will phone them in Zenica, and I will draw the government's attention to the complaints we have heard tonight. [Announcer] One of our viewers asks: When will we dispense with municipal officials? [Izetbegovic] I do not know. In what sense? Municipal officials are needed and will be needed in every situation.... [Announcer, interrupting] Is it your impression--you have toured extensively throughout our territory--that these municipal officials have now seized too much power? [Izetbegovic] I believe that the viewer is right inasmuch that we also have realized that municipalities are attempting, due to this existing isolation, due to the fact that we had absolutely no communications until a few months ago [sentence as heard]. Municipalities had gone independent. They turned into statelets of sorts. We have realized this, and now we are trying, if possible, to trim that kind of autonomy a bit, to consolidate the state as this would be in everyone's interest. Municipalities have begun to conduct themselves in a self-interested way. It will not give the electricity if it has the electricity, or it will not give flour if it has flour, etc. I believe that the new government is trying to tackle this issue and that they are doing something. You know how difficult it is to reclaim power from those who have seized it? It is easier to press the cork into the bottle than to take it out. [Izetbegovic] A lady from Zenica asks: Are municipal authorities authorized to impound privately owned goods? Well, here we have Zenica again. It is indicative.... [Izetbegovic, interrupting] It is indicative. This is all coming from Zenica. Yes, there are some situations, although they have to be explicitly listed under the law. There are some cases, but I am not sure whether the number of these cases is high. Only in exceptional cases, of course, can the state interfere with private property. Only in exceptional situations. [Announcer] What are the plans for central Bosnia, for Maglaj? We also have many questions about other areas. Will anything be done about the lifting of the blockade of Tesanj, Teslic, Maglaj, and the free territory of Doboj? When and how will this happen? How can the people there be helped? [Izetbegovic] Of course, these are military issues, and soldiers would hold it against me if I revealed their plans. However, the soldiers have faced that issue of lifting the blockade of Maglaj for days. As far as aid to Maglaj is concerned, we have tried to push convoys through. We have done everything we could-- sometimes even what we should not have done--in order to send them the convoys. The other day we managed to get a convoy through to the very entrance to Maglaj but, as you know, some civilians allegedly stopped the convoy at the very last checkpoint. The convoy returned to Zenica, and then to Belgrade. [Announcer] The UNHCR says that people there are dying of starvation. The other day almost 10 people (?died). [Izetbegovic] Yes, they know that. That is when we intervened. They increased the amount of air-dropped aid because this is more or less what Maglaj survives on. The air drops--aid dropped by parachutes--were increased. We ensured that aid is dropped and that it is dropped in the right place because it used to fall all over the place. There have been fewer mistakes recently. We are trying to send convoys, but sometimes we are completely powerless. With regard to lifting the blockade, that is an issue that is on the agenda. [Announcer] We have a question here by a soldier who has fought since the first day of the war. Could the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army have done more and liberated more territories? I think that this question is very interesting--all the more so since we had to liberate all territories. When we remember what happened in the beginning of the war--the total occupation and all the corps of the former Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] that took control of almost all of our republic--it is obvious that we, after all, liberated everything we have now ourselves. [Izetbegovic] Yes, that soldier used the right word when he said that we could have liberated more territory than we have. Practically, we have liberated all the territory we have today. The people of Sarajevo know that best. There were six or seven barracks here from which the JNA had to be expelled. JNA soldiers were wandering around the city until 2 May. The situation was the same throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. Could we have done more? Perhaps it is not the time now to assess that. You know, one always asks oneself whether one could have done more, what would have happened had one done something different. A few days ago I listened to one of their high-ranking generals, who said that they could have captured Sarajevo. He made this claim and went as far as giving details of how the Serbs showed themselves as cowards and saying that they should have done specific things on a day when he had asked them to in order to cut Sarajevo in two. I remember those days, and [words indistinct]. That is when there was fighting around the Marshal Tito barracks. We negotiated for them to hand over the barracks. Their other generals did not allow that. What we agreed on during the day was undone at night. A general goes to Lukavica, comes back, and says that the agreement was changed. They tried to cut the city in two in that area. They can regret this and say that they failed to do something. We can say that we could have had Ilidza with a little bit more perseverance. Ilidza would have been ours if we had reacted at the right moment. You know that we were in Ilidza. I mention only Ilidza, but the viewer who asked the question did not refer only to Sarajevo but also to other areas. I just wanted to illustrate that we could have done more in certain areas. We know that in Sarajevo we may have been able to keep Ilidza if we had sent only about 100 to 200 people at the right moment; however, there is no second chance there. We lost Ilidza. We did not react in time, and people had to withdraw. We could have had Ilidza, and the situation would perhaps be completely different. [Announcer] [passage indistinct] [Izetbegovic] A list of mistakes, of unlikely successes, and strange failures will probably be drawn up later. I think that there will be many more successes that will surprise people than failures. However, it is certain that there have been failures that could have been prevented--such as the fall of Doboj and Trnovo. Commissions have been set up to analyze this, as well as the incident on Igman. Did it have to happen? All circumstances indicate that it did not have to happen and that it was due to personal shortcomings. [Announcer] One of our viewers asks about the military situation and the further organization of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. [Izetbegovic] All I can say is that the Army is being constantly worked on in the sense that it is being strengthened, and that discipline is being stepped up. This is very important; there are no everlasting commanders. You will see. There will soon be a series of personnel changes in the Army. They are being prepared at the moment. I think that the decisions will be reached in two or three days. We are constantly trying to improve the situation in the Army by introducing changes, by promoting and appointing people who have proved themselves, by removing and replacing people who were not good, and by appointing to front lines and commanding positions those people who have proved to be good. Naturally, personnel issues are very delicate and difficult, and all sorts of mistakes can be made, but we are trying to improve the situation by constantly changing people. We also step up discipline. The political department is active. They have recently issued a series of very useful booklets. Every army must have a political platform. It must know what it wants and how it plans to fight. Therefore, big steps have been made in that respect. Foreigners have acknowledged that this is a real army. Of course, there is a lot more to do. I have mentioned the specific things that we are doing at the moment. We are working on the strengthening of Army personnel by making certain changes. [Announcer] Various newspapers--I read some new papers that have appeared in Sarajevo--recently criticized the Army leadership, especially the people who have come from the former Yugoslav People's Army. I think that there were a lot of unjust accusations. [Izetbegovic] It would be inappropriate for me to assess this publicly. You would like to know what our strategy is? Our strategy is to create in peacetime a small and very effective army. Not a numerically large army, but a very effective, well-equipped, and well-trained army. Perhaps even a professional army, which will not have more than 20,000 to 30,000 personnel. Our army currently has something over 200,000 people because we are at war. [Announcer] An army that can, with the MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], defend everything we create? [Izetbegovic] Yes, it can defend everything. At the moment, we are trying to have as many mobile units as possible in the Army. Most units were not mobile. The Army is very large, and it can defend areas to which it is attached. Now we want to create mobile units; in fact, we are already creating them. There already is a certain number of mobile units, which is increasing every day. In any event, the perspective of our country is to create a small, effective, well-armed, well-equipped, and well-trained army. [Announcer] What about members of the Patriotic League before the war? How can they survive in such conditions, with the humanitarian aid they receive? [Izetbegovic] With difficulty. [Announcer] Soldiers and the wounded from the Patriotic League organized a meeting in Zenica, also attended by the families of the dead soldiers. Who takes care of them? [Izetbegovic] That is one of the elements of our state of affairs seen realistically. Some people here euphorically set some impossible goals without taking into account the actual state of affairs. Unfortunately, we who receive reports every day know the real state of affairs. It could be described--especially morale--as unusually high. The people's morale is surprisingly high--their readiness to fight and sacrifice themselves. On the other hand, of course, we have problems with food and the so-called (?MTS). We do not hide that. Speaking about arms, we capture most of them, we produce some of them, and we import some. We are trying various paths to get something in, but that has been reduced recently because we are under a complete blockade. So--talking about the Army--we provide most weapons by capturing them from the enemy. These are not negligible amounts, but rather large quantities--sometimes very large--because they have a lot of weapons, and our actions occasionally yield results. We capture a certain amount of ammunition and arms, and we also make some. [Announcer] Well, we have been talking for over an hour, let us take a look at humanitarian aid. The situation is extremely grave. You have singled out Zenica, central Bosnia. I would also add Sarajevo and eastern Bosnia to this list. What is going with regard to humanitarian aid? [Izetbegovic] I do not have to conceal that this was a case.... [pauses] At some stages, humanitarian aid has been used as a method of pressing us. There was a drop in deliveries, you know. A person who regulates them, who holds the tap, turned them down a little so that we could feel what hunger and cold was and, hence, be more pliable regarding some concessions, political concessions. You could feel it on the ground. There has been no abundance of anything since the outbreak of war. In many places, however, the shortages had already reached a critical point. It came as a result of this trickling tap policy of humanitarian aid, covered by some excuses to the effect that nothing could be done--that due to one attack in one location there could be no deliveries for a month, or an airport would be closed, Sarajevo airport, for example. Central Bosnia was in a very serious situation in some periods. I believe that, in that respect, conditions will get somewhat better and that perhaps we have already experienced the worst phase. It is no longer such a grave threat. We have been tested. We are leaving this winter, an icy winter, behind us. We have refused to make unprincipled political concessions. I believe that they have not yielded any result, and I believe that this method will no longer be used. That is provided, of course, that our impression is correct that it was a result of what we perceive as deliberate moves. They claim that this was not the case, that it was a result of some other circumstances--snow, lack of safety, etc. Let us wait and see. All in all, I believe that this method will no longer be used, so there will be a more positive situation in the near future in that regard. That is all the more so because the snow will melt away. You have mentioned the convoys that have arrived. There is also a huge delivery that is yet to arrive; it is expected to arrive from the direction of Split and Zagreb. It is being organized by a combination of Muslim and Catholic humanitarian organizations.... [Announcer, interrupting] [word indistinct] Mr. Separovic while he was in Sarajevo? [Izetbegovic] There are huge amounts of food. It is available there. It only has to be transported. We have a transport problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina. That is why we are making these efforts to calm down the situation on the ground. It is something people should know. Food must come. That is our imperative. At the moment, this is the law above all laws; food must reach Bosnia. [Announcer] Could we have done more? We know our situation with regard to necessities--gas, electricity, etc. We know how everything goes. Yet we have no oil, no logs. For example, we are distributing humanitarian aid beans, although most elderly people and those who are all alone have no means of cooking these beans. [Izetbegovic] I would not say that we could have done more. We even reached a point when we were ready to buy heating fuel from the chetniks. We even authorized someone to carry this out, to [words indistinct]. They spotted it and changed their mind. They did not want to give wood to us. That is how far we went because we feared that people would be dying in the cold. Luckily enough, this has been a rather mild winter, except for the past few days. When it was at its harshest in December and January, however, we went as far as this. We believed that one day we would be able to explain to the people why we bought wood from the chetniks. Well, put simply, it was so you do not die from exposure here. They, however, cancelled it at the last moment. Hence, we had come close to and perhaps gone beyond the limit of-- shall I say--the permissible in order to come up with a solution. What we could have done, though, .... [pauses] We have now created a program. Last year--perhaps the general public does not know this--we imported a huge quantity of seed on time. This year we have drawn up again a program according to which every square meter will be sown. A draft law has now been set in motion that.... [pauses] There is a great deal of abandoned land, particularly in central Bosnia and in the Bosnia valley. People have fled. We are not going to tolerate this land not being cultivated. We are going to introduce a law so as to enable municipalities to give this land on temporary loan, for one year only. It would be extended every year for as long as the war goes on. Municipalities will give a plot of land and seeds to refugees. This will be far from any kind of advanced agriculture. There is no fuel for the tractors. People will have to sow in an old-fashioned way. The government is doing its best to make sure that not a single patch remains unsown--whatever land is under the government's control--so we can end up with a maximum harvest of vegetables. Last year we did a great deal, and partly thanks to this we had enough potatoes, a considerable amount of fruit was picked. As you know, there were enough vegetables.... [Announcer, interrupting] On balconies. [Izetbegovic] Yes, on balconies etc. We distributed it systematically. However, humanitarian aid was not in our hands. What was up to us was not to create disruptions in the delivery of humanitarian aid. This is why people think we were subservient in a sense -- we did not want to bring about a situation in which there would be no humanitarian aid. [Announcer] Talking here, let us tell people whether there will be any improvements in gas, electricity, opening special corridors -- you said very little about this. Are the United Nations, UNPROFOR going to take control of the gas valves, waterworks, and suchlike? [Izetbegovic] We have a crisis headquarters, headed by Ganic. There are some other people, civilian and military people, civilian experts in this body. They are tasked with examining, in cooperation with UNPROFOR, how to open up Sarajevo in such a way that there will be benefits rather than damage from this opening up. Many people perhaps have not much idea about the kind of damage that may ensue. There are some very problematic things that might arise from the opening of the city. We will be striving to open up the city in a way that will benefit the city without problems arising from this. Electricity, I believe, will soon return. It, electric power, has gradually stabilized at 20 MW. We used to have 20, and then it would drop to 6, to zero, and then back to 6 etc. Things have stabilized somewhat in this respect. We nevertheless believe that we will soon be able to get 70. If there are no extraordinary circumstances, this will probably take place toward the end of this week. Saturday, Sunday we may get an extra 50 KW. This will make it possible for a considerable number of Sarajevans to receive electric power, at least four hours a day. This is what the power network expects. As for gas, we are sometimes in a very difficult situation, we are on the brink of turning it off altogether. The Serb side is playing a game with this gas. We are in a position to cut their gas as well as our own. We can do it at any time if the amount of gas here in Sarajevo falls below a certain minimum level. They are, however, holding us in what our people describe as a situation of too little to live on, too much to die. There is not enough gas. These quantities are, however, not so small as to make it sensible for us to cut it off altogether. The bakery would be then threatened etc. As far as gas goes, I am not really certain that there will be soon any improvements. I do not believe there will be any improvements soon. [Announcer] What is the Presidency and government going to do about the disastrous humanitarian situation in Kakanj? Is it possible to do something more about the delivery of baby food to Zenica? [Izetbegovic] I can only say that there is a committee working on the matter. They are doing their best but humanitarian aid is not in our hands. [Announcer] We have four identical questions here: Is Tuzla airport to be opened? If so, when? [Izetbegovic] If you want my prediction, I believe that the airport will be open. At some point my prediction was late February or early March. I still cling to this prediction -- late February or early March. [Announcer] We have already heard some hints. As far as I know, I heard it today, the airport is supposed to officially reopen on 7 March, so it seems you are right. [Izetbegovic] Yes, but I made my prediction 15, 20 days ago, if you remember that occasion. [Announcer] Let us go back to some other matters. What about Serb artillery in Ahatovici, Butilo, Paljevo, Rajlovac, in other words, behind Stup? [Izetbegovic] According to some reports, well, in any case artillery has been either removed beyond the 20-km radius or placed under [UNPROFOR] control. There is the odd abandoned artillery piece that is being collected by UNPROFOR.... [Announcer, interrupting] [words indistinct] some districts. [Izetbegovic] Except those pieces that are hidden, those pieces that are possibly hidden underground. In all probability UNPROFOR will spot or has already spotted these abandoned artillery pieces, and transfer them by helicopter and group them in certain locations. [Announcer] In some five places, if I am not wrong. [Izetbegovic] It was first assembled in eight places and they are now regrouping it in five places. As Mr. [name indistinct] said last night, they need to tighten, as they put it, the battlefield, in order to ease their control. I do not think that we will have any problems in that respect. Some artillery pieces have definitely been sent to Kiseljak, according to some information that we have. It was sold or given away there. Some of their weapons most probably ended up there. [Announcer] As they have been doing so far, they have been selling their artillery. [Izetbegovic] We have such reports, I must admit they are not confirmed, but came from very reliable sources. [Announcer] What will happen to the heavy artillery after two years, a viewer asks. I think that the fate of it will be resolved before that. [Izetbegovic] The fate of the weaponry once peace is restored is not resolved at the moment. We do not know what will happen to the artillery. Of course, we will request that it be destroyed. That will be the best solution. [Announcer] What are the prospects for the return of refugees? Now we could mention all the refugees, but a viewer from Zagreb has raised this question in particular. When is this going to be possible? [Izetbegovic] Refugees are one of our main motives in our painstaking negotiations with Croatia, following so many unsuccessful negotiations -- and now we are again doing the same. It is our feeling that without an agreement with Croatia we cannot return the refugees. Roads are closed, airports are closed. They should be enabled to go somewhere, to travel along the road from Split to Sarajevo. Hence, our refugees are our main motive in these negotiations as we are trying in one way or another to reach some agreement with Croatia. It is our desire to enable as soon as possible these people to return. Since this cease-fire in Sarajevo went into effect I have been receiving hundreds of letters and messages saying that people would like to return to the city. They want to know how they can return. In my replies I write of course as much as I can, as I cannot reply to every letter, that they should be patient for some time. The return of these refugees will nevertheless have to be done via Croatia and via the Ploce-Mostar-Sarajevo road or the Split -Sarajevo road. We must reach some agreement on this matter. This is a kind of imperative we have tasked ourselves with, we are tasked with solving this issue. First, we would, of course, withdraw the refugees from Croatia. [Announcer] Talking about this, the question also arises of returning people to the strip here along the Drina river in particular, i.e. eastern Bosnia, including the question of why Foca has been bypassed in all the negotiations so far on drawing eventual borders. Why is it not included in the 15 disputed areas although Foca always had a majority Muslim population? After all, this point was raised in Geneva, as far as I remember, including the majority Muslim populations in eastern Bosnia as per the 1991 census [sentence as heard]. What is the present position of this entire area in the negotiations? [Izetbegovic] We have a basic, rather broad formula. We say, give us back our areas, our land and you will have peace -- this is our message to the other side. When we say our areas, we refer to those areas where the Bosnian population was in the majority according to the 1991 census. [Announcer] Cajnice, Foca, Rudo, Visegrad [words indistinct] are of strategic importance to us.... [Izetbegovic, interrupting] In Cajnice we unfortunately were not in the majority.... [Announcer, interrupting] What about Rogatica, for example, where we were? [Izetbegovic] We demand that they are given back. According to this formula we advocate -- it was the Assembly's position too, if you remember, this is precisely how it is formulated -- we can demand our majority areas. And we will demand them. We are determinedly carrying on in this direction, we have not been giving in, as you know, during over one year of negotiations. This is our message again. This was the instruction given to Silajdzic before he left for these talks. For now it is impossible to predict how the negotiations will end because various great powers are at play here. We, however, cannot give up this principle. It is a kind of platform passed by the assembly. [Announcer] Can the presidency do something to help the Muslims who are still in Banja Luka? Yesterday, we saw some footage of dead people, they were killed there? [Izetbegovic] Hardly anything. What we can do and what we are doing at the moment is to inform international organizations and the public, international organizations in particular, as it is their duty to take care of this. Regretfully, I have to state, though, that it is not an effective method. Nobody is ready to react, verbally yes, but not to take concrete measures. They deem that for this reason they imposed the sanctions against Serbia but are not ready to enter Banja Luka and liberate those people. Whether we will ever be able to do that is open to question. [Announcer] A question from Sipovo. When are we going to return home? What will happen to the western part of Herzegovina? The association of citizens of Grbavica and Vrace asks when they are going to return home. There are very many question of this sort. [Izetbegovic] As to Grbavica and Vrace, I think that a while ago I replied to that question. The situation there is somewhat clearer than that regarding Sipovo or Banja Luka. [Announcer] Now, toward the end of the program, some more questions remain to be answered. I think they are interesting, but I think it is primarily up to our government to reply to them. If you are ready, may we reply to them as well? What does the Presidency think about students drafted into the army? Will it enable them to continue the school year 1993-94? Are you thinking about sending some exceptional students from Sarajevo who have been admitted to some universities in Europe and elsewhere in the world? Finally, once educated, they are going to be useful as experts. [Izetbegovic] In that respect we have to be very cautious in what we are doing. We should neither stop the process of education of talented people who can obtain education, nor on the other hand should be approach that process too liberally, because by this means we are weakening our army. Not because of the departure of a couple of dozen people, but because people here ask the question of who will defend the country, why should some people go to live and study comfortably in America or Turkey and so on, while we are getting killed here and so on. That is a very delicate issue. I think that in this respect a rational solution must be found. We must not be left without cadres, because we will not get far. One day we will restore peace, we will have a state, that state and society need educated people. No state can do without them. No state can allow itself such luxury as to be left without any educated cadres. Therefore, perhaps we will have to examine that issue with great sensibility in such a way as to send the real talents abroad to acquire education. We should not turn down scholarships that have been offered. However, those to be sent abroad should be people who have fought over the past two years and who made their contribution, to be able to be withdrawn from the army. I think that people who did not fight should not enjoy such a privilege. But, by this I am not giving a final reply. Of course, this is a question that needs to be examined well. [Announcer] Have you been informed about shooting in Sandzak over the past two days and the fluid situation in Bijelo Polje? [Izetbegovic] Yes, I know. As you know we have drawn attention to the situation in Sandzak. We have done what can be done in this respect. I think that we have sent a letter to the UN Security Council, asking it to examine the situation in the light of the latest developments, the escalation of terror there. We will have to warn the Security Council to do something. However, with regard to the experience that Bosnia has had with the Security Council in this connection, I think that we should not count on them to take any effective measures. I do not believe they would. As regards Sandzak, our strategy will be to try to tie it to the Bosnian problem. Therefore we put forward an initiative for a wider conference, some called it the Balkan conference. We advocated that standpoint in order to gain the chance to put the Sandzak issue on the agenda. It should not remain on the sidelines. We cannot tackle it within the resolution of the Bosnian issue. We can only tackle it if we extend it. In any case, regardless of the resolution of the situation in Bosnia, at one time the whole thing will have to be discussed in a wider context; at least, the complex including Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, and Croatia. The issue of Sandzak, as soon as we deem it possible to do so, will be linked to the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina; we will try to resolve it in a package. In the meantime we can draw the attention of the international public and the relevant organizations to the violation of human rights. [Announcer] When we are already talking about [words indistinct], can I ask you about Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], how do you view the blockade of the Macedonian borders and how do you view the possibility of the deployment of fresh U.S. troops in that republic. Would that be a chance for the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue to be resolved more quickly? [Izetbegovic] We have condemned the latest moves by Greece against Macedonia, which is an independent and sovereign state. That was also done by the European public, but I do not think that they did enough in this regard. But, still, the international public and the international community have condemned Greece. However, Greece did not find it appropriate to rectify its behaviour. That is, indeed, a regrettable act. I do not think that fresh American soldiers will be deployed down there. Anyhow, their number is only symbolic, but completely sufficient to make an attack on them an attack on the United States. That is very clear [words indistinct] the message is very clear. It is not important whether there are 300 or 600 soldiers [words indistinct]. I think that a military action against Macedonia cannot be expected. [Announcer] Do you believe the war will end in May, a viewer from Tuzla asks. We are nearly at the end of the program, may I ask you what your prediction is, what will happen in the 23d and 24th month of the aggression against our country? [Izetbegovic] I have to tell you [words indistinct]. I do not have the feeling that the war will end that quickly. I do not have that feeling. It would be good, we are in favor of restoring peace here as soon as possible. However, our objective is a fair peace -- I do not think we can expect it in a month or two. Peace at any price could be signed tomorrow. We have to fight a bit more to restore a fair peace, we have to work toward it a bit longer, we still need some more time. [Announcer] A message for the Sarajevans. Let us end as we started, can this situation be considered a nucleus of our free country Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Izetbegovic] Sarajevo is very important [passage indistinct].
