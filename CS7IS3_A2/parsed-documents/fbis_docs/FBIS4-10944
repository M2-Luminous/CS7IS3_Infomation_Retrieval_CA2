So, should investors believe the term private sector means that the pertaining public company will change owners and orientation? Not always. The auction of Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company]--which is scheduled for 20 May in Sao Paulo--may be a kind of self-privatization. Managers of the most profitable Embraer subsidiary, the Embraer Aircraft Corporation (EAC), its U.S. subsidiary, are preparing themselves--under EAC President Newton Berwig from Rio Grande do Sul--to purchase this filet mignon from Embraer. It is really a filet mignon because there is evidence that the EAC--which is totally controlled by Embraer--has for years been fattened with juicy commissions and exclusive rights to sell Embraer planes while the mother company increasingly suffered the losses. "Of course we would like our independence," Berwig told ISTOE reporter Osmar Freitas Junior at the EAC headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. "I am very surprised over this self-purchase attempt, which has never been mentioned during the high command meetings," said Brigadier Mauro Gandra, chief of the Civil Aviation Department. The conditions of the auction, which were published on 5 April, do not foresee this possibility. The Air Force, which generated and protected Embraer, never discussed the possibility of dismembering the company. "I favor the independency of the EAC but I do not know if the company can purchase itself," Embraer President Ozires Silva told ISTOE in Sao Jose dos Campos. For this reason Newton Berwig has summoned, at the request of Ozires Silva, a group of brokers. They are offering Embraer to U.S. investors, especially those in the financial field. If they form a consortium and buy it, the next step will be to divide it into three. The military part of Embraer will remain under the control of the Air Force in light of its reluctance to sell. The EAC would then remain light and free, metamorphosed into an independent company with exclusive rights to sell Embraer-produced Brasilias, CBA-123's, and Bandeirantes worldwide, except for Latin America. The civilian part of Embraer would be managed by the consortium. Given that the investors know planes only as passengers, they will have to hire experts for the new Embraer. The strongest candidates for these positions are members of the team headed by Ozires Silva, who founded Embraer in 1969 and who has shown a remarkable example of political survival. Except for a few months during the Collor administration, Ozires has always managed Embraer. And he may not step down. "I believe that if the new company chief comes from the financial field he may maintain the current company management," Brigadier Gandra said. "I do not know if Ozires will remain in his post, but I believe that he should remain because he is the father of Embraer and he knows the company," echoed Newton Berwig. But this is not what most consultants are telling their clients who are interested in Embraer's privatization. Brigadier Lauro Ney Menezes, retired, a former director of the Sao Jose dos Campos Technical Aerospace Center said: "There has been a managerial perpetuation that has steadily followed questionable guidelines." Menezes is today an independent consultant. Multiplic Bank director Manuel Cintra added: "Following the auction, Embraer must have a new board of directors because, although it has a team of qualified managers, they are used to a subsidized system." Multiplic was asked by Newton Berwig to take part in Embraer's self-privatization, but declined. The domestic solution proposed by Berwig/Ozires does have one point in its favor: There has been little interest, at least thus far, by foreign investors in Embraer's auction. It should be noted that the terms of the proposal will affect this and the next generation. The government has committed itself to liquidating a $640 million debt of Embraer. This loss will, of course, be paid by taxpayers. The established value is $295 million plus $30 million, which will have to be fueled to Embraer. The package could turn out to be a bad deal because it also includes $205 million in debts accrued since 1993, which the 31 December 1992 auction notice astutely overlooked. The notice envisages the sale of 60 percent of Embraer shares, of which up to 40 percent will be available for foreign investors. The state, through the Air Force, will keep 20 percent of the shares plus the Golden Shares; that is, those with a veto right concerning strategic decisions, especially those dealing with military initiatives. The 5,600 Embraer employees will be able to buy 10 percent of the shares at a 70 percent discount, and the remaining 10 percent will be offered to small investors. Foreign companies are not being deterred either by the limits imposed on the amount of shares they may buy, or by the Golden Shares. Joao Antonio Lopes, president of the Trevisan consulting company, said: "The problem stems from the lack of governmental decision to support the aerospace industry." He added: "The presidents of the United States and France have taken the initiative personally and have engaged in diplomatic efforts to advertise their industrial products." No major aerospace, space, or military company has ever prospered without the help of its own government. The privatization proposal includes the purchase by the government of the CBA-123 project. The problem is that state support for military and aerospace industry has declined in recent years. Despite the doubts existing in Brasilia about Embraer, there are at least three consortia--in addition to those supporting Newton Berwig's "self-privatization" proposal--that are planning to participate in the auction. Another former president of Embraer, Ozilio Silva, (no relative of Ozires), who is being advised by Trevisan, is backed by the French Bank and the Brazilian Bank. He hopes to win the auction through the participation of Martin Marietta, one of the giants of the U.S. aerospace industry. Silva does not favor the division of Embraer. He is also dealing with Raytheon, a company that has already got a foot--or, rather, a toe--in Brazil. Raytheon is bidding for a project to set up the Amazon Region Surveillance System (Sivam). As its Brazilian partner, Ozilio is negotiating with the Constran construction company. He hopes foreign investors will consider Embraer as a first step toward larger investments in the aerospace program and in the privatization of the Brazilian communications system. It is also expected that consortia organized by the Monteiro Aranha group and by the Multiplic Bank will also participate in the auction. Some people oppose the privatization. The metal workers union and the Sao Jose dos Campos engineers union have called for a recovery project for Embraer by a group of consultants headed by Amir Khair, former finance secretary of the PT [Workers Party] Sao Paulo Municipal administration. The document concludes that Embraer could recover with a $70 million injection without being privatized. "No matter the future of the public company, the main issue is that there should be a committee of civilian institutions to control its activities and to prevent financial disasters," Khair said. Embraer executives believe the group that is best prepared for the auction is Newton Berwig, mainly because it started organizing earlier than the rest. "The self-purchase of the EAC has been talked about for a long time," said a company manager who did not want to be identified. An Embraer document dated 1991--when the public company was trying to reorganize itself to overcome the national economic crisis--lists different ways to fatten the EAC. The document states: "Profit opportunity: The EAC creates a subsidiary to finance Embraer planes. In a fiscal paradise, the EAC Finance Corporation could also facilitate the international financial operations of Embraer." These points interest those who want to extend their field of operations. From this restructuring the EAC became much stronger. Since Embraer owed it $40 million, the EAC purchased--at $15 million off the debt--the exclusive right to sell Embraer planes worldwide, except for Latin America. Fantastic business. One Embraer executive said: "We were naive and did not see that the EAC was getting stronger at the expense of Embraer." This naivete is due to the EAC's unblemished record. The company has sold nine out of every 10 Brasilias, the most successful Embraer plane. The EAC placed 270 airplanes in the demanding U.S. market which gave it in 1990 a 38-percent share of the international 21-40 seat airplane market. The EAC, which has 125 employees, operates from a two-building complex, the kind which Americans call clean cut high-tech [preceding three words in English]. The modern parts control and management software of the EAC has been adopted by large U.S. companies like Northrop. Since its foundation in 1989, the EAC has placed more than 300 Bandeirantes planes in Uncle Sam's skies. It is true that the EAC received a lot of aid from the mother company. To guarantee a place in the U.S. market, many Brasilias were sold at very low prices. For example, a contract with the large U.S. company Continental to supply it with 100 airplanes was closed at a loss. This means it lost money on the deal. The expectation was to make money later, when the Brasilia would be a known airplane in U.S. skies. It is just that "later" came the U.S. recession which made the EAC sales drop considerably. In times of economic depression, everyone must tighten their belts. One would think that the commission of Embraer salesmen should have also been reduced. Wrong. Sales commission represents EAC's black box or double accounting. When the company was created, enormous commission was paid: 18 or 19 percent for each Bandeirantes that was sold. It was really a concealed way to inject capital into the EAC, seeking to stabilize it and avoid problems with the Brazilian Government. Commission dropped to 14.2 percent in 1986, to 10 percent in 1887, and stabilized at 12 percent in 1989. Commission never varied from this fantastic percentage which is greater than the international average. For each Brasilia sold for, let us say, $7.5 million, the EAC received $900,000. On a sliding scale, 2 percent of the commission was divided among all the EAC employees, from the president to the janitor. The management kept $5,000--nearly the price of a cheap car--for every Brasilia delivered. In 1989 the EAC sold nearly 60 planes in the United States and each EAC executive received $300,000, apart from his salary. During the following years the number of planes sold and delivered abroad dropped considerably. Only 15 planes were sold in 1992. A restructuring proposal in 1991 foresaw a cut in the sales commissions. Berwig said he accepted this proposal. The EAC president then froze the salaries of the executives and main salesmen at their highest average rate. That is, salaries plus commission. From that figure he cut 20 percent. "If sales had increased, the measure would have represented a real saving, but sales continued to drop and the incorporation of commission into the salaries represented an increased cost for the EAC," said a former EAC director. This means the big EAC bosses earn an annual salary of at least $300,000. Some Embraer people believe they even reach $500,000--which not even a Ford or IBM executive would scorn. "In some cases the commission exceeded the labor cost of the plane," a former Embraer director said. Meanwhile, in the world of the Brasilia, Embraer faces serious turbulence. The U.S. recession was slowly overcome but sales continued low, perhaps partly due to the lack of stimulation that the commission represented to EAC salesmen. Their salaries, however, continue very nicely thank you. In practice, Embraer continues to inject capital into its subsidiary and we should not be surprised if the well-nourished prodigal son wants his independence. Newton Berwig blames the company's salary situation on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service which forbids cutting commission under the pretext of combating tax evasion. Some years ago the EAC spent nearly $1 million on lawyers to explain to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service that sales commission had been stabilized at 12 percent. No changes have been made since then; salaries continue high and the main Sao Jose dos Campos company, which is totally indebted, has not done anything about it. The EAC maintains the Embraer planes sold in the United States by buying spare parts at a 30 percent discount. In 1992 the EAC received two free Brasilia planes, to increase its capital, and an enormous stock of Brasilia spare parts to pay for Embraer debts. But Embraer still owes $20 million to EAC. "We were unable to stop this drainage of funds," one Embraer executive regrets. Berwig's enemies--and there are many inside Embraer--have another version. They say that Berwig, a U.S. naturalized citizen and former U.S. Air Force pilot, has a "secret" contract with Embraer. A secret clause requires that approximately $4 million would be paid immediately to Berwig as severance pay--in addition to other benefits over the next few years--should he be dismissed. The self-purchase of the EAC would also certainly be advantageous to Embraer because it would preclude an audit that new owners would certainly order. The privatization/EAC self-purchase imbroglio is just another mishap in the history of Embraer. The company started out with the blessings of the Air Force in the form of an initial order of dozens of Bandeirante planes. It had all kinds of incentives: between 1970 and 1988, any corporation could deposit 1 percent of its income tax in Embraer. To promote the acceptance of Brazilian planes in the United States, the Brazilian Government removed all duties on the import of planes. The only problem is that Brasilias, Tucanos, and the like today face an altogether different market constraint: a 19.2-percent fiscal burden. Embraer, which combines aeronautical production, advanced technology, and military industry, has become an easy target for political maneuvers. Salo Roth, former director of the EAC and an Embraer official for 18 years, said: "In the 1980's, Ozires Silva unwillingly embarked on the creation of Orbita, a company to manufacture missiles but which failed." There were international operations like the bold triangular operation through Great Britain of four Brasilias to Bophutatswana, a black territory that was only recognized by South Africa. Brazil officially opposed the racist South African regime and endorsed all UN resolutions against it. During the government of Jose Sarney, who in 1987 signed a cooperation agreement with Argentina, Embraer began the CBA-123 binational aircraft project. Yet, the Argentine money never came. The Brazilian money did not come either. Nevertheless, Embraer president Ozilio Silva decided to develop the aircraft anyway. The CBA-123 model has the novel feature of having its engines set backwards. The money was obtained from the financial market at soaring interest rates. The CBA-123 is almost ready. There are three prototypes, but they are not selling. The project represents a $300 million loss. The loss is even higher in the case of the AMX subsonic fighter project, which was implemented jointly with Italian companies. The Air Force fell behind in paying because of its critical financial situation and even considered backtracking completely. It will purchase only 22 aircraft. That is all. Although it is on the brink of collapsing, Embraer has savored some victories. The main ones are the Tucano and the EMB-145. The Tucano, a training plane, is considered to be one of the best of its kind in the world. The Tucano accounts for 45 percent of this type of aircraft on the market. In association with Northrop, Embraer is participating in a bid worth millions of dollars to supply 675 aircraft to the U.S. Air Force and Navy. The EMB-145, which is still on the drawing board, will be a beautiful 50-passenger jet plane and there are already 136 orders for it. Whether these orders will be fulfilled depends on what the future holds for Embraer. Based on these possibilities and under the labor union proposal, the Committee Against the Privatization of Embraer--which comprises dozens of institutions--will try to get the 20 May auction suspended. The auction represents another bird being sucked into the Embraer turbines. The enemies of privatization maintain that the auction conditions must be approved by Congress, which has not happened. Decree-Law No. 770/69--which created Embraer--states: "In the ordinary issuance of shares to increase capital, the Federal Government must underwrite enough shares to guarantee a minimum 51 percent of the voting stocks." If privatization takes place without the annulment of the decree, the auction process may be blocked by lawsuits. The contenders have got the ball rolling, and the result will be known on 20 May, the date of the auction. Self-purchase or pure and simple privatization, a great duel will take place between the Silvas. On one hand, Ozires Silva, colonel and eternal Embraer commander, on the other hand, former Embraer president Ozilio Silva. They have known each other for 40 years, they were great allies, but know they treat each other contemptuously. Curiously enough, the two Silvas live in the same condominium, the luxurious Bosque do Engenho, in Sao Jose dos Campos, with its magnificent view of the marshlands. Will passengers please fasten their seat belts. The AMX This is an ambitious subsonic fighter plane for ground attack, developed by Embraer, Alenia, and Aermacchi (Italy). The project has been superseded and its cost is approximately that of a modern American F-16. It has accumulated enormous losses. The CBA-123 This is the result of a political agreement between Brazil and Argentina. It never received the funds promised by the two governments. Embraer developed the plane by contracting loans from the financial market. It represents a $300 million loss. The Bandeirante Created in the 1970's, it represented Embraer's business card in the international market. More than 300 units were sold in the United States alone. The Bandeirante consolidated Embraer's position in its regional aviation niche. The Brasilia The successor to the Bandeirante with a pressurized cabin, it has allowed Embraer to control more than one third of its regional aviation market in the world. Nearly 320 units were sold, 83 percent of which were sold in the United States. The Tucano A military training airplane, considered one of the best planes in use in the world, it controls 45 percent of its market and is manufactured under license in the United Kingdom. It can be used in the antiguerrilla struggle.
