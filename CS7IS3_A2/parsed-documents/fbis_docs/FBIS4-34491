At the end of May, GRANMA blew the whistle when it reported that early on in the neighborhood assemblies it was widely requested that the media identify the "macetas" (wealthy people in popular jargon) affected by a recent decree whereby illicitly obtained properties would be confiscated. This request was probably unexpected because the island's enormous difficulties would seem to have indicated that participants in the assemblies would have been more interested in important issues, having been subjected to widespread shortages, frequent power outages and a chaotic transportation system. Now, nevertheless, the authorities believe this reaction is the result of widespread rejection of individuals who are profiting from the crisis caused by the loss of the dependable markets of the defunct socialist countries and the intensification of the U.S. blockade. The background of this phenomenon shows that demands for the confiscation of the "macetas'" properties was widely agreed upon at the so-called "workers parliaments" held during the first quarter of this year, which were organized by the labor unions to find out the people's views concerning ways to deal with the country's economic problems. In essence, the "macetas" are people who speculate on products that are scarce -- most of which are obtained illegally from state stores -- and have amassed true fortunes, the dimensions of which are only coming to light now. The people's demand to confiscate the "macetas" properties was followed by the National Assembly's approval of guidelines to reorganize the economy, among them instructions to the government to adopt "efficient and exemplary" measures against those who accumulate wealth through the black market, illegal business deals and even theft. Decree-Law 149 was approved by the State Council on 4 May, and 12 days later it went into effect. The decree-law included research mechanisms and, in many cases, called for cases to be reviewed before confiscations that would preclude the right to compensation. During the first month, the Office of the Prosecutor opened over 220 files and imposed precautionary measures on almost 200 cars, approximately 100 motorcycles, 50 trucks, several dozen tractors, over 100 homes, about a dozen boats, and over 3 million pesos (equivalent to dollars). The "macetas" are usually citizens who cannot justify the legality of a standard of living which by far exceeds their incomes. Upon displaying temporarily seized properties, the television stations were careful not to show the faces of the people involved, based on the principle of not morally harming anyone, especially since during their trials they will have four opportunities to prove their innocence with documents. Nevertheless, certain cases have leaked, such as that of a retiree who receives a pension of approximately 100 pesos monthly and who, within a short period, purchased two cars, one van and one truck, and amassed savings of 100,000 pesos; and that of an administrator who earns a salary of 117 pesos monthly and owns four motorboats, one motorcyle, and one truck. It is obvious that some of the illegally obtained properties, including raw materials imported by the state, are being concealed because the "macetas" had time from the beginning of the debates to try to evade the measures. Nevertheless, the issue for the authorities does not seem to be the success of the operation but the permanent enforcement of Decree-Law 149 as part of a plan to restore financial order in the country, including the implementation of a tax system. One issue the Cuban Government clearly established from the beginning is that this is not a witch hunt or a frontal attack on self-employed workers, a sector that has been encouraged over the past few years as a means of finding a solution to the crisis and which includes almost 160,000 people throughout the country. Instead, the struggle against the "macetas" is part of an operation to deal with the lack of control and permissiveness which, to a large extent, make possible the existence of speculators and the black market. According to Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, one of the first signs of the effectiveness of the plan is the improvement of social discipline, shown in the sale of cigarettes, which were deregulated on 1 June. Until then, cigarettes had been rationed. Contrary to expectation, when the Cuban people were able to purchase cigarettes quota-free after such a long time, there was no avalanche. On the first day, 5.5 million pesos were sold; on the second day, 3 million pesos; and on the third day, 2.5 million pesos. Rodriguez believe this was the case because there were no speculative purchases, but he suspects that it would have been different if the "macetas" had not been under society's magnifying glass at the time. More concerned with concealing their faces than in increasing their capital, the nouveau riche had to let the opportunity go by, and the Cuban people received a brief respite in the middle of a quite complicated daily life... at any rate, however, they are waiting to find out who -- paradoxically -- enriched themselves through the shortage.
