Mcllroy: ``Beaches Left Polluted by Rubbish of 28 Nations''] [Text] British beaches are being polluted by waste dumped illegally from shipping traced to 28 different countries, according to the Marine Conservation Society. Many stretches of coastline were in a ``scandalous'' state with tons of debris and sewage-related waste strewn around, the society said yesterday. Typical of items dumped by passing shipping were aerosol cans and a log book of shipping channels from Germany; a milk carton from India; a shampoo bottle from Japan; two batteries from Poland; a plastic sauce bottle from Spain; a drinks container from China, and a large plastic drum, margarine tub lid and plastic bottle from Holland. ``All the items had their own language on the debris, ruling out the possibility the items had been bought and disposed of in the UK,'' the society said. The society was reporting on Beachwatch '93, a clean-up operation of 121 beaches it launched last September with Reader's Digest. ``The major source of plastic waste was from shipping,'' said Miss Cait Loretto, marine science officer with the society. ``This shows that existing legislation is not only ineffectual but is also being widely ignored.'' ``The maximum fine for catching an offender is £450 in the UK. In the United States a cruise liner was recently fined more than £200,000 for dumping plastic -- now that is something like a deterrent.'' She said the Environmental Protection Act 1990 put the onus on local authorities to keep public places up to a certain standard of cleanliness -- a standard many beaches failed to meet. ``Some beaches are regularly cleaned from May to September but this still fails to ensure that the majority are free from litter.'' The findings of Beachwatch '93 are based on the results of the clean-up campaign during which more than 1,000 volunteers cleared 33 tons of rubbish from 121 British beaches. A total of 114,880 items found included 51 percent made of plastic ``providing a real threat to marine life.'' Eleven percent were sewage related, among them condoms, tampons, panty liners, cotton buds and nappies. The society said it wanted to put pressure on the Government for better legislation, better disposal facilities and better sewage treatment ``so our beautiful beaches can be made safe and pleasant for all.''
