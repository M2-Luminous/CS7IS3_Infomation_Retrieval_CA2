The resolution imposes a ban on issuing permits for staging mass communist rallies, as well as granting communist organizations facilities and telephone lines for their activities. Communist publications must not be circulated. Communists must not act as official co-organizers of any undertakings. Thus, communists are being ruled with a rod of iron. Although there is no information regarding any punishments for violating the ban, from now on communists can hardly be expected to hold open party meetings. They have no choice but to continue their activities underground. Had it not been for the Oblast Council attack of rage, communists could have been kept under the authorities' watchful eye.
