Yutaka Kawashima, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau, was responding to concerns posed at a House of Representatives Budget Committee hearing that the United States was considering independent sanctions. "The concern of the U.S. Government has been squeezed down to how to respond through the UN Security Council and there was no thinking about military options," Kawashima said in response to a question. Kazuo Kitagawa, a member of coalition component Komeito, had asked Kawashima about remarks made by U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry in a U.S. television interview that it is possible that independent sanctions may be imposed on North Korea by countries involved in the issue. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said that Japan will provide its efforts through a number of routes, while noting that Tokyo is seeking a negotiated resolution to North Korea's refusal to open its nuclear activities to full international inspections. Hata, speaking at the same committee sesssion, said Japan will cooperate with the international community "within the limits permitted by the constitution" if the UN should decide to impose sanctions on North Korea.
