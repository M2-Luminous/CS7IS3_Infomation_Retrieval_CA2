FR940525-2-00081 FR940525-2-00061 The Plan acquired the Whole Loans in four blocks for an aggregate purchase price of $2,089,978. The Plan earned $1,488,791 in income with respect to this investment and it paid total servicing fees of $122,290. The loans underlying the Whole Loan Blocks represented first lien interests on residential property and had coupon rates ranging from 6.375 percent to 9 percent. None of the individual borrowers was a party in interest with respect to the Plan. No delinquencies, other than occasional late payments, were ever documented with respect to the Whole Loans. Further, no restrictions were ever placed on the sale of transfer of this investment. (1) Whole Loan Block # 1 consisted of nine loans which the Plan purchased from the Mellon National Mortgage Corporation of Colorado Profit Sharing Plan Trust, an unrelated entity, on November 16, 1979 for $152,578. The total income received by the Plan with respect to this investment was $134,783. Whole Loan Block # 1 was serviced by Bank Western, without the receipt of compensation. (2) Whole Loan Block # 2 represented a 90 percent interest in thirteen loans which the Plan purchased for $818,719 on July 8, 1977 from Midland Federal Savings and Loan Association (Midland Federal) of Denver, located in Denver, Colorado. Midland Federal, which was not a party in interest at the time of the investment, retained a 10 percent remainder interest in Whole Loan Block # 2 and it also serviced such loans on behalf of the Plan until its merger with Bank Western in 1984. Servicing fees totaling $34,495 were paid to Midland Federal and Bank Western in connection with this investment. 7 In addition, the Plan received total income of $514,372. 7 The Department is not proposing any exemptive relief herein beyond that provided in section 408(b)(2) of the Act with respect to the servicing of Whole Loan Block # 2 by Bank Western. The applicant states that the agreement between the Plan and Midland Federal at the time these Whole Loans were purchased stipulated that the Plan would earn 8.75 percent and that the servicer would retain the full coupon rate. According to the applicant, the coupon rates ranged from 9 percent to 9.5 percent. When Midland Federal merged with Bank Western, applicant explains that the Plan continued to receive the agreed upon 8.75 percent and Bank Western continued to receive the full coupon rate. (3) Whole Loan Block # 3 represented a 90 percent interest in seventeen loans which were acquired by the Plan on January 27, 1978 from an unrelated party, First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Denver (First Federal), located in Denver, Colorado. The total cost of the Plan's investment in Whole Loan Block # 3 was $686,318. First Federal retained the 10 percent remainder interest of such investment and serviced Whole Loan Block # 3 on behalf of the Plan in return for an aggregate servicing fee of $83,010. The total income received by the Plan over the life of this investment was $557,675. (4) Whole Loan Block # 4 represented a 90 percent interest in seventeen loans which the Plan acquired from an unrelated party, Littleton National Bank (Littleton) of Littleton, Colorado on December 1, 1976. The total cost of the Plan's investment in Whole Loan Block # 4 was $432,363. Littleton retained a 10 percent interest in Whole Loan Block # 4 and serviced such investment on behalf of the Plan for a total servicing fee of $4,785. The total income paid to the Plan in connection with Whole Loan Block # 4 was $281,961. 4. On July 23, 1990, the Board of Directors of WCIC adopted a Restated Employees' Retirement Fund Agreement which covered employees of WCIC and its related companies. The Plan then became a section 401(k) cash or deferred compensation plan effective January 1, 1991. In the process of converting the Plan, the Trustees determined that they should seek outside investment expertise and provide participants with a choice of investment vehicles. Therefore, in October 1990, the Trustees selected Brinson Partners, Inc. (Brinson) of Chicago, Illinois to manage the alternative investment vehicles to be offered to participants. In addition, an existing block of WCIC stock was delivered to Brinson to dispose of at its discretion. 8 Other than the WCIC stock, the goal of the Trustees was to liquidate all of the Plan's other assets and to deliver cash to Brinson which would be invested at the direction of the participants. 8 The applicant represents that such stock constitutes qualifying employer securities within the meaning of section 407(d)(5) of the Act. However, the Department expresses no opinion, herein, on whether the stock satisfied the terms and conditions of section 407(d)(5) of the Act. From October 1990 through the end of 1990, the Trustees proceeded to liquidate the Plan's investments. The bulk of the liquidations took place in December 1990. However, certain of the Plan's assets, including the subject Assets, were difficult to sell, primarily due to their small investment size and high servicing costs. Therefore, the Trustees believed their only alternative was to sell the Assets to Bank Western. Thus, the trades were arranged on December 27, 1990. The Plan paid no fees or commissions to Bank Western in connection with the sale. 5. The following Asset Summary Table reflects, in pertinent part, the status of the Assets at the time of the December 1990 sale. In addition, the table shows the Asset sales that have been exempted by the Department and discussed further herein in Representation 7. Presented below are descriptions of the Assets as summarized in the table.
