Maybe "private settlement" should be added to this. Such a description indicates the extent to which Japan has gone in being passive, waiting for outside pressure, being engrossed with pleasing its partners, and indulging in behind-the-scenes deals. The Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement may be a classic example to illustrate this point. However, things have changed drastically with the latest Japan-U.S. summit meeting. This time, Japan offered neither "gifts," "apologies," nor "private settlements." The two nations failed to reach agreement on the framework trade talks due to a dispute over the issue of designating "objective criteria" to measure progress in the opening of Japan's markets. Both nations were given verdicts that "it is a time for mature deliberation" (as stated by U.S. President Bill Clinton) and that "it is a time for us to cool our heads" (as stated by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa). The Japanese negotiating team feels refreshed. Apparently they feel a sense of satisfaction and relief as they were able to resist "being pressured with managed trade in the form of numerical targets." Even U.S. negotiators seem to have "felt cathartical" (as stated by a high-ranking White House official). The same official has added: "Nothing can move as long as we have to deal with Japanese bureaucrats. Sensing it would be useless to go on like this, we were extremely frustrated." Both the Japanese and U.S. Governments tried to give the impression that their relationship was undergoing a "maturing process" (as stated by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher) so this relationship, as a whole, would not be shaken despite the breakdown in top-level trade negotiations. A high-ranking U.S. Government official has explained: "Although the United States has at times imposed sanctions against European nations and Canada because of trade disputes, it has been able to maintain basic relations with these countries. Our relationship with Japan has reached this stage." In other words, this relationship is probably one based on "gamesmanship." This cannot necessarily be denied. In the United States, a younger generation of politicians who are intolerant of Japan's attitude of taking advantage of U.S. tolerance has taken control of politics and diplomacy. In Japan, the idea that Japan should say what it has to say to the United States and maintain a firm attitude so as to come up to the expectations of other Asian countries is spreading among its leaders. Both nations have begun to think about whether they can somehow have more business-like relations with each other. It certainly is necessary for the two nations to broaden the scope and context of their relationship by outgrowing their excessive bilateralism under which they look at each other from the opposite ends of a telescope. Nevertheless, the latest "cathartical diplomacy" between Japan and the United States lays bare the uncertainty of post-Cold War relations between the two nations. There was almost no coordination of macroeconomic measures to maintain economic growth, while microeconomic measures to deal with sectoral trade issues stood out. The idea of "Japan-U.S. cooperation on a global scale" regresses as the United States sticks firmly to its inward-looking stance. While Japan and the United States call for a promotion of an open regionalism for the Asia-Pacific region, both of the all-important nations continue to engage in their chronic trade conflicts. The Clinton administration has its own "internal problems" to worry about. Since it pushed through the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) against opposition by big labor unions, it has had to secure concessions from Japan at bilateral trade negotiations that would keep the labor unions happy. It would not be a bad idea to take a hard-line stance toward Japan to wipe away the administration's image of "diplomatic weakness" built up by its faulty handling of the Bosnian conflict and other issues. At the latest framework trade talks, the U.S. Government decided that "everyone would sing the same song" (as stated by U.S. Senator John D. Rockefeller IV). During the Cold War era, such U.S. Government agencies as the White House's National Security Council (NSC) and the State Department played the role of trying to keep trade conflicts from intensifying. This time, however, they closed ranks with the Government's economic and trade departments and agencies to avoid causing utter confusion. It seems as if the United States considers Japan in the same way it previously considered the former Soviet Union. Above all, what is significant is ideological fluctuation. One high-ranking White House official has said: "One of the reasons the trade negotiations broke down is that Japan made a caricature" of the framework trade talks as if it were a confrontation between the United States, which advocates managed trade, and Japan, which champions free trade. Meanwhile, Japan has a mass of "internal problems" to deal with. But, in the series of trade talks with the United States, Japanese bureaucrats particularly came under fire. On the eve of the summit talks, President Clinton read such books by Prime Minister Hosokawa as There Will Be No Tomorrow [Ashita-wa Gozanaku-soro] and a compilation of Hosokawa's past comments translated into English, entitled "The Time To Act Is Now." Clinton reportedly showed great interest in Hosokawa's call for reforming the Japanese bureaucratic system, and revealed to his close aides his intention to support the prime minister in his struggle against bureaucrats. The "breakdown" in the trade negotiations may have resulted from Japanese bureaucrats' reaction to such a Japan-U.S. partnership toward reforming the bureaucratic system. In this connection, it is suspected that bureaucrats may have skillfully manipulated nationalistic feelings. Japan-U.S. relations can probably mature only after the two nations carry out their respective reform programs broadly, deeply, and swiftly. It is too early to speak of maturity at this stage.
