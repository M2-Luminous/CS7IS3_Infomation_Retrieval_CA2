On Monday [2 May] the draft of the SPD government program was to have been finally adopted by the party's Executive Committee. According to information received by WELT AM SONNTAG, it is doubtful following Zoepel's departure whether a final decision can be made. An SPD spokesman told WELT AM SONNTAG on Saturday: "The meeting is scheduled to start at 1300. What will happen then is not clear." A member of the Executive Committee stated: "A quarrel with a great deal of saber rattling is threatening to erupt." It has also become known that a meeting of the Presidium is to be convened. The SPD government program is to be officially adopted at the federal conference in Halle on 22 June. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping, who was in Paris over the weekend, stressed that, after the resignation of Zoepel, who was responsible for transportation and housing in the shadow cabinet, Scharping sees "no reason whatsoever for changing our position." Concerning Zoepel's departure from the commission, which has ended its work, "no reasons referring to the contents are discernible." "There has never been a single contentious issue" within the commission regarding environmental policies. Zoepel naturally sees things differently. In a personal letter to Scharping on Friday, he cited "differing views on the work style and the task of the commission responsible for the government program," which have led to "misunderstandings between you and me that cannot be settled" as the reason for his step. Moreover, there is apparently a conflict between the position advocated by Scharping on traffic issues and the "credibility of the work that I have done so far, which makes it impossible for me to represent the SPD." According to information received by WELT AM SONNTAG, Scharping and Zoepel quarreled vehemently as early as last Monday at the Presidium session. The cause of the dispute was a speed limit demanded by Zoepel. Scharping, however, only agreed to a speed limit without a specific ceiling. Also, Zoepel criticized Scharping's style of leadership. The manager of the SPD Bundestag Group, Struck, called for party unity on Saturday. The public debate about the government program was "annoying." He described Zoepel's step as "regrettable" and an "overreaction." WELT AM SONNTAG learned that the presentation of the spring report by the economic research institutes, which predicted a growth of 1.5 percent, had caused considerable unease among the party's left wing. They insist on the inclusion of more specific social regulations in the SPD government program, which should be financed through additional burdens on the top third of tax-payers -- in the form of higher energy taxes, a surcharge on the financial assets of private households, and higher taxation of the increase in the value of immovable property.
