[Horn] Thank you. I am as normal as any average man. In a few weeks this trophy [reference to the metal support-frame he wears around his neck and head as a result of a recent car crash] will be off my head early next week. In other words, the traces of the break are slowly disappearing. [Correspondent] If I understood your words correctly, discussion about coalition negotiations, let alone ministerial posts, is meaningful only after the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] congress, after joint coordinations. Nothing until then? [Horn] [passage omitted] We convened the congress for 4 June. We will decide then. [passage omitted] I think that it is most obvious that it is the party that came second in the elections, the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], can be considered as a possible coalition partner. [passage omitted] I hope they take seriously the responsibility the election presented them. [passage omitted]. This country needs a viable parliament and government. An MSZP-SZDSZ government alliance may mean it will not be too difficult to agree on the most important tasks and that the two parties' agreement with each other may open a path toward a wider alliance. Under this, which I think would be very good, a relationship should be shaped in the future or in the new government between the six parliamentary parties different from the current one. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Certainly your party has become the strongest party of the would-be coalition at this election. How do you wish to use this power? [Horn] The most important thing is to put right the affairs of the country. [passage omitted] We have said the transformation can be executed in a different way from the present manner. In other words, we said it was possible to conduct a policy in which people are put in the focus. It is unacceptable for us that the transformation should be carried out in such a way that the great majority of people should lose out as a result. A burden-sharing in proportion to income must be created. [passage omitted] People's lives must be made more secure, and I do not mean by this public safety only, but also job availability, education, and the assurance of all other aspects of existence. What we also need, shall we say, is a policy with a human face, which means also that we must solicit the views of a broad range of people in all essential questions. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Among the 2 million people who voted for the MSZP, many have recently lost their social status; that is, the middle stratum that makes a country strong and capable of progress. Can the MSZP offer something to them? [Horn] I recently read an analysis of the kind of people who have voted for the MSZP. The widest support has come from those living on wages and salaries, the workers and peasants in the villages. There are also very many entrepreneurs. [passage omitted] Third, there is the middle stratum you mention, which is sliding down on the social scale: teachers, public employees, artists, and others. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Do you see a realistic chance for carrying out all the changes you envisage? [Horn] If there was not a chance we would not start this task. This is why I started the news conference by quoting Franz Vrantizky, who called me to congratulate me and tell me the difficult part was just beginning. He is entirely right. For although it is a great pleasure to know the Socialist Party enjoys such huge support, it is also a great responsibility. [passage omitted] I think the greatest strength of the Socialist Party lies in its expertise. Thus people can have faith that the Socialist Party will start dealing with matters professionally. [Correspondent] Have you got some sort of emergency aid package? [Horn] We have got a package that has already been disclosed regarding social and employment policy, economic and social agreements. It is a short term action program to be completed within the year, in 1994. [Correspondent] So rapid changes can be expected? [Horn] Yes, yes. There are a lot of silly things in this country. Several laws and decrees were adopted, structures and practices evolved, and we protested against them to no avail. Being in an opposition role, of course, there was not much impact of our protest. [passage omitted] So many things can be changed without applying investments worth billions of forints, by way of which the life of people can be improved. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] You said at the news conference that Hungary was in need of foreign help more than ever. What did you mean by this? [Horn] It is quite understandable the activity of foreign capital came to a halt for the time being. This is quite natural, and this is not some sort of no-confidence in the outgoing government, but a kind of waiting. Well, there is an enormous need for foreign capital, but at the same time, internal laws also have to be adopted that will stipulate definite conditions regarding the activity of foreign capital; that is, it should not mean only the buying of markets, as it happened in many cases. The other thing is that this country will need new money. Very serious amounts of money will be needed so that genuine investment activity can take place and to generate economic growth, even if of a modest rate. Last but not least, this country is struggling with a huge debt. There is sufficient reserve in 1994 to fulfill this debt repayment obligation. But what will happen in 1995 and the ensuing years? Will all our money go on repayment of the interests and the instalments? For then we really will not have any internal reserves or internal resources for development. So all this has to be thought through. [passage omitted] Thus a lot of things could be mobilized to put this country back on its feet. Our conviction is that without foreign help getting back on our feet cannot be done. [Correspondent] The press wrote a lot about the fact that the MSZP did not quite manage to get rid of its image associating it with the former HSWP [Hungarian Socialist Workers Party]. How does the party relate to these old members? [Horn] Look, I would very much like if in 1994, as a result of the elections, we would close this dwelling in the past. Not because we have nothing to say about the past, but because we want to deal with the future. [passage omitted] People judged that the policy of change cannot go on as it has done in the past four years; they want change. They considered that the Socialist Party can manage and lead this policy of transition better than the present government. It is possible they will put their faith into another party in 1998. [passage omitted] We will work hard so that they should not be disappointed. Anyway, the nature of a left wing party worldwide is to work in the interest of the majority. So it is possible to deal with the past, but nobody's life will improve one iota in this tiny homeland. [passage omitted]
