Furthermore, the Ministry of Culture wants to have all films shot on the mainland processed and censored in China--even if it is not going to be released domestically. This is despite the existing rule that all scripts be approved by the authorities before permission is given to film. The moves come as part of a crackdown on Western infiltration in China, which saw laws recently passed banning the private ownership of satellite dishes. They are also connected to China's embarrassment over two "anti-government" productions shown internationally last year, Beijing Bastards and The Blue Kite. Under the new regulations, only 26 co-productions will be allowed annually on the mainland. Last year more than 30 Hong Kong productions were shot in China. It is not clear whether all these will in future be classified as co-productions. At present, a producer wishing to film in China must either pay one of the 16 officially sanctioned Chinese studios for co-operation and use of the studio (a production "in association with"), or the Chinese studio can invest in the film making it a co-production. "We don't really know where we stand now," said the head of the Hong Kong Motion Picture Association Peter Tsi. "We still haven't received any confirmed reports. We will be taking this up with the New China News Agency [XINHUA] at our next meeting for clarification. "This is not a beneficial thing for the Chinese film industry and we wonder do they know this." The new rules come as Chinese movies--largely backed by Hong Kong and Taiwanese production companies--are gaining wide international recognition. Last week, Chen Kaige's Farewell to My Concubine won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. If joint ventures are banned, such productions may not be possible in future. "If their objective is to stop film-makers seeking finance from abroad, then they may well succeed," said Hong Kong producer Shu Kei. "I know I would not agree to these conditions." "Definitely, the Hong Kong and Taiwanese film industries will be hit the hardest." "It's hard to know how this will pan out," said Barbara Robinson of ERA, which produced award-winning director Zhang Yimou's Huozhe (To Live), currently in post-production. "It's obvious China is trying to control this thing a little bit better. But we are still very comfortable in our relationship with the authorities. Pronouncements are one thing; how the policy gets worked out is another."
