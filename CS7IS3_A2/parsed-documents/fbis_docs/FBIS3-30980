NATO warned the Serbs on Wednesday that its warplanes would bomb their heavy weapons located around the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo unless the guns are withdrawn or put under U.N. command by February 21. "The plus and minus impact (of air strikes) must be carefully considered," Akashi said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE at the headquarters of the U.N. Protection Force in Zagreb, Croatia. "The military commanders of the U.N. Protection Force also believe that air strikes could be useful to promote political and diplomatic negotiations, but they see a number of complicated questions involved militarily," Akashi said. Akashi said the new cease-fire that U.N. mediators reached in Wednesday negotiations with the Serbs and the embattled Muslim-led Bosnian government will soon be put into a written agreement. Its main points are both sides' pledge to honor the cease-fire and to pull back their heavy artillery and mortars from the area around Sarajevo and to place them under U.N. control, he said. Akashi said with regard to the quick conclusion of a lasting cease-fire agreement, the NATO ultimatum could turn out to be a "plus." However, in negotiations with the Serbs it could also become a minus factor, since the Bosnian Muslims took the NATO decision as support for their stance. "There remain difficult negotiations on both sides," said Akashi, warning against too high hopes for a quick solution. Dozens of cease-fires have collapsed during nearly two years of fighting around Sarajevo. Asked if he expects a settlement of the Bosnian conflict within the 10-day NATO deadline, Akashi evaded a clear answer. "As far as we are concerned, we can only say that we will continue our strenuous efforts," he said. He said the U.N. has not yet concluded who is responsible for the massacre of civilians at a Sarajevo marketplace last weekend. The mortar attack on February 5 killed 68 people and injured some 142. Investigation into the attack is extremely difficult because the single firing of a mortar leaves few traces on the ground, Akashi said. The Serbs have denied they fired the mortar round and claim that the Bosnian Muslims staged the incident to fan international outrage over ostensible Serbian atrocities.
