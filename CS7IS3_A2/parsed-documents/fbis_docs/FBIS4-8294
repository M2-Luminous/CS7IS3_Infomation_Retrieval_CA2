Ion Diaconescu (National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party -- PNTCD), Dinu Patriciu (Liberal Party '93 -- PL '93), Attila Verestoy (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania -- UDMR), and Nicolae Taran (Civic Alliance Party -- PAC) maintained that the time for theoretical discussions had passed and that concrete solutions were necessary. They claimed the opposition had these solutions to offer. Dinu Patriciu said that the dialogue with the ruling party [Social Democracy Party of Romania -- PDSR] could resume only if the Vacaroiu cabinet resigned. The representatives of the CDR member parties concluded that they could resume the dialogue with the ruling party if PDSR understood "it is not the country's master but its servant." CDR leader Emil Constantinescu presented to the press conference a "Manifesto for Romania's Salvation," whereby the CDR suggests several measures termed as "simple and efficient," meant to boost Romania's recovery from the crisis caused by "a incompetent and corrupt" government. Considering themselves rightful to fight by any legal and democratic means for the nation's rescue, the CDR member parties call for: A "tough and fair" justice able to stop corruption; the allotment to the local administration of at least 18 percent of the taxes paid by the population; the cancellation of the farm taxes and the finalization of the process of granting the property title deeds; jobs to be created through investments and privatization; social protection for the youth, unemployed, and underprivileged; increased budgetary funds allotted to education, health, and culture; the Armed Forces' endowment to strengthen the defense capacity; and integration within the Euro-Atlantic structures and a stop to the slide toward other spheres of influence.
