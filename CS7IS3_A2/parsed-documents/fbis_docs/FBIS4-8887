He said so in an interview with DIE WELT after concluding talks in Bonn. Pawlak stated that the currently hopelessly crowded border checkpoints at the Oder and Neisse Rivers should be addressed and the transport infrastructure decidedly improved. This includes the construction of five new bridges, the establishment of four new border checkpoints, and an extension of the Berlin-Warsaw-Minsk-Moscow highway, the Wroclaw-Katowice-Krakow highway, and the already initiated modernization of the Berlin-Warsaw railway line. These projects will soon be discussed by a German-Polish working group initiated by Kohl and Pawlak. The 34-year-old government head, who promoted investment in Poland during his visit to the Daimler-Benz company in Stuttgart yesterday, also intends to tackle the mounting, sensitive problem of car thefts in the FRG by Polish thieves. "Rapid exchange of information is of utmost importance for the police in this connection," he said in the interview with DIE WELT. The better-equipped criminals are taking advantage of the still very poor technology used by the Polish police. This should change in the coming years. Yet, Pawlak added: "I am cautious as far as promises are concerned." Pawlak did not shirk the question as to whether and how the leftist government of former communists and the Peasant Party, which he leads, intend to pursue market-economy reform: "Our main objectives are democracy and the social market economy--on the basis of social stability and evolution, and without shock therapy. What we need is wide acceptance of reform by the population." With great emphasis, the leader of the Peasant Party pointed to the significant decrease in the rate of inflation and 10-percent production growth in the first quarter of 1994. "These are signs of a stable economic situation." Pawlak noted with satisfaction Kohl's support for leading Poland toward the European Union and NATO. Regarding Moscow's objection to his country's NATO membership and that of other Central-East European reformist states, the prime minister said: "Russia had said yes before, but NATO did not react quickly enough and Russia changed its mind. I think the chances are not bad if we are all determined." He said that military aggression was not an acute danger but "a danger in the form of chaos. This can lead to most serious consequences. The former Yugoslavia should serve as a warning to all of us." Pawlak's conclusion: "The important thing is cooperation in partnership. This can be a solid basis also for security."
