The president agreed with the suggestion of the Central Bank on granting licences to carry out banking operations to foreign and joint banks if foreign states grant Russian banks similar conditions in their activities abroad. The president recommends that the Central Bank increase its supervision of the work of commercial banks, credit organizations and carries out thorough investigations of their activities no less than once every two years.

The decree also lays down that the Central Bank will take part in government sessions while the finance and economics minsters will take part in sessions of the Council of Directors of the Central Bank. Laws and actions by organs of state power disrupting the unity of the system of the Central Bank are declared inadmissible. The document states that the Central Bank is a federal bank and according to the Russian Constitution its actions are regulated exclusively by federal organs of state power.
