Tadeusz Syryjczyk, a council member of the Democratic Union (UD), the largest opposition party, said that the crisis had shown the ruling coalition, whose members have roots in the pre-1989 communist system, did not have "experts on governing under democratic conditions." Donald Tusk, leader of the Liberal-Democratic Congress (KLD) - which is making plans to merge with the UD - said that the real problem facing Poland was not the issue of personalities in the coalition, but the statements and decisions of the Pawlak government. Tusk argued that many decisions, particularly relating to the budget and to taxation of small companies, threatened to undermine the reform achievements of the past four years. Leszek Moczulski, leader of the rightist Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN), said that none of the fundamental issues had been resolved in relation to privatisation and the dispute over the Finance Ministry. He predicted that the next coalition crisis would erupt in four weeks time. Jerzy Eysmont of the Non-party Reform Bloc (BBWR) noted that despite the coalition agreement, there were sharp differences between the SLD and the PSL over the state finances, the budget, privatisation and local government reform. For the leftist Union of Labour (UP), parliamentary floor group spokesman Tomasz Nalecz said that the crisis was the "first serious warning signal" over the differences between the coalition partners. However, he added that "parliamentary arithmetic" saved the coalition, since there is no obvious alternative. However, "apart from the elegant style of Borowski's departure from the cabinet, nothing was prevented. (...) It was a serious coalition crisis, and more crises will follow," he predicted. Nalecz dismissed as "difficult to imagine" the suggestion from KPN Leader Leszek Moczulski of a possible coalition of the KPN, the PSL and the UP. Among extra-parliamentary rightist groupings, opinions were divided, but most were agreed the coalition was unlikely to survive the full parliamentary four-year term. Pawel Laczkowski of the Party of Christian Democrats (PCHD) said that he believed the present coalition would easily see out the year. However, there had been a clear shift in the relative balance of power, with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak strengthening his position. Romuald Szeremietiew, leader of the Movement for the Republic of Poland (RDR), described the coalition as a marriage of convenience which was likely to face ever more rocks in its path. Ludwik Dorn of the Centre Alliance (PC) believed that the position of the SLD and its leader Aleksander Kwasniewski had been weakened. Janusz-Korwin Mikke of the Real Politics Union (UPR) said that there seemed to be no real alternative to the present coalition. Part of the SLD would like to make an alliance with the Democratic Union (UD), but the UD is opposed. Also, there is the possibility that SLD deputies from the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ) might seek to make a separate coalition deal with the Polish Peasant Party, but at the moment, OPZZ deputies are apparently not ready to break up the SLD. Poland's international partners are unwilling for the moment to comment on developments in the ruling coalition. Officials at the World Bank in Washington, who requested anonymity, said that the bank was prepared to work with anyone appointed to succeed Marek Borowski as finance minister. It was also stressed that no official position could be expected from the World Bank as long as the situation in Poland remained unclear, and that the bank was concerned at the possibility of amendments to the draft budget. The value of Poland's sovereign debt on world secondary markets, which after Borowski's resignation had fallen from 50.5 cents to the dollar to 46.5 cents, on Wednesday seemed to have stabilised at 47 cents.
