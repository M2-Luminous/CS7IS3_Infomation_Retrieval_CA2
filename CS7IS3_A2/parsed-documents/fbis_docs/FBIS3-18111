In a meeting here with visiting Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Euro-American Affairs, Mahmud Va'ezi, Stercken noted that the German Government and parties shared the idea that friendly ties and cooperation with Iran should be continued. The German official also called on Iran to play a more active role in solving Afghan issue and the regional crises and remarked that Iran had more power and authority to peacefully settle the crisis. Va'ezi believed that the U.S. was the main obstacle on the way of materialization of a collective regional cooperation system as well as peace and security in the Persian Gulf. He commented that the United States intended to drive the regional states closer to itself through sowing discord among Iran and his neighbors in order to sell them more weapons. Pointing out that Iran had fully cooperated with the United Nations on Afghan issue, the Iranian diplomat noted that the international community, besides its humanitarian aids, should stop sending arms to the clashing groups in Afghanistan.
