This in turn permitted them to raise system gain from the original 6 percent to 17 percent, at which point they achieved saturated oscillation. Other parameters of the December experiment include a saturated-oscillation maximum output energy of 3 mJ, a saturated-oscillation pulse plateau width of 2 ï¿½s, and an intra-cavity oscillation average power of 190 kW. The successful achievement of saturated oscillation indicates that the BFEL facility and its key equipment -- the microwave electron gun, high-power wide pulse modulator, NdFeB permanent-magnet undulator, and five-dimensional high-accuracy remote-controlled optical cavity resonator -- have attained a world-class performance level.
