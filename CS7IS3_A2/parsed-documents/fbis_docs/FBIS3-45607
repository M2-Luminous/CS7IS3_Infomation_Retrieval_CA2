From Beijing to all localities, many newspapers increased the number of pages in each issue or increased the number of issues each month. A total of 150 newspapers all over the country took this action at the same time. A few years ago, dozens of newspapers simultaneously increased the number of pages, and the action attracted extensive attention. Last year, another 130 newspapers joined the action to increase pages, and this was widely discussed by people. This time, as of New Year's Day, at least 150 newspapers increased the number of pages or issues. In Beijing alone, 46 newspaper joined this round of expansion, which is the third such round. In the new year, RENMIN RIBAO will be expanded to 12 pages each day, GONGREN RIBAO has expanded its Sunday issue to eight pages, FAZHI SHIBAO has been expanded to eight pages from four, BEIJING QINGNIAN BAO was changed into a daily, BEIJING WANBAO expanded to 16 pages, JINRONG SHIBAO expanded from four pages to eight pages, SHENZHEN SHANGBAO expanded to 12 pages, and CHANGJIANG RIBAO expanded to 12 pages after becoming an 8-page daily last year.... What has prompted the newspapers to increase their pages? Market competition caused such changes. At the end of 1991, a total of 1,543 newspapers were openly published. At the end of 1993, this had increased to 2,030. That is, a new newspaper was published every one and a half days last year. As education in China remains rather backward, there are still a considerable number of illiterates, and the number of newspaper readers is still limited, there are in fact too many newspapers in mainland China. This inevitably intensifies competition among the newspapers. As a result, competition exists in terms of quality, price, distribution, personnel, advertising, and business operations. By means of increasing pages, newspapers may offer more information and carry more advertisements. So this has become the major means of competition to attract readers. Therefore, newspapers have now become thicker with each issue, and some weeklies have become dailies. There is more substantial content, and the layouts have also become more attractive. While increasing the number of pages and issues, many newspapers also complete printing and distribution earlier, and they have diversified their distribution channels in order to occupy a larger share of the market and to bring more convenience to their readers. More and more newspapers now bear responsibility for their own profits and losses, do not rely on government financial support, and do not depend on institutional subscribers using public funds to subscribe to newspapers. At present, more than 700 newspapers in the whole country have adopted laser composition and printing technology, and the newspaper advertising business is also developing rapidly. Last year, more than 10 newspapers earned over 100 million yuan in advertising income. The newspaper management organ in the CPC Central Propaganda Department has pointed out some noticeable problems amid the rapid development of the press: Some newspapers have tried to seek a greater "market effect" by publishing "weekend editions" and increasing the number of pages, but they did not consider the social effects of publishing pictures and stories which were vulgar and in bad taste in order to attract readers. Some newspapers even reprinted materials from the overseas press in violation of the state's relevant regulations, thus causing a disorderly situation in the press. The concerned authorities have noticed these problems. Of course, the increase in newspaper pages has inevitably led to higher prices. One year ago, 400 yuan a year could be used to subscribe to four to five newspapers, but the same amount can now be used to subscribe to only two newspapers. This year, newspaper prices will increase by 100 percent in the most extreme cases. Some experts predict that overall newspaper circulation will decrease sharply.
