FBIS4-4969 "dreas066_d_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 South Korea Kim Tae-chung Comments on DPRK Nuclear Issue Kim Tae-chung Comments on DPRK Nuclear Issue SK0204024894 Seoul YONHAP in English 0223 GMT 2 Apr 94 SK0204024894 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 2 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, said Saturday that South Korea should ask for nuclear transparency in the North and then quietly await the outcome without getting directly involved. "This is because the nuclear question is basically an issue between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and between North Korea and the United States," he said. Kim said that although Seoul had the right to demand inter-Korean nuclear inspections under the joint denuclearization declaration, it could refrain from doing so once the IAEA completely guarantees Pyongyang's nuclear transparency. Kim's remarks are part of a lecture at Cheju University to be given Saturday afternoon, whose text was distributed to the press in advance. On the proposed exchange of special envoys, the former opposition leader said it should be used as an occasion to promote an inter- Korean summit by enabling the envoys to discuss matters related to peace, cooperation and unification. He said an inter-Korean summit should take place without further delay if only to dispel distrust, misunderstanding and enmity between the two sides and also to explore "our destiny on our own." Regarding the North Koreans' threat to turn Seoul into "a sea of fire," Kim said they should revoke the inflammatory statement and apologize to the 44 million South Koreans. He also criticized as "totally unrealistic and dangerous" a high South Korean defense official's remarks that "if war breaks out, we would use it as an occasion to achieve unification by force of arms." Kim observed that the North Korean forces are strong and, besides, China would not allow South Korea and the United States to gain control of the strategic Yellow Sea. He also foresaw the possibility of the United States and North Korea striking a deal featuring simultaneous resolution of the nuclear question and diplomatic normalization. "It appears that beneath-the-surface talks have been going on to a substantial extent between the United States and North Korea on the issues of diplomatic normalization and economic cooperation," he said. Kim voiced opposition to an arms buildup in the South, asserting that deployment of Patriot missiles, procurement of sophisticated weaponry and resumption of the Team Spirit exercise would only impede attempts at dialogue.
