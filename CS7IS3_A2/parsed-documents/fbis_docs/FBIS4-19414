"Kok is an exceptionally talented man. We must take account of the fact that the election results could turn out to be such that he becomes prime minister," Kooijmans said in an interview with the VRIJ NEDERLAND magazine. "The CDA should not boycott a cabinet led by Kok," Kooijmans said. "It is reasonable that the Christian Democrats would then provide ministers for his cabinet," he said. "We must respect the views of the voters." Kooijmans said "the cause of the CDA's big losses in the polls was the `neglect of inspiration from the bible.' I think that we did not emphasize the C in Christian enough," he said. "You are seeing that voters who long felt comfortable with the CDA are now running off. Everything has become too pragmatic. We must put that right." Kooijmans said that "it could not be denied" that the former KVP [Catholic People's Party] supporters in particular no longer identified with the CDA. The merger of the KVP, ARP [Anti-Revolutionary Party], and CHU [Christian Historical Union] had not produced the unity aimed for.
