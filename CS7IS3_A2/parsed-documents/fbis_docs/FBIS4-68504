This is the second year that he has been included in the "who's who" of promising young leaders who will determine world policy in the next century. Does Mr. Nemtsov not feel cramped in his one individual province? Is he not being pulled closer to the Kremlin? [Nemtsov] No, I say without any coyness: I want to be a governor. I have started an undertaking, maybe with some mistakes (I do not know if they are from youth or from stupidity), but some things have begun to work out. And now it would be madness to drop everything and move to Moscow. I do not exclude the possibility that in the future, but not very soon, I will be able to work in the government. However, I do not intend to participate in the presidential elections--neither in the upcoming ones, nor in the ones after that. [Correspondent] The things that have "begun to work out" in Nizhegorodskiy Oblast, are they very difficult to superimpose onto an all-Russian scope? [Nemtsov] The main all-Russian problem is the declining economy. The orthodox methods--to stop giving credits to everyone, to limit expenditures by any means, even if it is at the price of impoverishing the people--are unacceptable to Russia. It would be more correct to isolate specific promising sectors and to implement a rather harsh structural policy. Moreover, the criterion of promise should be determined not by whether some bureaucrat likes a certain sphere, but by where private capital is going, where the people are investing their own money. Since this is associated with a great deal of risk and is done very cautiously, then, as a rule, this is an almost unerring choice. And the state has merely to support it from its own side. In this regard it plays a secondary role. If, for instance, today private capital is going for the development of service and to trade, then the state must also direct its money there. If private capital goes, for example, to construction, and a construction boom is becoming clearly outlined now, then state money should follow. For example, the processing of agricultural production is very profitable. Last year we supported entrepreneurs, including also kolkhoz [collective farm] farmers who wanted to build private mills and sausage-making shops, to organize the production of cheese, yogurt, etc. There were 123 processing plants built with "mixed" money. As a result, we were able to kill three birds with one stone: We increased the profitability of agriculture, saturated the market, and broke up the monopoly of the processing sector. Or here is another example. This year, conversion credit will be granted only to those enterprises which have found the funds for investment in their own production, either in domestic or in Western banks. In short, I look to see where the large banks are "diving." I find out what investment programs they have and, if there is a little money in the oblast treasury, I try to get it into the promising projects. The second thing that may be imitated from us is the method of "tying up" the free public funds. The idea, which Yavlinskiy and I worked out in Nizhniy Novgorod, consists of issuing loans which are rather attractive to the citizens, and using the money obtained from the public for capital investments. At one time, loans uplifted the economy of Japan. On one hand, this is a struggle with inflation, since the "hot" money goes out of circulation, and on the other--it is an organization of investments. Unfortunately, it is difficult to offer loans on a federal level, since the population does not trust the government. But at the local level, judging by what is happening here in Nizhniy, this is still possible. The "Yavlinskiy loan," for example, was snapped up literally in a few months. Recently we offered a telephone loan. The citizens receive a certificate which guarantees them the installation of a telephone within half a year. For every overdue day, the telephone network must pay one percent. Therefore, naturally, we are interested in building the telephone station as soon as possible. Today we are trying to implement a housing loan. [Correspondent] Your oblast is always being cited as an example. You are constantly being visited by high-level guests and government delegations. This is reminiscent of the model kolkhoz or plant which formerly served the leadership as a propaganda aid. [Nemtsov] The only difference is that no one gives us money for "leading experience." We do not have any privileges as compared with others. In fact, everything depends on the political will of the governor: If he wants to do something, he does it. If he does not want to--he does not. As for the attention of well-known people, that is not a bad thing at all. First of all, we ourselves receive a certain stimulus. Secondly, often our experience becomes the property of all Russia, and sometimes even the CIS countries. And finally, such a situation is advantageous to me as governor. It is much better than having the image of a man who is constantly displeased with Moscow. [Correspondent] You do not like to quarrel with the leadership, or is there no need for this? [Nemtsov] I simply try not to conduct myself in a challenging manner. The concern for the interests of the region force the governor to be a pragmatist. If I am unhappy about something, if I feel that personal relations are starting to get in the way of the cause, I will express this in a personal conversation, and not in a newspaper interview. As long as I live in Nizhniy Novgorod and do not get involved in the Moscow shuffle, I will have normal relations both with the Kremlin, and with the government, and with parliament. But if I suddenly got the desire to engage in politics in Moscow, I believe that a number of conflicts with all the institutions of power would arise immediately. Yet for now, when I need the support of the president or the prime minister, I get it. But I turn to them only in the most extreme cases. For example, when the government wanted to stop the privatization of cargo transport. At that time, we sold trucks at open auctions and created a very strong sector in this sphere, which resolved the problem of supplying the city with milk, bread, petroleum products, etc. But the Ministry of Transport offered very strong resistance. I had to go to Yeltsin, and the problem was solved in about 15 seconds. While I was there, Boris Nikolayevich called the transport authorities and said: "If you impede the governor, you will deal with me." Recently I had a conflict with the mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod. It was necessary to remove him, since he was impossible to work with. [Correspondent] A strange story. After all, you and Mayor Bednyakov were of the same mind, almost friends. What happened? [Nemtsov] It is a very simple story. If a person brings to referendum the question of city sovereignty, if his main goal is to bring to the point of absurdity the idea of separating the city from the oblast, then I believe that it is impossible to work with such a mayor. Because this is a direct threat to the entire system of power which is rather fragile, and which may lead to anarchy. I cannot work under conditions of conflict. In this, evidently, I differ from many Moscow leaders, who cannot imagine themselves under any other conditions. I need if not mutual understanding, then at least a tolerant attitude toward one another. Otherwise, nothing will get accomplished. Let us take land reform: If the leadership holds noisy discussions on this topic, public clarification of attitudes, then the cautious peasants will never in their life follow the reformers. Unfortunately, it has worked out in these two-and-a-half years that the mayor and I had no mutual understanding, and especially no tolerance in our relations. Maybe I too am at fault in this. We began in the era of romanticism. Everyone greeted us: "Go ahead and work, you boys from Nizhniy Novgorod, and we will support you." Then the paradise apples ended, and a mass of problems arose: There is no money, the plants are stopping work, there is growing public discontent, and the prestige of authority is falling. When we go uphill, we must help each other. But sometimes one thinks that he can get to the top first, leaving all the others behind. And then the struggle for personal precedence begins. Then I suggested to Boris Nikolayevich that he remove Bednyakov from his duties. He had appointed him, and he removed him. Bednyakov is a civil servant, just like me. The only thing that distinguishes me from a civil servant is that I have been popularly elected, receiving 70 percent of the votes. [Correspondent] Do you have any opposition in Nizhniy Novgorod, and does it hinder you in your work? [Nemtsov] There is, and it is rather powerful: The communists from "Trudovaya Rossiya," the national-patriots and the radicals. However, they lost in the local elections. I cannot say that the opposition hinders the reforms. However, it keeps us from napping, all the time trying to find mistakes and pointing them out most persistently. In that sense, the existence of the "street" opposition is even beneficial--it forces us to keep our form.
