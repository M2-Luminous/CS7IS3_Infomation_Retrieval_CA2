They think that it has the same function as their own military, whose only tasks are security and making war, and so they think that that is ABRI's function in East Timor. The Governor of East Timor Abilio Jose Osorio Soares made that statement in response to questions from reporters in Dili yesterday morning after inaugurating and swearing in Drs Sudarmadi as the head of the East Timor Regional Office of the Department of Information. Sudarmadi is replacing Drs Amir Ali Nasution. The inauguration and transfer of power was at the direction of Minister of Information H. Harmoko Directive Number 202-A/SK/BK/JB/1993 dated 19 December 1993. The new official was formerly the head of the Department of Information's Surakarta District Office (Central Java), and the former official will be transferred to Jakarta. Governor Abilio said that ABRI's presence is still needed in East Timor because out of the approximately seven ABRI battalions serving in East Timor only one has security duties for stabilizing the region and the other six are territorial battalions whose function is to aid the villagers. The governor also made this assertion in response to several western countries which have warned ABRI to withdraw immediately from East Timor. Governor Abilio added that East Timor needs ABRI very much. The facts show that ABRI's presence in East Timor is helping to advance the welfare of the people in the countryside because ABRI lives with the villagers. Antonio Freitas Parada, chairman of the East Timor DPRD [Provincial Parliament] made a similar statement when he was interviewed by PEMBARUAN at Comoro Airport in Dili before he and the governor left for Denpasar, Bali, to attend the Udayana IX Military District Command transfer of power ceremony. Parada said that foreigners might still think that East Timor is like Bosnia or Cambodia and that ABRI is just fighting here. On the contrary, ABRI is the people's workmate in the gardens, in the rice fields and in the villages. He said that the residents of East Timor have only been Indonesian citizens for 18 years. There are still many things that the people of East Timor need to learn from ABRI in order to become good Indonesian citizens; for example, they are learning many things from ABRI's territorial activities in the villages about how the land is cultivated in other provinces, about how to speak the national language and about Indonesian culture, which the people of East Timor must still learn to understand. "Believe it or not, the villagers speak better Indonesian than the city dwellers because they associate with ABRI every day," said Parada.
