Drawing on a wealth of accurate historical data and on the situation in the 15 years since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the book offers a rather extensive and systematic exposition on the process of initiating and developing the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and on the theory's basic contents and innovative contributions. It also specifically analyzes the historical process of reform, opening up, and modernization in contemporary China, depicting the basic form of socialism with Chinese characteristics which is currently being practiced. The book also discusses Deng Xiaoping's role as an architect and leader in various fields of work undertaken by China to promote reform, opening up, modernization, development, political stability, and reunification of the motherland. It analyzes Deng Xiaoping's realistic and innovative ways of thinking in philosophical terms, extensively describing the chief architect's historical status and tremendous contributions. The book is yet another compelling work by Wen Lequn, a professor at the People's University of China, following the publication of his book "The Early Life of Deng Xiaoping" last year.
