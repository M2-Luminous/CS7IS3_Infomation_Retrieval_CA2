MENA has learned that the Arab League Council will discuss a number of political, economic, legal, and financial matters at the closed session. Four committees have been formed for that purpose: A political committee, an economic committee, a financial and administrative committee, and a legal committee. The political committee will discuss the Arab boycott of Israel in the second and third degrees--in other words, an indirect boycott. It will listen to a briefing from the secretary of the Arab Boycott Bureau in Damascus on the boycott and its implications for the peace process. The committee will examine the U.S. request that the boycott be lifted on U.S. companies that participate in developing and rehabilitating the Palestinian self-rule areas following the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. The political committee will also debate a report on Arab national security at a time of fast-breaking international changes. MENA has learned that the economic committee will discuss the formulation of a unified Arab position vis-a-vis GATT, which will be signed in April in Morocco. The economic committee will also discuss the economic repercussions of peace, particularly with regard to the possible establishment of a Middle East market. The committee will also review various agreements concluded by the Arab League and its institutions and assess their effectiveness. The financial and administrative committee will discuss the contributions by member states to the League's 1994 budget, estimated at $28 million. It is expected to urge the members to pay their contributions on time so as to help the Arab League institutions perform their duties. The legal committee will discuss a number of important topics, including the status of Palestinian refugees in a number of countries and the care they receive, the performance of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and a number of legal matters pertaining to the Arab League.
