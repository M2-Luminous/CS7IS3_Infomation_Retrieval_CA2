FR940414-0-00035 FR940414-0-00012 40 CFR Part 52 [CA 57&hyph;9&hyph;6292; FRL&hyph;4858&hyph;9] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans California State Implementation Plan Revision AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is finalizing limited approvals and limited disapprovals of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the Federal Register on September 29, 1993. This final action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of finalizing this action is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rules control VOC emissions from metal container, closure, and coil coating, from wood products coating, and from graphic arts operations. EPA is finalizing a simultaneous limited approval and limited disapproval under CAA provisions regarding EPA action on SIP submittals and general rulemaking authority because these revisions, while strengthening the SIP, also do not fully meet the requirements for non-attainment areas. As a result of this limited disapproval EPA will be required to impose highway funding or emission offset sanctions under the CAA unless the State submits and EPA approves corrections to the identified deficiencies within 18 months of the effective date of this disapproval. Moreover, EPA will be required to promulgate a Federal implementation plan (FIP) unless the deficiencies are corrected within 24 months of the effective date of this disapproval. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective on May 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the rule revisions and EPA's evaluation report for each rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region 9 office during normal business hours. Copies of the submitted rule revisions are available for inspection at the following locations: Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On September 29, 1993 at 58 FR 50884, EPA proposed granting limited approval and limited disapproval of the following SCAQMD rules into the California SIP: Rule 1125, Metal Container, Closure, and Coil Coating Operations; Rule 1136, Wood Products Coatings; and Rule 1130, Graphic Arts. Rule 1125 and Rule 1136 were adopted by SCAQMD on August 2, 1991 and submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on May 13, 1993. Rule 1130 was adopted by SCAQMD on March 6, 1992 and submitted by CARB on September 14, 1992. These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) cited above. EPA has evaluated all of the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA's interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPR. EPA is finalizing the limited approval of these rules in order to strengthen the SIP and finalizing the limited disapproval requiring the correction of the remaining deficiencies. These deficiencies are related to recordkeeping requirements, test method references, Executive Officer discretion, control device equivalency, VOC limits, and rule applicability. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and evaluations has been provided in the NPR and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at EPA's Region IX office (TSDs for SCAQMD's Rule 1125, Rule 1136, and Rule 1130 dated April 30, 1993 and July 21, 1993). Response to Public Comments A 30-day public comment period was provided at 58 FR 50884. EPA received no comment letters on the NPR. EPA Action EPA is finalizing a limited approval and a limited disapproval of the above-referenced rules. The limited approval of these rules is being finalized under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt regulations necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. The approval is limited in the sense that the rules strengthen the SIP. However, the rules do not meet the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement because of the rule deficiencies which were discussed in the NPR. Thus, in order to strengthen the SIP, EPA is granting limited approval of these rules under sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the CAA. This action approves the rules into the SIP as federally enforceable rules. At the same time, EPA is finalizing the limited disapproval of these rules because they contain deficiencies that have not been corrected as required by section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, and, as such, the rules do not fully meet the requirements of part D of the Act. As stated in the NPR, upon the effective date of this final rule, the 18 month clock for sanctions and the 24 month FIP clock will begin. Sections 179(a) and 110(c). If the State does not submit the required corrections and EPA does not approve the submittal within 18 months of the final rule, either the highway sanction or the offset sanction will be imposed at the 18 month mark. It should be noted that the rules covered by this final rule have been adopted by the SCAQMD and are currently in effect in the Los Angeles&hyph;South Coast Air Basin. EPA's limited disapproval action in this final rule does not prevent SCAQMD or EPA from enforcing these rules. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Process This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, to the Regional Administrators). A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 13, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).
