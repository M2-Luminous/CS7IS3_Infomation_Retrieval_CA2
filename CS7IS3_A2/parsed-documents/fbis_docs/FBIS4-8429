FBIS4-8429 "dreeu071_p_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 POLAND Oleksy Questions NATO Air Strikes Oleksy Questions NATO Air Strikes OW1304100294 Tokyo KYODO in English 0948 GMT 13 Apr 94 OW1304100294 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO--Jozef Oleksy, speaker of Poland's Sejm or lower chamber in the National Assembly, Wednesday [13 April] questioned the ability of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to prevent Serbian forces from continuing attacks against Bosnian Muslims. Speaking at the Japan National Press Club, Oleksy, vice chairman of the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SDRP), said, "our question is whether NATO's air raids can have any effectiveness as a warning against Serbia." Oleksy is a political rival of Polish President Lech Walesa. Oleksy, a former communist cabinet minister in charge of trade unions, opposed Walesa's Solidarity prodemocracy movement until the SDRP's predecessor, the Polish United Workers' Party, was ousted from power by the Solidarity-led coalition government. Oleksy's remarks came two days after NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner warned Bosnian Serbs not to retaliate in the aftermath of air strikes against Serbian forces besieging the Bosnian enclave of Gorazde. NATO jets, in two rounds of air raids Sunday and Monday, destroyed Serbian tanks and armored personnel carriers, the first NATO bombing raids on ground positions in the organization's 45-year history. "The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is evidence that the European security system does not have the ability to resolve wars stemming from ethnic disputes," said Oleksy, who is visiting Tokyo at the invitation of the House of Representatives. However, he voiced some support for the air strikes, saying, "although it may be hard to support the air raids unconditionally, sometimes we should not avoid invoking military means in view of the uncompromising attitudes of (Serbian) fighters and the complicated situation." He also expressed a desire to see NATO accept Poland as a full member. Poland is now only qualified to join NATO meetings under the "Partnership for Peace" scheme pushed by the U.S. administration of President Bill Clinton and the 16-nation alliance. The partnership scheme is designed to draw former Warsaw Pact adversaries closer to NATO without guaranteeing such countries would receive NATO defense if attacked by an enemy. Russia has balked at proposals to give full NATO membership to Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, while expressing interest in joining the partnership.
