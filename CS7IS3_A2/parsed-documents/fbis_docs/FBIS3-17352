At the time combat operations had not yet ceased on the territory of Abkhazia, but everything already pointed to the fact that Georgia had lost this war, and everyone was living in expectation of imminent victory and long-awaited peace. I talked with the Abkhaz leader about his vision of his republic's future after the war. The war ended 30 September. Over the six months since then Abkhazia has not had time to heal its wounds and to restore normal life, particularly as Russia has maintained an economic blockade of the republic throughout the winter. And yet it has survived! A bread-baking plant, a tobacco factory, and even enterprises such as Sukhumpribor (the only plant in the former Union to produce ballpoint pen refills) have been restored and have started working. Public transport is functioning, and old people on pensions are provided with three free meals a day in enterprise cafeterias. In Sukhumi the seafront, public gardens, and parks have been cleared of obstructions and traces of fighting, and coffee shops and small stores have started opening. Of course things are difficult, there is no fuel or raw materials for enterprises, there is a food shortage, people live mainly on what they themselves grow, and there is a catastrophic shortage of money, since Abkhazia has been cut off financially from both Georgia and Russia. It is difficult to organize a normal life for people -- as much as 40 percent of the housing is in an unfit state, blocks have been destroyed, and apartments looted. A special housing commission, which includes old people, representatives of the intelligentsia, and participants in the war, is now working under the Sukhumi Administration. Housing authorizations (temporary ones) are issued primarily to families of deceased persons, to people whose homes have been burned down, and to invalids from last year's war. Refugees are returning little by little to Abkhazia -- Russians, Armenians, Greeks, Georgians (but only those who did not participate in combat operations against it). The agonizingly difficult process of restoring a peaceful life is exacerbated by the fact that there has been no political settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz problem, and Abkhazia's status has not been defined. With the onset of spring people have suddenly started speaking once again of war and the possible resumption of combat operations on Abkhazian territory. The situation in this region has again started to exacerbate, and tension is increasing day by day. I talked about this with Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Abkhazia. He had just returned from a big foreign tour -- he had been to Switzerland, New York, and Moscow, where he met with officials and gave news conferences. "Surely not war again?" I asked him. "How do you rate the likelihood of such a development of events?" [Ardzinba] There are at least two circumstances that are intensifying aggressive sentiment in the Georgian leadership and prompting it to attempt to take revenge. These are, first, the signing of the treaty with Russia and, second, the support which Shevardnadze has once again received in the West, particularly during his recent U.S. trip. I must remind you that, when the war was still being waged in our country, the Russian leadership made repeated statements to the effect that no treaty would be signed with Georgia until the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia had been settled in full. But, despite its own statements and despite the fact that there has been no settlement and, what is more, there is still a threat that combat operations will be resumed, Russia signed the treaty. At the same time it recognized Georgia's territorial integrity. What does this mean from a legal viewpoint? Only that Russia has no territorial claims on Georgia. But the Georgian leadership interprets this as recognizing that Abkhazia is part of Georgia, although that is another matter -- a matter of our internal relations. [Shipunova] Vladislav Grigoryevich, what danger do you see in the treaty concluded by Russia and Georgia? [Ardzinba] The fact that it contains articles on the handover of arms to Georgia and on assistance for it in reorganizing the army. Thus, this is a repeat of the situation which existed in 1992, when Georgia obtained arms under the Tashkent Agreement -- after which it at once unleashed aggression. Today, by undertaking to arm Georgia, Russia is again giving it carte blanche to wage war. Shevardnadze's repeated statements, notably at a UN Security Council session, that the situation could get out of control have certainly not been accidental. Later he will most likely use them to justify renewing combat operations, particularly as there have already been several armed raids by Georgia in Galskiy Rayon, on the border. [Shipunova] And yet the treaty has not yet been ratified, has it? [Ardzinba] That is of no great importance, since a number of agreements have been signed in addition to the treaty, including agreements on the status of the border troops, on the status of the Russian Armed Forces on the territory of Georgia, etc., and these agreements include the same articles on military questions as the treaty itself. So these agreements have already started to be implemented, without any ratification. For example, Georgian youths will now be drafted into the border troops and will receive weapons; this work is already being developed. [Shipunova] Did you make any attempt to prevent the signing of the treaty, and did you have contacts in this regard with anyone in the Russian leadership? [Ardzinba] Unfortunately we are unable to have normal contacts with the leadership of Russia. All our appeals and warnings of the possible dangerous development of events have gone unheeded. Yet not only we but also many political forces in Russia itself have spoken out against the treaty! There was the appeal by all factions in the State Duma on the eve of President Yeltsin's trip to Tbilisi; all the North Caucasus leaders, who also had a negative attitude to the upcoming signing, gathered at the Foreign Ministry; there was the appeal by a whole series of Federation Council members.... To our great sorrow, all these opinions were also disregarded. I would like to emphasize that, in the event of Georgia's commencing combat operations, the responsibility for this will also lie with those who secured the signing of the Russian-Georgian treaty. [Shipunova] What forces are they, do you believe, and who in Russia could benefit by this? [Ardzinba] Certain circles in Russia take a strange stand on their own country's security and pursue a policy in the interests of the West rather than of Russia itself. But the West has no need either of a strong Georgia or of a strong Russia; it is simply using the present situation in our country to increase its own influence and even presence in this region. [Shipunova] Do you have in mind the plans to send UN peacemaking forces into Abkhazia? [Ardzinba] Shevardnadze does not conceal the reason why he wants the peacemaking forces. In order to disarm the Abkhaz army, abolish Abhazia's state power bodies, and set up some directorate to run our state. Thus, it is a question of Abkhazia's occupation by UN forces and of those forces' resolving the problems which Shevardnadze was unable to resolve with his tanks last year. He evidently received assurances of support in the United States. Shevardnadze's report to the Security Council spoke bluntly about creating a precedent for the use of "blue helmets" in hot spots in the former Union. As we know, there are many such spots on USSR territory of the USSR, and once it starts.... [Shipunova] You disagree with this version of a "settlement." What, then, are your proposals? [Ardzinba] The point is that our proposals and the Abkhaz side's position in this conflict in general are hushed up and distorted in every possible way both in Russia and in the West. I saw this for myself during my trip abroad and my meetings with representatives of international organizations. The Georgian side portrays the matter as though Abkhazia is also agreeable to the sending in of peacemaking troops throughout the territory from the Ingur [Inguri] river to the Psou river. This is not so, in actual fact. Whereas such troops really could fulfill a disengaging role along the Ingur, which forms the actual border between Abkhazia and Georgia, I cannot understand against whom they will guard us on the Psou, which forms the border between Abkhazia and Russia. Against attack from the Russian Federation? Or is it that someone would like to station his troops along Russia's borders? Our version of a settlement is that the opposing sides should pull back their troops a certain distance (3-5 km) on the border along the Ingur and that peacemaking forces should enter the corridor so formed. At the same time we have always said that Russian, not UN, troops should be used as peacemaking troops. International forces would be present here only as observers. If the chief aim is to be viewed as preventing the resumption of combat operations, this option is more than adequate. But the trouble is that Georgia's aim is quite different, because it does not seek a peace settlement and is not abandoning its plans to crush and subjugate Abkhazia, depriving it of its own statehood, i.e. it prefers the strong-arm option for resolving the problem. From November 1993 we held talks with the Georgian side in Geneva and New York, and a memorandum and a communique were prepared which said that the sides would no longer use force. There were several opportunities to sign these documents, but their signing was thwarted, the decisive role in this being played by Shevardnadze's U.S. trip and by the U.S. Administration's support for his plans. In the United States Shevardnadze signed a joint statement with the Americans on military cooperation, according to which the United States will assist Georgia in reorganizing and arming the army, and a document was also signed on the creation of a joint security program (?!). One gets the impression that UN membership gives a state the right to carry out both aggression and genocide against another people with impunity. Georgia started the war in Abkhazia two weeks after its admission to the United Nations. It was admitted contrary to the organization's Charter, being at that time a country without a legally elected leadership since its leaders had come in as the result of a coup d'etat. The decision itself was adopted by means of a poll [oprosnym putem], so it could be said that it was not Georgia that was admitted to the United Nations but Shevardnadze, evidently for his past "services." These violations also formed the basis of the Georgian leader's further unpunished conduct in respect of other peoples, moreover human rights are also being grossly violated in his own country, where what is virtually an authoritarian regime has been established and all dissidence is crushed. [Shipunova] Shevardnadze called the Georgian parliament's decision to dissolve the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet "hasty," thus apparently dissociating himself from it. What do you think about this? [Ardzinba] This is his usual subterfuge, an attempt to mislead. The decision adopted in Tbilisi stems directly from Shevardnadze's UN speech, and these are all links in the same chain. The Georgian parliament's decision is an unlawful document, it is.... You know, it is a work of literature, running to many pages. It contains such "pearls" as this, for example: "The Abkhazians seized part of sovereign Georgia -- Abkhazia...." It is illegal even from the viewpoint of their own constitution, which does not feature any Abkhaz ASSR [Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic] or any autonomous entities at all. It was by adopting such a constitution that they initiated the conflict in the first place. Relations between Georgia and Abkhazia ceased de facto two years ago. From a legal viewpoint Georgia and Abkhazia are in no way linked today. There has long been no Abkhaz ASSR. There is the Republic of Abkhazia with its own constitution and its own legally elected organs of power. Therefore it is possible to talk about one thing only -- the restoration of interstate relations between the two republics by concluding a treaty. We have been moving toward this, but such a development of events does not suit Georgia's leaders. So the Geneva talks are frustrated, the treaty with Russia is signed regardless of our positions and interests, then comes the appeal to the United Nations for military aid, and finally the totally illegal decision of the Georgian parliament is adopted on the dissolution of our republic's organs of power and even...on the institution of criminal proceedings against Abkhaz deputies! By all these actions the Georgian side unilaterally put an end to the process of a peaceful political settlement. [Shipunova] What do you intend to do in the present situation? [Ardzinba] My trip abroad had the purpose of conveying our position to the world community and opening eyes to the actual state of affairs, since Georgia misleads everyone about Abkhazia's statehood and about our historical and present relations. The concepts of "separatism" and "violation of territorial integrity" do not apply to our situation. I met with UN Security Council President Merimee, with UN Under Secretary General Goulding, with the ambassadors of a number of countries, and with representatives of the UN peacemaking forces command and also of the U.S. Department of State. I believe that the meetings were mutually useful, since Abkhazia's true position on all questions of our conflict was explained, and the Abkhaz leadership's official appeals to the Security Council were handed over. A great deal came as a revelation to my interlocutors, because hitherto they had listened to and heard just one side here -- the Georgian side. [Shipunova] It is known that you have also proposed to the leaders of the Federation components in the North Caucasus the holding of a meeting in Sukhumi.... [Ardzinba] Yes, and I received their agreement in principle to such a meeting. We have not yet decided finally on the venue, and the crux of the matter is not whether it is held in Sukhumi or in one of the North Caucasus capitals. The chief thing is that we are seeking support not abroad but from our own compatriots and brothers. We intend, in particular, to invite representatives of the peoples of the North Caucasus as permanent observers in Abkhazia. [Shipunova] Does all this mean that you are preparing for war? Will a possible decision to send UN troops onto the territory of Abkhazia mean the start of a new war? [Ardzinba] I must declare most definitely that we will perceive any decision to which the Abkhaz side does not agree as an attempt at occupation, with all the ensuing consequences. It is not hard to surmise what the result of this will be not only in Abkhazia but also throughout the Caucasus region. Today we have been forced to strengthen our defenses, but we are not abandoning hopes and efforts aimed at resuming the talks process. If the Georgian parliament repeals its illegal decision, that will open the way to continuing the peace talks. We do not want war, and we will do everything to prevent a new armed clash. This also applies to the question of refugees. Yes, we oppose the return to Abkhazia of persons who participated in combat operations with weapon in hand and who continue to pose a threat to Abkhazia's security. They cannot return until there has been a full settlement of the conflict. This insistence of ours is natural. The situation in Abkhazia today is peaceful and calm. We are endeavoring to maintain it. But, I repeat, much will depend on the stand that Russia takes this time. [Ardzinba ends] I was completing the preparation of this material for publication when I learned of a statement made by UN Secretary General Butrus Ghali. In it he admits that the necessary conditions do not exist in Abkhazia at present for sending in UN peacemaking forces. This statement inspires hope that common sense and political realism will, after all, triumph in the world community's attitude to the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. But Russia, nonetheless, will have the last say. It is still not too late to prevent new bloodshed.
