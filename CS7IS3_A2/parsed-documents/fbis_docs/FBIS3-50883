In today's edition of PROCESO, Scherer said: "I appreciate the inclusion of my name with those of Bishop Samuel Ruiz and Ms. Rigoberta Menchu," the other two persons proposed by the EZLN. "However, as a journalist I am committed to impartiality, which would be difficult for me to maintain in a double role as mediator and reporter of the events we are experiencing," said Scherer. "Thus I must exclusively fulfill the rules of my profession," he concluded. Today Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de Las Casas, announced in his homily that he accepted the offer to try to mediate the dialogue proposed by the EZLN, whereas the answer is yet to come from Menchu, a Guatemalan Indian who received the Nobel Peace Price in 1992. In the same edition, PROCESO disclosed that the EZLN had asked the three to "respond publicly to our proposal and, if the response is positive, mediate in this dialogue between the struggling poor people and their hangmen. For that purpose you are invited to the EZLN General Command in Lacandona jungle, where you will always be well received and protected so you can receive our proposals in writing." [Hamburg DPA in Spanish at 2032 GMT on 9 January 94 adds that Rigoberta Menchu has "confirmed today her willingness to accept the role of mediator in the conflict, although she expressed the need to first know the responses from Ruiz and Scherer and to have guaranteed approval from Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari."]
