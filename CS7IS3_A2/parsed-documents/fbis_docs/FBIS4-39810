However, his smile disappeared a few days ago after he completed his visit to Belgium and France on 4 June. "I told the leadership of the European Community Commission (ECC)," Akayev said at a meeting with journalists after the European visit, "that their stiff conditions and interest rates are neck-breaking for the Republic." The president called the ECC credit "holdup of a beggar." He told virtually the same to Indian foreign minister who visited Bishkek this week. The only difference was that he described the deplorable situation of his country. The president said that Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] does not enjoy the same rating as neighbouring Central Asian countries, adding "Turkmenia [Turkmenistan], for instance, is wallowing in petrodollars. The Turkmen president is building a palace worth 400 million U.S. dollars. "On the other hand, I could only scratch $500 million all over Europe for a three-year programme for reforming the Republic," he stressed. Kazakhstan, Akayev continued, leads the entire continent in the production of non-ferrous metals and is a member of the nuclear pool. Uzbekistan has large deposits of gas and oil. It annually produces over 100 tonnes of gold and harvests millions of tonnes of cotton. Kirghizia is a poor country, the president repeated: 98 per cent of all energy resources are imported by it at prices which are 50 per cent higher than on world markets. Akayev told journalists that he has been persuading the organisation for economic cooperation and development for two years to put the republic on the list of developing countries, since it needs easy-term credits to be repaid by instalments. "We are a small but proud people," he added. "If we take a loan, we should be sure that we shall pay it in time."
