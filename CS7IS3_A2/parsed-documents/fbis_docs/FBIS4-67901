The temporary capping of the Agni missile programme is being attributed to a financial crunch. The Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) had sought Rs. [rupees] 50 crore to conduct three more test launches in the near future, but the Government has not responded to the request. The postponement of the Agni programme is being interpreted as a concession to American concern about India's missile programme. The Clinton Administration has demanded that India's short-range missile, Prithvi, which is ready for induction in the armed forces, should also not be deployed. Army sources, however, say that they do not have any specific instructions about Prithvi as yet. Defence sources further claimed that India was not going to abandon its strategic missile programme under American pressure, but admitted that some delays would now be inevitable. Agni has been successfully test-launched thrice between 1989 and 1994. But at least six more tests are needed before it can be considered for deployment. Meanwhile, India is learnt to have finalised purchase of 30 fourth generation MiG-29M fighter aircraft from Russia. These highly sophisticated, look-down-and-shoot-down planes are equipped with the Doppler radar system which function in all weather conditions. The finalisation of the MiG-29M deal is evidently India's response to the proposed sale of 38 F-16 deep-penetration aircraft to Pakistan by the U.S. The MiG-29's will be acquired in two batches, with a score of planes joining the Indian Air Force over a three-month period starting in May. Known for their extreme manoeuvrability and high visibility range, the fly-by-wire Tumansky R-33D turbo engine-fitted MiG-29M's are rated to be better than the F-16's in most respects, except for their armament load capacity. The Russian planes, however, cost a fraction of their American counterpart, and the price of the MiG deal is estimated at Rs. 270 crores. There is every possibility that India may start getting the MiG-29M even before the U.S. Senate gives the nod for supply of F-16's to Pakistan. Highly placed sources confirmed that the purchase order for MiG-29M's was placed during the visit of Army Chief General B.C. Joshi to Moscow in March this year. However, officials in South Block said the Chief of the Army Staff had gone to Moscow to hold talks on spares that have not been forthcoming since the disintegration of the former USSR. But the officials did not rule out the possibility of buying MiG-29M's to augment the MiG-29 fleet. The Mikoyan series aircraft are comparable to the American F/A-18 Hornets. They are very effective against low-flying targets because of the shoot-down facility. The MiG-29's have a combat radius of 1,150 km (620 nautical miles) in a single sortie as compared to the F-16's 845 km. The Russian aircraft has a maximum speed level of mach 2.23, which is equal to 2,335 kmph or 1,260 knots. The F-16's, however, have nine external pylons and can carry an armament load of up to 4,700 kg. This is more than the MiG-29's capacity of 3,600 kg, which are loaded on to six pylons. But the MiG-29's are fitted with AA-10 and AA-11 air-to-air missiles and also have additional cavities to carry bombs and rockets. The Doppler radar and a six-barrel 30 mm Gattling-type guns are the other distinct features of the MiG-29. Meanwhile, it is understood that India has sorted out the problem of spares for the armed forces. Sources disclosed that India okayed the MiG-29M deal only after an assurance that the Bangalore-based Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) would serve as the service outlet for all types of MiG's for the entire South and South-East Asia region. Sources in the South Block said India was in the process of selling a particular series of the aircraft to Malaysia, whose Air Force personnel were trained in Pathankot recently. India is also in the process of negotiating with the Malayasian Government on the sale of Russian Mi-25 attack helicopters. These helicopters are used for anti-armour warfare and can provide an airborne platform to achieve tactical battle area supremacy. The Mi-25 is believed to be an answer to the American Cobra helicopter. Meanwhile, Agni, successfully test-launched twice, has signalled India's emergence as a growing power in the entire Asian region. The 1,800-2,500 km range missile can cover a large part of China, West Asia and South Asia. Even if the Americans are likely to use every means to make India sign the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), ministerial sources said India would not under any circumstances abandon its missile programme. But the sources did not rule out a delay in the missile plans. While the Agni continues to be India's best bargaining block, the Prithvi missiles are ready for induction in the Army.
