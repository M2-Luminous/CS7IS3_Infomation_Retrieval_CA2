The mission has brought a renewed variant of the Russian plan on the Karabakh settlement. The plan is based on Armenia's and Azerbaijan's compliance with the Russian initiative and their readiness to withdraw their forces form the hostilities zone. According to the renewed plan, several observation points will be deployed along the disengagement line around Nagorno-Karabakh. Representatives of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia will be in the composition of these posts. Main coordinating headquarters of peacekeeping forces which are to control the cease-fire agreement will apparently be based in the Azerbaijani city of Agdam and Karabakh regional center of Khankendi (Mardakert). The same sources reported that Vladimir Kazimirov, special envoy of the Russian president, would participate in the Baku talks.
