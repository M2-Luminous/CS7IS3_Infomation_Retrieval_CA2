"Everything has been going smoothly since the unification of yuan exchange rates at the start of this year," said Wang, who took the post as the top leader of the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer two months ago. The bank's business in foreign exchange settlement has not been affected by the unification. Hard currency earners, most of which are foreign trade firms, have sold all their foreign exchange certificates (FEC) to the bank according to state regulations. "The working capital of foreign exchange in our bank has remained stable," said Wang. The first quarter of 1994 is supposed to be the transitional period for China's foreign exchange control system to convert from the old to the new. During this period, the Bank of China is under instruction to withdraw FEC and set up a special records file for enterprises to register the amounts in hard currency earnings they sell to the bank. Wang declined to say the amount of fec withdrawn by the bank so far, but hinted that through spending and exchanging them for U.S. dollars, it will not take long before the special banknotes are completely withdrawn by the bank. With eight years of experience as BOC branch chief in London and then in New York, the 42-year-old Wang is well-known for his expertise in gold and foreign exchange trading. The unification of yuan exchange rates has not caused big rises or falls in the rate so far. Wang expects the present 8.7:1 exchange rate to remain stable in the foreseeable future. "China's overall economic growth is healthy, foreign trade keeps increasing and the government is stepping up efforts to control inflation. All these are favorable for the yuan to stay stable," said Wang. To pave the way for the second stage of foreign exchange reform, or the operation of the new system which will start as of April 1, said Wang, the Bank of China is improving its RMB clearing system and mobilizing required amounts of capital funds in both Chinese yuan and hard currencies. In responding to clients' growing awareness of risks, the bank has set about establishing a quotation system for future yuan trading, Wang disclosed.
