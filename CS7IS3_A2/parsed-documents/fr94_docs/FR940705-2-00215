FR940705-2-00215 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix K&hyph;VI. Footnotes of Appendix K Appendix K&hyph;VI&hyph;A. This table is derived from the text in Appendices G and K and is not to be used in lieu of Appendices G and K. Appendix K&hyph;VI&hyph;B. The criteria in this grid address only the biological hazards associated with organisms containing recombinant DNA. Other hazards accompanying the large scale cultivation of such organisms (e.g., toxic properties of products; physical, mechanical, and chemical aspects of downstream processing) are not addressed and shall be considered separately, albeit in conjunction with this grid. Appendix K&hyph;VII. Definitions to Accompany Containment Grid and Appendix K Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;A. Accidental Release. An accidental release is the unintentional discharge of a microbiological agent (i.e., microorganism or virus) or eukaryotic cell due to a failure in the containment system. Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;B. Biological Barrier. A biological barrier is an impediment (naturally occurring or introduced) to the infectivity and/or survival of a microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell once it has been released into the environment. Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;C. Closed System. A closed system is one in which by its design and proper operation, prevents release of a microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell contained therein. Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;D. Containment. Containment is the confinement of a microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell that is being cultured, stored, manipulated, transported, or destroyed in order to prevent or limit its contact with people and/or the environment. Methods used to achieve this include: physical and biological barriers and inactivation using physical or chemical means. Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;E. De minimis Release. De minimis release is the release of: (i) viable microbiological agents or eukaryotic cells that does not result in the establishment of disease in healthy people, plants, or animals; or (ii) in uncontrolled proliferation of any microbiological agents or eukaryotic cells. Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;F. Disinfection. Disinfection is a process by which viable microbiological agents or eukaryotic cells are reduced to a level unlikely to produce disease in healthy people, plants, or animals. Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;G. Good Large Scale Practice Organism. For an organism to qualify for Good Large Scale Practice consideration, it must meet the following criteria [Reference: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Recombinant DNA Safety Considerations, 1987, p. 34&hyph;35]: (i) the host organism should be non-pathogenic, should not contain adventitious agents and should have an extended history of safe large scale use or have built-in environmental limitations that permit optimum growth in the large scale setting but limited survival without adverse consequences in the environment; (ii) the recombinant DNA-engineered organism should be non-pathogenic, should be as safe in the large scale setting as the host organism, and without adverse consequences in the environment; and (iii) the vector/insert should be well characterized and free from known harmful sequences; should be limited in size as much as possible to the DNA required to perform the intended function; should not increase the stability of the construct in the environment unless that is a requirement of the intended function; should be poorly mobilizable; and should not transfer any resistance markers to microorganisms unknown to acquire them naturally if such acquisition could compromise the use of a drug to control disease agents in human or veterinary medicine or agriculture. Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;H. Inactivation. Inactivation is any process that destroys the ability of a specific microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell to self-replicate. Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;I. Incidental Release. An incidental release is the discharge of a microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell from a containment system that is expected when the system is appropriately designed and properly operated and maintained.
