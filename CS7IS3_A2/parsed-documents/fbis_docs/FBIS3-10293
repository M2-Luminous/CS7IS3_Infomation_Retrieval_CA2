He is accompanied by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and a group of high-ranking officials from his cabinet. Itamar Franco is the first head of state to be received by Rafael Caldera as Venezuelan president after taking office one month ago. Sources close to the Brazilian Government said the objective of a working meeting on Friday is to develop the economic foundations for the creation of a trade agreement to be known as Merconorte. Despite the importance of the meeting, the presidents do not plan to sign any agreements since the two countries already have more than 36 agreements ranging from cultural exchanges to technical and trade cooperation.
