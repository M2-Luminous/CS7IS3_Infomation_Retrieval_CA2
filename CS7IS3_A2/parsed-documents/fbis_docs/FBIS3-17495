The Chechen republic attached no other conditions to the conclusion of a treaty with Russia. If it were suggested, as a preliminary condition, that Chechnya be regarded as a constituent part of the Russian Federation, it would make no sense for Groznyy to send a delegation to Moscow, said Akbulatov. He continued that, detrimental as they were to the Russian interests, the political games around Chechnya would inevitably produce a new Russian-Caucasian war, and claimed that President Dudayev was concerned exactly about that possibility. Akbulatov dismissed, as an obvious journalistic error, reports that the Moscow-based negotiations had been broken-off and the Chechens were to blame for it. He said the negotiations were continuing and no chance would be overlooked for a reasonable compromise. The Chechen and Russian delegations were to meet again on Saturday, March 26. Chechnya was seeking the closest and neighborly relationship with Russia, said Akbulatov, with sovereignty as a safeguard against the possible repetition of an attempt to exterminate the Chechens.
