To this effect, Miquel Roca said at the end of the committee meeting that an end must be put to the speculation about a possible confidence motion or an early general election: "People cannot continue to speculate with a constant electoral atmosphere," asserted Roca, for whom yesterday's result seems to have no consequence for parliamentary support for the government. As Jordi Pujol had already stated Sunday [12 Jun] evening, the CiU leaders yesterday assessed the results as a clear endorsement of the nationalist coalition's support for the government, and Roca even asserted that because of "our voters' mandate, as reflected in the results," CiU "is now much more obliged than before" to continue the same state policy. "The PSOE will do whatever it thinks fit, but we have already confirmed our intention to continue to support the government," Roca continued. Nevertheless, in his opinion, CiU's support depends on "the government's maintaining its intention to strengthen the economic policy that we have promoted and its way of tackling autonomy policy," he said. Roca added that the agreement with the government on autonomy policy is at the "final stage, not just of negotiation but of finalization," and he hopes it will be completed within the next few days. The view that Sunday's results endorse CiU's political activity in both the European and state spheres and in Catalonia was one of the points discussed by the liaison committee, which also emphasized that the coalition has achieved its aims, which were to win in Catalonia for the first time in other than autonomous community elections and to win back the third seat that it held between 1987 and 1989. The liaison committee also considered the fact that CiU's victory has a balanced distribution throughout Catalonia, since the coalition prevailed in the areas of Tarragona, Lleida, Girona, and Barcelona. The victory with a lead of almost 9 percent over the Socialist Party of Catalonia in the city of Barcelona is of a special nature for CiU, which Miquel Roca highlighted in saying that following this result "we have the greatest hope and confidence of success" in next year's municipal elections. Both Roca and Democratic Union of Catalonia [UDC] leader Josep Antoni Duran Lleida expressed the desire for the pact between the two parties for these local elections to be signed before the summer, although some sectors of Democratic Convergence of Catalonia [CDC] would prefer an internal debate on relations with Union to be conducted before the agreement is concluded. The disagreements between the two parties on the organization of the campaign, which Union made clear and which culminated in the angry walkout by all its leaders at the end of Sunday's news conference, at which Duran Lleida was not called on to speak and at which some Christian Democratic leaders had problems in gaining entry to the hall, were raised formally by Union at the liaison committee meeting. The two parties decided to draw up reports separately and then call a restricted meeting in order to study them, but while UDC wants this to be done this week, CDC does not feel the same urgency. Convergence sources told this newspaper that there was not the slightest mistake in the campaign, contrary to what Union believes, and attributed any possible shortcoming to the large number of meetings which CiU held during that time. Duran Lleida explained his sudden walkout from the election headquarters by stating that "if the interpretation of the results was made by the CDC secretary general, thanks were given by the CDC candidate, and the political analysis was made by the CDC chairman, it is clear that it was a very appropriate news conference for a party but not for a coalition." Duran Lleida, who stated a few days ago that he felt "uncomfortable" in having to support the Socialist Party, said yesterday that his stance had not changed, "although I can feel rather more pleased following the victory in the European elections," but he demanded a gesture by the PSOE to show that it wishes to continue to have CiU's support. Jordi Pujol, who would make no statement at the end of the liaison committee meeting, later asserted in an interview broadcast on TV3 at 1200 that the People's Party "cannot afford the luxury of lapsing into fanaticism, intransigence, and anti-Catalanism," because this would have "unforeseeable consequences" for the country, referring to the insults against the Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] premier made by PP supporters celebrating the conservative party's victory in Madrid. "The language, culture, and whatever affects Catalonia's national identity take priority for CiU, and everybody should know that we cannot be counted on for anything without taking this into account," Pujol stated in the interview. Despite this, Pujol expressed his desire and confidence that the People's Party leadership will lay down a policy totally different from what could be deduced from those shouts: "I expect People's Party policy to be dictated not by a few hotheaded and anti-Catalan people but by people with a sense of responsibility," he said, asserting that the party "will be in the Spanish Government some day or other." He also reiterated that CiU suffered no erosion in these elections because of its support for the Socialist government, and that "if it depends on us and if the policy we demand in the economic and autonomy spheres is pursued, we will maintain our line."
