Elsewhere, Britain and France have warned Baghdad of the consequences of the attacks carried out recently against UN employees, correspondents, and foreign nationals in north Iraq. [passage omitted] Regarding reports about the re-formation of the Popular Army in Iraq, Dr. Hamid al-Bayyati, representative of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI], said that Saddam has issued a decision to that effect, together with instructions concerning the details and rules governing the commanders and personnel of this army, which is tantamount to a militia for the ruling party. Dr. al-Bayyati's statement, issued by the SAIRI support office in London, a copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has received, said that the authorities have designated several camps to train the battalions and brigades formed recently from partisan elements, on whom Saddam's instructions "imposed voluntary service," in Popular Army formations for six to 12 months. The statement pointed out that discontent has spread among ruling party elements. They expressed their discontent at Saddam's decision, which they believe means that the country is experiencing a serious political, military, and security crisis, and that they should expect an important event as a result of which they will become the victims of one of Saddam's whims manifested in his internal and external wars. Dr. al-Bayyati pointed out that the Iraqi regime disbanded the Popular Army after the war with Iran because it had represented a huge financial burden for the regime and an administrative vacuum during the war. The statement added: It is also worth mentioning that, because the regime has been exposed to real dangers threatening its existence at this stage, and for the sake of staying in power, it has taken new steps to protect itself with more than one security cordon to allow it to maneuver and unleash its military forces to carry out tasks that are still shrouded in ambiguity and could be launched at any moment.
