FBIS4-14466 "drsov062_s_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-062 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 Georgia State Security Service Subject to Parliamentary Control State Security Service Subject to Parliamentary Control LD3103104794 Tbilisi Radio Tbilisi Network in Georgian 0400 GMT 31 Mar 94 LD3103104794 Tbilisi Radio Tbilisi Network Georgian BFN [Text] We have received a resolution on subjecting the State Security Service to parliament, and Igor Giorgadze has been confirmed head of the State Security Service. Here is an interview with Igor Giorgadze: [Begin Giorgadze recording] If we are talking about Georgian traditions, then I must say that we have little tradition within the security service. We used to have a security service that was built on Soviet traditions. We shall retain the good features of that tradition and, in fact, we have already done so. The bad features that the society rejected will not be implemented. As for today's confirmation, of course the factor of trust is worth congratulating, but with this confirmation we have not gained anything other than a burden. We must work for the welfare of our motherland. The security service has major problems to tackle. People are looking at this service with hope and we must not shatter our peoples' hopes.
