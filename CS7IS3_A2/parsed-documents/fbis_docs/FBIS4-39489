FBIS4-39489 "drsov110_f_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 National Affairs Interior Ministry Statement on Action by Crimean Official Interior Ministry Statement on Action by Crimean Official LD0706152394 Kiev UNIAN in Ukrainian 1200 GMT 7 Jun 94 LD0706152394 Kiev UNIAN Ukrainian BFN [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- UNIAN reported yesterday that Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimea's internal affairs minister, met in an isolation remand cell with Citizen Rayil Khayrov who is accused of the November 1993 murder of Crimean Tatar leader Yuriy Osmanov. The main public relations center of Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry assessed these actions by Valeriy Kuznetsov, whom Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry does not recognize as head of the Crimean militia, as illegal. Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry's official explanation stresses that "R.K. Khayrov, born in 1968, was previously sentenced to two years of corrective labor. He is presently being held criminally liable in accordance with Article 93 `A' (murder for mercenary motives) and Article 42 (robbery with assault) of Ukraine's criminal code for the murder of Citizen Osmanov Yu. B., committed on 6 November 1993. Notwithstanding that the defendant committed the gravest crime against an individual and in disregard of existing norms and regulations, V. Ye. Kuznetsov issued an instruction to bring Khayrov out of the cell where he was in detention, into an individual office for a meeting with him. The employees of the isolation remand center were ordered to leave the premises immediately. The private conversation between V.Ye. Kuznetsov and the defendant lasted for six minutes. Thus, by his actions he grossly violated Article 12 of the law of Ukraine "On preliminary confinement," Article 162 of the Criminal Procedural Code of Ukraine, and also a number of clauses of the instruction on the procedure for detaining individuals taken into custody and defendants in isolation remand cells of Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs. In accordance with these normative acts, V. Ye. Kuznetsov, even if he were a minister, did not have the right to such a meeting with Khayrov without written permission from the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Court, which is currently examining this matter. In arranging a personal meeting with the defendant, V. Ye. Kuznetsov exceeded his official authority, which could lead to a leak of investigation secrets and other negative consequences. There is not a single doubt that this was done purposefully, consciously, and intentionally. The disdain and self-seeking of V. Ye. Kuznetsov in achieving his intentions are also undoubted. While addressing occasional recommendations to the personnel of the Republic of Crimea's internal affairs bodies to abide by legality and the provision of law and order, in practice he is insolently disregarding the current laws of Ukraine."
