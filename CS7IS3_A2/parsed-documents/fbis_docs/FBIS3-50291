Hajrudin Sermic reports from Maglaj that "one of the heaviest days of war is behind the people of Maglaj, at least in terms of the number of shells fired at the positions of the fighters of the 201st Brigade and the villages on the free territory. Three tank and infantry attacks were repelled in the Pazaric, Sedra, and (Rovin) area along the newly established defense positions, even though the chetniks and the ustasha fired over 2,000 shells from their rich arsenal. However, the fighters of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade again demonstrated heroism, morale, and patriotism, and repulsed all the attacks." The report says that "in order to justify the great losses in his ranks, and to reduce at least to some extent the panic felt by his fighters and the people of Zepa, Lozancic, commander of the treacherous 111th HVO Zepa Brigade, has been deceiving the public on Croatian Radio by claiming that they have captured some point or another. But that is a lie as his fighters have not advanced a single millimeter, nor will they. They can only move backward." Reporting from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "the attacks on the free Brcko territory are not letting up. After futile attempts yesterday at infiltrating sabotage groups in white camouflage uniforms behind our lines, the [Serb] enemy intensified the shelling of the Brcko defense lines and the civilian targets inside the free territory. Vranovaca was again exposed to the heaviest artillery attacks. This stronghold near Brcko, which was of extreme strategic importance even in World War II, is one of the main targets of the Serbian aggressor in this offensive. Last night Vranovaca was pounded with howitzers, tanks, 60-mm, 82-mm, and 120-mm mortars, Praga, and Bofors guns." The report says that "at the same time the aggressor was bringing in reinforcements to Lipovac, Donja Brka, and Cadjavac. The large forces that the aggressor has amassed on the Brcko front do not seem to be having the least effect on the low morale of the chetniks. Interchetnik clashes have been escalating into armed conflicts with increasing frequency. Last night at 1945 [1845 GMT] the chetniks from Stari Brod and Donja Brka fired at each other with small arms, and later even threw hand grenades at each other's positions. Last night there were also small arms fire exchanges among the chetniks in the Cadjavac region." Describing the situation in Sarajevo, the studio announcer says that "early this morning the chetniks started an artillery barrage against the city. Howitzer shells and mortars fired from Krivoglavci landed at Point 850, Jezera, and Vis. From the direction of Okruglica four howitzer shells were fired at the Jewish cemetery, while a howitzer from Metalka fired at Kobilja Glava. At just after 0700 the aggressor in Nedzarici fired mortars at Dobrinja, and artillery shells fired from Gavrica Brdo landed on Donji Kotorac and Butmir."
