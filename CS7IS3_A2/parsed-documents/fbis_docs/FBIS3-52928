INTP Chairman Muzaffer Arslan said Tuesday the system would be established around Irbil within 15 days, followed probably by Karkuk and Kifri. He said that various arrangements had been made with certain private TV channels in order to obtain some program packages. "We have also arranged our dish to pick up the broadcasts of the International Turkish Channel, Avrasya," Arslan said. He added that various groups were "disturbed" by the "activities of the Turkmans." When asked who these were, Arslan said, "Our relations with the Baghdad government have not been good. Nor are we on good terms with its extension in northern Iraq. Moreover, some Kurdish groups in northern Iraq are disturbed, because we keep our distance from them." Arslan noted that a radio station in Turkish, called Voice of the Turkmans, had become the most popular in the region. Training for Teachers INTP has also established two schools in northern Iraq, Karaoglan Primary School in Kifri and Dogus Primary School in Irbil. "But we are in deep need of teachers and we have held talks with the Turkish Ministry of Education to provide schools," he said. "We are also appealing to retired teachers here who would like to help us." Arslan said 30 to 40 teachers would come to Turkey this summer for training.
