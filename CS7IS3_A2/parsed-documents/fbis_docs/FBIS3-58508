Now that this has not happened and extremism appears to enjoy a considerable following, people are rapidly drawing the opposite conclusion. Both reasonings are wrong. It is simply inconceivable, in the light of history, that Russia should change overnight." [Amelink] Your government is positive about NATO's Partnership for Peace program, and even wants to take part in it. Does that not represent a break with Finland's policy of neutrality? [Aho] In this context, it is important to make a distinction between the countries of East Europe, whose security guarantees disappeared with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, and the neutral and nonaligned countries in Europe. I view the Partnership for Peace as an offer of closer cooperation with NATO. We are not out to set new rules in the area of our security. Our interest extends to that part of the program aimed at peacekeeping activities. The Finns have a long tradition in this area. Some people are suggesting that we are interested in the project in the same way as the countries of East Europe. That is not the case. The foundation of Finnish foreign policy remains nonalignment and a strong national defense. [end Aho] The visit by Prime Minister Aho, who arrived from Dublin and who will be traveling to Luxembourg this afternoon, falls within the framework of Finland's possible accession to the European Union [EU]. These negotiations must be completed by 1 March. Finland is primarily concerned with measures to protect its agriculture, the prime minister said: "We have to struggle with a number of structural problems for which the EU will have to allow transitional measures. We need time to adapt to the rules of the EU." A tougher matter is the climate, which limits the productive period of our agricultural sector. Despite the greenhouse effect, there is no possibility of changing that. Consequently, a separate system of support loans is needed for farmers in the Nordic countries. There are already separate rules in the EU for the mountainous areas. We do not have those. A new and good criterion to take account of and that would benefit our farmers is the degree of latitude. Using this criterion, the EU can prevent other countries from using the same rule to obtain support for their farmers. A separate rule is primarily of interest for supporting the existing social structure in the Finnish countryside. [Amelink] The opinion polls give a changing picture of the Finnish attitude toward the EU. Do you expect a positive outcome from the referendum this fall on EU accession? [Aho] Many people, and especially those in my own Center Party, are indeed against it. There is a certain amount of hesitation about whether or not you can trust the conditions of accession. However, I expect that the majority will agree if we can obtain favorable conditions during the negotiations in Brussels. They would be crucial in the final judgement. [Amelink] Are you thinking of holding the accession referendums in Norway, Sweden, and Finland on the same day? [Aho] That is one option that cannot be ruled out. However, it is still too early to speculate on it. We still need a few more weeks. [Amelink] The Finnish economy is currently in a slump. Despite inflation of about 1 percent, unemployment remains above 20 percent. Can you see light at the end of the tunnel? [Aho] In early fall the unemployment rate stopped rising, but I must admit that this really is an enormous problem. If investment resumes -- and there are initial signs that this is beginning -- then the situation in the labor market will gradually improve. The fact that our exports have risen considerably recently will increase room for new investments, but the employment situation will certainly not improve in such a dramatically quick way.
