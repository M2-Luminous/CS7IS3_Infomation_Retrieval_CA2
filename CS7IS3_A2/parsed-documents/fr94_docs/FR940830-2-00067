FR940830-2-00067 FR940830-2-00040 Gene Therapy Production Issues; Public Meeting AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a public meeting to discuss gene therapy production issues. The meeting is designed to obtain public testimony from biomedical researchers, academia, biotechnology associations, governmental agencies, and individuals and organizations with relevant information concerning gene vector production issues. DATES: The public meeting will be held on Monday, September 12, 1994, from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., immediately following the National Institutes of Health, Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee meeting. ADDRESSES: The public meeting will be held at the National Institutes of Health, Bldg. 31C, 9000 Rockville Pike, conference room 7, Bethesda, MD. No registration is required. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For information regarding the meeting: John G. Bishop, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM&hyph;515), Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;1448, 301&hyph;402&hyph;1336, FAX 301&hyph;496&hyph;7027. For information regarding this notice: Stephen M. Ripley, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM&hyph;635), Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph; 1448, 301&hyph;594&hyph;3074. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The field of gene therapy is rapidly evolving. New approaches to genetic modification of somatic cells for the mitigation of human disease are being developed in ever increasing numbers. The investigators who wish to pursue gene therapy approaches are also increasing in number. FDA is interested in exploring with the public and industry means to overcome impediments to the development of useful therapeutics for a variety of human diseases without diminishing patient safety. As part of this process, FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research is holding a public meeting to discuss practical concerns relating to gene therapy vector production issues. The objectives of the meeting will be to: (1) Solicit public testimony from biomedical researchers, university faculty members and administrators, biotechnology associations, Federal and government agencies, and individuals and organizations with relevant information concerning gene vector production experience; (2) solicit public testimony from the participants concerning potential barriers to gene therapy vector product development and innovation, and the means to overcome these barriers; (3) discuss quality control issues that have arisen for gene therapy vector products; and (4) discuss current good manufacturing practices and good laboratory practices and their application to gene therapy vector production from the earliest phases of the investigational new drug application process through the manufacture of licensed products. In addition to the participants mentioned above, patient and/or consumer organizations and other interested parties are invited to participate in the meeting. Information presented at the meeting will be considered by FDA in the development of future points to consider and other guidance documents. Dated: August 24, 1994. William K. Hubbard, Interim Deputy Commissioner for Policy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21469 Filed 8&hyph;26&hyph;94; 11:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
