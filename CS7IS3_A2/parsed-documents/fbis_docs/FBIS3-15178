This was stated at a briefing for Russian journalists held at the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry by Vitaliy Churkin, a Russian deputy foreign minister. According to the high-ranking Russian diplomat, this political step is important because in the course of political developments Tuzla has lately turned into a second symbol of unresolved problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina, next to Sarajevo. As long ago as several months or possibly even a year, the opening of the airport in Tuzla was declared to be one of the principal goals of the European Union; the issue was also mentioned in NATO resolutions several times. We have been feeling a certain aggravation of the situation around the Tuzla airport recently, V. Churkin said. We have, he said, been engaged on this issue for a long time and had discussed the subject with the Serbs. At the time they had said to us that they were greatly concerned over the fact that Tuzla airport would be used by the Muslim side for military deliveries. They said that appropriate monitoring of the procedure was essential. Some time ago Russia put forward the idea that the presence there of Russian observers, along with other observers, was needed to remove this concern. For a long time we told all those interested in this matter about this readiness on our part, the Russian deputy foreign minister noted, and it should be said that this readiness on Russia's part was immediately welcomed. "I am speaking especially of this," V. Churkin emphasized, "because somehow it emerges that after yesterday's statement some people have suddenly been attempting to present matters as though the Russians had almost deceived someone when they issued this statement and suddenly prepared this decision." In actual fact there was a multilateral UN meeting on 25 February at which this issue was also discussed in quite some detail and at which it was stated that the opening of Tuzla airport might be pushed through as early as 7 March. That is why, the high-ranking Russian diplomat considers, noone should be surprised in the slightest that such an agreement was finally reached precisely during the high-level meeting in Moscow between the Russian foreign minister and the leader of the Bosnian Serbs. Vitaliy Churkin continued that now it is up to the Muslim side. The discussion of the problem with the Bosnian Serbs was held on the basis of a document that was offered to Serbs and Muslims by Yasushi Akashi, the representative of the UN secretary- general for the former Yugoslavia. It provides for the international monitoring and the presence of Muslim and Serbian contact groups on the territory of the airport in Tuzla to have a truly clear picture that this airport is used for humanitarian and not for some other purpose. Vitaliy Churkin noted that in this connection "I am at the moment, frankly speaking, a little bit surprised that the Muslim leadership is speaking out against it. The Muslim leadership is also speaking out against the presence of Russian observers and against the presence of a contact Serbian group in this airport. It is difficult for me to understand why all that is happening." The deputy foreign minister of the Russian Federation said that "we do not need this; we are going to feed, help, and ensure the humanitarian aid not for the Russian population. In the first instance this will be the Muslim population, and I repeat, Serbs and Croats, as well, if they live in this area. I cannot understand at all why somebody should express any doubts about it." Vitaliy Churkin said he was sure that this turn of events had not been a surprise either for the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina or for the Muslim side. He expressed the hope that in the next few days all the details of the operation to open the airport will have been settled so that the airport can start to function and humanitarian aid be delivered to the population of this area of Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to the deputy foreign minister "a representative of the Emergencies Ministry is now in Zagreb after being in Belgrade yesterday, because, as you know, that organization is still engaged in the delivery of humanitarian goods by land." In this connection he drew attention to the fact that the Russians involved in this operation will be not military people and not from the Defense Ministry but precisely from the Ministry of Civil Defense, Emergencies, and Elimination of the Consequences of Natural Disasters, which was formerly the state committee for emergencies. They are well trained people. According to him the Russian side intends to act strictly within the framework of the scheme and the operation being prepared by Mr. Akashi and the leaderships of the former Yugoslavia itself and Bosnia-Herzegovina. As for the agreement on the creation of a Croatian-Muslim federation, it should be said that a preliminary agreement has been prepared on the creation of a confederation between this Croatian-Muslim federation and Serbia. "This has not come as news to us," V. Churkin emphasized. "I must express my satisfaction at the character of the contacts and consultations that we have had with the American side and in particular with my American counterpart, envoy Redman, because right from the outset he informed me in detail of his plans." "It seems to me," he said, "that Chuck Redman is engaged in studying some interesting possibilities which might, if they turned out right, certainly help the achievement of a Bosnian settlement. I have not yet had an opportunity to study the documents in detail, but it is a matter of settling a number of aspects of Muslim-Croatian relations. If this agreement is correctly incorporated within the general context of a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, it could full well prove useful. However this probably requires still closer interaction on our part with the Americans and also with the other countries that are displaying a keen interest in the problems of achieving a Bosnian settlement."
