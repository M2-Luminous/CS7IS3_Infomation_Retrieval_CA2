Proposals from national organizations involving language instruction programs should provide for those programs supported in the past year information on the criteria for evaluation, including levels of instruction, degrees of intensiveness, facilities, methods for measuring language proficiency (including pre- and post-testing), instructors' qualifications, and budget information showing estimated costs per student. A description of affirmative action policies and practices must be included in the application. Applicants should include certifications of compliance with the provisions of: (1) the Drug-Free Workplace Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;690), in accordance with Appendix C of 22 CFR 137, Subpart F; and (2) Section 319 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;121), in accordance with Appendix A of 22 CFR 138, New Restrictions on Lobbying Activities. Budget Since funds provided by AID would come separately from its East European (including the Baltic states) and New Independent States programs, proposals must indicate how the requested funds will be distributed by region, country (to the extent possible), and activity. Subsequently, grant recipients must report expenditures by region, country, and activity. Applicants should familiarize themselves with OMB Circular A&hyph;110, ``Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education *␣*␣* Uniform Administrative Requirements,'' and OMB Circular A&hyph;133, ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Learning and Other Non-Profit Institutions'' and indicate or provide the following information: (1) Whether the organization falls under OMB Circular No. A&hyph;21, ``Cost Principles for Education Institutions,'' or OMB Circular No. A&hyph;122, ``Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations;'' (2) A detailed program budget indicating direct expenses by program element, by region (the independent states of the former Soviet Union or Eastern Europe), indirect costs, and the total amount requested. NB: Indirect costs are limited to 10 percent of total direct program costs. Applicants requesting funds to supplement a program having other sources of support should submit a current budget for the total program and an estimated future budget for it showing how specific lines in the budget would be affected by the allocation of requested grant funds. Other funding sources and amounts, when known, should be identified; (3) The applicant's cost-sharing proposal, if applicable, containing appropriate details and cross references to the requested budget; (4) The organization's most recent audit report (the most recent U.S. Government audit report if available) and the name, address and point of contact of the audit agency. All payments will be made to grant recipients through the Department of State by wire transfers. Technical Review The Advisory Committee for Studies of Eastern Europe and the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union will evaluate applications on the basis of the following criteria: (1) Responsiveness to the substantive provisions set forth above in PART II, Program Information (40 points); (2) The professional qualifications of the applicant's key personnel and their experience conducting national competitive award programs of the type the applicant proposes on the countries of Eastern Europe and the independent states of the former Soviet Union (30 points); and (3) Budget presentation and cost effectiveness (30 points).
