The talks reached a comprehensive agreement which will further unclog the channel of world trade and create favorable conditions for the development of world trade and economy in the late 20th century and early 21st century. The world economy has been in a recession since the late 1980's. Under such a situation, all countries have adopted various measures to revive their economy, but without any remarkable success. So, to strive for success in the Uruguay Round of talks has been regarded as the only chance for getting the world economy out of stagnation. Since the GATT became effective in 1948, seven rounds of talks have been held, tariffs have dropped drastically, and the world's trade volume has risen from $57 billion in 1945 to $3.7 trillion in 1992. The GATT played a valuable role as an impetus to economic development which should not be overlooked. The vast number of developing countries, considering the interests of the whole, have made relevant concessions and greatly contributed to the success of the recent round of talks. However, the Western powers nearly ruined such a historic opportunity despite the fact that they would benefit the most from the success of the talks. The Uruguay Round of talks was originally scheduled to end three years ago, but the talks were repeatedly delayed due to sharp differences between the European nations and the United States over such issues as trade in agricultural products, financial services, subsidies to aircraft manufacturers, and trade in audio and visual products; and at times the talks almost reached a breaking point. Many people with breadth of vision warned that the failure of the talks would inevitably lead to intensified protectionism and consequences worse than anything imaginable. After repeated bargaining back and forth, the European side and the U.S. side at last had to make compromises. The Uruguay Round of talks had 117 participating parties and dealt with 21 items, including market access, tariff reduction, service trade, and intellectual property. The text of the final agreement reached by the talks is as long as 450 pages, containing 45 independent documents. The major achievements are as follows: First, the problem of market access for almost all industrial and agricultural products has been solved. All non-tariff barriers which various countries have set up over the years to protect their industry and agriculture will be gradually removed in next 10 years. Second, tariffs for industrial goods will be drastically reduced, by approximately 40 percent. Third, developed countries will reduce tariffs for agricultural products by 36 percent in six years, while developing nations will reduce the tariffs by 24 percent in 10 years; and farm subsidies will be reduced by 36 percent in six years, and the export of subsidized farm products will be reduced by 21 percent. Fourth, banking, telecommunications, and other services, as well as intellectual property, will be placed for the first time under the control of the GATT. In addition, the agreement also deals with the establishment of multilateral trade organizations. The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks is a welcome event for all countries. As Sutherland has said, the agreement means "more trade, more investment, more employment, and better income" for everyone. All parties, both developed countries and developing countries, will benefit to varying degrees. Of course, countries with more developed commodity economies and greater exports will benefit more. For this reason, developed countries will benefit much more than developing countries. According to calculations by several international organizations, after the agreement is completely carried out in 2005, the benefits obtained by all countries will range from $230 billion to $270 billion, and the actual benefits may even be much higher than these figures. According to an estimate by U.S. President Clinton, the United States alone will obtain benefits ranging from $100 billion to $200 billion and create several hundred thousand jobs. The indirect impact of the agreement will not be felt until after it is carried out, and it is too early to estimate what will happen now. For the developed countries, the advantages from the agreement are evident, while to the vast number of developing countries, there could be more disadvantages than advantages. However, some developing countries which are achieving industrialization will benefit more from the agreement. First, these countries will be able to freely export their industrial products to developed countries. Next, these countries, with a good investment environment in which the production costs are much lower than in developed countries, will attract a great deal of investment from major transnational companies. The major disadvantages are as follows: First, although the agreement permits the poorest developing nations with no industrial foundation to adopt measures to protect their national industries, it is in fact not easy for them to do so. This is because if they adopt high tariffs, their people will be unable to afford to imported industrial goods; and if they adopt low tariffs, their national industries will be strangled. Second, the agreement has not solved the problem of high tariffs for textile goods, leather products, tropical products, and primary products, while these products are major export products of many developing countries. In particular, textile goods will continue to be subject to the control of the 1974 agreement on various fiber products in the next 10 years. The 1974 agreement is very unfavorable to developing countries because it sets quotas and high tariffs for imported textile goods. Third, when service trades such as banking and telecommunications enter developing countries, they could cause unexpected consequences. Many international organizations have calculated the advantages and disadvantages of the agreement of the Uruguay Round of talks to developing countries. Their consensus is that the poorest countries, particularly black African nations south of the Sahara, will get only the smallest piece of the Uruguay Round cake. A serious defect of the Uruguay Round agreement is that it has not paid due attention to the commodity production and trade of the poorest countries. An agreement is merely an agreement, and the key is how to carry it out. Some Western nations usually place their domestic law above international agreements, and frequently bring fabricated charges against other countries according to their domestic law and take "reprisal" measures against the latter, resulting in international agreements existing in name only. For this reason, it is not so easy to truly seize this historic opportunity, and it is still necessary to make a great deal of effort.
