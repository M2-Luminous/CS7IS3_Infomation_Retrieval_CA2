The people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], however, clearly had advance warning of the enemy's attack plan and ambushed the enemy forces. The NADK, in cooperation with the people, divided their forces into two prongs. The first prong attacked the communist Vietnamese puppet troops as they left Lvea village; the second prong attacked the troops leaving Ampil Pram Daeum. In these two attacks, the NADK and the people killed 38 communist Vietnamese puppet soldiers, wounded 32 others, and seized a large quantity of guns and materiel. The remaining soldiers were really scared. A large number fled because they were afraid of dying and were angry with their commanders for forcing them to attack the Democratic Kampuchean resistance forces and the people and die on their behalf.
