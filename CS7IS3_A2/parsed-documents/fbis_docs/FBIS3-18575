We must take advantage of the present opportunities." Foreign Minister Willy Claes reiterated this position in Paris yesterday, after meeting with President Francois Mitterrand and his colleague Alain Juppe. Claes was in Paris on a working visit. He reported to his colleague Juppe on the talks on European Union [EU] enlargement. Both ministers also discussed the financing of the common foreign policy. Some members of the Union argue it should be financed by special contributions from the member states. "However, we can hardly develop a common policy, if, with every action, we must discuss who will pay what," Claes stated. France has now suggested eastablishment of a fund which would be financed partly by Community funds and partly by member state contributions. "This seems to be a good working hypothesis," Claes said. With Mitterrand, the Belgian minister talked mainly about the situation in Rwanda and Burundi, where he was on a visit last week, and about Zaire. With his counterparts, Claes also made preparations for the Paris Conference. Last December's European Summit in Brussels adopted French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's idea of a Security Pact in Europe. Belgium fears that this conference might be pointless, unless one succeeds in getting countries such as Slovakia and Romania, which are showing little interest, around the table. The purpose of the conference, scheduled to start in Paris next April, is precisely to convice the countries of Central and East Europe, including Russia, to reach agreements concerning their borders and respect of minorities on their territories.
