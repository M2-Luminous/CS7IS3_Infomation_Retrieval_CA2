FR941125-2-00101 FR941125-2-00075 In a NOFA published in the Federal Register on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 68000), the Department announced the availability of $8.8 million in funds for FHIP. On February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9235), HUD published a notice that made an additional $800,000 available, for a total of $9.6 million in FY 1993 funding. To ensure that sufficient time was available for full consideration to be given to applications under the FY 1993 FHIP Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Reinvention Lab Project NOFA (June 16, 1994, 59 FR 31072), the Department replaced the $1 million of FY 1993 Education and Outreach Initiative funds made available under that NOFA with $1 million in FY 1994 Education and Outreach Initiative funds in a notice published on August 9, 1994 (59 FR 40599). The $1 million in FY 1993 Education and Outreach Initiative funds from the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Reinvention Lab Project NOFA were instead made available to fund additional eligible Education and Outreach Initiative applicants under the FY 1993 FHIP NOFA, and to complete the funding of grantees under that NOFA who were only partially funded. A notice published on July 14, 1994 (59 FR 35942) listed the bulk of the awards made under FY 1993 FHIP NOFA. This notice announces the additional FY 1993 FHIP NOFA Education and Outreach Initiative applicants funded as a result of the August 9, 1994 notice.
