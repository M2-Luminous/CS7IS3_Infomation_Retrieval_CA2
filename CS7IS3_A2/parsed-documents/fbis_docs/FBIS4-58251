FBIS4-58251 "drnes085_l_94012" FBIS-NES-94-085 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Tender Issued for Building of Jericho Bypass Road Tender Issued for Building of Jericho Bypass Road TA2904111094 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew 29 Apr 94 p 4 TA2904111094 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT Hebrew BFN [Report by Ilana Baum] [Text] The Construction and Housing Ministry yesterday issued a tender via the Public Works Division for the construction of the "Jericho bypass" road. It will be the first of a series of "security roads" to be built by Israel to avoid friction between Israelis and Palestinians and to increase security for the Jewish settlers in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, approved the building of the new road. The length of the "Jericho bypass" road will be 13 km and it will cost 5 million shekels. It is a ring road which will be built some 2 km south of Jericho. The work will begin within a month and will end within weeks after that. About three months ago, the Construction and Housing Ministry prepared a master plan for the "autonomy roads," which will cost a total of 2 billion shekels. They will involve the building of some 600 km of roads in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. The plan, which is defined as top secret, categorizes the importance and urgency of each road. The "Jericho bypass" road was defined as having immediate urgency. The plan was presented for Defense Ministry inspection and Yitzhaq Rabin's approval. No permission has yet been given for the building of additional roads. The autonomy road plan has two tracks: One: restoring, expanding, and adding new lanes to existing strategic roads, such as the Jordan Rift Valley road, the Alon Road, and the Trans-Samaria Highway. Two: building new roads, called "security roads" with the aim of assuring the safety of the Jewish residents. These are bypass roads, such as the "Jericho bypass" road. The aim of the security roads is to bypass Arab population centers and prevent friction between Jews and Arabs. Under this clause, additional roads are planned: the Ramallah bypass, the Nabulus bypass, the Tulkarm bypass, and the Shomron bypass.
