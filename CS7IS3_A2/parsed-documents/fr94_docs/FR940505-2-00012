Reichenbach Fireworks imported them in consumer packaging and sold them to retailers licensed to sell only ``Class C'' fireworks to consumers. ``Class B'' devices are defined by the U.S. Department of Transportation, 44 CFR 173.88(a) and (d) and 173.100 (a) and (r) and have significantly greater pyrotechnic composition than ``Class C'' fireworks. For this reason, they pose a greater risk of injury to consumers.
