A goniophotometric apparatus for measuring the backscattering diagrams for samples of soils and vegetation and for water surfaces at laser wavelengths was developed. A diagram is given with 29 components identified, serving as a basis for a detailed description of instrument structure and functioning. It ensures measurement of the effective brightness coefficients in the range from 10[.sup]-4[/] to 10[.sup]4[/] with an error not greater than 20%. The results of measurements of sand, earth (clay loam) and mixed meadow grasses, as well as an open water surface and water with an oil film with a thickness 0.5 mm, at wavelengths 1.06 and 10.6 ï¿½m are presented. The experimental data on the angular energy and polarization reflective characteristics of samples of underlying surfaces, in combination with simulation of the geometry and observation conditions of the macrosurface of extended terrain sectors, make it possible to synthesize their images and therefore to select the best parameters of laser sounding apparatus.
