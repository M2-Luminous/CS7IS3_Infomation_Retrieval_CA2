Radio Reloj at 1504 GMT on 12 March reports that Matanzas Province is outstanding in controlling borers through biological means. In 1993, despite the nation's resource shortages, some 48 million borer-eating flies were released to control the pests in 78,000 caballerias. It is estimated that borers are responsible for losses of between 9,000 and 130,000 tons of sugar per year. Radio Reloj at 1509 GMT on 12 March reports that the Eliseo Caamano Agriculture-Livestock Production Cooperative in Consolacion del Sur Municipality, Pinar del Rio Province, expects to harvest 5,000 quintals of tobacco during the current campaign, a record figure in the co-op's 15 years of existence. The co-op has harvested 250,000 poles of tobacco to date, almost 50 percent of the expected harvest. Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 12 March reports that Ciego de Avila Province has had the biggest white grapefruit harvest in history, 14,500 tons in the 1993-94 campaign. In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that exploitation of a small gold mine in the Castellanos multimetallic deposit in Minas de Matahambre, Pinar del Rio Province, will begin next month. The engineer in charge of extraction and processing says the gold is in tiny particles that will have to be extracted from the soil. He says approximately one pound of gold, worth $6,000 on the world market, can be obtained from every 500 tons of soil. Putting the mine into operation will provide jobs for over 200 excess workers from Pinar del Rio's mining enterprise. Exploiting the mine has been made possible through an investment of approximately 3 million pesos. Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 14 March reports that in three days of work members of the Antiaircraft Defense and Revolutionary Air Force reached 142 percent of potato picking, a great labor feat. In San Antonio de los Banos, Havana Province, 250 DAAFAR members are supporting the food program on orders of the high command. Lieutenant Colonel (Juan Avelero), deputy chief of the troops, has said that in Havana 2,000 men from various Western Army units helping pick tomatoes will remain for some 30 days to work in the potato harvest. Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 15 March reports that the Siguaney factory in Sancti Spiritus is producing a new variety of gray cement which has proven very resistant to salt water and good for many uses, including blocks. Specialists point out that its production allows the factory to save 10 kwh of electricity and 26 kg of oil per ton: in other words, 11 percent less than what was traditionally required. Radio Reloj in its 2030 GMT newscast on 15 March reports the following: "The Colombian subsidiary of the English hotel chain (Forte) has, at Cubanacan's request, taken over the administration and marketing of the (Las Yagrumas) Hotel in San Antonio de los Banos." Cubanacan president Abraham Maciques confirms: "Cubanacan has signed similar joint ventures -- which guarantee a market, experience, and technology -- with prestigious hotel groups from Spain, the Netherlands, Jamaica, Germany, and Canada." In Sancti Spiritus Province since January, 300 caballerias of cane have been cultivated using oxen. The province's Basic Cooperative Production Units, agricultural-livestock cooperatives, credit and services cooperatives, and state organizations own over 1,600 teams of oxen. Sector workers intend to cultivate some 2,800 caballerias of land using ox teams, in addition to working on self- sufficiency plots and the planting, collecting, and transportation of cane. The Ministry of the Sugar Industry aims to have some 2,300 teams of oxen by the end of 1994. The workers of the sugar industry's machine shops in Havana are carrying out two important tasks this year: manufacturing chains for cane and conveyor belts (esteras) for bagasse, in cooperation with a Spanish firm. They continue to support the production of spare parts. The National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP) will this year put a plan into effect to motivate those agricultural producers most outstanding in fulfilling their plans for collection and sales to state organizations. This was reported at the ANAP provincial plenum in Matanzas, which analyzed production and collection management in the small farm sector. The plenum, held at the Alberto Delgado Cooperative in Perico Municipality, was presided over by ANAP President Orlando Lugo Fonte and attended by Agriculture Vice Minister Luis Gonzalez. The first Guitart-Cayo Coco tourist complex, in the cays north of Ciego de Avila Province, has hosted close to 20,000 foreign tourists during its nearly 10 months of operation. This complex opened in April 1993 to outstanding Ciego de Avila workers, received its first foreign visitors a month later, and was officially inaugurated on 12 November 1993. There are plans to build a second Guitart-Cubanacan tourist installation on Cayo Coco. The workers of the Ramiro Santiago fish farm in Las Tunas are trying to produce 20 million tilapia larvae and 12 million fry in 1994, figures far greater than in 1993. In 1993, a little more than 1,000 tons of fish were produced there; in 1994, the farm expects to raise this figure to 1,600. Las Tunas' program designed to increase production to 8,000 tons in the next four years will provide each inhabitant of the province two pounds of freshwater fish per month. Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 16 March reports that Cuba is going to cultivate sunflowers to produce fodder and sunflower oil. Lieutenant Colonel Gilberto Pena Martinez says a multidisciplinary group from the Ministry of the Interior is going to work with each province to begin planting in August and to begin developing the industry with a view to meeting approximately 50 percent of the ministry's fat needs.
