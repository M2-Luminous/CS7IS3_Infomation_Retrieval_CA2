The climax of the several-day meeting of ministers from over 120 countries should be the official signing of all the GATT agreements that were hailed in December by the apostles of international free trade as the "successful conclusion" of the seven-year so-called Uruguay Round of talks. Whether every single minister will know exactly what he is signing is a matter of doubt. There are no less than 28 new agreements, which, with all the annexes and appendices, add up to 20,000 pages of print. International economic dealing has long become the domain of world enterprises, pressure groups, and specialists sitting in bureaucratic ministries or inside bodies like the European Union [EU] Commission. All the politicians can do is lay down the general line of march. The complexity of the mutual interdependencies makes democratic control almost impossible. When the new agreements are ratified by the majority of the 120 countries next year, over the 10 following years there will be a gradual mutual "opening up of markets" not just to trade, but also to public works and services, which will alter the lives of millions of people on all continents. For the first time, agriculture and, as part of technological progress, the broadcast media, telecommunications, transportation, and much else besides will be affected. The losers will be the poorest developing countries that cannot feed themselves. Skeptics fear that the new agreements contain too many loopholes for countries that, under pressure form high unemployment, might want to pull out of the strong international competition. The GATT that was created in 1948 is to be converted into a "World Trade Organization" (WTO) with tougher rules. To prevent the Marrakesh meeting from being overshadowed by intense disputes, it has been agreed to continue the work over the next 24 months. When the Uruguay talks began eight years ago at the inspiration of U.S. President Reagan, the world was still quite different from today. In the old Western industrialized countries, including Japan, technological progress has eliminated more and more jobs since then. The high chronic unemployment is making West European social security systems virtually impossible to finance. The technological competitiveness of many low-wage countries has increased markedly, and with the "opening of markets" it will exert an even stronger wage pressure in the old industrialized countries. The EU countries now have a moral duty to gradually integrate the "new market economies" of East Europe. What is more, China, as the world's most populous country, has made such progress in the development of its increasingly capitalist economy that in 10 to 15 years it will have overtaken not only Germany, but also Japan and the United States as a world trade partner. No wonder the trade unions of North America and West Europe are now demanding that a "social clause" be added to the new world trade regulations. Countries in which trade unions are suppressed and minimum ILO regulations, such as a ban on the employment of children, are violated should be excluded from the mutual opening up of markets. The developing countries have already vehemently opposed such a "social clause" in Marrakesh. Their rich elites are using their people's "poverty," from which they profit the most, as an argument against "discrimination." Environmental protection was also completely "overlooked" in the Uruguay talks. High environmental standards are considered a cost factor that apply mostly to those countries that enjoy a high standard of living. If the industries of these countries consider themselves too much at a disadvantage in free world trade, they pull out. The only explanation for the great "joy" in Germany over the success of the Uruguay talks is the fact that economic interests and their prophets dominate this country. The Marrakesh accords are a late victory for the already anachronistic "Reaganomics" ideology. It is ironic that many hopes are now being vested in the U.S. Congress. It is the most unusual of Western parliaments because its majority is not obliged to support the U.S. Government. Washington is virtually the only capital that could belatedly force through an environmental clause and a social clause in the WTO. The apostles of free trade might scream blue murder about "new protectionism," but this might salvage Germany's important achievements.
