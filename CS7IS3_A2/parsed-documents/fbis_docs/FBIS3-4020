He pointed out: Thanks to the management work in the previous two stages, we have dealt blows at a large number of local ruffians and despots. Social order in our rural area has been considerably improved, the masses have a stronger sense of safety and a healthy atmosphere prevails while the unhealthy one has been checked. However, to ensure a long-term peaceful environment, we still face strenuous work in the future. Therefore, during the stage of consolidating and imposing restrictions, which starts in April, various specific measures for comprehensive management must be fully implemented in grass-roots units. Wu Xiangdong, member of the provincial party committee standing committee and secretary of the political and judicial commission under the provincial party committee, made specific arrangements for the work in the next stage. He urged the continued strengthening of leadership and establishing and improving various responsibility systems for the management of public order. He also urged directly linking the work of comprehensive management of social order with the assessment of work achievement, and with rewards and penalties, so that party and government leaders at all levels, and various political and judicial departments, will enhance their sense of political responsibility for protecting local safety. At the meeting, Comrade Wu Xiangdong also stressed: To manage social order in rural areas well, it is necessary to strengthen the building of grass roots units and consolidate fundamental work at that level. Fourteen prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and counties passed on their experiences at the meeting, including Changsha, Yueyang, Shaoyang, Lingling, Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture, Changde, and others.
