The immediate goal of that effort, according to an editorial published today by the weekly TRABAJADORES, is to combine during May and June the cutting and processing of all the available sugar cane with a sowing effort that has been termed colossal, as well as to carry out extensive cleaning of the sugar cane fields before spring. In an effort to use existing manpower to its maximum capacity, men and machinery will be transferred from various provinces to other territories so that they can complete the harvest in their places of operation, to cutting down and processing all of the sugar cane. The newspaper, published by the Central Organization of Cuban Trade Unions [CTC], explained that this will be a concerted effort among forces and teams that have achieved the highest yield and discipline. It will include tens of thousands of workers, while other contingents will devote themselves to sowing, fertilizing, and manual cutting. The newspaper tells the country that it is necessary to win in the current sugar cane harvest and adds that the goal is to surpass the last harvest's production by several thousand tons, thus starting the agriculture industry's recovery. Decisions on these matters are occurring at the same time as deputies of the National Assembly of the People's Government (parliament) are discussing the general guidelines of a package of measures designed to end the country's financial imbalance and decrease the amount of excess currency in circulation, thus restoring the value of salaries. TRABAJADORES says that, aside from being the country's leading source of revenue, sugar production is also a measure of the country's heartbeat. The current sugar harvest is vital to halting what it terms the depression afflicting the national economy. It added: This will be an indicator of Cuban capacity for countering enormous shortages and difficulties that now exist. Within this strategy, Cuba intends to have within the next few years the necessary raw materials to achieve former levels of sugar production. But in 1994 it defines its eventual success only as a harvest which surpasses that of 1993, which was 4.2 million tons. The state of mind which prevails among workers who participate in the sugar battle is at its highest, the CTC publication's editorial concludes.
