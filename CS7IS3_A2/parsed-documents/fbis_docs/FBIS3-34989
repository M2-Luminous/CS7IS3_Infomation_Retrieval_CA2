While the leadership of the coalition has and continues to exert intensive efforts to contain the negative impact of the partitioning decision Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, member of the YSP Political Bureau and prime minister, made appointing a governor for the Abyan governorate, thus exceeding the constitutional prerogatives that are granted to the Presidential Council and the Council of ministers in this respect, the YSP and the influential people within it in the Aden governorate today further exacerbated the crisis. Salih Munassir al-Siyali, Aden governor, and member of the political bureau, summoned the commander of the Central Security Units in Aden and informed him that the party leadership has decided to quickly move the Central Security Units from their locations in the Radfan camp in (Kurmaksal) to the al-Mashari' area in Dar Sa'd, thus violating the military security committee's decision and the decisions of the dialogue committee of not carrying out any transfer or change in any of the forces, giving a 12-hour ultimatum to carry out the order. Otherwise, deterring measures will be taken to force them to move. Contacts were made to convince the YSP to avoid such an escalation. However, the contacts were unsuccessful, and water and electricity were cut from the camp today as a prelude to a bloody confrontation. Denouncing these provocations by the YSP and its military command, the GPC holds the YSP responsible for the consequences of this measure. It appeals to the brothers in the YSP leadership to show deference for their people and their unity. The GPC also urges all political organizations and forces, at the forefront of which is the dialogue committee, to denounce and condemn such measures. The GPC also affirms that these provocations will not weaken its determination to sign the pledge and accord document, which is the only way out of the political crisis. Nor will such measures weaken the GPC determination to reunite the coalition to implement the articles of the document, since this is a joint responsibility. It is God who grants success.
