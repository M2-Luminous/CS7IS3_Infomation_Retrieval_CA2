The prime minister is trying to paper over the inner split by acting as if everything can continue as before. This is chasing away the young people from his party. But what is worse: This is also costing Denmark influence in Europe. This was said by former Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen (Liberal Party) in a comment on the attack SDP Chairman and Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has directed against the Liberals' Europe policy in a letter issued by the LO [National Labor Confederation] in which he calls the Liberals the main enemy to the SDP in late summer's election for the European Parliament. Ellemann-Jensen characterizes as "pure nonsense" the prime minister's assertion that the Liberals are pulling out of the National Compromise and are seeking a "United States of Europe." "The Liberals want the European Union [EU] to become a body for cooperation among independent states, and we are observing the rules of the game in the National Compromise. But we want it made possible for the people to rescind the Danish reservation [opt-out] to cooperation in the EU through a new referendum, and we are working to get a majority for this," said Ellemann-Jensen. He claims that Europe has changed itself since the National Compromise was arrived at almost two years ago, and that today there is far greater need for establishing cooperation in defense and refugee policies. "This is seen in the entirely relevant events in the former Yugoslavia and in Russia. Today the peace in Europe is in danger, and we cannot defend the peace by sticking our head in the sand," said Ellemann-Jensen.
