Since efforts to do this at the multilateral level in the Paris Club of the creditor countries have failed, Iran is now trying for bilateral solutions. Austrian claims from state-secured export business, which amount to about 12 billion schillings, are also affected. Negotiations are to be held in March. However, it will not be easy to come to an agreement, because Tehran wants to pay its overdue liabilities with oil deliveries. Algeria is another country that internationally is considered as a candidate for rescheduling, because its revenues from business in natural gas are suffering under the decline in oil prices. So far, Algiers has paid its debts to Austria. In this case, liabilities amount to about 14 billion schillings, 9 billion of which come from a railroad project. There are also problems with Russia (liabilities: about 40 billion schillings), which has not fulfilled obligations incurred in the rescheduling agreement with Austria for paying interest. For this reason, in contrast to its original intentions, the Control Bank is not issuing any more guarantees for exports to Russia for the time being. The situation is similar regarding most other CIS states. Only painstakingly chosen projects are insured and financed, which should guarantee the servicing of such debts. Business is normal only with Kazakhstan and Belarus, which have been granted credit lines. The Control Bank was able to slightly loosen conditions for insuring exports to Poland (liabilities: about 40 billion schillings), which is fulfilling its rescheduling obligations most punctually. In 1993, the Control Bank's focus shifted toward the neighboring reform states and the Southeast Asian countries because of premium reform, economic development, and the development of risks as well as the release of soft loans. If Austria becomes a member of the European Union [EU], this would also have consequences for the Control Bank. It would then retreat relatively quickly from short-term business with OECD countries for the benefit of private loan insurers, but the range of claims that are worth refinancing would be extended by the risks insured by these private insurers. EU membership would further stimulate business with the neighboring reform states because of the elimination of discrimination in the processing trade. Last year the Control Bank's turnover in guarantees declined to 45.1 (48.2) billion schillings, but promissory notes rose clearly to 41.9 (27.5) billion schillings, which raises the expectation that business will recover this year. The volume of rescheduling loans and guarantees has increased to 87.1 (78.2) billion. Payment of damages from liabilities (without rescheduling) went down to 3 (4) billion schillings, or to 1.9 (2.9) billion minus refluxes. Countries for Half Retention Listed The recent amendment to the Export Promotion Regulation (AFVO) stipulates, among other things, a 5-percent limit for deliveries to countries whose credit standing has improved. Even though a list of such countries is still being drawn up, it probably will be more comprehensive than was feared after first restrictive comments by the Finance Ministry. According to the latest information, about 15 to 20 countries will probably be on the list. This applies, in particular, to Asian as well as the reform states of East and Central Europe and a few countries in Latin America and Africa. The final decision is to be made over the next few days.
