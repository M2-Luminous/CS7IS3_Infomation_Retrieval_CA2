This was stated by Russian presidential envoy, Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov in an interview with INTERFAX today. Pastukhov suggested that the talks between Georgian and Abkhazian representatives, which finished in Moscow on 14 May had been "absolutely necessary." The talks showed that the parties were "moving towards a dialogue and their permanent contacts were of great importance," he added. Pastukhov highly praised the Georgian-Abkhazian documents signed in Moscow. They include the agreement on ceasefire, separation of the troops, deployment of the CIS peacekeeping contingency between the conflicting parties and the establishment of a joint coordinating commission on energy supply, transport communications, etc. The commission will have its permanent seat in Sochi from 1 June. "The most valuable thing about this commission is that the parties will always be looking into the faces of each other and openly discussing what worries them," Pastukhov underlined. Commenting on the deployment of CIS peacekeeping forces on the Inguri River, he emphasized that details of the operation must still be worked on. "The CIS heads of state will express their opinion on the operation. Thereafter, the plan will be discussed with the conflicting parties. We take as our basis an initial number of about 3,000 people for the peacekeeping forces," Pastukhov said. He stressed that the issue on CIS peacekeepers had been worked on during numerous consultations with the UN and the CSCE. "We hope that the peacekeeping operation itself will be carried out with the active participation of international observers in the conflict zone. It will probably be reasonable to widen their mandate and to increase their number," Pastukhov suggested. He said the Russian party was quietly optimistic on implementation of the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia. "Earlier, we had also had rather strong decisions which unfortunately were never carried out. It is necessary to say less and to do more," Pastukhov accentuated. He announced that Georgian and Abkhazian representatives would meet in Geneva on 13 June in order to work out solutions with which everyone would be satisfied.
