It was "premature" to talk of an agreement in Moscow between Russia and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to re-open the airport, Akashi said. The Serbs were insisting on liaison officers at the airport, a move vigorously opposed by the Moslem-led Bosnian government. "The positions are quite apart," Akashi admitted. Aid officials said the opening of the airport to humanitarian aid flights is vital to the 700,000 mainly Moslem inhabitants in the region who have been kept without adequate food since war broke out in Bosnia almost two years ago. Nevertheless the UN is pressing ahead with work to ready the runway and airport to receive fixed winged aircraft within a week or two, Akashi said. "We would like to do it with the agreement of the parties so that the airport will not be exposed to shelling or bombardment," he added. When the airport does re-open, the humanitarian air bridge would fly in one or two flights per day, in daylight hours. In a sign of some progress in the region, Ron Redmond, spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said aid distribution across Bosnia last week had been "extremely good," with 8,100 tonnes of aid delivered in the week to early Friday, some 83 percent of the target. However, the UNHCR had protested to the Serbs over their blockade of convoys for the Moslem-held pockets of Maglaj and Tesanj, he added. A fuel convoy was allowed into Gorazde where people have been dying in hospital because its electricity generator lacked fuel. However the situation at Maglaj remained very serious with 10 aid trucks packed with supplies forced to return to Zagreb and Banja Luka, Redmond said. "We will attempt to send two convoys at the start of next week from Zagreb and Zenica and will try also to reach Tesanj," the UNHCR spokesman said. Although Redmond said the UNHCR had protested strongly to the Serbs over the delays, Akashi blamed "Croat populations from neighbouring villages" for blocking the convoys. The Japanese diplomat said that at a meeting with the three warring parties in the Bosnian conflict in Geneva on Thursday he had sensed "isolation, some bitterness and hardening" of the Serb position over a U.S.-sponsored plan for a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia. On the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, Akashi said "total freedom of movement should be possible within the next several weeks," but said further negotiations were needed with the Bosnian government and the Serb side. UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is expected to address the UN Security Council in the next few days to say which countries would be invited to send contingents to the UN Protection Force in Bosnia, Akashi said. The UN chief said 10,000 extra troops would be needed to maintain the "still fragile" ceasefire in Bosnia. Meanwhile, the UN Protection Force successfully rotated Canadian troops in the eastern Moslem enclave of Srebrenica with their Dutch counterparts.
