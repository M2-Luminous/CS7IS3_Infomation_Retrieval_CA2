"We never imagined it would come to Shushkevich's resignation. Literally hours before the vote the Russian ambassador in Minsk was reporting on the situation in the republic -- and he expressed no alarm. What happened was like a bolt from the blue," a Russian Foreign Ministry CIS department aide admitted. The removal of Shushkevich is not going to do Russian-Belarusian relations any good. Boris Yeltsin has lost a reliable ally, who unconditionally took his side last fall in the struggle against Khasbulatov and Rutskoy. The Belarusian leader was one of the few CIS leaders whose loyalty Yeltsin could always count on: In the past two years it is difficult to remember an occasion when Minsk has not supported a Moscow initiative in the context of the Commonwealth. Shushkevich's stock was pretty high in the international area -- he was seen as a reformer and stalwart supporter of the market economy. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, whose position most observers expect to be strengthened, adopts a different line. His views are much closer to those of his Russian colleague Chernomyrdin than to those of Yeltsin and Shushkevich. The results of the vote removed the final doubts about the Belarusian parliament's orientation: The communists have a solid majority in it. The signs are that someone who will more easily find a common language with Zyuganov than with Yeltsin will be elected the new chairman of the Supreme Soviet. In this situation there is practically no hope of the Belarusian leaders' carrying out serious reforms. The republic's economic prospects could not be gloomier. Nevertheless, Chernomyrdin will fly to Minsk in February to agree on a mechanism for the unification of the two states' monetary systems. Given that this step was causing thunderous protests on the part of Russian reformers even before Shushkevich's removal, one can imagine the kind of reaction there will be now that the Belarusian parliament has shown its hand. As for Belarusian foreign policy, according to Russian diplomats, it will not change significantly. Minsk is too heavily dependent on Moscow and the leaders of the communist majority in the Supreme Soviet are unlikely to openly display their ideological enmity toward Yeltsin.
