A conference proposed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and supported by U.S. President Bill Clinton for next month "must take place but sooner, if possible immediately," Mitterrand said. "The way the military conflict is taking the upper hand over diplomatic negotiations must not be allowed," he told a press conference. A contact group was formed in London at ambassadorial level Monday to try to coordinate policy on ending the fighting in Bosnia. The group comprises representatives of the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations. "It is time that the great powers, together with the warring parties, set out an accord that it suits them to agree to," Mitterrand said Tuesday. "The process of demanding in the name of the United Nations a retreat of Bosnian Serb military forces was very useful in Sarajevo. Why not continue it in the designated security zones?" he added.
