Xinjian, which was chosen as a site for the comprehensive project about the control of insect and other pests, is a key rice producing county. With reference to the experience of field schools for farmers in Indonesia, recommended by FAO, local authorities will open similar schools in line with local conditions in an attempt to help farmers to deal with pests and treat diseases that endanger rice. No classrooms and teaching facilities are needed for such schools: farmers mainly study through actual practice under the guidance of experts.
