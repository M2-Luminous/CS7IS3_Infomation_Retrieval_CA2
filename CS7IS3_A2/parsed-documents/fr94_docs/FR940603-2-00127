FR940603-2-00127 FR940603-2-00082 [Release No. 34&hyph;34128; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;12] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating to Modification of Fees for Failure to Observe OEX RAES Requirements May 27, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on April 1, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change Currently, CBOE Rule 24.17, ``RAES Eligibility in OEX,'' establishes eligibility standards under which individuals, member organizations, and joint accounts may participate in the CBOE's Retail Automatic Execution System (''RAES'') for Standard & Poor's 100 Index (``OEX'') options. The CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 24.17(a)(iii) to provide that an individual required to sign onto RAES immediately prior to expiration may apply to the OEX Floor Procedure Committee (``OFPC'') for prospective relief from the log-on requirements during a particular expiration cycle. The CBOE also proposes to delete paragraph (iv), which states, among other things, that a member's failure to meet his RAES obligations will disqualify him from signing onto RAES for such time period as the OFPC determines. In addition, the CBOE proposes to replace the current $500.00 fee for failing to comply with CBOE rule 24.17's log-on and log-off requirements with the following fee schedule: (1) A fee of $100.00 for one to three failures within one calendar year; (2) a fee of $250.00 for four to six failures within one calendar year; and (3) a fee of $500.00 for seven or more failures within one calendar year. Finally, the CBOE proposes to assess a fee for any joint account member or nominee of a member organization who has logged onto RAES and later terminates participation on RAES at any time prior to the next succeeding expiration date, unless the member participates in another OEX RAES account or terminates his membership with the Exchange. The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposed rule change is to eliminate the automatic disqualification provisions in CBOE Rule 24.17 and to reduce the fees now required of members under that rule for failure to observe the rule's log-on and log-off requirements. In addition, the proposal makes certain editorial changes to clarify CBOE Rule 24.17 without affecting its substance. In May 1993, Exchange Rule 24.17 was amended to establish, among other things, more rigorous log-on and log-off requirements for participants in OEX RAES. 1 For example, group members who previously were logged on automatically by the Exchange must now log on at their own initiative each time they enter the trading crowd. Likewise, members who previously were not required to log off the system each time they left the trading crowd must now do so. 1 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32248 (April 30, 1993), 58 FR 27596 (``RAES Fee Approval Order''). In view of such additional log-on and log-off requirements, the Exchange believes that the $500.00 fees currently due from members who do not log on or log off as required are excessive. The proposed rule change therefore establishes a new graduated fee schedule, under which the fee amount will increase in relation to the number of times within any one calendar year that a member does not log on or log off as required. Specifically, during each calendar year, a $100.00 fee will be due for each of the first three times that a member fails to observe the log-on or log-off requirements; a $250.00 fee will be due for each of the fourth through sixth such times; and a $500.00 fee will be due for all subsequent times. In addition, the CBOE proposes to assess a $500.00 fee on any member participating in a joint account or nominee account held by a member organization if the member logs onto OEX RAES but thereafter terminates participation prior to the next succeeding expiration date without either joining another OEX RAES account or terminating membership on the Exchange. Members who fail to observe CBOE Rule 24.17 can be subject to a variety of sanctions. 2 The CBOE states that the fees suggested in the proposed rule change, like the fees imposed currently under CBOE Rule 24.17, do not constitute disciplinary action. Nevertheless, the review procedures in Chapter XIX, ``Hearings and Review,'' of the Exchange's rules will be available with respect to the assessment of the proposed fees. Under those procedures, a member may seek verification of fees charged by the Exchange. If the member is not satisfied with the verification of fees, he may request a hearing before a panel of three or more members of the Exchange's Appeals Committee. At the hearing the appellant may be represented by counsel and may cross-examine witnesses. 3 2 Under CBOE Rule 24.17(b)(v), the OFPC may bar, restrict, or condition a joint account's participation in RAES if any member fails to meet the OEX market maker requirements. Under CBOE rule 24.17(c)(vi), the OFPC may bar, restrict, or condition a member organization's participation in RAES if any nominee on RAES in OEX fails to meet the OEX market maker requirements. CBOE Rule 24.17(e)(ii) provides several sanctions for failures to comply with the requirements of CBOE Rule 24.17, including disciplinary action under, among others, CBOE Rule 6.20, ``Admission to and Conduct on the Trading Floor,'' and Chapter XVII, ``Discipline,'' of the CBOE's rules. In addition, the OFPC may take remedial action, including suspension of a member's eligibility for participation on RAES and other remedies appropriate under Chapter VIII, ``Market Makers, Trading Crowds, and Modified Trading Systems,'' of the CBOE's rules. 3 See CBOE Rules 19.3, ``Procedure Following Applications for Hearing,'' and 19.4, ``Hearing.''
