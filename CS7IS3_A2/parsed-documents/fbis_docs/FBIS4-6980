Mr. Fujimori, what is happening at the prime minister's official residence? [Fujimori] Leaders of the ruling coalition parties are now assembling at the prime minister's official residence, and they will soon hold a meeting to discuss ways to deal with the present political situation. The leaders of the ruling coalition parties in their meeting this morning confirmed the need to continue efforts to persuade the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to remain in the coalition. Later, in the afternoon, Prime Minister Hata called SDPJ chairman Murayama to ask the latter for talks, but chairman Murayama told the prime minister he had no intention of complying with his request for talks. Chairman Murayama is believed to have concluded there are no prospects for breaking the deadlock over the SDPJ's breakaway from the coalition through talks, unless extraordinary changes have occured since the SDPJ broke away from the coalition after the Central Executive Committee and a meeting of members from the both houses of the Diet decided that the SDPJ should quit the coalition. Chairman Murayama returned to his home at 1600 [0700 GMT] this afternoon, and there seem to be no prospects for talks between him and Prime Minister Hata. The leaders of the ruling coalition parties will discuss how to deal with the issue of the SDPJ's breakaway from the coalition. [Kawabata] Just now, former Prime Minister Hosokawa can be seen entering the prime minister's official residence. The SDPJ is still taking a tough stand. Mr. Fujimori, what sort of other options do the ruling coalition parties have? [Fujimori] The ruling coalition parties intend to continue to try to persuade the SDPJ to remain in the coalition. If the SDPJ continues to reject the persuasion, and refuse to remain in the coalition, the leaders of the ruling coalition parties will have to form a new cabinet without the SDPJ. The ruling coalition parties will become a minority in the Diet. The ruling coalition parties have 182 seats in the House of Representatives and their seats are far less than those held by the Liberal Democratic Party. Meanwhile, the ruling coalition parties hold 62 seats in the House of Councillors, only one-fourth of the majority. With those seats in the Diet, the ruling coalition parties would be unable to get any bills to pass in the Diet if the LDP and the SDPJ objected, and they would be hard-pressed to run the Diet in the future. [Kawabata] Mr. Fujimori, thank you very much.
