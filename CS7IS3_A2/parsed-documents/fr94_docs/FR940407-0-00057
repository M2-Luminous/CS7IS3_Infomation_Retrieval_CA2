FR940407-0-00057 FR940407-0-00012 Approval of Colorado's program revision shall become effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. In February 1991 Colorado submitted a draft application for EPA review. EPA provided comments on the draft application to the State in May 1992 and additional comments in May 1993. EPA's comments on the draft application were fully addressed in the final application submitted in October 1993. However, EPA has identified minor differences in the following provisions of the State regulation as reflected in the final application: Colorado Code of Regulations 261.4(b)(7); 261.8; 262.11(c); 268.1(c)(2); 268.6; 268.7(b)(7); 268.35(d); 268.40(b); 268.41(a); 268.42(b); 268.44; 268.50(d); and 100.22(c)(4). Colorado has committed to revising each of these regulatory provisions, and anticipates that these revisions will be adopted by April 1994. Accordingly, EPA intends to proceed with authorization rather than continue the dual regulatory scheme that presently exists. Thus, the Colorado program is granted immediate final authorization for the provisions set forth in the following table. ‚ê£ 1HSWA or FR reference 1State equivalent 1 1.
