ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to revise the general eagle permit restrictions applicable to American Indians and public institutions. The Service proposes to issue permits of limited duration and conditions, for the transportation into and out of the United States of eagle parts, nests or eggs or articles containing such parts, nests or eggs of the bald eagle ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) or the golden eagle ( Aquila chrysaetos ) that are lawfully possessed by American Indians and public institutions. The proposed regulation will provide for eagle permits to be issued only for transportation into and out of the United States when the eagle parts have religious significance or value, or are being transported by a public institution for scientific or exhibition purposes. The Service makes this proposal in order to address the concerns which have been expressed by American Indians and public institutions who have sought the Service's permission for the international travel of lawfully possessed eagle parts or other articles containing eagle parts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The golden eagle and most notably the bald eagle are proud symbols of our nation's natural beauty, our democratic form of government and our national heritage. The bald eagle was selected by the Continental Congress in 1782 as our national symbol and was given special protection by Congress in the Eagle Act of June 8, 1940. The Act as originally enacted provides that the Secretary of Interior may permit the taking and possession of bald eagle specimens for the scientific or exhibition purposes of public museums, scientific societies, and zoological parks. The Eagle Act was amended by Congress on October 24, 1962 (16 U.S.C. 668a) to include the golden eagle within its provisions and to permit the taking, possession, and transportation of eagle specimens for the religious purposes of Indian tribes.
