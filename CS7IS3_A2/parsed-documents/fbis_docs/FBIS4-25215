China and Malta enjoy close bilateral ties and the prospect of such ties are bright, President Jiang Zemin told Fenech Adami. Shortly before the meeting of the two top leaders, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks with his Maltese counterpart Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Guido De Marco at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. Qian told De Marco that China opposes resorting to sanctions in the nuclear inspection issue of the DPRK. He said that, China has not changed its position of solving the problem through negotiations among the four parties involved: DPRK, the Republic of Korea, the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency. "Sanctions are not a sensible choice, as they would only aggravate the crisis," Qian noted. He added that China holds that efforts should be made to maintain peace and stability and achieve denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. Qian expressed his support for Malta's application to join the European Union as a member of the European family. He also said that, compared with Europe, the Asia-Pacific region has felt less impact from the ending of the Cold War. De Marco agreed with Qian on the need to settle international disputes, including the Korean issue, through peaceful talks. He said his country believes that China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, can perform a substantial role in the international community and the Asia-Pacific region in particular. It was China that first proposed the establishment of a new global political and economical order, De Marco said, adding that Malta also regards it as a very important issue. During the meeting between President Jiang and Premier Adami later at Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the Chinese government, the Maltese leader was told that his visit will help to bring mutual relations to a new high. Productive results have been achieved since diplomatic relations were built up between the two countries in 1972, Jiang said. The reciprocal visits of both countries' top leaders have reinforced the friendly link between the two countries, Jiang said. He added that mutual economic and trade co-operations so far are also fruitful. "We are Working together to seek new frontiers of further collaboration in economy and trade," Jiang told Adami. Past experience has proved, Jiang stressed, that both big and small countries, regardless of their differences in social systems, can co-exist peacefully and co-operate beneficially on the basis of mutual respect.
