The majority of Thai military leaders are still very reserved and treat the country's arms data as a national secret. However, the call for more transparency on arms has also been heard in recent months from a small quarter of liberal Thai military thinkers. They view Thailand's willingness to report to the UN on its arms holding and purchases as part of confidence building measures in the region -- some gestures which Thailand can undertake right away. In recent months, there had been some effort to adopt "openness" within the Thai armed forces. For example, for the first time in Thai history, the Supreme Command Headquarters decided to come up with a "Defence White Paper", which contains Thailand's short and longterm views on security matters. Although the content of the white paper was revised and subsequently toned down, particularly sections relating to Thailand's policy towards neighbouring countries, it is still a remarkable document. It reveals parts of the hearts and minds of Thai military strategists. Since the end of Cold War, the need to have more transparency in defence procurements has been widely debated and eventually accepted as one of the trust-building measures for the region. Somehow, quite a few military leaders here believe vehemently that Thailand's security could be further compromised if Bangkok adheres to the UN arms register. To the Thai military, the prevailing idea is that an arms register could mean disarmament in the long-run. They also see this mechanism as a Western attempt to control the country's defence and security policy. On the other hand, Thailand's pattern of arms procurement in the past two decades also poses a barrier to the principle of transparency. Although US-made arms remain the core of Thai weapons, some cheap and sub-standard ones have also found their way into the Thai arsenal. These weapons, mainly Chinese-made, were purchased at friendship prices, which were arbitrary. Also, most of the transactions were not well-documented either at the source or in the recipient countries. Some of the military, leaders, have privately expressed concern that an arms register could expose this weakness which in turn could have an adverse effect on the armed forces. Under the UN Register of Conventional Arms, the participating countries are voluntarily called upon to provide data on imports and exports and other general background on procurement and national holding. Therefore, the Thai arms imports from the US and other Western countries would be well documented and could be identified. Within Asean, Malaysia has proposed the establishment of a Regional Arms Register to complement the work of the UN Register. So far, there has not been any consensus among Asean countries on this issue. The attitude of the Indochinese countries is still unknown for the time being. Last year, Singapore was among the eighty countries that submitted reports for the UN register. The island republic's report is believed to contain information on its conventional weapons which includes tanks, armoured combat vehicles, artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, among others. Being the host of the Asean Regional Forum, which will discuss the arms register issue, Thailand has a crucial role to play. The military leaders would require a proper understanding of significances and implications. Indeed, the initiative will not limit arms export or import of any weapon, it only monitors with the hope that it could reduce suspicions which in the first place cause the arms race. Within Asean, Thailand's embrace of the register would send a positive signal to the region, which of late has harboured high levels of suspicion of Thailand's defence posture. The case in point is the beefing up of the country's naval forces which has already caused concern as it could lead to Thailand having a blue water force capacity in the future. The recent decision to purchase a used aircraft carrier from Spain does not augur well with the general mood within the region. Like it or not, the Thai armed forces have to deal with the issue of an arms register sooner or later. Instead of having an apprehensive approach to the whole issue, it would be in Thai interests to adopt a more forward looking strategy like Malaysia and Singapore, which have also increased their arms stockpile in the past few years. As one of the original supporters of the idea, broached two years ago after the Gulf War, Thailand could begin to contribute to this UN effort in a small way by now submitting its defence white paper to the UN register, like what the British government did last year. Incrementally, it can file reports on categories of weapons that the Thais feel comfortable to disclose. Located centrally in mainland Southeast Asia, Thailand's transparency is indispensable in shaping the new strategic order and making the region safer.
