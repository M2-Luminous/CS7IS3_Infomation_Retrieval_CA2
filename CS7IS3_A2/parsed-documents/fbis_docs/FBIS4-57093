TRABAJADORES newspaper, mouthpiece of the CTC, underscored that the recent decision by the National Assembly of the People's Government (Parliament) reflects policies designed to cleanse public finances, to eliminate excess money in circulation, and to restore economic development. The CTC added that the drafting of policies to end the crisis was achieved through the active participation of the workers in a process of large meetings in which [words indistinct] participated. TRABAJADORES added: This is how the most difficult part of the process began; it is a process that will require the people's support and understanding, timely information, a great amount of discipline, and rigorous control to implement the policies. The newspaper warned it is a long and complex process in which other economic, organizational, labor, and wage measures must be included. The measures will be adopted amid an iron-clad U.S. economic blockade, which has cost the country more than $41 million and whose effects, according to several estimates, in 1993 alone, prevented the country from obtaining 40 percent of the foreign exchange that could have been attained with the same level of production and investments, the newspaper noted. The CTC mounthpiece maintained that another adverse factor is that workers are in dire straits because of the abrupt loss of markets and the prices that Cuba was paid for sugar, nickel, citric fruits, and other products in the now defunct Soviet Union and other socialist European countries. TRABAJADORES explained that the country has to resolve its excess cash circulation problems with hardly 23 percent of the resources it had four years ago for development. This also has to be done without external financial resources, as well as within the principles of solidarity and social justice. TRABAJADORES concluded by saying that the Assemblies for Economic Efficiency, which are to begin on 16 May, will carry on the work begun in the parliaments in the workplace. They will prove to be a worthy tool for reducing subsidies and costs, applying strict control measures for material resources, and systematically contributing to the economy.
