As BELAPAN has learned, the management of the National Press Center has withheld its consent to hold the news conference, explaining that the ministers are just "private people." At the press center of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, a BELAPAN correspondent has learned that, in connection with the dismissal of [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislav Shushkevich, Vladimir Yegorov considers the press conference ill-timed. Nevertheless, the Journalists' Union of Belarus is currently working on holding such a press conference.
