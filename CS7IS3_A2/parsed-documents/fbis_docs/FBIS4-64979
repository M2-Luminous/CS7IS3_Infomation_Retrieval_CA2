This ought also to benefit neighboring countries, Weizsaecker said at a luncheon in Bonn today in honor of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The Federal Republic's firm integration in NATO and the European Union is an important prerequisite for the success of this path. [as received] The federal president stressed that the growing integration of the Russian Federation into the European and international institutions is equally important for Germans. The countries located between Germany and Russia should also be included in this process in a trusting way. Weizsaecker described Russia as "a great nation." The Germans have themselves been able to experience this and are grateful to Russia. The federal president added: "How else would the regaining of state unity have been possible for us in freedom?" With this, the Russian people have not only demonstrated their magnanimity but had also "shown far-sighted trust in the common future of our peoples." We now have to prove ourselves worthy of this strength and shoulder the tasks facing us responsibly and with optimism. Weizsaecker stressed: "For me it is one of the miracles of history that the suffering Hitler inflicted on Russia could not destroy the deep inner relationship between Germans and Russians." The German president stressed that the opportunities currently available are "historically unprecedented." They would not exist without the persistence and strength of the Russian people, nor without the desire for reform and personal courage of Yeltsin. Addressing the Russian president, Weizsaecker added: "The images of August 1991, when you risked your life to resist force and fought for free human rights, became documents of world history and will remain for posterity an example of what the actions and convictions of an individual can achieve."
