The negotiators are holding lengthy talks in a bid to find common ground concerning the general principles for national reconciliation. At this stage, the mediators virtually have no idea of how to approach the third version of the general principles because the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] continues to say no to discussing legal issues. After this afternoon's session, sources reported that there were many areas of agreement. There are no agreements yet concerning general national reconciliation principles because UNITA does not want to discuss the legal side of the dossier. Both the government and the mediators believe that the dossier should be discussed both along political and legal lines. The mediators and the observers have undertaken to work with the UNITA team this evening in a bid to settle the problem. They will attempt to persuade UNITA to accept discussions that can always fall back on the country's existing legal framework. A source said that if the mediators manage to get UNITA to agree to that, perhaps there might be an agreement on the general principles of national reconciliation by tomorrow. That source noted, that the issue of the general national reconciliation principle is just the first part of the dossier. In a clear reference to the issue of the ministerial portfolios and specific national reconciliation principles, that source said that heated talks are on the way. They will try to do away with possible loopholes to avoid any complications when those principles are implemented. [end recording]
