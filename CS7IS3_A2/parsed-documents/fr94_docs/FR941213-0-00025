FR941213-0-00025 FR941213-0-00007 40 CFR Part 52 [CA 21&hyph;2&hyph;6706; FRL&hyph;5115&hyph;2] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision; San Diego County Air Pollution Control District; San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District; South Coast Air Quality Management District AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the Federal Register on July 19, 1994 and August 24, 1994. The revisions concern rules from the following districts: the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDCAPCD), the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD), and the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). This approval action will incorporate these rules into the Federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rules control VOC emissions from surface cleaning and degreasing operations, oil sump operations, storage of materials containing VOCs, and operations related to the loading of marine tank vessels. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective on January 12, 1995. ADDRESSES: Copies of the rule revisions and EPA's evaluation report for each rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region IX office during normal business hours.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 24, 1994 in 59 FR 43521, EPA proposed to approve the following rules into the California SIP: SDCAPCD Rule 67.6, Solvent Cleaning Operations; SDCAPCD Rule 67.17, Storage of Materials Containing Volatile Organic Compounds; SJVUAPCD Rule 461.1, Organic Solvent Degreasing Operations; and SJVUAPCD Rule 465.2, Crude Oil Production Sumps. SCAQMD Rule 1142, Marine Tank Vessel Operations, was proposed for approval into the California SIP on July 19, 1994 in 59 FR 36731. SDCAPCD Rule 67.6 was adopted on October 16, 1990 and submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) on April 5, 1991. SDCAPCD Rule 67.17 was adopted on September 21, 1993 and submitted on February 11, 1994. SJVUAPCD Rule 461.1 and Rule 465.2, both adopted on September 19, 1991, and SCAQMD Rule 1142, adopted on June 19, 1991, were all submitted by the CARB on January 28, 1992. These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amended Act. A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRMs) cited above. EPA has evaluated all of the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPRMs cited above. EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and evaluations has been provided in 59 FR 36731 and 59 FR 43521, and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at EPA's Region IX office. Response to Public Comments A 30-day public comment period was provided in 59 FR 36731 and 59 FR 43521. No comments were received. EPA Action EPA is finalizing action to approve the above rules for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the submittal under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D of the CAA. This approval action will incorporate these rules into the Federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Process The OMB has exempted this action from review under Executive Order 12866.
