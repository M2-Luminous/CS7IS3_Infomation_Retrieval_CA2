Recent publications about the Ministry of Defense in the RESPUBLIKA newspaper are "irresponsible, biassed and aimed at creating sensational news at any cost," the ex-minister said. Butkevicius said he regrets that the timing of a series of articles in RESPUBLIKA "coincided with Lithuania's statement on its intention to approach West European defensive structures." The former minister said Lithuania had to choose from two ways of behaving before it was internationally recognized -- either to carry out a policy of doing nothing, or to develop national defense. "I and my colleagues chose the second way."
