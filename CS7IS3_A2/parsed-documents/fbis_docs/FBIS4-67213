When police experts searched him, they found heroin worth 1.5 million schilling hidden in a camera case. Moreover, they found statuettes that are probably also made of the same drug. In the interrogation, the Spaniard admitted to being HIV positive and said that he had taken over the drugs from his fellow traveler Juan Ripoli Tocho (43), also a Spanish citizen.
