The young people of the fishing sector, representing the nation's different provinces, held the sector discussion in Cienfuegos Province. Such important topics as achieving greater efficiency and productivity, taking better care of the work force, increasing the movement of innovators and efficiency experts, and confronting criminal actions took up the greatest part of the session. During their speeches, the delegates pointed out the way Cuba's young people are at the center of the nation's problems and discussed the initiatives they are undertaking. [Begin unidentified speaker recording] I don't need to tell you that there has been a tremendous deterioration in the work force because of this crime problem. In the past three years, we have lost approximately 1,000 people, because of all these things -- as many captains [patrones] as crew [lancheros] and baiters [encarnadores]. I mean, it is really quite serious. And we who need the support of the comrades from the [word indistinct] of the ministry and the comrades who are involved with these things... [pauses] We have followed up with the comrades from the UJC's national bureau and the provincial UJC bureau to try to recruit 80 young people to the center. The UJC immediately moved forward on the task. We have the 80 youths for the center, but well, a bit... [pauses] the entry of these new young people into the center has, as we say in proper Cuban, stalled [se ha trabado]. [end recording] Also analyzed at this fishing sector discussion was the progress of fish farming in the country -- the possibilities that exist with a reservoir capacity of 9 million cubic meters of water in Cuba, in addition to all the infrastructure that has been created to produce fry. Nevertheless, there is still quite a way to go before some 40,000 tons of fish a year can be produced to supply the population. The main difficulties lie in the lack of a work force, and its instability. The plenum resolved to create a new generation of fishermen as was done in the first years of the Revolution. The residents of Cienfuegos expressed their experience in this task, and fundamentally in developing family fish farming.
