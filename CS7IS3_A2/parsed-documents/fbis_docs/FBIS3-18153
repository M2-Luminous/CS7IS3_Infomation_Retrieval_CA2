Conversely, the Swedish People's Party has not been able to draw any advantage from the popularity of presidential candidate Elisabeth Rehn. This is seen from one of the polls that the Finnish Broadcasting Company released on Wednesday [9 February]. The Social Democratic Party is now supported by 32.5 percent of eligible voters, compared with 22 percent in the parliamentary election three years ago. Support for both the Center and Conservative Parties is now put at 17.5 percent. In 1991 almost 25 percent voted for the Center Party and over 19 percent for the Conservatives. The survey was done by Taloustutkimous [marketing research firm] in January-February. A total of 1,900 citizens were asked their opinion.
