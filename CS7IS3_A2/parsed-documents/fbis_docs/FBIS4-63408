A Client? An Enemy?"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Many will remember that soon after he took the Kremlin throne, the incumbent president described Russia's position as a country staying "in the antechamber": Soon another "revelation" followed: Apparently Russia needs to be "raised from its knees." And now other countries have been asked to use "vy" [formal mode of address] in talking with Russia. [passage omitted] In its time Turkey was called "the sick man" of Europe. Now, increasingly, foreign press describes Russia as a seriously ailing state with a heart ready to break. Zbigniew Brzezinski reflects: If Russia is not an enemy anymore, what is it then: an ally, or a client, or simply an enemy that has suffered a defeat? We shall not discuss today the main reason for Russia's deplorable condition. Yet one cannot but admit that the present policy makers indeed possess an exceptional talent for destruction. It is not just anyone that is capable within a few years of bringing one of the "superpowers" to its "knees," moreover with its own hands. [passage omitted] The rapid destruction of Russian industry and agriculture and the downfall of science make Russia's position on the world arena all the more shaky. It would be naive to suppose that the Western business world would seriously reckon with a country on the verge of an economic catastrophe. To be sure, red carpets are being unrolled before the Russian president. But what is happening in reality? [passage omitted] At the end of August the last Russian soldiers will leave Germany -- the soldiers who, at the command of the whole world, made a decisive contribution to smashing the Nazi regime. Yet representatives of western states -- participants in the anti-Hitler coalition -- refused to take part in the sendoff ceremony. What cunning political calculations lie behind this? Yet Russia's humiliation does not stop here. From an interview that the Russian president had with DER SPIEGEL we have learned an amazing piece of news: Yeltsin has called on the Bundeswehr "to take on peace-keeping missions not only in Yugoslavia but also in the restive CIS states." An excellent "present" to the peoples of the former USSR on the 50th anniversary of our Victory in the Great Patriotic War! Seeing such policy by the Kremlin, the Pentagon is stepping up pressure on Moscow, demanding that joint U.S. and Russian military exercises be held in Russia's heartland. "The working people of Orenburg and Volga regions, as well as all people of Russia," says a joint statement issued on this occasion by 14 public organizations of the region and titled "U.S. Troops Have Nothing To Do On Our Soil", are pained to see how, in the course of and anti-people's reform, the country's military and economic might and its political authority are falling. The ever growing unceremoniousness, with which Western powers are openly interfering in Russia's internal affairs, arouses anger and indignation." Many of the world's press publications also see Russia's national humiliation in the unscrupulousness shown toward Moscow by the NATO countries delivering air strikes on Bosnia, not deeming it necessary even to inform Russia about them in advance. The picture will be more complete if it is recalled that gentlemen reformers have driven the country into the trap of powerful Western financial centers. The clutch of the IMF and the World Bank is merciless. According to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, Russia already owes the West more than $80 billion, of which $32 billion is to be paid this year. Experts on this problems, for instance, French Professor Bernard Notain, warn: "The ongoing enslavement is setting the stage for a subsequent dismemberment of the country." The logical question is: Who in fact has brought Russia down to its knees and forced it out into the antechamber? FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU states, "Russia is in no position to demonstrate that cooperation with it can be fruitful, and therefore it is merely imitating activity, conditioned by helplessness." Where will the leaders -- who rather than ensure effective protection of the country's national interests, are only capable of imitating policy -- steer Russia?
