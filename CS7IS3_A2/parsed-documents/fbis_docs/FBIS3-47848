On 17 January an official concerned of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that "a joint declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is not an act between countries [kukka kanui haengwi] and it is, therefore, impossible to turn it into an international treaty," adding "the issue of nuclear reprocessing facilities on the Korean peninsula should be solved between North and South Korea." The official continued: "The government's policy is that if the radiochemical laboratory North Korea possesses now turns out to be a small-scale nuclear reprocessing facility it will persuade North Korea, through the North-South Joint Nuclear Control Committee, to close the facility and abide by the joint declaration of denuclearization."
