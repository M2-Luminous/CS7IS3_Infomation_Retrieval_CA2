FR941116-2-00040 FR941116-2-00027 [OPP&hyph;30362A; FRL&hyph;4918&hyph;5] PMC Specialties Group Inc.; Approval of Pesticide Product Registrations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces Agency approval of applications submitted by PMC Specialties Group, Inc., to conditionally register four pesticide products containing a new active ingredient not included in any previously registered products pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Robert Forrest, Product Manager (PM) 14, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 219, CM #2, Environmental Protection Agency, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy, Arlington, VA 22202, (703&hyph;305&hyph;6600). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Register of April 29, 1994 (59 FR 22160), which announced that PMC Specialties Group, Inc., 501 Murray Road, Cincinnati, OH 45217, had submitted four applications to conditionally register the pesticide products ReJeX-iT AP-50, ReJeX-iT TP-40, ReJeX-iT MA, and ReJeX-iT AG-36 (File Symbols 58035&hyph;A, 58035&hyph;T, 58035&hyph;I, and 58035&hyph;O),~ containing the active ingredient methyl anthranilate (CAS No. 134&hyph;20&hyph;3) at 50, 40, 100, and 14.5 percent respectively, an active ingredient not included in any previously registered products. ~~~~~~~~~ The applications ~listed below were approved on September 16, 1994, for the following products: 1. ReJeX-iT AP-50 for the reduction of bird activity on temporary pools of water, except those bordering airports (EPA Reg. No. 58035&hyph;6). 2. ReJeX-iT AP-40 for the reduction of bird activity on landfills, tailing ponds, and impoundments (EPA Reg. No. 58035&hyph;7). 3. ReJeX-iT MA for formulation use only of registered, end-use products for bird control (EPA Reg. No. 58035&hyph;8). 4. ReJeX-iT AG-36 for use to repel birds such as Canada geese from golf courses and other turf areas (EPA Reg. No. 58035&hyph;9). A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain data are lacking, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration period and do not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional registration period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects; and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of methyl anthranilate, and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations which show that use of methyl anthranilate during the period of conditional registration will not cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is, in the public interest. Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that these conditional registrations are in the public interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions, and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects to man and the environment. These products are conditionally registered in accordance with FIFRA section 3(c)(7)(C). Only the first two studies listed below are required for these products, except for ReJeX-iT AG-36 which requires all three studies. Within 1-year of registration, or October 1, 1995, the following studies must be submitted: 1. Avian Acute Oral (Guideline Reference Number 154&hyph;6). 2. Acute Freshwater Fish LC&hyph; 50 (154&hyph;8). 3. Beneficial Insect (Honey Bee Acute Contact LD&hyph; 50 Study (141&hyph;1). More detailed information on this conditional registration is contained in a Chemical Fact Sheet on methyl anthranilate. A copy of this fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (703&hyph;305&hyph;5805). Requests for data must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and must be addressed to the Freedom of Information Office (A-101), 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. Such requests should: (1) Identify the product name and registration number and (2) specify the data or information desired. Authority: 7 U.S.C. 136.
