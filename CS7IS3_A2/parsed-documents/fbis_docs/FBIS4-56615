The talks between the government and the COB made great progress early this morning but later the rupture seemed imminent as a result of the insults against President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada by peasant leader Evo Morales during the negotiations. "If Morales does not apologize" to the president "we will break off the negotiations" said Government Minister German Quiroga at Government House. Meanwhile, the environment of violence in the rural area between the peasants who blockade roads and the passengers who want to get to their destination reached its highest peak when a group of peasants apparently caused a bus to fall into a 500-meter cliff killing three people and wounding six. Cochabamba Police Commander Mario Nunez said the bus accident that took place near Independencia is being investigated to find out who is responsible for it.

The peasants asserted that an armed group of civilians broke up the blockade with shots and tear gas but the government denies any participation. The peasant leaders of Potosi Department said that today they will march to Potosi to request the release of the peasants under arrest and to enquire about those missing. Felix Santos, executive secretary of the General Trade Union Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia (CSUTCB), said the whereabouts of about 12 peasants of Potosi is unknown. Another unidentified individual died during a clash between peasants who closed the road from Sucre to Cochabamba and a group of passengers desperate to get to their destination. The Chuquisaca prefect (governor) admitted that some people were wounded but noted that no one reported any death during blockades in Chuquisaca Department, which is now isolated because of the official closure of roads and highways.
