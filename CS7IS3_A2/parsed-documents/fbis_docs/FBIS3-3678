There, he put forward the new idea about the "New Pacific Community." In November, he played host to leaders of the organization for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] and held the first informal meeting with them. Such major diplomatic moves adopted by Clinton in Asia prompted people to analyze and comment on the U.S. foreign policy trend. The European allies on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean doubted and worried that the United States might shift the focus of its foreign policy "eastward." Thus, a U.S. State Department spokesman appeased the Europeans by quoting a children's song: "Making new friends but not forgetting old friendships; one is silver and the other is gold." In January this year, Clinton attended the NATO summit meeting in Brussels and then visited Prague and Moscow. According to the White House timetable, he will still make a second visit to Europe this year. The "old friends" reacted warmly. Britain's Thames Television said: "Europe remains the U.S. first lover." What then are the specific positions Europe and Asia separately hold in the U.S. diplomatic pattern? To answer this question, we should first know what objective is being pursued by the United States in its foreign affairs. There are three major pillars in the U.S. foreign policy: Economic security, military strength, and the advancement of "democracy." All this is aimed at safeguarding U.S. global interests and its "leading position." If we put Europe and Asia to the two sides of such a scale by comparison, it may not be difficult for us to find the answer. Let us first view the issue of economic security, to which the United States gives top priority. In Europe (mainly Western Europe) there exists 50 percent of U.S. corporations' overseas investment (about $120 billion), 60 percent of their overseas profits, and 65 percent of all foreign investment made by the United States. For example, up to the end of 1992, the investment made by American companies was only $78 billion. In addition, the European Community is also a major region where the United States can achieve a foreign trade surplus. Asia is the region which absorbs the largest part of U.S. exports ($127 billion in 1992 against $117 billion to Europe) and is also the region where U.S. exports have increased at the fastest speed. Between 1978 and 1992, the U.S. exports to Asia have multiplied over four times but, in the same period, the U.S. exports to Europe multiplied 2.9 times. The exports to Asia provide 2.5 million jobs in the United States (those to Europe creating some 2 million jobs). More importantly, as the region recording the fastest economic growth in the contemporary world, Asia has development prospects which are strongly attractive to the United States. In the 1960's, Asia's total GNP accounted for only 4 percent of the world's total. The proportion has now increased to 25 percent and it is expected that it will reach 30 percent in the early 21st century. The volume of trade in Asia now accounts for 25 percent of the world's total, the foreign exchange reserves kept by the central banks in Asia accounts for 33 percent of the world's total, and Asia's population accounts for 59 percent of the world's total. As long as the U.S. share of this huge market increases by 1 percentage point, some 300,000 jobs will be added to the U.S. job market. In such circumstances, it is not hard to understand why President Clinton, who took reinvigoration of the U.S. economy as his priority task, is trying to make a "new friend" out of Asia. We can then review the issue of national security backed by its military strength, an objective pursued by the United States. In this regard, the United States is facing two vistas which are in striking contrast to each other. Europe: After the end of the Cold War, the Warsaw Pact was dissolved and the confrontation between two major military blocs came to an end. However, ethnic conflicts, territorial disputes, and religious contradictions previously covered up by the Cold War were all revealed. Europe cannot earn any "peace dividend"; on the contrary, it has become a new center of turbulence. The civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has not only shocked Europe but also threatened stability in other regions of the world and posed a challenge against the U.S. "leading position." Asia: Problems in such hot spots as Cambodia and Afghanistan were successively settled, mitigated, or turned into internal strife. Conflicts there have calmed down. The parties concerned are carrying out dialogue and negotiations on the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. Although there are difficulties and twists and turns, the direct dialogue on an equal footing and negotiations are favorable to the proper settlement of the contradictions and problems. China is pursuing an independent and peace-oriented foreign policy and is making great contributions to the maintenance of peace and stability in Asia. As compared with other regions of the world, Asia enjoys a rather stable political situation. In such circumstances, it is not hard to understand why President Clinton, who announced that the United States "must lead the world," declared: "The core of our security remains in Europe." The so-called "promotion of democracy" means to promote the political and economic systems of the West all over the world and this will guarantee the security of the United States. In this regard, there are different opinions inside the United States. Former secretary of state Henry Kissinger recently refuted the viewpoint that countries adopting Western-style "democracy" will not launch a war and that countries adopting the Western-style market economy will automatically become "democratic." Kissinger said that "this was not the inevitable result" but we will not discuss this here. In view of the strategic needs in "promoting democracy," the United States considers Europe as its cooperation partner. The United States and Europe share the same cultural traditions, the same social systems, and the same values. So, the "old friendship" will not be forgotten. Such characteristics and changes in the situations in Europe and Asia, especially the increasing importance of economic factors in post-Cold War international relations, have prompted the United States to adjust its policies toward Europe and Asia. Clinton explicitly pointed out: "While the focus of our attention has shifted to the real global economic challenge, we must not only direct our eyes toward the other side of the Atlantic Ocean but also toward the other side of the Pacific Ocean." The U.S. strategy of facing both oceans serves its national interests. At the same time, such a strategy will also provide more room for its diplomatic maneuvers. People have noted that late last year, when the United States and Europe were involved in a fierce dispute over the issue of farm produce trade in the Uruguay Round of trade talks, Clinton frankly said that if the talks failed, APEC would "provide us with the means of expanding our market in the Asia-Pacific region." His visits to Europe this year will give a similar hint to Japan, which said "no" to the United States in their trade talks. Therefore, President Clinton will continue to maneuver between his "old friend" and "new friend" according to changes in the international situation in order to safeguard the U.S. national interests and will further readjust his diplomatic tactics to deal with the two oceans.
