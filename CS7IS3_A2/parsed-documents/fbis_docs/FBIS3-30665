He said it would be fatal to allow Zhirinovskiy to enter the republic at all. Zhirinovskiy, Russian ultra nationalist and chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) which emerged victorious in the recent parliamentary elections in Russia, told REUTER this week that "the Czech Republic will lose Moravia soon and only Prague and a few breweries in which the beer will turn sour will be left of it." The leadership of the far right Assembly for the Republic- Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) announced this week its decision to invite Zhirinovskiy to visit the Czech Republic "in order to obtain information about the programme and goal of his party." "If some irresponsible person were to invite Zhirinovskiy to the Czech Republic, then the invitation should be solely to a mental hospital," Rudolf Opatril, spokesman for the Czech-Moravian Centre Party (CMS) parliamentary group, told journalists today. He said that "Zhirinovskiy's babble, be it about Moravia or anything else, is not a matter to be dealt with by politicians or journalists, but by psychiatrists." Zhirinovskiy is a person dangerous for the whole world, Opatril said, adding that "it was impossible to react to his statements by jokes" but it is necessary to resolutely condemn him. "If someone invites Zhirinovskiy to the Czech Republic, we will consider this an act of high treason," he said. The government coalition Christian Democratic Party (KDS) considered Zhirinovskiy's visit to the Czech Republic undesirable, given his extreme views, the KDS said in a statement given to CTK today. "The KDS believes that the statements and behaviour of Zhirinovskiy during his visit to other countries serve as a sufficient reason for declaring him a persona non grata and for not allowing him to enter the Czech Republic," the statement says.
