After the talks both premiers expressed their countries' willingness to cooperate, particularly in concrete economic projects. Pawlak said that, in addition to the Partnership For Peace Initiative, partnership for economic development was significant at present. He said that frequent contacts between the two countries' premiers should be followed up by meetings between the two countries' ministers and businessmen. Together with Polish President Lech Walesa and Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski, Pawlak is in Prague attending talks between leaders of the Visegrad Group countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary) and a U.S. delegation led by President Bill Clinton.
