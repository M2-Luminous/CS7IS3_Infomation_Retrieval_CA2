Its mechanics geared in the realm of action and not words, the new policy does not mean that Iraqi diplomacy has downgraded its efforts toward the international organization, especially as Iraqi delegations abroad have adopted quiet diplomacy and on the spot decisionmaking in bilateral relations. This is done in the context of a political reality that takes into consideration the mode of conduct of international relations and American strategic pressures through the Security Council and its bodies like the special commission and others. That means that Iraqi diplomatic activity has to deal with the special circumstances that have formed and continue to form obstacles and limitations that affect international bodies, countries, and organizations, attempting thereby to deliver these countries and organizations from consequences that might arise against them through American pressure. Iraqi diplomatic activity has not been limited to dispatching delegations, but has included steps to reinvigorate the foreign service and to support its embassy employees in European countries. Diplomatic cadres have begun their travel to those countries after ministerial orders were issued to transfer them there. According to its custom, Baghdad remains the hub of economic and political activity. No day passes without a delegation, or perhaps more than one, making the rounds of ministerial buildings, especially the foreign, petroleum, trade, and industry ministries. Some employees of these ministries are attempting to shroud the delegations and their nationalities in secrecy. However, it is clear that in addition to Asian countries, most of the European delegations belong to France and Russia. No one can positively say that these delegations were unable to reach agreements or, at least, common understandings to respond to mutual interests in a manner that is in accordance with the nature of the international situation that is not applicable to Iraq alone, after it came to apply to other countries. It has become a restraint on their freedom to conduct their trade policies. In order to overcome American surveillance, some countries have resorted to sending unofficial delegations headed by a former minister, or a member of parliament or presidents of chambers of commerce and industry in their own countries. These delegations are often amazed by Iraqi negotiators whom they expect to be "agreeable" to enormous concessions which are usually called political or circumstancial concessions. However, they are confronted by sound commercial terms, which leave their adversaries with no option but to offer concessions themselves. It is clear to the observer that current Iraqi diplomatic activity is proceeding with studied steps and limited goals. It has temporarily shelved wishful thinking and has adopted a realistic policy in practical steps. The February visits point to this. A delegation to Geneva to take part in a conference on human rights and disarmamemt was led by the foreign minister, Muhammed Sa'id al-Sahhaf. Tehran witnessed bilateral meetings between Iraqi and Iranian delegations. The assistant foreign minister, Sa'ad Faysal, led the Iraqi delegation. Up to the time of writing, Assistant Minister Dr. Riyad al-Qaysi is still in Paris conducting negotiations that, apparently, are not limited to trade and legal matters only, but cross over to political matters too. No doubt, they are focused on bilateral relations, which are witnessing improvements in numerous areas. Diplomatic activity did not cease with the visits of last February. The current month of March will witness activities that are intended to pave the way for the creation of a non-hostile atmosphere for any new step that aims to break the severity of the embargo, even partially, during the coming Security Council deate. It is expected that Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz will arrive in New York to begin a series of meetings. If no official communique or notice of the visit and its date are issued by now, then it is expected that the time for the arrival of Mr. 'Aziz in New York will be the end of the month. Observers expect the visit to have tangible positive results that will be the basis for realistic diplomatic relations that Iraq will be able to establish in various ways. The most important first step is the invigoration of bilateral relations with some European countries and the neighboring countries of the region. Then there is the positive cooperation with the organs of the international organization in such a manner as to frustrate any pretext that might be exploited under diplomatic cover to extend the duration of the embargo. Then there is placing the United Nations in such a position as to make it far from simple for it to bind the articles of the American political resolution with a legal and legitimate cover.
