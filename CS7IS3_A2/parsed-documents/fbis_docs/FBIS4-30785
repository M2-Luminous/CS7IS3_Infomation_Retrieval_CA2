For details on this hearing, let us follow our correspondent at the trial: [Xhaxhiu] Today's hearing of the trial of 10 high functionaries of the Albanian communist state opened with explanations by the defendant Simon Stefani. The leadership of the Party of Labor of Albania [PPSh] is the only unfortunate leadership of all the Eastern communist countries to have such a destiny and experience prison, the former number one at the Interior Ministry stated in his explanations. The former Politburo member did not neglect giving a further philosophic-Marxist analysis of the political party system that prevailed for decades on end in Albania, stressing that the party decisions had to be carried out. I did not order the dragging of dead bodies on the border, I did not order the shooting of those who crossed the border, he said. Speaking about other sections of the indictment, the defendant Stefani rejected them and considered the indictment to be generally erroneous and premeditated. After theorizing about the impossibility of economic equality in socialism, the defendant explained further the practices that he had found in place, the implementation of standing regulations, and the efforts he had made in changing the instructions on telephone checks and the opening of mail. The trial continued later with explanations by defendant Hekuran Isai, the other former interior minister. In his two hours of explanations, Isai attacked the past and present left and right wings, assessed the progressives in the bosom of the Politburo, and considered the PPSh to be fatally broken in the face of the hurricane of democratic youth. The defendant Isai, too, did not fail to carry out an autopsy on the regime at the pinnacle of which he had existed for many successive years. Citing [Albanian patriot] Noli and [Albanian statesman] Saidi, passing from Spartacus to Achilles, from Enver Hoxha to Poland's [Communist Prime Minister] Rakowski, from a Kosovar poet to the Spanish Gonzales, the defendant spoke at length about social systems, the former PPSh Central Committee, the functioning of the Secretariat, and the expenses of the red group, which according to Isai's arithmetic, resulted in only 1 cent grabbed each year from the Albanian people. The former deputy chairman of the infamous Eviction-Exile Commission did not accept his role on this Commission. The post of deputy chairman, he said, does not constitute an error, just as the 118 decisions approved by him on the eviction and exile of dozens of innocent families do not constitute errors. Isai challenged the indictment with global figures. The same stance was maintained in the previous hearing by defendant Manush Myftiu, the chief of the Commission. According to the Association of Former Convicted and Political Prisoners, there approximately 60,000 persons were imprisoned or exiled during the communist regime. The same association confirms that about 700,000 were persecuted nationally during this period. Nevertheless, on behalf of the defendants Isai and Myftiu, two of the leading characters on this infamous Commission, no one could dare to raise his voice against the existence of this Dantesque commission.
