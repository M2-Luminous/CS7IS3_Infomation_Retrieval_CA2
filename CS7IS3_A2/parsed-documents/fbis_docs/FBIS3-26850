Chen Junsheng said: Agricultural means of production are the most basic guarantee for agricultural development. Whether this work is done well or poorly will have a direct impact on whether the peasants' enthusiasm for production will be effectively sustained over a long period. In a certain sense, the work will be the most important factor that will decide whether China will have a bumper harvest in the agricultural sector in 1994. Currently, China is gradually establishing and developing a socialist market economy. While multichannel competition is very fierce, supply and marketing cooperatives, acting as major distributors, still command a majority share of China's total sales volume and market. Therefore, they must play their roles to stabilize the market. China has successively raised its agricultural production, particularly grain production, to several higher levels in recent years. Such achievements have been inseparably linked to supply and marketing cooperatives that supplied agricultural means of production and provided other services. We hope they will, as they have done in the past, perform their tasks in a down-to-earth manner so as to properly do their work in supplying agricultural means of production in 1994. Chen Junsheng stressed: In light of the current situation, first, we must avoid any drastic fluctuation in the prices of agricultural production means. The general situation is that China's stability depends on stability in the agricultural sector. Appropriately handling agricultural affairs is not the sole concern of any single department; it requires that all concerned should have the overall picture in mind. The purpose of supply and marketing cooperatives playing their role as major suppliers of agricultural means of production is to provide better services to enhance agricultural production; it is not directed at raising profits. Therefore, supply and marketing cooperatives at various levels should reduce distribution links as much as possible so as to curtail expenses. We should eliminate those previously so-called normal circulation links that can be eliminated; this move should be considered a reform. We should even more resolutely eliminate abnormal circulation links. Only then can we lower expenses and prices and in the end guarantee the market's smooth circulation with reasonable prices that peasants can bear. Second, we should coordinate with relevant departments to properly safeguard that markets of agricultural production means circulate smoothly. Various localities must strictly investigate and handle activities detrimental to peasants, including excessive numbers of operators dealing in agricultural production means, unreasonable increases in commodity prices, and profiteering behavior whereby the same commodities are resold several times. Third, we should strengthen management of the quality of agricultural means of production and establish efficient administrative organizations, systems, and procedures to strictly crack down on fake and substandard commodities. Supply and marketing cooperatives at various levels definitely should not allow fake and substandard agricultural means of production to appear on their premises. They should ensure that an abundant high-quality supply of agricultural means of production will be available for the peasants. Fourth, we should establish necessary reserve systems to ensure that the requirements for agricultural production and disaster relief can be fulfilled.
