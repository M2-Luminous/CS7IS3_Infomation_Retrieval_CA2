At a joint news conference following the official talks, Jovanovic said it had been agreed in the talks that sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had been made redundant a long time ago by the huge and important changes that had taken place in Bosnia itself and on the territory of former Yugoslavia. The two ministers pointed to the negative consequences of the NATO air strikes against Serb positions in Bosnia and NATO siding with the Muslims. This action dealt a heavy blow to the peace process and the political process in the region, Jovanovic said, adding that now much more time and effort would be necessary to put the peace process back on track. The sanctions have been inflicting damage even on those who designed and imposed them, Jovanovic said. He stressed there was no longer anyone who would be ready to take part in this, nor support the anachronism that was created in Bosnia and on the territory of former Yugoslavia. Greek Minister Karolos Papoulias, having expressed pleasure over meeting Jovanovic again, pointed to the need for firmer cooperation between the Balkan countries in resolving the issue of sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Speaking about sanctions, Papoulias said there was "scope for actions within the European Union." However, he spoke more about cooperation between the Balkan countries in that sphere, which, as he said, should take joint action. "In a series of meetings with Bulgarian and Romanian colleagues, we agreed we would work together on the problem of sanctions," Papoulias said, convinced Hungary and Ukraine would join such an action. He said at today's talks they also discussed the idea of organizing an inter-Balkan conference on cooperation between the states in the Balkan region that would take place when peace was reached on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. "We have agreed with Minister Jovanovic to work in this direction with the ministers of other Balkan states," Papoulias said, listing Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary as first partners in connection with the idea. Minister Jovanovic expressed his gratitude to Greece and to the Greek nation for the aid given to the Serb people. "This aid comes from the very soul, and that makes it even more precious," he said, stressing that the Serb and Greek nations were linked by ties of friendship that could not be severed. Jovanovic particularly expressed his gratitude in connection with an action currently taking place in Greece for gathering millions of signatures for a petition to suspend sanctions against the FRY, which would be sent to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. The Yugoslav minister said the policy of peace, dialogue, and agreement was a permanent orientation of the FRY. That is why we are asking the international community to treat us on an equal footing. Everything that has been imposed on the Serb nation as a form of punishment must be removed to enable negotiations on an equal basis. "Talks cannot take place under the threat of bombing or under political and economic pressure," Jovanovic said. It is expected that Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will receive the Yugoslav foreign minister tomorrow morning.
