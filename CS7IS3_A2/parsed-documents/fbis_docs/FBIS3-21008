The TFTS system makes it possible to establish telephone communications--or to send faxes and data--from a plane to any country by means of automatic dialing. The air-ground link is directly established through specialized equipment aboard the aircraft and a cellular network of stations on the ground, each with a range of 240 km linked to the stationary telephone network. At the end of 1990, France Telecom joined with several European telephone carriers to create a TFTS network that would gradually cover all of Western Europe by 1994. The telephone carriers are also working with six European airlines (Air France for France) which will begin full-scale testing early next year aboard their planes.
