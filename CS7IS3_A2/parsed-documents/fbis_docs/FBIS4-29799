At 1830 on 17 June, the Democratic Kampuchea [DK] office received a letter from the Interior Ministry of the two-headed government signed by Sar Kheng and Yu Hokkri. It ordered the Democratic Kampuchea representative and his entire staff to withdraw from the DK office before 19 June 1994. II. According to reliable reports, Interior Minister Sar Kheng and Defense Minister Tie Banh -- both communist Vietnamese puppets -- met on the orders of their communist Vietnamese masters to adopt this measure on 14 June; that is, before the roundtable commission meeting on 15 and 16 June. III. According to these reliable documents, the Assembly did not meet to decide on this matter and the king did not know about it in advance. Therefore, the move to close the DK office in Phnom Penh was a dictatorial and fascist measure by the police and troops of the communist Vietnamese puppets. They are no different than Hitler's fascist Gestapo. This was a decision made by communist Vietnam and its puppets, who oppose national reconciliation and peace and who continue to fuel the communist Vietnamese war and annex Cambodia at will. IV. As for the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], it does feel the need to leave its office in Phnom Penh for the following reasons: 1. The PDK is not afraid of the puppets' fascist police and troops -- the lackeys of communist Vietnam. The DK has fought more than 250,000 communist Vietnamese aggressor troops since 1979. It dealt them repeated serious blows until forcing them to sign the October 1991 Paris agreement. The DK is not afraid to make sacrifices. It has done so repeatedly and has left everything behind to defend the nation, race, and land. The DK has no goal other than this -- it does not seek profit or power. 2. The DK set up this office following the Paris agreement at the request of the king and of people from various circles in Phnom Penh as well as people nationwide. It did so at the request of the overwhelming majority of peace and justice-loving countries around the world who want the various Cambodian sides to have contact and talk with one another to achieve national reconciliation and peace so that Cambodia can enjoy peace and Southeast Asia and the Asia- Pacific region can enjoy stability and security. After learning of this fascist measure, the king asked the PDK to leave to prevent the two-headed government from making trouble. At the same time, the king also told the two-headed government not to do anything affecting the DK representative. If the representative were molested, there would be great trouble. In view of this situation, the PDK decided to pull out of Phnom Penh. V. The problem is this: What was the goal behind the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their puppets closing the DK office in Phnom Penh? Our nation, people in every circle, and peace and justice-loving countries around the world have seen their goal and clearly realize the following: 1. The goal of the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their puppets and lackeys is to continue fueling the war to kill the Cambodian nation, people, and the DK. This is why, on the one hand, they have dispatched men to seek aid -- particularly weapons -- from foreign countries, while on the other hand they destroyed the roundtable meeting by refusing to discuss national reconciliation. Our entire nation and people can clearly see this with their own eyes. Increasing numbers of foreign observers have also realized that the State of Cambodia has become a two-headed government since the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] election. This is just on the outside, however. In essence, the two-headed government remains the state authority of the communist Vietnamese puppets -- 90 percent in Phnom Penh and 100 percent in the provinces. 2. In fueling their war of aggression in Cambodia -- using Cambodian traitors to kill nationalist Cambodians -- the communist Vietnamese have no hope of destroying the DK militarily. They have had bitter personal experiences, both in the full-scale war of aggression using their own army from 1979 to 1991, and thereafter. Despite this, the communist Vietnamese continue to fuel their war of aggression through their puppets in the two-headed government so they can continue to bring in Vietnamese nationals to annex Cambodia in a demographic war. The strategy of the communist Vietnamese aggressors poses a great danger to the survival of the nation and people. Faced with this immense and immediate danger, the PDK -- like other nationalist Cambodians -- has a high sense of responsibility and duty regarding the survival of the Cambodian nation and race. It cannot avoid this responsibility. Now, as in the future and in the past, the DK absolutely remains with the nation and people, sharing weal and woe. 3. Apart form the goal of killing the nation, the people, and the DK, do the communist Vietnamese have any other goals in ordering their puppet and lackey troops and police to enact this fascist measure to close the DK office in Phnom Penh? The answer to this question is very clear; there is no doubt about it. The goal of the communist Vietnamese is to cut off contact between the DK and the other Cambodian sides completely. Once they have done this, the communist Vietnamese and their puppets can do whatever they want with those who are already in their cage. This is the dark goal of the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys in adopting the fascist measure to close the DK office in Phnom Penh. VI. Another question that arises is this: Can the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys do anything they want at will? The answer to this question is also clear; there is no doubt about it. The communist Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys cannot do anything at will. The national conflict caused by the communist Vietnamese aggressors through the Communist Party of Vietnam -- which also controls the so-called Cambodian People's Party, the state authority, and over 4 million Vietnamese -- is already very acute. There is also the social conflict resulting from the communist Vietnamese aggressors' controlling and plundering the economy of the two-headed government -- from paddy, rice, corn, beans, rubber, fish, timber, and so on, to other resources. On top of this, the Vietnamese nationals who have been flowing into Cambodia -- there are more than 4 millions of them now -- have also been robbing the country. The ringleaders of the communist Vietnamese puppets are also robbing the country. The two-headed government is doing the same thing. This has deprived people in the rural areas of their farm land and workers and students in the cities of jobs. Officials, teachers, and even soldiers are being deprived of their salaries. The 15-year communist Vietnamese war of aggression continues to rage and destroy the country. Theft and robbery, insecurity, prostitution, AIDS, and all kinds of social ills are spreading. All of these conflicts are piling onto other conflicts and are near the explosion point. The communist Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys are solving this complex situation by fueling the war with one hand in an attempt to destroy the DK, which is the backbone of the resistance of the entire Cambodian nation and people in defending the nation. With the other hand, they are using fascist measures to arrest and kill the people and the masses in Phnom Penh and various provincial towns who are unable to take it any longer and have risen to fight back. Can the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys solve this? Certainly not; on the contrary, the more the communist Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed government fuel the war, the more fascist they become and the more they oppose national reconciliation. In turn, the nation and people will oppose and denounce them more and more. The forces of national reconciliation will arise and become more agitated and active in their struggle. VII. On this occasion, the PDK would like to once again affirm its stance as follows: 1. In a situation where the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys, bad elements in the Western alliance, and the two-headed government continue to fuel the war to kill the nation, the people, and the DK, the latter has every right to join the nation and people to struggle in every form to defend themselves. 2. The DK, like the entire nation and people, very much needs and wants peace and national reconciliation. In the past, present, and future, and under all circumstances, the DK will continue to stand firm and unshakable on national reconciliation. 3. The DK wants continued roundtable talks and discussions to search for national reconciliation based on the two items on the agenda as already agreed. This is a billion times better than fueling the war. Long live the mighty national reconciliation forces! [Dated] Cambodia, 21 June 1994 [Signed] PDK Chairman Khieu Samphan
