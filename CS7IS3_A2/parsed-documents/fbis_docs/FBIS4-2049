Relentlessly Launching the Drive To Crack Down on Crimes To Maintain Social Stability In the past year, courts throughout Shanghai accepted 7,844 criminal cases of the first instance, down 3.86 percent from the previous year; and concluded 7,763 cases and rendered verdicts on 12,175 criminals, down 6.67 percent from 1992. Of the 10,073 criminals, on whom the verdict was enforced, 3,129, or 31.06 percent of the total, were serious criminal offenders having committed murder, robbery, rape, intentional grave injury, major larceny, and railroad banditry. Of these, 2,154, or 68.84 percent of the serious criminal offenders, were sentenced to five years or more in prison, life imprisonment, or death (including death sentence with a stay of execution). Under unified arrangements, courts in Shanghai closely coordinated with the relevant departments and concentrated efforts to launch in depth a special antitheft drive. Throughout the year, they accepted a total of 4,157 cases involving 6,882 accused. Of these, the courts concluded 4,102 cases and sentenced 6,753 criminals, accounting for 55.47 percent of the total number of criminals sentenced. Courts at all levels in Shanghai, earnestly implementing the National People's Congress' relevant decisions, meted out swift and harsh punishments according to the law to 165 criminals who smuggled, produced, trafficked, and traded in narcotics; who smuggled, produced, and disseminated pornography; who abducted women and children for sale; who engaged in prostitition; or who assembled people to gamble. The Shanghai railroad transport courts, proceeding from the need to maintain public order, cracked down on railroad and highway bandits. Throughout the year they tried and concluded 490 cases involving 996 criminals who committed murder, robbery, rape, injury, and larceny along railroads or on trains. Of the 910 criminals on whom a verdict was already enforced, 379, or 41.65 percent of the total, were sentenced to five years or more in prison, life imprisonment, or death (including death sentence with a stay). 2. Cracking Down on Serious Economic Crimes and Punishing Corruption To Safeguard Economic Order Courts in Shanghai performed an extremely heavy task in cracking down on economic crimes. Major economic criminal cases increased markedly with the following features: 1) increased number of serious cases and volume of money involved; 2) more crimes committed by employees of banking institutions; and 3) changes in the attributes of criminals. Most of the accused were administrative and managerial, financial and accounting, supply and marketing, and maintenance personnel of enterprises and institutions or employees of banking institutions; and their age tended to become younger. Of the 18 economic criminals sentenced by the Intermediate Court, 55.6 percent were under the age of 25. Courts at all levels meted out severe punishment without mercy specifically for crimes committed by state functionaries, especially those of leading party and government organizations, judicial departments, administrative law enforcement departments, and economic management departments who took advantage of their position and powers to embezzle and misappropriate public funds and take bribes; for crimes of producing and marketing fake and shoddy goods to the detriment of consumer interests; and for fraud in economic contracts. Throughout the year, they accepted 1,086 economic cases involving 1,499 accused; and, together with the cases left over from 1992, concluded 1,075 cases involving 1,515 accused. Of the 998 criminals on whom the verdict was already enforced, 367, or 36.77 percent of the total, were sentenced to five years or more in prison, life imprisonment, or death (including death sentence with a stay). Of the economic criminals given a verdict, 40.1 percent were former state functionaries. Through holding trials, courts recovered 53.0879 million yuan of economic losses for the state and collectives. To maintain market economic order and stop unlawful competition, the courts sentenced 46 criminals involved in fake trademarks. Following the Second Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the courts took immediate action to strengthen the intensity of deepening the anticorruption drive. Three successive special trials were held in Shanghai in August, September, and October to try publicly 99 cases of embezzlement, bribery, and misappropriation of public funds. From September through December, a total of 423 economic criminal cases were concluded, equivalent to 64.88 percent of those concluded in the first eight months. 3. Intensifying Judicial Administration of Economic Cases, Using Legal Weapons To Readjust Economic Relations, and Ensuring the Establishment and Development of the Socialist Market Economy Last year, law courts handled 22,802 economic disputes of various descriptions, up 54.59 percent from the previous year. They completed the trials of 21,424 cases, up 48.77 percent from the previous year. Claims involved in litigation topped 3.83 billion yuan, a 198-percent increase over the previous year. There was an upsurge in the number of cases that reflected salient problems in the way the economy functioned. The number of cases involving foreigners and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots increased rapidly. Also, there was an increase in the number of cases in which the defendants were from outside Shanghai. Interference from protectionist practices by local authorities was serious. In light of these problems, the municipal higher court held several meetings to carefully analyze the new circumstances in which economic cases were tried, and explicitly called for enhancing concepts in five areas of the judicial administration of economic cases: Enhancing the concept of equality by providing equal legal protection to all types of market competitors, such as state-owned, collectively owned, privately run, and "partly or wholly foreign-owned" enterprises; heightening the concept of contractual obligations by fully respecting the intentions of interested parties and ensuring the realization of the market economic principle of fostering contractual practices; enhancing the concept of overall interests by resolutely resisting and opposing local protectionist practices and safeguarding the unity and authority of legal institutions; heightening the concept of policy-guided law enforcement by handling cases in strict accordance with the law where relevant legal provisions are available; by following the guidance of basic principles in policies and laws in the absence of legal provisions or explicit legal provisions; and by realistically and properly applying the criterion of whether cases are solved in a manner conducive to the "three causes"; and enhancing the concept of efficiency by striving for good political, economic, and social benefits. Law courts across the municipality actively tried cases stemming from enterprise bankruptcy, joint enterprise operations, contracting, and leasing, providing legal guarantees and services for changing operating mechanisms in enterprises. Last year, they tried 815 cases that fell under these four categories, concluding proceedings in 703 cases. They actively conducted explorations, boldly carried out practical work, and conscientiously tried stock- related cases. First, they stopped blackmarketing in stock subscription forms to maintain order in issuing stocks. Second, they halted stock speculation to maintain fair and orderly stock trading. Third, they strengthened stock companies' responsibilities as brokerages to protect stockholders' legitimate rights and interests. Fourth, they experimented with the issuance of public notices on losses incurred on stock markets to protect investors' legitimate rights and interests. The development of scientific and technological markets caused a corresponding increase in disputes involving trademarks, patents, and technological contracts. Law courts in Shanghai handled 140 cases that fell under these categories. Last year, law courts dealt with 182 cases involving foreigners and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots (including maritime cases), twice the number in the previous year. They took care to serve the policy of opening up wider to the outside world through the manner in which they handled cases. They fully exercised China's jurisdicational rights in accordance with the principle of maintaining state sovereignty. They upheld the principle of equally protecting the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese and foreign litigants, as well as litigants within and outside the national boundaries. They actively publicized China's laws and investment policies to attract foreign investment. In dealing with illegal acts committed by foreign business people, they meted out legal punishment or applied compulsory measures in accordance with the law. 4. Strengthening Civil Judicial Work To Effectively Protect the Civil Rights and Interests of Citizens and Corporations In the past year, courts accepted 36,963 civil cases of the first instance and concluded 36,864, up 12.95 percent and 14.19 percent respectively over 1992. Divorce, debt, and indemnity -- the three major categories of civil lawsuits -- accounted for nearly 80 percent of the total, of which 21,277 cases involved divorce, constituting 57.56 percent of total civil lawsuits. Courts at all levels, pursuant to the law and the Shanghai municipal regulations for protecting the aged, the young, and women and children, heard some 25,000 cases involving divorce, alimony, child and parental support, and inheritance, thereby protecting the lawful rights and interests of women, children, and the aged. Persistently giving priority to lawsuits involving the aged, courts expedited the handling of such civil cases; 90 percent of the cases were concluded in two months and most of them in less than a month, and 97 percent were resolved. In handling lawsuits related to violation of consumer interests, courts earnestly enforced the "Regulations on Protecting the Lawful Rights and Interests of Consumers in Shanghai Municipality;" of the lawsuits settled, 96 percent were won by consumers. In the past year, a total of 73 lawsuits involving housing and real estate management were accepted by the Municipal Intermediate Court alone, which handled only two such cases in 1992. While hearing individual cases, courts demanded their personnel to foster an overall concept and to refrain from adopting a wait-and-see attitude as a result of failing to obtain a clear grasp of policies and laws. They were urged to combine the hearing of housing and real estate dispute cases with the implementation of the state's macroeconomic regulation and control policies, to guard against handling cases independently, and to pay attention to the social benefits of case handling. They were also urged to persist in proceeding everything from reality and adhering to agreements in handling housing and real estate disputes; to uphold the equality of subjects before the law; and to expedite hearing and enforcement of ruling while ensuring the quality of case handling. In addition, courts also accepted 102 cases of labor disputes; and 591 civil lawsuits involving foreign and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan businessmen, thereby protecting the lawful rights and interests of foreign nationals and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan citizens in the mainland, as well as promoting the normal development of people-to- people exchanges. Personnel of grass-roots people's courts actively took part in local comprehensive management of public order. Throughout the year they offered guidance and training to 5,611 mediation personnel on a total of 349 occasions, and alleviated aggravating contradictions by properly handling 352 civil cases in good time, thereby maintaining social stability and unity. 5. Actively Conducting Administrative Judicial Work To Protect the Lawful Rights and Interests of Citizens, Corporations, and Other Organizations and To Ensure and Supervise Administrative Organs in Exercising Functions According to the Law In the past year, courts accepted 339 administrative cases of the first instance and, together with the cases left over from 1992, concluded 360 cases. Courts at all levels, earnestly implementing the Administrative Procedural Law, focused the administrative judicial work on serving key municipal construction projects. They took the initiative to provide out-of-court legal service in a bid to resolve disputes before lawsuits were filed and promptly heard cases related to key municipal construction projects, thereby providing an effective legal guarantee for the municipal construction. Courts actively accepted cases related to encroachment upon enterprises' autonomy in production and management in violation of the Enterprise Law; cases related to unwarranted pooling of funds and arbitrary requisitioning of donations and extraction of fees from enterprises; and various administrative cases involving large and medium state-owned enterprises, which were filed with the people's courts according to the provisions in the Administrative Procedural Law. Throughout the year they accepted 854 cases from administrative institutions for compulsory enforcement by courts, and enforced 854, or 99.18 percent of the total, thereby supporting administrative institutions in exercising functions according to the law. In the past year, courts in Shanghai accepted a total of 97,950 cases of all kinds and concluded 97,846, up 12.3 percent and 12.46 percent, respectively, over 1992. In view of the judicial tasks, which became more and more heavy and difficult, courts continued to follow the correct guiding ideology and focused the work on the three major tasks of serving economic construction, fighting corruption, and ensuring social stability, thereby keeping the work of courts in pace with the continuous development of the new situation arising from a market economy. The following major measures were taken: 1. Persist in Strictly Enforcing the Laws and Make Efforts To Enhance the Judicial Level First, efforts were made to ensure that cases were placed on file for investigation and prosecution. The overwhelming majority of cases tried at the courts were directly handled by courts; public prosecution cases accounted for only 7.52 percent of the total number of the cases mentioned above. Second, we persisted in holding public trials, placed judicial activities under supervison by the masses and public opinion, and vigorously put an end to "cases influenced by relationships or favoritism." Third, we strengthened supervision over court trials and provided better guidance for proceedings. In the past year, we wound up a total of 815 criminal cases which had been appealed to a higher court and a total of 22 cases protested by procuratorial organs. Fourth, we improved study of application of the law. Over 50 special judicial work conferences and seminars of various forms were held across the municipality to study laws, rules, and regulations which had been recently promulgated as well as judicial explanations. The judge training center sponsored 13 training sessions to give professional training to nearly half of the key members of judicial work. Fifth, we further strengthened law enforcement. We handled 20,407 various law enforcement cases in the whole year; coupled with the cases kept on file, we handled a total of 21,348 cases, making the rate of cases finished in the year reach 82.27 percent. Thus, we maintained the authority of verdicts as well as the dignity of the laws. Sixth, we conducted a general examination of law and discipline enforcement. Law courts in Shanghai examined 5 percent of civil, economic, and law enforcement cases; seriously handled the problems discovered; and made corrections while trying to consolidate. Seventh, we established rules and regulations to standardize the conduct of cadres and policemen. Shanghai's law courts established or amended over 160 various rules and regulations, including a system to determine the responsibility for mistakes in the trial of a case, while launching a special drive to rectify unhealthy practices found in government departments and in trades and professions and while conducting a general examination of law and discipline enforcement. 2. Step up Reform of Law Courts Themselves and Strictly Enforce the Laws First, we deepened reform of the personnel system and improved administration through appraisal of objectives achieved during job tenure, thereby arousing the enthusiasm of the vast numbers of cadres and policemen. Law courts in Yangpu, Putuo, and Changning districts implemented an "on duty, standby, and off duty" system among their personnel, thereby preliminarily giving expressing to the principle -- competition on an equal footing, and those who excel will succeed and those who fail are eliminated. Second, we rationalized the law court system and installed better facilities in law courts. In 1993, we established law courts in New Pudong Area, New Minhang Area, and Jiading Area; the Higher People's Court established a court for handling complaints and petitions; and the intermediate people's court established a second court for hearing civil cases. Third, we explored reform of court trial methods. The Shanghai Municipal People's Higher Court specially set up a group for guiding reform of court trial methods to provide specific guidance for the progress of the work. Law courts in New Pudong Area, Yangpu District, Xuhui District, Huangpu District, and Songjiang Area successively experimented with criminal cases' prosecution and defense and with the hearing and proof method for civil, economic dispute, and law enforcement cases. Fourth, we implemented a system for determining the responsibility for mistakes in the trial of a case and adopted a new pattern of lawsuit documents on a trial basis. They have a positive significance for promoting the enhancement of judicial personnel's professional and law enforcement level. 3. Earnestly Improving Work Style and Stepping Up Investigations and Studies After the party central committee and the muncipal party committee encouraged the "practice of conducting investigations and studies," leaders elected to a new term on the municipal higher court used two months' time to investigate and study thorny problems and issues of widespread concern arising during the course of judicial processes in law courts at the grass-roots level. They promptly held a work conference of officials from economic dispute mediation centers in Shanghai's law courts, drawing up work rules for such centers after summing up their experiences. They also made specific provisions regarding the character, tasks, establishment, case-handling procedures, and mediation principles of such centers on the basis of legal provisions and practical experience in judicial administration. Moreover, they stepped up their efforts to hold academic seminars and actively attended the fifth national academic seminar of judicial departments. A total of 12 papers from law courts in Shanghai won prizes, accounting for 55 percent of the total number of papers sent to the seminar. The higher court won the prize for well-composed treatises. 4. Setting Priorities in Judicial Administration and Hearing Major and Important Cases Leaders in law courts at all levels personally heard major and important cases, meting out harsh punishment expeditiously in accordance with the law for serious cases of embezzlement and bribery that gravely infringed on the interests of the state and people, and impaired the reputation of the party and the government; for serious cases involving fraud, profiteering, the production and sale of counterfeit and substandard goods, tax evasion, and grave disruption of economic order; and for cases that seriously affected public order, endangered people's lives and property, and affected social stability, such as murder, robbery, rape, highway banditry, and especially crimes committed by gangsters that were similar to organized crime. They conscientiously tried major and important economic, civil, and administrative cases related to the drive for deepening reform, especially to the drive for accelerating reforms of the banking, investment, financial, and taxation systems. They worked hard to enhance the results of handling cases and improve service. They showed courage in enforcing the law strictly in exceptionally serious or controversial cases. They established a sound supervision and inspection system, formulated the "Opinions on Earnestly Trying Major and Important Cases," and prodded law courts at all levels to ensure thorough judicial administration of major and important cases. 5. Applying Different Means To Actively Participate in Comprehensively Improving Public Security At the begining of last year, the Central Committee and municipal party committee issued a series of important instructions on strengthening the comprehensive effort to improve public security. The higher court promptly convened a meeting of presidents of the courts at the district and county level to gain a better understanding of the instructions, during which it offered specific opinions on implementing the instructions. Setting a target for the work of enhancing trial functions and participating in the comprehensive effort of improving public security, courts at all levels strengthened examination and supervision in this respect. Through the efforts of the police, it has become an initial standard that all courts in the municipality take part in the comprehensive effort to improve public security. First, education to publicize the legal system was conducted through public hearing of cases and public sentencing of offenders. The courts in the municipality held 236 public meetings to announce the sentencing of offenders, at which sentences on 717 cases involving 1,221 offenders were announced. This has helped educate some 191,100 people. Second, typical cases were selected and publicized through the media to expand the cases' impact on society. Last year, 1,641 pieces of case-related materials were compiled for publicizing. About 3,110 manuscripts were sent to the central and local press units, 2,138 of which were used. Third, concrete education on the legal system was conducted by making use of criminal cases. Last year, 1,747 visits were made to the scene where cases occurred or to the relevant units to conduct legal education by making use of related cases, and the masses welcomed this method of education. Fourth, in dealing with problems discovered in the course of handling cases, judicial proposals were applied to urge the relevant units to improve the legal system by plugging loopholes. Courts at all levels put forward 707 judicipal proposals containing 1,031 articles, 384 of which were adopted by relevant departments. Rectification and reform measures were implemented accordingly. Fifth, efforts were made to strengthen education after sentences were meted out to criminals. The purpose was to encourage criminals to agree with the court judgement and reform themselves. To keep an eye on criminals who were placed on probation, the courts established a system under which the criminals were frequently revisited for observation purposes. Measures to help educate them were implemented in coordination with public security departments and other relevant units. For juvenile criminals, each had a personal file set up and an analysis of their conditions was conducted regularly. The municipality's courts made 472 revisits to check on criminals placed on probation. To check on juvenile offenders, the courts made 697 revisits. 6. Strengthening the Building of Court Personnel and Keeping Them Clean and Honest Adhering to the principles of setting strict demands on party members and court personnel, the courts throughout the municipality took great pains to improve the quality of their personnel. First, they strengthened the building of leading bodies. Following the election of new leading bodies for the courts at various levels, the higher court party group immediately convened a municipal conference on court work during which it called on the leadership of courts to strengthen unity and put the collective strength of courts into play. Second, efforts were made to deepen the struggle against corruption to promote honesty among court personnel. The higher court conducted special checks aimed at improving the quality of trials and at rectifying the practice of making litigants' money and property the main criterion for handling cases; resolutely carried out the provisions of the Supreme People's Court on building a clean government; and promptly issued a circular to rectify the collection of fees and charges in violation of regulations. Third, courts at various levels organized cadres and police to conscientiously study the documents of the 14th CPC National Congress, Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," and "The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure," and to receive education on communist ideals and ethics in order to enhance their consciousness and firmness in adhering to the party's basic line. Fourth, to purify the rank of cadres, courts at all levels earnestly investigated and punished violators of laws and discipline. With the acceleration of reform, opening-up, and economic construction, a legal system with the Constitution as the core, suited to the development of a socialist market economy, is being established. As more and more social and economic relations are being regulated by legal means, the workload of people's courts is getting heavier and heavier. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the party's 14th Central Committee and according to the arrangements made by a national conference of higher people's court presidents, the main tasks of this municipality's people's courts in the new year are to continue cracking down on criminal activities; to do a good job in trying serious cases, especially serious economic cases; to vigorously regulate economic relations; to effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the people, legal entities, and other organizations; to strengthen and improve judicial work by strictly enforcing laws and raising the quality of judicial workers; and to provide a judicial guarantee and legal service in maintaining social stability, promoting a clean and honest government, and taking the lead in building operating mechanisms for the socialist market economy in Shanghai. First, it is necessary to step up the trial of criminal cases and to strive to maintain social stability. Second, we should regulate economic relations according to law and promote the establishment of a modern enterprise system and a market economic structure [the word "socialist" was not included]. Third, efforts should be made to step up the trial of civil and administrative cases to effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons. Fourth, people's courts should step up their reform and strengthen themselves. The tasks facing the people's courts in 1994 are arduous. Under the leadership of the municipal party committee and under the supervision of the Supreme People's Court, the municipal people's congress, and its standing committee, we are determined to rally more closely around the party Central Committee; guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese Characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the party's 14th Central Committee, we will strengthen our spirit, resolutely carry out reforms, and work hard to bring our judicial role into full play so as to make a fresh contribution to Shanghai's effort to be the first to build operating mechanisms for the socialist market economy and to "making some changes in one year and substantial changes in three years."
