FR940228-1-00043 FR940228-1-00006 Discussion The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that several operators of Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes have reported finding cracks and broken spokes on certain main wheel assemblies, part number 5008131&hyph;4. Investigation revealed that the manufacturer of these wheels had discontinued a shot-peening procedure that was part of the manufacturing process prior to April 1991. Subsequently, an improved shot-peening procedure on the mating surfaces of the inboard wheel subassemblies was introduced in October 1992. However, this procedure was not introduced on the outboard wheel subassemblies until February 1993. Consequently, a number of units were produced that are prone to fretting and cracking due to a lack of shot-peening of the assembly mating surfaces and bolt bosses. This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of a main wheel assembly during takeoff or landing. Fokker has issued Service Bulletins SBF100&hyph;32&hyph;070, dated January 18, 1993, and SBF100&hyph;32&hyph;073, dated September 10, 1993, which reference Aircraft Braking Systems Corporation (ABSC) Service Bulletins Fo100&hyph;32&hyph;46, dated December 24, 1992, and Fo100&hyph;32&hyph;48, dated March 10, 1993, as the appropriate sources of service information. The RLD classified these Fokker service bulletins as mandatory and issued Netherlands Airworthiness Directive (BLA) 93&hyph;009/3 (A), dated June 1, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Netherlands. ABSC Service Bulletin Fo100&hyph;32&hyph;46 describes procedures for eddy current inspections to detect cracks of certain demountable flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies; and, if no cracks are found, modification and subsequent inspections of the subassemblies; and, if cracks are found, replacement of the subassemblies with serviceable parts. ABSC Service Bulletin Fo100&hyph;32&hyph;48 describes procedures for eddy current inspections to detect cracks of the bolt bosses of certain demountable flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies; and, if no cracks are found, modification of the subassemblies; and, if cracks are found, replacement of the subassemblies with serviceable parts. This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive eddy current inspections to detect cracks of certain demountable flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies and of the bolt bosses of certain demountable flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies, and modification or replacement, if necessary. Replacement of a cracked wheel subassembly terminates certain repetitive inspections required by this AD. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the ABSC service bulletins described previously. The FAA estimates that 87 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 14 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection and modification, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $66,990, or $770 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:
