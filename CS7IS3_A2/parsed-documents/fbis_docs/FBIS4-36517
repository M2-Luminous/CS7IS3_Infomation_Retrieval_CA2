FBIS4-36517 "drnes111_o_94011" FBIS-NES-94-111 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 SYRIA Paper Says Israel Pushing Region to War Paper Says Israel Pushing Region to War JN0706073594 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 7 Jun 94 JN0706073594 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] Under the headline "The Dangers of Reckless Israeli Behavior," TISHRIN says in its editorial today: After the signing of the Cairo agreement on the implementation of the Oslo deal, Israel increased its aggression in southern Lebanon, intensified its daily shelling of residential areas there, and carried out a glaring act of piracy when it kidnapped a Lebanese citizen, thus violating all international agreements and human rights. TISHRIN adds: It is worth noting that that terrorist operation took place under the direct supervision of Yitzhaq Rabin himself, something which proves that the Israeli political and military decisionmaking is controlled by a terrorist mentality. Moreover, Israel launched a savage raid on the Ba'labakk area, and is now amassing more troops and equipment and escalating its expansionist, aggressive language against Lebanon. The paper indicates that through that behavior Israel is seeking to escalate regional tension, kindle war and aggression, and ruin the peace climate in order to undermine the peace process and destroy all its bases. Israel is also seeking to undermine the process of national reconciliation in Lebanon, thus reaffirming that it sought and still seeks to control Lebanon and its resources. The paper stresses that separate deals neither achieve peace in the region, nor provide peace and stability for Arabs or restore their rights. Nor have they ended Israeli intransigence, arrogance, and aggressive, expansionist behavior. The paper says that Israel has violated the principles of the peace process and is now pushing the region to war and confrontation, thus defying the will of the international community and the U.S. initiative for peace in the region. The paper reiterates that Syria and the Arabs have joined the peace process to restore the occupied Arab territories and the usurped Arab rights. Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN says: If the international community and the United States in particular are interested in the success of the peace initiative, they must work to curb the unruly aggressive Israeli behavior and to pressure the Israeli Government into compliance with the principles of a just, comprehensive regional peace.
