Dr. S.P. Kohli, Deputy Director General, Ministry of Health told the first international conference of the Indian Association of Alliative Care here that cancer is no longer a problem of developed countries but a matter of concern for developing countries also. She said the problem had acquired greater magnitude due to an increase in life expectancy resulting in a greater ratio of old people in the population, increase in population, improved life style as well as modernisation. In India, breast, cervix and uterus cancer was most common in women while men were more prone to mouth, larynx and lung cancer. These types of cancer were tobacco-related and could be prevented by proper education, creating awareness and stopping tobacco intake. Lung cancer was nearly nine times more common in smokers than in non-smokers, Dr. Kohli said. Considering this, the Union Government had chalked out a plan of action for prevention of cancer at an early stage, prevention of tobacco intake in any form, early diagnosis of cancer specially in cervic, breast and mouth. She said that it was most unfortunate that most of the cancer patients in India reported at a very advanced stage in hospitals and regional cancer centres, rendering the therapy ineffective. She suggested that since there were more advanced cancer cases in India, Palliative therapy should be provided to such patients effectively. In India, 30 percent of the cancer cases could not be treated with active therapy and "we could provide only palliative therapy in such cases," Dr. Kohli said. Cancer pain is not an imitable part of cancer, contrary to common belief. Little is done to alleviate pain simply due to inadequacy of medical education in cancer pain therapy, she said. Medical students were taught to treat cancer but not cancer pain. She suggested introduction of pain relief and palliative care education at undergraduate and post-graduate teaching level. The Union Government had started producing oral morphine in collaboration with the World Health Organisation directly to 10 identified regional cancer centres. There was a proposal to provide oral morphine to other teaching government medical institutions, too. She said that morphine was the cheapest and most effective pain killer in cancer. Pain could be minimised in 80 to 98 percent of cancer cases if right drug in right dose and at right time was given, she said.
