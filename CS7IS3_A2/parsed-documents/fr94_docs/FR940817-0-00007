FR940817-0-00007 FR940817-0-00004 COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION 17 CFR Part 30 Limited Marketing Activities From a United States Location by Certain Firms and Their Employees or Other Representatives Exempted Under Commodity Futures Trading Commission Rule 30.10 AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ACTION: Order. SUMMARY: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC''), subject to the conditions specified below, is expanding the category of persons to whom firms operating pursuant to the Limited Marketing Order issued on October 28, 1992 may direct limited marketing conduct with respect to foreign futures or option contracts within the United States through their employees or other representatives. The relief as originally issued was limited to conduct directed towards institutions and governmental entities identified in condition 5 of the Limited Marketing Order whose description in terms of status and assets has been derived generally from the definition of ``qualified eligible participant'' (``QEP'') as that term is defined in Commission rule 4.7(a)(1)(ii), 17 CFR 4.7(a)(1)(ii). This Order will expand the relief to conduct directed towards all ``accredited investors'' as that term is defined in the Securities and Exchange Commission's (``SEC'') Regulation D issued pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jane C. Kang, Esq., or Francey L. Youngberg, Esq., Division of Trading and Markets, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20581. Telephone: (202) 254-8955. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 28, 1992, the Commission issued an Order under rule 30.10, 17 CFR 30.10, to permit firms that have received rule 30.10 relief, to engage in limited marketing conduct with respect to foreign futures or option contracts within the United States through their employees or other representatives. 57 FR 49644 (November 3, 1992). Among other conditions, 1 the Order provided that such solicitation or marketing activities occurring within the United States be limited to such activities directed towards certain institutions and governmental entities whose description in terms of status and assets has been derived generally from the definition of QEP as that term is defined in Commission rule 4.7(a)(1)(ii), 17 CFR 4.7(a)(1)(ii). The Commission noted that the Order was a first step and that absent any problems that would warrant a reconsideration of the appropriateness of permitting rule 30.10 firms to operate in accordance with the Order, the Commission may in due course expand the scope of the relief. Upon consideration of the matter, in particular, that no issues have arisen in connection with the operation of the Limited Marketing Order in the two years since its issuance, the CFTC is amending condition (5) of the Order issued on October 28, 1992 expanding the relief to be generally consistent with the term ``accredited investors'' as defined in section 230.501(a) of Securities Exchange Commission Regulation D promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, 17 CFR 230.501(a), who are not already included within the scope of current condition (5) of the Limited Marketing Order. 1 The Limited Marketing Order also required that the regulatory or self-regulatory organization to which the Commission issued 30.10 relief or its equivalent obtain written confirmation from the Commission that the Order applies to such rule 30.10 order. To date, the following regulatory or self-regulatory organizations have requested and received confirmation from the Commission that the Order will apply to their members: 1) Commission des Operations de Bourse (December 4, 1992); 2) The Securities and Investment Board (December 30, 1992); 3) Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (December 30, 1992); 4) Securities and Futures Authority (December 30, 1992); 5) The Montreal Exchange (February 10, 1993); and 6) Sydney Futures Exchange (June 30, 1993). In this connection, the Commission would need to confirm the application of this expanded relief to each of the organizations referred to above. Accordingly, condition (5) of the Order is amended as follows (new language is italic): ``(5) Such soliciting or marketing activities occurring within the United States will be limited to such activities directed to the following persons, acting either for their own account or the account of another entity which is described below: (a) A futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor registered as such with the Commission;
