So politics is still what is preventing the lifting of the 10-month-long blockade of Tuzla and this region, even in this way. This is what Selim Beslagic, Tuzla city mayor, says: [Beslagic] The military officials of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] have visited the airport in the presence of a U.S. officer, who said after the visit that they could equip Dubrave Airport to receive aircraft within two and a half hours. This means that international experts believe that Dubrave Airport can under these conditions and without [word indistinct] elements receive these (aircraft). I think that the airport is in the hands of politics, primarily in the hands of the blackmailing policy of the fascist aggressor -- when I say fascist, I mean the Serb-Montenegrin bandits -- and it seems to me that NATO, Europe, and the United Nations must bare their teeth and finally show whether they are for or against fascism. If they are for fascism, they will not open the airport. If they are against fascism, I think that the airport will be opened. I personally hope that it (will be the latter). [Brkic] This winter some 635,000 people in this region have been living a nightmare when it comes to the delivery of food and survival. Mr. Beslagic, what would the opening of this airport mean? [Beslagic] The opening of Dubrave Airport has two functions. The first one, I believe, is psychological, to lift the blockade, the psychological blockade, as we are simply blocked here and if aircraft [words indistinct], it would mean that there is a way out. The second is humanitarian, which again [words indistinct] the delivery of food, a regular flow of food, and I can tell you immediately that [words indistinct] and part of the European blackmail. [Brkic] Over the last few days the world has been saying that this airport near Tuzla will after all be opened. It remains to be seen whether this is just another game.
