FR941110-1-00053 FR941110-1-00010 The term ``certificate of privilege'' is intended to mean the approval or permit necessary to make special purpose shipments. Authority should be included for the committee to specify the requirements contained in the certificate of privilege. Such requirements, established through rulemaking, would be intended to ensure that shipments would not be diverted to the fresh market. Safeguards should be adequate so that the committee can track such shipments from the time they leave the local shipping point to ultimate destination. This would be necessary to determine that such shipments did not enter fresh market channels of trade. The committee should have the authority to rescind or deny certificates of privilege or any other permit to any handler if proof is obtained that such handler shipped Walla Walla Sweet Onions for any other purpose than stated on the certificate of privilege. The committee would rescind or deny certificates only after an appropriate investigation concerning the alleged shipments and upon adequate and substantial proof that the handler did in fact violate the regulation. The Secretary would have the right to modify, change, or rescind any safeguards prescribed and any certificates issued by the committee pursuant to the provisions of this section.
