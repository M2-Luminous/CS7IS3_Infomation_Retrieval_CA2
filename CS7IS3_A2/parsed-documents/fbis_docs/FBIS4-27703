It will be the first time since 1967 that not a single minister will be present at the meeting. As the 50th anniversary commemoration of the D-Day, which led to eventual allied victory in World War II, is scheduled around the same time, European and U.S. leaders will be gathering in France. Although Japan has been an OECD member for 30 years this year, it may end up with receiving cold treatment by other nations. Japan joined the OECD in 1964. It has sent either a foreign minister, trade minister, or economics minister to the annual OECD ministerial meetings from 1968. From 1984, all three ministers from the MOFA, MITI, and the Economic Planning Agency have, as a rule, participated in the annual ministerial meetings. "Employment and Growth" is the major topic in the agenda of the upcoming ministerial meeting. U.S. cabinet-level economics officials, including Mickey Kantor, U.S. trade representative, Lloyd Bentsen, secretary of treasury, Robert Reich, secretary of labor, and Laura Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, will all gather at the meeting. U.S. President Bill Clinton is also scheduled to be in France around the same time. It is expected that a series of meetings will be held, taking advantage of the OECD forum.
