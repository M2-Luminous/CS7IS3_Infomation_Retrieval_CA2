Private Coverage The bill passed by Congress sets up units known as Health Promotion Agencies (EPS) that will be responsible for collecting contributions from workers and business owners (12 percent of the total monthly payroll) and for contracting for health care services to be paid for out of these resources. Higher Dues The new plan means a 71-percent increase in the contribution for health care. To date, employers and workers have paid in 7 percent. According to estimates of the National Association of Industrialists (ANDI), additional contributions paid into the Social Security Institute by members will total 233.5 billion pesos, 156.5 billion from employers, and 77 billion from workers. An employee earning 100,000 pesos next year (roughly the minimum wage) will pay 3,960 pesos of that sum for health insurance for himself and his family. Under the current system, he would pay only 2,310 pesos. The employer's contribution rises from 4,666 to 8,040 pesos, with the additional resources used to provide the entire family of the insured with basic health care, including common illnesses and maternity coverage. Two Systems The reform creates two major systems: the contributory system and the subsidized system. The former will cover persons with contracts, government employees, pensioners, and independent workers able to pay. The subsidized system will include persons unable to pay who will receive economic assistance to make their contribution to the system. Such assistance will come from a Solidarity Fund. Members will have freedom of choice. They will be able to select the EPS they prefer or transfer to one providing better services. Subsidy What will be the source of the subsidy? Health Promotion Agencies will collect contributions from employers and workers. These funds will be used to pay for the basic health plan and administrative overhead. However, in some cases, there will be a surplus that must be transferred to the Solidarity Fund. Subsidies will be financed out of these resources and other funds transferred from the Central Government or municipalities. How will the surplus be generated? First of all, the National Social Security Council for Health Care will determine how much the health care of every member costs. For example, if it estimates the cost to be 200,000 pesos a year, the EPS may retain only that amount for every member covered. However, in many cases, the agency may have a large number of persons earning high incomes, meaning that 12 percent of their salaries would amount to far more than the cost of the health care. In such cases, the surplus will be paid into the fund, effectively creating solidarity between the rich and the poor. No Cuts How does the plan work? The law states that the basic health plan to be provided by the EPS will be the same as the one now offered by the Social Security Institute. In other words, it will include a package of services covering common illnesses and maternity at all levels. It will also cover any and all diagnostic services, medical treatment, surgery, and rehabilitation deemed necessary. No "Preexisting Conditions" There will be no such thing as "preexisting conditions" in the system. This means that members will receive care even if it can be demonstrated that a specific disease was contracted before coverage as a member began. For the first time, the pension reform will allow the participation of private pension funds, which will begin to compete for the contributions of Colombian workers. Gradual Readjustment Payments into either of the two systems will gradually rise from 8 to 13.5 percent based on the following schedule: 11.5 percent in 1994; 12.5 percent in 1995; and 13.5 percent in 1996. Of that amount, 3.5 percent will go to pay for disability and survivor benefits and the administrative overhead of the system, whether it be the ISS or a private fund. In the latter case, however, the government has decided that in order to promote competition, to the extent that the funds are more efficient, they may voluntarily transfer part of the 3.5 percent into their members' savings accounts. Under both systems, employers will pay 75 percent of the dues and workers the remaining 25 percent. Solidarity Fund In order to expand coverage and enable persons with low incomes to secure a retirement pension, a Pension Solidarity Fund is being set up that will also benefit athletes, artists, bullfighters, women operating small businesses, "community mothers," and the physically challenged. During its first year of operation, the Fund hopes to obtain over 40 billion pesos from an additional 1-percent contribution paid by employees earning over four minimum monthly wages. Retirement Age In order to be entitled to an old-age pension, a worker must be over 55 in the case of women or 60 in the case of men and have paid into the system for a minimum of 1,000 weeks (whether continuously or with interruptions), i.e., 20 years. Effective 1 January 2014, the age at which one becomes eligible for the retirement pension rises by two years: to 57 for women and 62 for men. Those covered by the private system are entitled to a retirement pension at whatever age they choose, provided the total amount of funds that have accumulated in the individual account allows them to have a monthly pension exceeding 110 percent of the legal minimum monthly wage at the time. Amount of Pension The amount of the old-age pension based on the first 1,000 weeks of contributions will be equivalent to 65 percent of the base distribution income. However, for every additional 50 weeks and up to a total of 1,200, the percentage rises by 2 percent to a maximum of 73 percent. From 1,200 to 1,400 weeks, the percentage will rise by 3 percent up to a maximum sum of 85 percent of the base distribution income. In the case of private pension funds, the terms are different because the amount will depend on individual savings and their financial yield. How Amount Is Calculated In order to calculate the base distribution income, the last 10 years or the entire time worked will be taken into account, depending on which alternative is more beneficial to the retiree. Exclusions The following will be excluded from the system of individual savings: those receiving disability pensions or persons who, when the system takes effect, are over 40 years of age in the case of men and 35 in the case of women, and those who have paid into the ISS for over 750 weeks. Transfers Persons deciding to transfer from the ISS to private funds will receive a pension bonus. The bonus will recognize contributions made since the worker joined, with allowance being made for inflation and the yield such contributions would have paid.
