Shih Chi-ping, spokesman of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said: "Our vice chairman, Chiao Jen-ho, will have a five-day meeting with his mainland counterpart Tang Shubei in Beijing beginning January 31 to discuss the operation of our two organizations and other issues." But Shih emphasized that the meeting was not intended to discuss disputes directly and would not address the thorny issue of repatriating Chinese hijackers to the mainland. The hijacking issue and fishing disputes were major obstacles to the successful conclusion of three previous rounds of talks between SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and his mainland counterpart, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) chairman Wang Daohan. The talks were bogged down on jurisdiction and sovereignty issues. The upcoming meeting is intended only to discuss the operations between the SEF and ARATS, Shih said. But the spokesman said: "Mr. Chiao and Tang may exchange opinions on the hijackings and other general issues, which can help pave the way for the fourth round of talks in the future." SEF officials said Chiao was expected to ask Tang to set aside sensitive political issues to facilitate progress in the next round of talks. He will also try to talk Tang into agreeing that each side had its own jurisdiction right in handling various cases, they added. The spate of hijackings -- 10 occurred in 1993 -- have emerged as a new source of friction between Beijing and Taipei, rivals since the communist government swept to power on the mainland in 1949 following a civil war and forced it nationalist opposition to Taiwan. Taiwan maintains that it has the jurisdiction to try and imprison hijackers, but China refuses to recognize such a right and insists that they must be repatriated. SEF and ARATS were set up in 1990 as nominally private bodies to get around Taiwan's 44-year-old policy of no direct contact with Beijing. The chairmen of the two agencies held the first-ever talks in Singapore in April to find ways to improve cross strait ties and resolve certain disputes.
