FR940224-2-00020 FR940224-2-00006 National Institute of Standards and Technology [Docket No. 931091&hyph;3291] Notice of Proposed Validation Requirements for Products Implementing Federal Information Processing Standards; Publication (FIPS PUB) 140&hyph;1, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: NIST invites interested members of the public to review validation requirements that have been developed for products that implement FIPS PUB 140&hyph;1, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. NIST plans to establish a product certification program using independent third party laboratories to validate cryptographic modules for conformance to the security requirements of FIPS 140&hyph;1. The requirements for certification will be finalized after the proposed procedures, inspections and tests for conformance have been determined. A National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program will be set up to accredit the third party laboratories at an appropriate future time. At this time, NIST solicits public review of the proposed procedures, inspections, and tests that will be used and the expected results to be achieved in the validation of cryptographic modules. Those wishing to review the validation requirements may obtain a copy from the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building, room B64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975&hyph;2816. DATES: NIST will continue to develop the validation program for FIPS 140&hyph;1, and will issue notices as appropriate concerning the program. Comments on the validation requirements are invited by May 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN: Validation Requirements for FIPS PUB 140&hyph;1, Technology Building, room B154, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Lisa Carnahan, (301) 975&hyph;3362, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. Dated: February 17, 1994.
