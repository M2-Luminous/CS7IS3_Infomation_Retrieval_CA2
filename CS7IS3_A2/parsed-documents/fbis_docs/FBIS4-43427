Resolution No. 927, which was approved unanimously, stresses that the Security Council will proceed with a full review of the situation, including the UN role in Cyprus, within the framework of its examination of the secretary general's 31 May report. It also calls on all interested parties to be committed to a substantial reduction in the number of foreign troops in Cyprus and in the arms expenditures of the Republic of Cyprus, in order to further the restoration of trust between the parties and as a first step for the withdrawal of the non-Cypriot forces as stipulated in the [Butrus-Ghali] set of ideas. The Security Council also notes in its resolution that it will continue to examine the secretary general's report and that additional information is expected. The Pakistani delegate claimed in his speech, without making any reference to our side, that the Turkish Cypriot leadership demonstrated political will to make progress in the confidence-building measures on the questions of Famagusta and the Nicosia Airport as well as for an overall settlement of the problem. In order to support his views, the Pakistani delegate referred to the acceptance in principle by Rauf Denktas of the secretary general's report of July 1993. He referred to the agreement that Denktas concluded with the United Nations in Vienna under the condition that the agreement would be incorporated into the secretary general's latest report.
