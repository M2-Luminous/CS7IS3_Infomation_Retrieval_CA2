I have the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] communique in my hands. I will read its six basic points: Brothers of the EZLN's Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command, we are contacting you to state the following: 1. The EZLN has already ended the consultations in all the towns that supported it by holding assemblies in the many towns, ejidos, rural slums, and hamlets that support and sympathize with the EZLN's just cause. Zapatist men, women, children, and elders analyzed and discussed the 32 proposals made by the federal government and the 34 demands made by the San Cristobal Zapatist group. 2. The men, women, children, and elders who, in 1993, voted to start the war and all those who have joined the EZLN taught the country a lesson in liberty and freedom by exercising their right to freely choose the EZLN. 3. The EZLN also received opinions and comments by all other Mexican social sectors. We will take into account the wisdom expressed by the suggestions made by our brothers, Indians, peasants, workers, students, teachers, housewives, nongovernmental organizations, Mexicans living abroad, intellectuals, and honest artists. 4. As of 31 May 1994, the EZLN is in a state of permanent assembly to start counting votes, to analyze the opinions received, and to give a reply as the supreme leadership of the EZLN's military and civilian forces. 5. All access to territories under EZLN control will be closed to the national and international media while the counting and analyses is in process. The results will be released through a communique issued by the supreme leadership. 6. The date and place to hold a news conference to inform Mexico and the world of EZLN decisions will be given in due time. As usual, Subcommander Marcos signed this communique from somewhere in the mountains of the Mexican southeastern region. Thus, the EZLN takes a major step regarding a consultation that was expected to reach a prompt conclusion. We have also received reports indicating that Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, might be arriving in San Cristobal de las Casas in the coming hours. Camacho Solis is expected to issue a communique on the Chiapas situation, and especially, to give details of a program he discussed with legislators two weeks ago during a meeting. This program, which was called aggressive, seeks to provide answers to all doubts and demands expressed by the EZLN in regard to the San Cristobal agreements. Thus far, this is the situation here in San Cristobal de las Casas and gradually, a second dialogue seems to be closer to becoming a reality. Many, however, are convinced that a second dialogue could not take place very soon, but the two conflicting parties are expected to give a concrete answer on the steps to follow regarding this peace and reconciliation talk. [Announcer] Is this EZLN communique addressed to a specific person? [Santoyo] No. It is addressed to the Mexican people, peoples and governments worldwide, and the national and the international media. It is not addressed to anyone in particular. [Announcer] Reports from San Cristobal de las Casas indicate that complaints have been made that, precisely, the EZLN has been telling the international media that, there are planes and helicopters flying over EZLN-controlled territory, just 136 days away from the date when this activity will be banned. [Santoyo] That is true. There is a second communique in this regard that has been addressed to SEMANARIO NACIONAL, PROCESO, LA JORNADA, EL FINANCIERO, and EL TIEMPO. In this communique, Subcommander Marcos, the signer, makes a traditional report of their current situation in the jungle. Marcos does indicate that following the 15 May event, helicopters have been spotted in addition to planes. Cooks complain that there will not be enough pots if they decide to land at the same time. Marcos includes in this communique -- a very long one, some seven pages -- a sort of poetic report of everything they are currently experiencing in the Lacandon jungle. He basically says that the consultations are over. The communique also includes a part addressed directly to the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD]. This part constitutes a long point and refers to the PRD saying a few days ago that more people have died within the PRD because of political strife than within the EZLN. Marcos notes in this communique that, even if they are right on the fact that more people could have died, what is truly significant is that currently in this Chiapas location, efforts are being implemented to make these peace and reconciliation negotiations benefit all Indian and peasant peoples nationwide. Marcos adds that as it is true that people have died, so it is that there is sacrifice and bloodshed involved in every struggle. They do not say, however, that currently, it is hard for the country to assume this sacrifice. There is also another section of the communique that says criticism is always welcome from pontiff to pontificate. Finally, they will be able to accuse us of being untimely; ignoring the correlation between forces; practicing political miscalculation; lacking [word indistinct] to watch the debate live; lacking subscriptions to major newspapers and magazines to learn about post-debate evaluations; being unkind and rude; suffering from mountain sickness; not recognizing possible allies; being sectarian, intransigent, and ill-tempered. We can be accused of everything, but not of being consistent. All we have done is place a trigger [gatillo] on hope, this communique concludes. This communique answers all the criticisms raised within the PRD regarding the famous visit made by PRD presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano. On this occasion, he received very blunt criticism from the EZLN, and specifically, from Subcommander Marcos. [end recording]
