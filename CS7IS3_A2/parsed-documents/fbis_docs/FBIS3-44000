He had led his country's delegation to bilateral talks with Nigeria at the end of which the two countries agreed to consolidate existing ties between the two countries. State House correspondent Chris Ngu has more on the bilateral talks: [Begin recording] [Ngu] The talks featured a wide range of bilateral, regional, and international issues, according to a joint statement issued in Abuja today. Nigeria expressed support for the determination of the government of Niger to safeguard the territorial integrity of that country. In that regard, Nigeria commended ongoing efforts to end the armed rebellion in the northwestern part of Niger Republic. On the other hand, the Nigerien side commended efforts of the Nigerian Government at national unity and reconciliation. Niger considers peace and stability in Nigeria as inextricably linked with development and progress of the entire West African Subregion. The two leaders resolved to reinforce efforts of their governments to mitigate the effects on their peoples of the deteriorating international economic environment. Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister Ambassador Babagana Kingibe has more on other areas of cooperation agreed on at the talks: [Kingibe] Specific areas of cooperation were considered to formalize cross-border trade and to enhance the unimpeded flow of goods and services. They further agreed to encourage private investments in each other's country and the formation of joint ventures. They therefore, directed that high level officials of the concerned ministries should immediately work out the modalities for effecting these decisions. In addition, the two leaders directed the joint commission to intensify its efforts in the implementation of its program of action, especially in the fields of agriculture, pest control, animal health, and management of water resources. The two sides reviewed progress in regional integration. They renewed their commitment to the realization of the objectives of ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] and the Abuja Treaty of African Economic Community. The two leaders exchanged views on a wide range of African and international issues and resolved to make concerted efforts to contribute to the maintenance of peace and security in Africa and the rest of the world. In this context, they expressed their full support to the OAU's newly established mechanism for the prevention and resolution of conflicts as well as the UN secretary general's agenda for peace. [Ngu] The Nigerien head of state extended an invitation to General Sani Abacha to visit the Republic of Niger at a mutually agreed date. President Ousmane, who left the country this morning, was seen off at the airport by Gen. Abacha and top government officials. [end recording] At a special dinner in honor of the Nigerien president in Abuja last night, Gen. Sani Abacha appealed to members of the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, to implement the organization's protocol of cooperation as a way of removing existing barriers to development and free interaction of peoples in the subregion. Here is again is State House correspondent Chris Ngu with the report: [Begin recording] [Ngu] Gen. Abacha, talking about cooperation at the subregional and African regional levels, said that success of ECOWAS would advance the drive toward attainment of the Abuja Treaty on African Economic Community. Much as, Gen. Abacha said, he considered development desirable in West Africa, he is of the view that economic development in the subregion cannot flourish until all conflict situations are responsibly managed. For that reason, he called on the warring factions in the Liberian crisis to implement the Cotonou Accords for peace in their country. Gen. Abacha noted with satisfaction, as he put it, the commitment of the leadership of Niger and Nigeria in satisfying the aspirations of peoples of both countries. He said that since coming to power, his administration has embarked on a determined course to create conditions for a stable and enduring nation. Referring to the recently established National Constitutional Conference Commission in Nigeria, Gen. Abacha talked about what he expects to follow from the commission's work: [Abacha] As a result of the work of the conference, my administration hopes to leave for posterity a balanced and carefully drawn up framework for the governance of this country. We intend that it would be a framework which will guarantee to all Nigerians [words indistinct] liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in a society, where the rule of law reigns supreme and justice will done and seen to be done to all. [Ngu] Looking downward the African Continent, Gen. Abacha expressed satisfaction at political developments in South Africa, especially the recent decision of Mr. Clarence Makwetu and the Pan- African Congress of South Africa to call off its military activities and fully participate in the democratic elections scheduled for 27 April this year. He appealed to Chief Buthelezi and the Inkhata Freedom Party to show similar patriotism. He especially thanked the Nigerien Government for the role it played in ending the Nigerian Airways plane hijack with minimum risk of innocent lives. President Ousmane, in his response to Gen. Abacha's address, commended Nigeria's efforts at promoting African unity. He referred to what he called Nigeria's preventive diplomacy strategy by which Nigeria is involved in many international peace missions and said Niger would emulate Nigeria in that regard. He said Niger's role in the Nigerian Airways' plane hijack was informed by his government's belief in upholding international diplomatic ethics. Nigerian cultural groups entertained guests.
