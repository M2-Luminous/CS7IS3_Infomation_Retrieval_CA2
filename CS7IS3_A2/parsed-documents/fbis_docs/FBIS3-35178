Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that speaking at a meeting of the Labor Knesset faction, Peres again emphasized that leaving the settlement of Netzarim in place is, in his words, unreasonable. He maintained that the two companies the Army will have to deploy to ensure the security of Netzarim could be better deployed on the Trans-Samaria highway, where they will safeguard traffic.
