Techo de Paja. This is what sentenced drug trafficker Meco Dominguez testified before Brazilian officials on 10 November 1993. At the time, Meco Dominguez was being sought by the Bolivian courts. According to the report, Meco Dominguez voluntarily presented himself before Brazilian police in Mato Grosso do Sul to provide information on his illegal activities in Bolivia. Carmelo Meco Dominguez told the Brazilians that he, and his partner Chavarria, held at least 10 meetings with the MIR leadership to discuss issues pertaining to the financing of the 1987 municipal elections and the 1989 general elections. Dominguez told Brazilian antinarcotics police that these meetings were attended by the following MIR leaders: Jaime Paz Zamora; Oscar Eid Franco; Gaspar Encina; Rosario Paz Zamora; Susana Seleme; [name indistinct] Arostegui; Jorge Mendez; Isaac Chavarria; Jorge Roca Suarez, a.k.a. Techo de Paja; and (?Sando Kasp Saucedo), a.k.a. Checo. Carmelo Meco Dominguez told Brazilian authorities that the meeting's objective was to discuss the financing of the elections and that he accepted this proposal in good faith because it was going to be good for the country. Dominguez added that Paz Zamora and the aforementioned persons attended several meetings at Isaac Chavarria's house. He said: I want to note that we held about 10 meetings before the elections. We also held a very special meeting on 15 April 1987 at Orlando Vaca Diez's house on Sucre Street in Santa Cruz to celebrate Jaime Paz Zamora's birthday. This contradicts what [MIR President] Oscar Eid said on 21 February on this program. Eid Franco said Carmelo Meco Dominguez was an uninvited guest, but on 10 November 1993 Dominguez told Mato Grosso do Sul antinarcotics agents that he had been one of the organizers of the birthday party. Dominguez also said he had hired a Mexican folk band. How can anyone allege that Carmelo Dominguez was an uninvited guest. (?He appears in one of the pictures taken at the time). He had organized the party and hired the Jalisco Mexican band in Santa Cruz. This party was publicized the next day in Santa Cruz newspapers. Dominguez added that in July 1987, Paz Zamora arrived in Santa Cruz to hold another special meeting and that he personally went to Viru-Viru airport in his blue Toyota station wagon to drive the MIR leader to Isaac Chavarria's house, where they met Jorge Roca Suarez, a.k.a. Techo de Paja.
