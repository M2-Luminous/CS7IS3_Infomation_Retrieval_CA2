It Is Possible"] [Text] With what he is saying in this interview, Antonio Martino could overtake [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi in terms of popularity on the tax issue among League sympathizers, and indeed all who believe tax decentralization to be the right thing. These statements by the Forza Italia economist are not a provocation, but the end results of a far from short or easy process, but one which needs to be begun. In short, a tax reform which would end up taking the entire taxation process out of the hands of the center, that is the Ministry of Finance, and transferring it to reformed and efficient local authorities. But in the meantime, Martino explained, one must work in two directions: on the one hand to reduce overall tax pressure, gradually but without hesitation, and on the other hand to clarify the rules for preparing the budget. First and foremost, Article 81 of the Constitution (no illegal expenditures), which Parliament has never implemented, must be applied. [Bozzo] First of all the rules, Professor Martino? [Martino] To me it seems obvious that it is necessary to abandon the present arbitrary system. Our problems derive from the fact that, in the absence of rules, everyone (and I am saying everyone, including the left) has used public expenditure for electoral purposes. And hence the enormous growth of expenditure has provoked a tax explosion, a boom, which has however remained insufficient to cover outgoings. The whole history of our public debt is here. And this is why we need rules: We can no longer give politicians blank checks. [Bozzo] In addition to rules, Forza Italia is also demanding a ceiling to the tax burden. [Martino] The meaning of the tax ceiling is simple: first of all one must decide how much one can take out of the economy without killing it. After that one establishes how to spend these resources. [Bozzo] It has been said that this is a demagogic proposition, that we cannot reduce taxes in Italy today. [Martino] The left has criticized the rule. To me this is unacceptable. It could not criticize the amount, as I have never said what the ceiling should be: It could even be equal to the present one. The fact of the matter is that the left wishes to continue to spend without control. This being said, I would add that it is possible to reduce tax pressure, even if this has to be gradual: One cannot withdraw an addict's drugs all at once. But taxation can be limited, and rationalized. Zero cost reforms exist: simplified execution and the elimination of taxes which yield little or nothing. [Bozzo] Do you think that it is possible to reduce income tax rates? Also: What are you proposing in terms of business taxation? [Martino] Reducing progressive personal income tax rates is essential, because tax rates of 50 percent not only yield little, but favor evasion. Then we need to untax employment, because, let us not forget, more than half of labor costs end up in the taxman's hands. I would propose an exemption for new "net job positions." Let me explain: "net" in order to avoid the fraud which consists of dismissing in order to rehire. And a total exemption for reinvested assets. [Bozzo] Let us now come, Professor Martino, to tax decentralization. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]'s "finance minister" Visco is now talking of tax federalization. [Martino] I do not know whether my project will be included in its entirety into the Forza Italia economic program. Nonetheless I have in mind a radical proposal, the implementation of which, obviously, requires time and a series of major reforms. Once a complete rearrangement of local authorities has been completed with, say, some 50 macromunicipalities, I would then entrust them with total tax authority, taking it away completely from the center. With two limits: 50 percent of income would have to be transferred to Rome, and a ban on recourse to market indebtedness. The reform, the final point of a long series of changes, would give citizens ever so much greater control of income and expenditure. [Bozzo] By way of conclusion: Do you like the idea of a superminister of the economy and privatization? [Martino] In theory yes, but without rules even the best superminister will fail. As to privatization, I would simply say that, if there is an excess demand for the company shares being issued on the market, evidently the price is low.
