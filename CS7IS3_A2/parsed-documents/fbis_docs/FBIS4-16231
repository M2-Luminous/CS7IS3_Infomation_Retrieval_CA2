The dogfighting both in individual branches of power and between neighboring branches will continue without any rules and in the absence of an arbiter. The Duma was making effectively its first attempt at legislative activity, its first encounter with the weightlifters' barbell which it has promised to lift, without which there is no sense in deputies even mounting the stage. And the fact that the first attempt was a total flop, or rather, did not get off the ground at all, unfortunately arouses serious apprehension regarding the legislative possibilities of the first post-Soviet parliament as a whole. The draft law was prepared mainly by the judges of the Constitutional Court themselves, and since the judges have had not only positive experiences, but also negative ones (if not more of the latter), they endeavored to safeguard themselves against future political interference in the legal process. The corresponding provisions of the draft law were aimed not at depriving the Constitutional Court of all political competence, but at curbing the political games and intrigues around it. Alas, these games and intrigues have already resumed around the draft law itself, even at a distant remove from parliament itself. The President's State-Legal Administration attempted to contest the Constitutional Court's right to initiate legislation on its own account. The president himself, according to Acting Constitutional Court Chairman Nikolay Vitruk, was extremely surprised at this, and instructed Aleksandr Yakovlev, his representative in parliament, to support the draft law. As a result some presidential structures officially defended the draft, but others scuppered it in the lobbies. It is hard to explain this by anything other than the battle for power and influence inside presidential structures. Following the Duma Council's session on Thursday it became clear that it was highly unlikely that the hurdle of two-thirds of the votes necessary for the adoption of federal constitutional laws -- quantifiable as 300 votes -- would be cleared. Finally the display board flashed up the figures: 247 votes for, 51 against, 87 abstentions. Those who voted against were mainly members of the communist faction, and the backbone of abstainers is formed by the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. The day before at the Duma Council Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who despises all diplomatic contortions, stated perfectly frankly that he was ready to exchange the votes of his faction for an agreement on an imperative mandate. The imperative mandate was also in its own way one of last week's issues in the State Duma -- and, perhaps, will also be an issue this week too. According to the laws of the "standard [operativnyy] mandate," a deputy elected to parliament on a party roll cannot vote contrary to the opinion of the majority of his faction, on pain of being expelled not only from his faction, but also from deputies' ranks altogether. Obviously, for Vladimir Zhirinovskiy the desire to bind the breakaway members of his faction by imperative mandate (which does not meet with the support of the majority in parliament) is so overriding that it is impossible to understand in what relation he stands to the draft law on the Constitutional Court. Overt political horse-trading is being conducted around this draft law. The communist faction and Zhirinovskiy's supporters are demanding some kind of State Duma quota in the appointment of judges, and also their own quota within this "Duma" quota. The Communists are also demanding that the Constitutional Court be restored its right to accept cases for examination on its own initiative, which was withdrawn from the draft, and without which it is not so effective in the capacity of a weapon in political brawling and blackmail. Of course, it was easy to object from the Duma rostrum during the discussion of the draft law that all these amendments are anticonstitutional and require at the very least amendments to the Constitution that was approved in the referendum. On the other hand the Constititution does not forbid any deputy to push the voting button as he sees fit. As long as strictly legal questions are the issue, however complicated they may be, it is always possible to reach compromise -- this, in point of fact, is the task of the law. It is far more difficult to reach real accord in politics. From the point of view of understanding of political factors, the draft law on the Constitutional Court was prepared and road-tested especially thoroughly. All factions pay at least lip service to the need for the Constitutional Court to resume its activity as soon as possibile. Questions are accumulating which no one has a right to answer except a Constitutional Court. Nevertheless, the draft law was defeated. Just as it will be in the event of its radical revision as demanded by "leftists," only this time by the factions of the opposite wing. The inability to muster two-thirds of the votes on the most fundamental questions threatens the familiar paralysis in legislative development in the foreseeable future. Russia remains without a Constitutional Court, without a general prosecutor, without a "qualified majority" in its legislative organs, and, as a consequence, without Law. And once again it is political ambitions that are thwarting the normal legislative process.
