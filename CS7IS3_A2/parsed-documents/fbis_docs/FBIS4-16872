This attack was directed towards Ganja, Azerbaijan's second largest city as well as towards the southern section of the front with the seizure of the city of Beylagan. TURAN was informed by a government official who requested anonymity. The Azeri leadership thinks that this military plan is aimed at destabilizing the situation in Azerbaijan, thereby compelling Baku to agree to the Russian proposal concerning the Armenian-Azeri conflict. It is widely known that the main terms of the proposal is the stationing of the Russian army in the conflict zone. During the Moscow Summit government officials of Armenia told Azeri President Aliev that "the Russian army's deployment in the region of conflict will guarantee a ceasefire." This statement made by the Armenian officials coincides with the statement made by Kazimirov, the representative of the Russian president for the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict which is pushing for a Russian peacemaking force role in the region. It is widely known that Baku insists that the separation forces should consist of international units and act on the basis of United Nations and the CSCE mandate.
