Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas stated a week ago what the two leaders had to discuss. [Bilodid] [passage omitted] Opinions about the possible military alliance sometimes voiced in the Seimas [parliament] are totally ungrounded. This is a manifestation of political atavism. A security vacuum has emerged after the USSR collapse. This issue is important to every politician. The problem of security can be tackled individually and in cooperation, but not through a military alliance. We will look for common issues in reducing possible dangers. We would not like this to be interpreted as actions directed against Russia or other countries. It would be naive to think that Russia can be bypassed or ignored. We often come across political naivete which sometimes stirs negative emotions. Compromises bear much better fruit. We will seek certain compromises during the visit, but definitely not military alliances. [Zukas] Ukraine will, probably, not refuse to participate in such an initiative as the "Partnership for Peace." [Bilodid] It is difficult to oppose this initiative. The Ukrainian Government assesses it positively, and I have not heard any hostile opinions, although there are different views. Certainly, the official stand will be voiced. Honestly speaking, however, this partnership is a palliative, a compromise. We will yet have to consider the formulations and concepts. We see, however, that Western countries are not ready to take us into their arms immediately. Moreover, it is naive and not serious to forget Russia which is being pictured now as a monster. We must take its reaction into account because we are realistic politicians. We do not need another Yugoslavia or Georgia. However, all this is happening next to us, and it is very worrisome. [passage omitted] [Zukas] Many people assess the situation in the neighboring Belarus as the "hunt for one of the Belovezh forest bisons." Not everyone in Ukraine approves of President L. Kravchuk's policy. Do you not think that the hunt for the second "Belovezh bison" is possible? [Bilodid] The situation in Belarus differs from that in Ukraine, and any analogies are meaningless. I believe that "storms" in the parliament encourage the development of the nation's collective mind. It is very important that the president has preserved peace in the state which has 53 million very different people. We have no "hot spots." The economy has declined considerably, but one should not forget the reasons. The foundation for a crisis was laid for 50 years at least. The USSR would direct all the money earned by Ukraine in the post-war period to other regions. Ukraine had a large industrial infrastructure, but the finances were not returned, and the capital stock became obsolete. [passage omitted] [Zukas] You are a representative of the sciences not only by your education. You worked in this sphere before entering diplomacy. Does your former experience help you find your way in political intricacies? [Bilodid] I assess history will all seriousness. Physics allows me to look for similarities between the two sciences. Parallels can be very interesting. The theory of phase transformations is an exact reflection of those changes which we call the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. This is only one analogy between the two sciences. Our two countries are creating versatile communities which previously knew only two colors -- of friends and foes. The vectors of your current interests are pointed at the East, the West, the North, and they almost bypass the South. This was also noted by the Foreign Policy Council for the Lithuanian president. Our embassy is trying to arouse your interest in the neighbors from the south. I am returning to physics again: The concept of stability states that if a system has only one degree of freedom, the level of stability is very low or it hardly exists. If there are three degrees of freedom, stability is guaranteed. It is the same in politics: The more ties a country has, the more stable its situation in the world is. A separate state is always lonely. [Zukas] However, relations between Ukraine and Lithuania are not too bright as well. [Bilodid] I have always thought about human relations. Certain things have changed today. Ukraine did not advocate the introduction of visas. We know that Lithuania was not interested in this too much. However, this is Lithuania's business. As soon as Lithuania introduced visas, we did the same. People have very clearly felt the emergence of visas. Our previous communication was much easier. Now we have been left with trains alone, although we are willing to negotiate air traffic again. Moreover, not every person can pay five U.S. dollars for a visa because the average wage is only $10-15. This reduces possibilities for cultural and scientific cooperation. [Zukas] How do you personally feel in Lithuania? [Bilodid] I have known Lithuania for a long time and I love it gently. I have spent many summers in the environs of Ignalina, and I would not exchange it for the Crimea or any other place. I myself asked to be appointed to Lithuania, although my diplomatic experience (10 years in the International Atomic Energy Agency, and six years in the United Nations) allowed me to choose.
