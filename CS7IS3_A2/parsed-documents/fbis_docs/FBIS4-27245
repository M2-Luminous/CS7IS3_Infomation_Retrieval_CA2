"If somebody is providing arms to Bosnia, we know nothing about this thing," he told reporters here when asked to comment on a CNN report Tuesday, claiming that Malaysia, Iran and Turkey will supply arms to the Bosnians. Dr Mahathir said Malaysia was only providing arms to its 1,500 soldiers serving under the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The CNN report could have misinterpreted this as supplying arms to the Bosnians, he added. We are not in the gun running business, he said.
