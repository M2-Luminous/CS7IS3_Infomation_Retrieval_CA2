FBIS3-46900 "dreas004__a94001" FBIS-EAS-94-004-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Businesses Wary of Participation in TMD Plan OW0601133194 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 30 Dec 93 Morning Edition p 9 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0601133194 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Defense Production Committee under the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan [Keidanren], which is organized by about 80 defense-related companies, released a 200-page report in mid-December. The report carries a translated text of the theater missile defense (TMD) plan, which was released by the U.S. Defense Department in June 1993. In view of trends in the post-Cold War period, the TMD is proposed as a regional defense system to replace the strategic defense initiative (SDI) plan. The United States is calling for Japan's cooperation in developing and purchasing the TMD system, and Japan is beginning to think seriously about it since it became obvious the DPRK (North Korea) is developing the "Nodong" missile with an effective range of 1,000 kilometers. Under such circumstances, the Keidanren Defense Production Committee has decided to study the U.S. proposal. A senior official of a major electric appliance manufacturer noted the TMD plan is expected to awaken Japan's interest in better warning and control systems as well as defense missile systems, saying: "Japan's air defense system is intended for airplane attacks, and the nation is completely open to ballistic missiles. The TMD will be a chance to modernize the nation's capability to cope with missile attacks." During his Tokyo visit in November, U.S. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin stated that Japan should contribute to the TMD project not only by offering its technology, but also by purchasing U.S.-made equipment. If so, the project would be unattractive to Japanese companies. Japan decided to purchase airborne warning and control system (AWACS) late last year, and the purchase of four AWACS planes was incorporated in the 1993 and 1994 budgets; however, this suppressed expenditure for Japanese-made equipment. Therefore, Managing Director Shozo Ojimi of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Limited showed a prudent attitude toward Japan's participation in the TMD project, saying: "It is questionable that we really have to join the TMD project thoughtlessly. We have to carefully study its technological merits, or we will just waste money." Also, a senior Defense Agency official said: "While the United States wants to use Japanese technology in the TMD, Japan's technological contribution to development of the missile system would be quite limited due to legal restrictions." Some quarters express concern that, even if some sort of technological cooperation is possible, such Japan-U.S. projects may produce nothing but technological friction just like the joint project for development of Japan's next-generation support fighter (FSX).
