FBIS4-66957 "jptdd019__l94019" JPRS-TDD-94-019-L JPRS Narcotics 27 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA COLOMBIA Case Involving `La Quica' Takes `Abrupt Turn' Case Involving `La Quica' Takes `Abrupt Turn' PA2704024194 Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal A Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 27 Apr 94 PA2704024194 Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal A Network Spanish BFN [Report from the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] [Text] The case of Dandenys Munoz Mosquera, a.k.a. La Quica, could take an abrupt turn in the United States. Only a few days before the trial against him begins in New York, Colombia obtained an important statement directly implicating La Quica in the case of the Avianca aircraft, contrary to what El Arete [Carlos Alzate Urquijo] had stated in a report that caused a scandal a few days ago. The Prosecutor General's office has the statement and is expected to turn it over to the United States within the next few hours. This is an exclusive report. By a strange boomerang effect, the letter from Prosecutor de Greiff to the U.S. judge who is examining the participation of La Quica in the attack on the Avianca aircraft prompted a very credible informant to confess all he knew about the sinister attack. According to the confession, given to an appointed prosecutor, the informant, whose identity is being maintained in strict secrecy, confessed that the Avianca aircraft explosion was carried out directly by Dandenys Munoz a.k.a. La Quica, with the participation of other accomplices. In other words, La Quica was the one who staged the attack. Even more surprising, the informant confirmed that La Quica had staged the attack as ordered by Carlos Mario Alzate Urquijo, a.k.a. El Arete, who was the one that stated before Prosecutor de Greiff that La Quica had nothing to do with the sinister incident. In other words, El Arete blatenly lied to Prosecutor de Greiff regarding La Quica. The informant, who contradicted the statement by El Arete, and who has puzzled the investigators, has a great deal of credibility with the judicial and security organizations, because he alerted the authorities about an attack on the U.S. Embassy and about other planned attacks, even against Prosecutor de Greiff.
