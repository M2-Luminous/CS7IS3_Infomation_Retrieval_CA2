Meeting Between Leaders of Top World Companies and Russian Government Ends in Moscow"] [Text] A meeting between Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin and a group of leading foreign entrepreneurs was held in the Kremlin yesterday. Russian Federation Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin also took part in it. The president's press service reported that Boris Yeltsin noted that the widespread opinion among foreign investors that Russia is a country with a high level of political risk is already outdated. The political situation has stabilized over the past few months, which creates a favorable climate for the investment process. "Russians take a long time getting ready, but then move quickly," Boris Yeltsin stated. "We are ready. Now we will move more quickly." Around half of all the edicts on economic reform signed since 23 May this year are devoted to normalizing the production and investment processes, the president pointed out. There have also been successes in the fight against inflation, and the prerequisites for reviving the investment process are in evidence. The president supported and made a high assessment of the idea of setting up the Russian Federation Government Consultative Council on Foreign Investment. The main result of the Moscow meeting between the top leaders of world companies and the Russian Government has been the setting up of the Consultative Council on Foreign Investment in Russia, Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin stated. He was speaking yesterday at a press conference devoted to the conclusion of the two-day sessions the the President Hotel, during which Russian ministers and the top leaders of 14 multinational corporations and banks from the Western countries and Japan conducted a direct dialogue on the problems of capital investment in the Russian economy. Summing up the meeting's results, Viktor Chernomyrdin announced that henceforth the government will resolve questions of improving Russian legislation in the sphere of investment, changes to the tax system, and, in general, the formation of economic and legal conditions to encourage investors in conjunction with its Western partners. "A qualitatively new structure has emerged," Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed -- "the Consultative Council on Foreign Investment, which represents the `organized interest' of major foreign investors implementing their plans in the Russian business sphere and moving toward a free market." The Russian Government is already proposing dozens of ready projects in heavy and light industry, and in conversion sectors, but these are hard to implement owing to the disorganized state of legislative and fiscal mechanisms, the Russian prime minister stressed. As he put it, the participants in the President Hotel meeting put forward a lot of fair criticism of the vague nature of Russian normative acts and the inconsistency of their implementation and of the lack of coordination between the actions of federal and local authorities. We will strengthen executive discipline at all levels of Russian power and we guarantee to Western investors that all acts of legislation in the foreign investment sphere will be observed, Viktor Chernomyrdin stated. The activity of the three standing working groups that have been set up will be devoted to solving specific problems, he said. Viktor Chernomyrdin particularly stressed that foreign investment makes it possible to prevent unemployment from "sweeping" Russia as a result of bankruptcies and the liquidation of loss-making enterprises. By investing capital, investors primarily create jobs. The participants in the President Hotel meeting made a high assessment of the level of interest and openness shown during the meeting, the joint communique on the results of the sessions says. They expressed confidence that the active participation of all council members in its work will be the guarantee that Western capital's participation in developing the Russian economy will be galvanized. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will coordinate the activity of the Council on Foreign Investment. Its next session will be held sometime this November.
