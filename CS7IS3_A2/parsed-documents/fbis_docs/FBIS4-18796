[Cetin] The Gorazde problem is not a new one. Gorazde is one of the six cities included in the secure areas determined by the United Nations. There have been sieges of Gorazde from time to time. There have also been times when this city could not receive any bread. I discussed these issues with officials in Sarajevo. Since 29 March, the sieges there have been intensified and attacks have been continuing. Turkey continued to undertake initiatives with regard to this matter during this time. For example, we held talks with Foreign Ministry officials from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia at the beginning of last week. This was one of the topics discussed at the talks. An appeal was issued to the United Nations, asking them to put an end to the siege in Gorazde as soon as possible and make the city genuinely secure. This matter was brought to the attention of the [word indistinct] foreign minister in a letter. In my contacts, I discussed these issued with Ejup Ganic and the Bosnian foreign minister, who were in Turkey two days ago. It is clear that there is neglect or foot-dragging on the part of the United Nations with regard to this subject. Although the city is under siege and NATO is ready to conduct an air operation if the United Nations demands, for some reason the United Nations is acting slowly on the matter. According to reports we received recently, the siege has been further intensified, the city is predominantly Muslim, most probably they want the city to be evacuated, and people have started arriving in the city from surrounding villages, making the city more populated. At this point, in order to prevent further suffering to the people there.... [pauses] Their suffering is also ours. I was in Sarajevo three times. As always, the Foreign Ministry has dedicated all its work force and all its time to this issue. We want to prevent the death of even one person. We want the United Nations to end this siege immediately and if necessary, apply to NATO for air intervention. We are continuing the necessary efforts to this end. [Gokce] There are reports that chemical weapons were used against Gorazde last night and that there were mass deaths. Have you been in contact with Bosnia-Herzegovina officials? [Cetin] Since last night, Foreign Ministry officials as well as myself have been trying to investigate this report, which stemmed from a single source. We contacted our permanent representative to the United Nations in New York. We contacted NATO in Brussels. We also contacted Zagreb, where the UN headquarters is located, and Sarajevo. It is true that there is a tense atmosphere, artillery is being fired, and people are being killed. As of this morning, however, the reports on the use of chemical warfare or mass deaths were not confirmed through our contacts. This morning as well as this afternoon, I had two conversations with Muslim Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. He is the prime minister of the country and is currently in Sarajevo. He is not in Ankara, Istanbul, or New York, like us. He is in his office in Sarajevo. I discussed this matter with him and told him that there are such reports in Turkey. I tried to understand the situation. As you know, Gorazde is 60-65 km from Sarajevo. It is very close to Sarajevo. According to what he told me at 1500 this afternoon, the siege is continuing, the situation is tense, and measures should be adopted in this regard. He reported to me, however, that he has no information about the use of chemical weapons or that there were mass deaths. We are obliged to believe the prime minister of a country. Therefore, I would like to call on my citizens especially. Naturally, every drop of blood shed in Bosnia-Herzegovina hurts us. Their suffering is also ours. Turkey was there before anyone else. I respect my citizens' sensitivity on this subject. There is, however, a government in that country and there are officials. There is also a ministry which has devoted all its efforts to this matter and which has a very good track record. We will work on this issue until the end and we will continue to do so, but I must act in line with the information conveyed to me by the responsible prime minister of the country, who now lives in Sarajevo. If he tells me that as of now he has no information on the use of chemical warfare or mass massacres, then we must all respect him. Turkey will naturally do whatever is necessary and has done so. Even if these events did not occur, I believe that if necessary NATO should conduct an air operation in order to lift the siege around Gorazde as soon as possible and we are working to this end. If necessary, we will intensify our initiatives even further in this regard. We want the United Nations to make an ultimatum on this subject. Gorazde and the other cities must be transformed into secure areas in the real sense of the word as soon as possible. A United Nations, which cannot render secure the areas which it decided to make secure, can no longer be trusted. Naturally, the Turkish Government will do whatever necessary. I sincerely hope that our citizens will be calm on this issue.
