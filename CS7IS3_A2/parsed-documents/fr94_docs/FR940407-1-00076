For the reasons set out in the preamble, part 256 of title 25, chapter I of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as set forth below. 1. The authority citation for 25 CFR Part 256 continues to read: Authority: 42 Stat. 208. (25 U.S.C. 13). 2. Section 256.3 (c) and (d) is revised to read as follows: §256.3 Policy. * * * * * (c) Beginning in FY 1995 HIP funds will be distributed to tribes proportionally based upon the total number of documented program-eligible applicants submitted by all tribes. Tribes shall make every effort to advertise the opportunity to apply for housing assistance to all member and non-member Indians residing within the designated service area. Tribes shall review HIP applications for eligibility in accordance with §256.6 and ensure that appropriate records and documents to verify eligibility are on file. On or before August 1, 1994, each Tribe shall submit to the Area Office a list of documented program-eligible applicants that also specifies the category of service to be provided to each applicant. This list shall be accompanied by the applications and a tribal resolution affirming the accuracy of the list. The Area housing staff will review the HIP applications and certify that they have done so before submitting the list of documented eligible applicants to the Central Office. In some instances, it may be easier for the Area housing staff to inspect the applications at the tribal offices. This decision may be made locally. (d) Beginning in FY 1995, HIP funds shall be included in the Tribal Priority Allocation (TPA) section of the BIA budget. Beginning in FY 1996, each tribe shall establish its own funding level for HIP within the TPA allocation based upon the number of eligible applicants it plans to serve in that year. Tribes are encouraged to provide adequate funding to meet the housing needs of individuals residing within the designated service area. Every effort shall be made to use HIP funds in conjunction with other programs so that the result will be a greater amount of housing improvements than would otherwise be possible with the HIP funds alone. Other funding sources shall be used only to supplement HIP funds, not as a means to exceed the regulatory cost limits for the category of service. §256.4 [Removed] 3. Section 256.4 (c) is removed. §256.6 [Amended] 4. Section 256.6(c) is revised to read as follows: * * * * * (c) Houses financed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shall not be eligible for assistance under HIP. 5. The introductory paragraph of §256.7 is revised to read as follows: §256.7 HIP selection criteria. At least every two years, each tribe shall develop a single priority list of applicants who satisfy the eligibility requirements of §256.6. The priority list shall be developed using a ranking system based upon five basic factors of need: Annual income, family size, overcrowded living conditions, age, and handicap or disability. Eligible applicants may receive points for any or all of these five criteria in accordance with the point schedule contained in Appendix A of this part. Individuals with a total score below zero, as a result of earning negative points for income, shall not be considered eligible and shall not be served. Housing assistance will be provided to individuals in priority order based upon the number of points earned. Eligibility information should be revalidated before service is actually provided. * * * * * 6. Section 256.7(f) is removed. 7. In Appendix A to part 256_Summary of Selection Criteria_Point Schedule Factor No. 6 is removed. Dated January 27, 1994. Ada E. Deer, Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs.
