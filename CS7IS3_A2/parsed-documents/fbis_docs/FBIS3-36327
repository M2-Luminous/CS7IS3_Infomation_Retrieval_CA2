The parliamentarians also adopted an address to the president and the prime minister devoted to the situation in agriculture. The address points out that "the unilateral approach to carrying out agrarian reforms, reduced to restructuring ownership of land, privatization and reorganization of collective farms and state-owned farms" led to a fall of agricultural output of 65-70% over the last two years against the average annual level in 1986-1990. State programs for constructing homes, gas, electricity and hot water installations, building roads and developing the telephone network in the country have been curbed. Due to the inadequate increase of prices of manufactured goods against agricultural products, virtually all farms went bankrupt. As a result, Russians have to consume less domestic agricultural products against the background of growing imports of foreign goods at the expense of destroying Russia's agriculture. Members of the Federation Council called on the government to consider a complex of agricultural issues at its next session. It is extremely necessary that real aid to agriculture be rendered until the beginning of field work in the spring. The session also passed a resolution demarcating the new border between the Ivanovo and Nizhnyy Novgorod regions. According to the decision to send a Federation Council commission to the area of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict, the session formed a group of 4 deputies. The session also approved a document regulating the implementation of the law "On guarantees and compensation for persons working and residing in the northern most regions of Russia and regions with similar adverse climate conditions." The document points to the need to strictly observe the privileges for the regions' residents envisioned during the preparation of the budget. The Federation Council will hold parliamentary hearings to look into the issue this March. A number of parliamentary committees will use their results as the basis for developing a draft law on the issue.
