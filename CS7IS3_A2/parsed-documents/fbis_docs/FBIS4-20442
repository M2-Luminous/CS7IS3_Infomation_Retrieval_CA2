The complete glycoprotein D gene sequence has 1185 nucleotides and encodes a polypeptide of 395 amino acids. Result obtained from the homology comparison among 168, HFEM, SC16, 17 and Patton showed that the most conserved region was located in the ectodomain, whereas the most variable regions in the signal peptide region, as well as transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain regions. The present paper provides the basis for further understanding of structure and function of HSV-1 gD gene and for a HSV vaccine development.
