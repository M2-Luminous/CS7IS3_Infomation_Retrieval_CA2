Army Commander General Guillermo Paredes Hernandez revealed that studies show that to make military service attractive and appealing one need lots of money -- approximately 180 million lempiras. He explained that new battalions will not be formed, and the present ones one will continue to be used. Perhaps, though, some reforms will be implemented. He made it clear, however, that this is not definite. When asked if Armed Forces Commander General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir's statement "voluntarily -- only to the movies" denoted a confrontation between the civilian and military powers, Paredes said that there is no confrontation nor any intention to begin one. "On the contrary, we came here to promote a civilized, high-level dialogue so that together we can all make the correct recommendations. Moreover, we are setting a precedent and an example for the rest of society: that we can find the correct solutions to all the problems we face if we cooperate, discuss, and talk things over with one another," he pointed out. Paredes recalled the problem the Armed Forces are currently facing with regard to the number of soldiers. The law stipulates that all soldiers who have served two years must be discharged, and the number of new recruits does not equal the number of soldiers currently in the barracks. Paredes explained that during the meeting he presented a study dealing with a large number of issues, including the budget increase that would be necessary to implement the plan. "The Army is engaged in such tasks as fighting forest fires and patrolling the borders where international armed groups, who often surpass the capabilities of the police, are present," he said. "We are used in these tasks and others, like the war against drug trafficking. Among other things, we are now getting ready to provide security while many people travel outside the city for the weekend," he concluded.
