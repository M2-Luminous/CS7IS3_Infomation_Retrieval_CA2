In an interview with Israeli military radio on Tuesday [29 March], Rivolta asserted that past Italian governments had a "pro-Arab and pro-Palestinian" foreign policy, adding: "That was the attitude of left-wing parties, which always tend to support the Arab political line." What Italy should do, Rivolta went on, is "to understand the true difficulties of the present situation and the seriousness of the obstacles blocking dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians." Berlusconi last week told the Tel Aviv daily, YEDI'OT AHARONOT, that he was a true friend of Israel and praised the policies of Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Interviewed by Israel's military radio, Israeli ambassador in Rome Avi Pazner denied Rivolta's claim that Italian foreign policy could be described as "pro-Arab." "For 2-3 years, in other words, since the start of the peace process, you can no longer talk about a pro-Arab Italian foreign policy," he said. "If anything, there is a policy in favour of peace, which includes expressions of friendship for Israel." According to Pazner, after a conversation with the media mogul a couple of weeks ago, he believes that, if Berlusconi forms a government, he would expect it to be friendly towards Israel. "He's not about to form a clearly right-wing government," the diplomat said. "Even if he counts on right-wing support, Berlusconi is a man of the centre whose concerns include relations with Europe, the United States, Israel and also the Italian Jewish community."
