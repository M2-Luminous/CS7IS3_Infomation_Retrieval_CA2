SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54353), EPA issued a notice which announced that Micro Flo Co., P.O. Box 5948, Lakeland, FL 33807, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 3F4196) to EPA proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180, under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, by establishing a regulation to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance residues of the following biochemical pesticide plant floral volatile attractant compounds: cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol, 4-methoxy cinnamaldehyde, 3-phenyl propanol, 4-methoxy phenethyl alcohol, indole, and 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene on the following raw agricultural commodities: the following field crops_alfalfa, clover, cotton, dandelion, peanuts (including hay), rice, sorghum (milo), soybeans, sunflower, sweet potatoes, and wheat; the following vegetable crops_ asparagus, beans (including forage hay), beets, carrots, celery, cole crops (cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower), collards (kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, kohlrabi), corn, fresh (field, sweet, pop, seed), corn fodder and forage, chinese cabbage, cowpeas, cucurbitis (cucumbers, squash, pumpkin), egg plant, endive (escarole), horseradish (radish, rutabagas, turnip roots), leafy greens (spinach, swiss chard), lettuce (head leaf), okra, parsley, parsnip, peas, peas with pods, peppers, potatoes, sugar beets, tomatoes; the following tree fruit, berry and nut crops_almonds, apples, apricots, berries (blackberry, boysenberry, dewberry, loganberry, raspberry), blueberry, cherry, citrus (grapefruit, kumquat, lemon, lime, orange, tangelo, and tangerine) cranberry, grapes, melons, (watermelon, honeydew, crenshaw, cantaloupe, casaba, persian), nectarines, pears, pecans, peaches, and strawberry as dispersed from the end-use product Corn RootwormBait ® , a pesticidal bait. The Agency has classified the seven floral attractants as biochemical pesticides based on their nontoxic mode of action and the natural occurrence of the components. The Agency notes that with the exception of 4-methoxy phenethyl alcohol and 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene, the various components are used in the flavor and fragrance industry and are considered generally recognized as safe by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association. Residue Chemistry Data No residue chemistry data were required. The Agency has taken into consideration the use pattern of the end-use product, its formulation, and the low application rate of the subject plant floral volatile attractants from the end-use product. The application rate of the subject attractants would be less than or equal to 20 grams of each per acre per application, given a maximum label rate of 5 applications of 10 pounds of Corn Rootworm Bait ® formulation per acre per season. Toxicology Data Furthermore, the Agency has evaluated the toxicology submissions provided by the petitioner. Completed mammalian acute toxicology studies for the end-use product indicate the following: acute oral toxicity in rats (LD 50 > 5,000 mg/kg, Toxicity Category IV), acute dermal toxicity in rabbits (LD 50 > 2,000 mg/kg, Toxicity Category III), acute inhalation toxicity in rats (LD 50 >6.08 mg/kg, Toxicity Category IV), primary dermal irritation in rabbits (Toxicity Category IV), primary eye irritation in rabbits (Toxicity Category I), dermal sensitization study in guinea pigs (not a sensitizer), and an Ames assay (not mutagenic). No comments were received in response to the Agency's announcement of the petition (PP 3F4196) in the Federal Register of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54353) proposing the exemption. Based on the information cited above and the conditions of use, the Agency has determined that the establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance in 40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after the date of publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk at the address given above. 40 CFR 178.20. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections. 40 CFR 178.25. Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector. 40 CFR 178.27. A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested. 40 CFR 178.32. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
