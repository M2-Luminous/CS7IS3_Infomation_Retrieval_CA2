In a speech at the opening of the cultural season organized by the secretariat of Arab students in Baghdad, Ramadan said that the dissension among the UN Security Council members on the question of the embargo imposed on Iraq is a positive element in Iraq's interest. He said this positive stand can be viewed as a victory for the Iraqis who have scored it thanks to their steadfastness, struggle, abidance by their principles and rights, and their rallying around Saddam Husayn, the leader of the brilliant march. Ramadan urged the oppressed people to resist injustice and hegemonistic policies. He said the Iraqis alone shattered the myth of U.S. monopoly of the world and showed how false is the belief that there is a united stand against Iraq which the United States had created through its deceptive and misleading policies and its colonialistic blackmail methods. Ramadan said that by distancing themselves from the United States and Britain, some UN Security Council members have exposed the falsehood of the U.S. claims and how they are violating international laws and conventions to achieve their designs and interests at the expense of other people and countries.
