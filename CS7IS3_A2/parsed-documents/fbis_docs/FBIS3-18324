Murmann told the Cologne daily EXPRESS (Wednesday edition): "The number of unemployed may certainly rise once again by up to 500,000 to 4.5 million this year; in eastern Germany, however, the low point has already been reached, in my view." The decisive reason for the continuing shrinking is the still insufficiant demand for German products abroad and the weak demand in the country itself. The forecast by the Federal Government, which expects an economic growth of 3.5 to 4 percent, is unrealistic, but 1.5 percent could be possible, the employers' federation president said. Murmann was convinced that the situation would get worse if a government led by the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] were to come to power. The BDA chief said: "From my talks with entrepreneurs, I know that the SPD is not trusted to be competent in economic policy." The economic situation in Germany would become even worse under an SPD-led government, Murmann predicted.
