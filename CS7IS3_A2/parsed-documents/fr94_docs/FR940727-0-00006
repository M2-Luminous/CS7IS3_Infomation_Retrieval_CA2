FR940727-0-00006 FR940727-0-00002 This rule suspends grade and inspection requirements in effect for fresh papayas. Such suspension will enable handlers to ship papayas to the fresh market at a reduced cost, since handlers will no longer be required to have their fruit inspected and pay the resulting inspection costs. Suspending grade requirements for fresh papayas is expected to increase producer returns by reducing costs and maintaining the quality of fruit offered for sale. The industry is committed to instituting alternative means of quality assurance by providing incentives to producers to harvest and deliver only acceptable quality fruit. This activity should ensure that consumers continue to receive good quality fresh papayas. This rule is in the best interest of producers, handlers and consumers, and is expected to increase returns to papaya producers. The Department's view is that this rule will have a beneficial impact on producers and handlers, since it will permit the industry to ship fruit without paying the cost of inspection, thus improving producers' returns, and is not expected to adversely impact the quality of fruit entering fresh markets. Consistent with the suspension of §928.313, this rule also suspends §§928.150 and 928.152 of the rules and regulations in effect under the order. Section 928.150 provides a means for handlers to receive waivers from the mandatory inspection requirement under certain circumstances, and §928.152 authorizes exemptions from the current grade requirement relating to fruit maturity. Since this action suspends mandatory inspection and grade requirements, these rules authorizing exemptions from such requirements would no longer be needed. A conforming change is also made in §928.160, which requires handlers to file monthly utilization reports with the committee. Among the information required to be submitted are the inspection certificate numbers applicable to each fresh shipment of papayas. Since inspection will no longer be mandatory, the requirement that handlers submit inspection certificate numbers would no longer be needed. Thus, §928.160 is revised to suspend such requirement. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0102. This rule should reduce the reporting burden on approximately 5 papaya handlers who have been completing PAC Form 7, Application to be an Approved Handler of Immature Papayas, and PAC Form 7(c), Immature Papaya Order Form. Form 7 is estimated to take 15 minutes to complete, and Form 7(c) about 10 minutes per form. No reduction in reporting burden is expected as a result of the revision in §928.160 pertaining to monthly utilization reports. While handlers will no longer be required to provide inspection certificate numbers, the remaining information on the reports will continue to be collected. It is estimated that each report requires 1 hour to complete. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee, and other information, it is found that the suspension of these sections, as set forth below, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) This rule suspends grade requirements for papayas grown in Hawaii; (2) Hawaiian papaya handlers are aware of this suspension, which was recommended by the committee at a public meeting, and they will need no additional time to comply with this suspension; (3) shipment of the 1994 season Hawaiian papaya crop is currently in progress; (4) this rule needs to be made effective by July 1, 1994, to be of maximum benefit to the Hawaiian papaya industry; and (5) the rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any comments received will be considered prior to any finalization of this interim final rule.
