The minister will, however, join the President during his Beijing trip scheduled for early next week, he said. The official said Han Sunday suggested that he would rather stay in Seoul this weekend, which may be a critical point in the future development of the North Korean nuclear issue. He said the international community is expected to move toward taking some kind of measures against North Korea this week, The U.N. Security Council may convene to hear reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the results of its recent inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities. The official said Minister Han might have felt that it would be more convenient for him to hold consultations at home with the United States and other countries on their joint strategy to persuade Beijing to join international measures against North Korea prior to his China visit next week.
