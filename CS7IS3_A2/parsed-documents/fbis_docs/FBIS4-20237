DE MORGEN learned this yesterday from senior government circles. So far, Dehaene has left it up in the air as to whether he was interested in or had been asked to be the EC president, uttering only a sharp "no comment." The report that the Germans and French had expressed their preference for the Belgian prime minister appeared in THE GUARDIAN in early March and led to quite a bit of excitement in the government. Not only was it remarkable that the energetic approach of the nonconformist Dehaene in Europe was esteemed but, in addition, everyone knows that the current government is identified with the person of the prime minister. Replacing him would be a tough job and would seriously compromise the survival of the government. Delors' succession must take effect on 1 January 1995, the government still has a bit less than a year to go. [passage omitted]
