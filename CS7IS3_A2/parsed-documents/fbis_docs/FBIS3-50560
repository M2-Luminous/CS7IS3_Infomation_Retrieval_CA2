It had been under the control of Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN) guerrillas since 1 January. Chiapas Government Under Secretary Julio Cesar Cancino has told television media that Altamirano is the only town in the hands of the "criminals" (guerrillas). The official did not provide details on the recovery of Ocosingo or the number of Army and rebel casualties during more than 24 hours of fighting. The authorities have only admitted the presence of EZLN rebels in four municipal capitals (San Cristobal, Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, and Altamirano). Meanwhile, media sources has reported there was guerrilla presence in five other towns: Chanal, Oxchuc, Huiztan, Cuxulja, and Rancho Nuevo. Cancino said that the Mexican Army is protecting the highways leading to Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, where "many rumors" have been heard about the activities of EZLN members. He stressed the possibility that the strife-torn situation in Chiapas as a result of the violent appearance of the EZLN will end 4 January.
