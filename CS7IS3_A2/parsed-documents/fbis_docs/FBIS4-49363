The liftoff from the Cape Canaveral followed a number of delays because of technical problems and weather conditions. The U.S. military refused to disclose details about the satellite, but an earlier NEW YORK TIMES report said the craft worth 1.5 billion dollars was the most expensive of the kind. Weighed five tons and equipped with a 152-meter-wide dish antenna, its mission was to intercept the telecommunications of Russian military, intelligence and political officials. The spy satellite was built and would be operated by the National Reconnaissance Office, the United States' largest and most secretive intelligence service, the TIMES report said. Data collected would be analyzed by the National Security Agency using a global network of ground stations and an array of supercomputers.
