The call came from Tsunesaburo Nishimura, president of the Japan Society of Industrial Machinery Manufacturers, in a meeting of industry leaders with International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai. Nishimura said the industry is concerned about the yen's renewed surge against the dollar following the breakdown in February of the Japan-U.S. trade framework talks. The Japanese currency's excessive strength may undermine the industry's cost-cutting and other restructuring efforts, he said. Nishimura and nine other industrial leaders, each representing machinery manufacturing for such sectors as engineering, construction, textiles and robots, jointly made the request to Kumagai during consultations over breakfast. The machinery industry hopes the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will ensure the trade dispute does not deal a blow to its earnings, which are just recovering in some sectors from the long recession, said Nishimura, who is also an adviser to Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. Kumagai said MITI will do its best to have the request reflected in its policy. Nishimura said some bright spots are being seen in such sectors as semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, machines for making housing materials and waste disposal machinery. But construction machinery, a major leading indicator for Japan's economy, is still in the doldrums, he said.
