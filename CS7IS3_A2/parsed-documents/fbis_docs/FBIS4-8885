FBIS4-8885 "dreeu075_k_94011" FBIS-EEU-94-075 Daily Report 20 Mar 1994 CROATIA Law on Invalidity of Bank Contracts Law on Invalidity of Bank Contracts 94BA0235A Split SLOBODNA DALMACIJA in Serbo-Croatian 20 Mar 94 p 12 94BA0235A Split SLOBODNA DALMACIJA Serbo-Croatian CSO [Article by S.G.: "Law on Invalidity of Certain Types of Security Agreements and Loan Agreements in Effect: Managerial Loans for Those Without `Beautiful Eyes'"] [Text] Under the adopted law, the beneficiary of a "beautiful eyes" type of loan is obligated to settle the unpaid value of the loan with the bank all at once. The Croatian Fund for Privatization expects that the Law on the Invalidity of Certain Types of Security Agreements and Loan Agreements, which went into effect about a month ago, will change the disposition structure of stock shares and their owners that is already in place. In simplified terms, this concerns legal regulation of what are known as (arbitrary, irregular) managerial loans, so that in response to Croatian public agitation the government has reacted with legal propositions to prevent the purchase of enterprises on credit, which is generally approved, insiders say, because of "beautiful eyes." The law expressly states that subscribed stock shares cannot serve as security to cover claims from loan agreements for the purchase of enterprises. Thus, loan agreements between banks and a physical person (primarily managers have come forward) based on redeemed old foreign exchange savings or on security through subscribed stock are invalidated. Also invalidated are agreements entered into with participation less than 10 percent of the loan value, those entered into for a term longer than seven years or with an interest rate lower than 5 percent, and loans agreed to without a foreign exchange clause or if their "grace period" is longer than 12 months, but also those agreed to without security from a mortgage on real property where the appraised value is at least 70 percent of the loan amount. The beneficiary of a "beautiful eyes" type of loan is obligated to settle the unpaid value of the loan with the bank all at once. But if the unpaid portion has not been returned to the bank by the day on which the agreement is deemed invalid, the agreement concluded between the loan beneficiary and the Croatian Fund for Privatization is also invalidated, in which case the Fund becomes the owner of the stock purchased with that loan. This is the part of the legislation that signifies for the Croatian Fund for Privatization a change in the ownership structure, because initial assessments indicate that approved managerial loans in the past period of time have not undergone additional treatment that would result in their conformance to the provisions of the law. At least as far as the Split office of the Croatian Fund for Privatization is concerned, this will mean a change in the ownership structure of, for example, the Primosten hotels, or even "Univerzal" or "Kamen" in Split. Indeed, information on conforming such loans to the norms imposed by the law has not arrived from "Split Bank." As Josko Ivacic, the director of the Split office, pointed out, all the names of people holding managerial loans without backing will be made public, and that will happen very soon because it will be necessary to transfer stock purchased with managerial loans to the Fund's portfolio. In addition, Ivacic says that it will be interesting to determine the names of the untried owners, which Ivacic says are primarily people without party affiliations, which will refute talk of how only one party is involved in these dealings. Also bearing the "brunt" of this law's articles are all agreements concluded since 1 May 1991, naturally if they conflict with the provisions of this law. The Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Croatia will bring charges to establish the invalidity of agreements.
