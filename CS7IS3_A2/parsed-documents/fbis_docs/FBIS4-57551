CODEFRO [expansion unknown] will be established as a binational agency within six weeks. The municipalities on the Uruguay River will join the foreign ministries. Foreign Minister Di Tella on 11 May told the Uruguay River mayors that within six weeks the CODEFRO binational agency will be established under an agreement with the Argentine Government. The Argentine and Uruguayan municipalities will play a very important political and technical role in this organization, because they, along with the foreign ministries, will be executive committee members. The CODEFRO project, sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank, will therefore be implemented. It represents the crowning of two years of work by the Planning and Negotiations Committee, which represents five Uruguayan municipalities and seven Argentine municipalities. It also represents a pilot project in Latin America in the field of regional integration, and a subsystem within Mercosur [Common Market of the South] planning. [passage omitted]
