The phrase, "A new step in space operations," which was used by the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) to describe the success of the launch of the H-2, can be applied to the very situation the Japanese space industry is in. The market size of the Japanese space industry is a mere Â¥200 billion or so as of FY92. Moreover, the demand comes mostly from the government and is nowhere near the market size in other leading countries. There are many aspects that are beyond the capabilities of private companies, e.g., any given project requires an immense investment of funds, long lead time, and a huge risk. Despite those seemingly insurmountable problems, Japan has made a giant step forward into the space business. One top executive of the industry said this: "The H-2 launch vehicle was built on the premise that it will be developed on domestic technology only, in order to meet the large satellite launch needs expected in the 1990s. With this success, it is possible that other countries might want to use this vehicle to launch their satellites, in addition to various Japanese satellites scheduled to be launched. The higher the demand, the more improvements that will result in the technology to reduce the cost; and the lower the cost becomes, the higher the demand will be. "They hope that the H-2 will fulfil those expectations. In that sense, the successful launch may be said to have opened the first year of the space age for Japan, or a milestone of the Japanese space industry, with the vistas of the coming 21st century, and it is the cornerstone of future development." The point here is that the wider the space business field expands, the better the chances for business development. A launch vehicle consists of about 100,000 components. The people of the companies, as well as NASDA, who were involved in the design and manufacture of those components did everything they could to ensure reliability, including extensive process evaluations and process witness tests and source checks during the entire manufacturing process, ranging from the quality control of each component to the entire system integration. All those efforts culminated in the successful launch. Some of the companies involved in the development are as follows: the fuselage was developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) as the principal contractor; the engines, by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI), as well as MHI; the satellite fairing, by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (IHI); the solid rocket motor, by Nissan Motors; and the onboard electronics, by NEC, Mitsubishi Electric, Nippon Avionics, and Mitsubishi Precision. The ground facilities that include the launch site equipment, communication and radio systems, and launch control were completed through the concerted efforts of MHI, IHI, and KHI, as well as Oki Electric, NEC, and Toshiba. Most of the companies mentioned above participated in the development of the two space test devices and systems carried by this first H-2 launch vehicle. One of the two test systems mentioned here is the Orbit Reentry Experiment (OREX) equipment. That experiment is intended for the development of the Japanese version of the space shuttle, HOPE, which is expected to be launched in the early part of the 21st century. The objectives of the experiment are to test whether it can withstand the high heat that is created during the reentry into the atmosphere and to collect the data for the black-out period, during which the radio signal cannot reach the ground, because of the enormously high temperatures. MHI assumed the responsibility of principal contractor, working with six other suppliers. Another test device is the H-2 Vehicle Evaluation Payload (VEP). VEP was launched with the OREX atop the H-2, after which it was separated and injected into an elliptical orbit with an inclination of about 28.8 degrees, with an apogee altitude of about 36,300 km and a perigee altitude of about 450 km. It stayed in orbit for about 100 hours, during which time it conducted various analyses such as the evaluation of the accuracy of the satellite orbit injection by the launch vehicle and the environmental conditions for various pieces of equipment during the launch. VEP was developed jointly by Toshiba and IHI. Although it is a national project, each company worked hard individually to live up to the full responsibility and credibility bestowed on it. Following the H-2's first launch, a hoard of satellites -- including the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-5 (GMS-5), the Space Flyer Unit (SFU) and the Advance Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) -- are waiting to be launched by the H-2, and those satellites are nearing completion with the enthusiastic cooperation of all the companies involved. The H-2 provides quite an attractive opportunity in terms of economic value, as well as in terms of its large size and its ability to launch multiple satellites. The environment of the space industry is a rocky road, to say the least. Although it is a promising frontier for mankind, the enormous funds required are blocking the approach. It is an undeniable truth that space development is stagnant at the moment. Every other country involved -- not just Japan -- is having difficulty assembling a large budget for space activities. The United States has developed a detailed policy on commercialization in five fields -- i.e., launch services, satellite communications, satellite-based remote sensing, new materials manufacturing and processing that utilize the space environment, and industrial infrastructure in orbit -- to promote the commercialization in general. In Europe as well, commercialization is being considered mainly in the areas of launch services and remote sensing. Russia is offering opportunities for the performance of experiments in the space environment on the space station Mir and its module Photon, while China has established an agency for offering launch services. In both countries, the trend seems to be to shift from the government-led systems to the government/industry- or industry-led systems. The Japanese space industry has become competitive with those countries in its success in launching a large vehicle. A significant jump is expected in the next step. In order to respond to the needs of the industry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has begun a study of the commercialization of the space development industry. The Space Activities Commission of the Prime Minister's Office recently established a forum to prepare for the reform of the Outline of Space Development Policy scheduled to be implemented later this year. It is certain that the nation's eyes will focus again on how further progress can be achieved in space development through a concerted effort by the academic, industrial, and government circles in the wake of this successful launch of the H-2.
