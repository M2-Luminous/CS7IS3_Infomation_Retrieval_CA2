The Taba negotiations have adjourned for the week, and Israeli delegation sources described the progress achieved this week as tremendous. We used to argue for a month and a half over one clause, and yet we concluded five clauses within the last three days, one of the delegates told us. Major General Amnon Shahaq recapped the discussions: [Begin Shahaq recording] We have concluded the agreement segment dealing with security coordination and cooperation. We have reviewed every aspect of the police issue, and later we will discuss several aspects of its size. We have started discussing security arrangements in Gaza and Jericho. The Civilian Affairs Committee has also concluded a series of issues, and it will pursue some of the issues next week. [end recording] Shahaq and Sha'th have started discussing the format of the comprehensive arrangement. Unfinished issues include two substantive matters: the Palestinian council and the self-administration's jurisdiction. The Civilian Affairs Committee still has five points to conclude before the civilian chapter of the Taba negotiations can be closed. [passage omitted] Members of the Israeli delegation said the talks were swift and favorable this week, although they were unprepared to commit themselves to a timetable. Gen. Shahaq said: [Begin Shahaq recording] We aim for an agreement covering every issue, giving us guarantees. I hope it will happen quickly. We all want it to happen as soon as possible, but I would not....[pauses] If two more weeks are required, then we will take two more weeks. If a month is needed, we will take a month. And if we find we can finish it in less than two weeks, we will all be glad. [end recording]
