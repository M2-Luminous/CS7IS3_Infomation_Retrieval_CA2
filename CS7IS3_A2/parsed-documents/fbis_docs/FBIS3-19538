In a 30-minute papal audience requested by the Israeli leader, Mr. Rabin defined as shameful the Hebron mosque massacre. The Vatican encounter was the first by an Israeli prime minister since an agreement to forge diplomatic ties was signed in December last year. Vatican officials said Mr. Rabin renewed his invitation to the Pope to visit Israel and that the Pontiff accepted saying he hoped circumstances would allow a pilgrimage to the Holy Land soon. Mr. Rabin arrived in Rome today on his way from three days of talks in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Today's meeting in the Vatican came on the same day that the Holy See's Secretary for Relations with States, Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, met PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis. Following his audience with the Pope, Mr. Rabin gave an exclusive interview to Vatican radio during which he spoke of the role of the Holy See in the Middle East Peace process: [Begin Rabin recording, in English] In my meeting with His Holiness the Pope, I found that he is more than interested to be in a position to influence the peace process. He would like to see a continuation of the negotiations and he would like to see peace being achieved in the Middle East as he would like to see it all over the world. But especially, he would like to see peace in whatever is related to the Holy Land. I stressed the importance of reaching peace hopefully before the year 2000 to Christ [as heard]. [end recording] That was Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in an exclusive interview with Vatican Radio's Celeste Martino.
