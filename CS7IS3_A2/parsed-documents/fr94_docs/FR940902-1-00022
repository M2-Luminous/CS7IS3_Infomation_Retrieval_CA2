FR940902-1-00022 FR940902-1-00003 Pub. L. 101&hyph;237 permits the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to require a reservist to submit a verification of continued pursuit of a reservist's program of education before releasing the monthly benefit to him or her. This proposal contains regulations which would require these verifications from reservists. It has been a long-standing requirement of VA that monthly benefits would not be released to students training under the Montgomery GI Bill_Active Duty until they submitted a monthly verification that they are continuing to pursue their programs of education. During 1989 VA conducted a study to determine whether this monthly self-verification was cost-effective. The study found that not only was it cost-effective for the Montgomery GI Bill_Active Duty, but that it also would be cost-effective in the other educational programs which VA administers. The study discovered that over 50% of the overpayments in a sample of non-Montgomery GI Bill_Active Duty cases would not have occurred if all educational programs had monthly self-verification of pursuit. Accordingly, VA, the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard are proposing amendments to §§21.7640 and 21.7654 which would extend monthly self-verification of pursuit to the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. At the same time the requirement that an educational institution verify pursuit at least annually is being eliminated. It has been a long-standing requirement of law that a reservist maintain satisfactory progress and conduct in order to receive educational assistance. In order that this provision of law be met, §21.7653 has required that educational institutions report to VA whenever a reservist is not making satisfactory progress or conduct. Pub. L. 101&hyph;237 amended 38 U.S.C. 3474 to provide that VA would not pay educational assistance to a reservist who has an unsatisfactory attendance record. Since each educational institution with an attendance standard is responsible for enforcing it, VA, the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard are proposing to amend §21.7653 to require that educational institutions report to VA whenever a reservist's attendance is unsatisfactory. The Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation have determined that these amended regulations do not contain a major rule as that term is defined by E.O. 12291, entitled Federal Regulation. The regulations will not have a $100 million annual effect on the economy, and will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for anyone. They will have no significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation have certified that these amended regulations, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the amended regulations, therefore, are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses requirements of sections 603 and 604. This certification can be made because the regulations affect only individuals. They will have no significant economic impact on small entities, i.e., small businesses, small private and nonprofit organizations and small governmental jurisdictions. VA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation find that good cause exists for making the amendments to §§21.7639(a), 21.7642(a)(7), (8) and (9), 21.7652 and 21.7672(d), like the provisions of law they implement, retroactively effective on December 18, 1989. VA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation find that good cause exists for making the new paragraphs §21.7576(b)(7), 21.7635(b)(5) and 21.7639(j), the amendments to §21.7620(b) and those portions of the amendments to §§21.752)(b)(19), 21.7576(a) and 21.7622(f) which deal with flight training, like the provisions of law they implement, retroactively effective on September 30, 1990. VA, the Department of Defense, the Department of Transportation find that good cause exists for making the new §21.7645, like the provisions of law it implements, retroactively effective on May 1, 1990. VA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation find that good cause exists for making the remainder of the amendments to the regulations (excluding the amendments to §§21.7654(a) and (b) and 21.7640(a)(1) but including those portions of §§21.7520(b)(19), 21.7576(a) and 21.7622(f) which do not deal with flight training), like the provisions of law they implement, retroactively effective on October 1, 1990. These provisions are intended to achieve a benefit for the reservist. The maximum benefits intended in the provisions of law implemented by the above proposed regulatory amendments will be achieved through prompt implementation. Hence, a delayed effective date would be contrary to statutory design; would complicate administration of these provisions of law; and might result in the denial of a benefit to a reservist who is entitled to it. These regulations have been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866.
