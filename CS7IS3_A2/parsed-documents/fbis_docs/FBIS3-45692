U.S. investment in China will benefit both sides, J. Carter Beese, director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said here yesterday at a symposium on how to enter the capital market of the United States. The symposium was jointly sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Bank of New York. Carter Beese said that he was happy about China's plan to issue one billion U.S. dollars-worth of global bonds in the United States. It will be the first time for China to enter the capital market of the United States. Shanghai Vice-Mayor Wu Kuangdi agreed to Carter Beese's view. Now three Shanghai-based companies have entered the capital market of the United States in the ADR form. Xu thought that they would help establish a good image for Chinese enterprises in the United States. Edmund Lukas, vice-president of the New York Stock Exchange, estimated that the trading volume of ADR in the United States will grow from 20 billion U.S. dollars last year to some 25 billion U.S. dollars this year, which will probably involve new enterprises from China. Joseph M. Velli, vice-president of the Bank of New York, also lectured at the symposium, telling some 200 Chinese stock exchange officials how to enter the capital market of the United States in the form of ADR.
