FR941117-0-00042 FR941117-0-00009 MidRange procedures are based on the use of a buying team to conduct the procurement. The concept is to designate individuals who are competent in their respective functional areas, provide those individuals with the basic authority to conduct the procurement and hold them accountable for the results. The buying team will normally consist of one technical member and one procurement member, but may be augmented with additional members as necessary. Personnel providing normal functional assistance to the team (e.g., legal, financial) will not be considered a part of the team unless so designated. To function properly, the team should be given the maximum decision authority in matters related to the procurement. When higher level management approvals remain essential, it will be incumbent upon the functional team member to obtain such approvals. The team may accept, as final, the decision of the responsible buying team member. 1871.202 Organizational responsibilities. 1871.202&hyph;1 Requiring organization. The requirements organization shall appoint, by name, the technical member of the buying team. This individual will normally be an end user or the one most familiar with the technical aspects of the requirement. The individual appointed, whatever the relationship with the procured item, is expected to totally fulfill the responsibilities to the buying team. If the requiring organization elects not to appoint a technical member to the buying team, standard interfaces and authorities applicable to large procurements will be used. The procedures in this part will be used to the extent practical; however, priority will be afforded to procurements fully using buying teams. 1871.202&hyph;2 Procurement organization.

Buying team members may require additional team members to perform specialized functions or to assist in the evaluation of offers. Requests for supporting members shall be made by the organization identifying the need for the support and directed to the appropriate management level in the supporting organization. Supporting team members, once designated for the team, shall fulfill all applicable responsibilities to the team as other members. 1871.202&hyph;4 Center management. Center managers shall, to the maximum extent practical and consistent with their responsibilities to manage the Center mission, convey sufficient authority to members of the buying team to conduct the procurement. Administrative or technical approvals should be minimized, and where deemed essential, facilitated to the maximum extent practicable. Center managers should lend their full support to the buying team should problems arise from the procurement. 1871.203 Buying team responsibilities.
