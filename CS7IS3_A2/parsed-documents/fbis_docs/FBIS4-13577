However, what we have heard from the U.S. secretary and other U.S. Administration officials on the siege does not encourage anyone to be optimistic about this U.S. commodity, which no longer has a market in Jordan. Jordan has suffered from contradiction between the U.S. words and deeds, and between talk and practical moves. Jordan has become fed up with the U.S. double standards, and this caused His Majesty King Husayn to openly announce that, henceforth, our country's effective participation in the peace process depends on how serious the U.S. commitments are concerning lifting the unjust siege on Jordan's sole port. Yesterday, the U.S. warships in the Gulf of Aqaba turned back a ship full of paper imported for the Jordanian press. This makes us even more doubtful about these U.S. statements; that is, unless the Clinton administration has reconsidered its calculations and concluded that it is unreasonable and unacceptable to continue sponsoring the peace process on the one hand, and imposing a siege on a country that is very strongly and honestly committed to the peace process on the other. We hope that Warren Christopher will this time have practical and acceptable proposals that do not harm Jordan's sovereignty and dignity concerning all that is related to the inspection of ships heading to the Port of al-'Aqabah. We also hope that the U.S. secretary's forthcoming visit to the Middle East will be more successful than previous visits and that it will lead to the aspired progress toward just and comprehensive peace in the region.
