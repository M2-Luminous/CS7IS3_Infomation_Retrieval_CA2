Following the departure of Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, with whom Tudjman had held talks at a two-day conference in Bonn, Tudjman also accused the Muslims of continued offensives. However, he described the Bosnia-Croatian conference at the Petersberg government guest house as useful. Even after Tudjman's remarks, it remained unclear whether there would be a cease-fire in central Bosnia. Izetbegovic said yesterday evening on ZDF [Second German Television Channel] that "no major results" had been achieved. Both presidents are now preparing for a new round of talks on 18 January in Geneva, this time involving all warring parties from the conference on former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]
