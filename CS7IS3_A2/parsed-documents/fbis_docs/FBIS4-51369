Since the city was approved as a special economic zone in 1980, the booming economy and growing population of the city have required an expanding power supply. In China, almost all large power plants were financed by the state in the past. But the city decided in 1987 to build power plants by itself, setting many favorable policies to encourage overseas and local investors. At present, a thermal power plant with a generating capacity of 1.8 million kw is under construction. According to its power development program, the city will construct two more large power plants in the near future. The program calls for the total generating capacity of the city's power plants to reach 6.35 million kw by the end of this century, to cover most of the city's power needs.
