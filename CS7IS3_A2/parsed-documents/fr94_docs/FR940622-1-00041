FR940622-1-00041 FR940622-1-00011 Par. 2. Section 1.305&hyph;3 is amended as follows: 1. In paragraph (e), remove the parentheses from the numbers in the headings for Examples (1) through (15) . 2. Paragraph (e), Example 15 is revised to read as follows: §1.305&hyph;3 Disproportionate distributions. * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* Example 15. (i) Facts. Corporation V is organized with two classes of stock, class A common and class B convertible preferred. The class B stock is issued for $100 per share and is convertible into class A at a fixed ratio that is not subject to full adjustment in the event stock dividends or rights are distributed to the class A shareholders. The class B stock pays no dividends but it is mandatorily redeemable in 10 years for $200. Under sections 305(c) and 305(b)(4), the entire redemption premium (i.e., the excess of the redemption price over the issue price) is deemed to be a distribution of preferred stock on preferred stock which is taxable as a distribution of property under section 301. This amount is considered to be distributed over the 10-year period under principles similar to the principles of section 1272(a). During the year, the corporation declares a dividend on the class A stock payable in additional shares of class A stock. (ii) Analysis. The distribution on the class A stock is a distribution to which sections 305(b)(2) and 301 apply since it increases the proportionate interests of the class A shareholders in the assets and earnings and profits of the corporation and the class B shareholders have received property (i.e., the constructive distribution described above). If, however, the conversion ratio of the class B stock were subject to full adjustment to reflect the distribution of stock to class A shareholders, the distribution of stock dividends on the class A stock would not increase the proportionate interest of the class A shareholders in the assets and earnings and profits of the corporation and such distribution would not be a distribution to which section 301 applies. (iii) Effective date. This Example 15 applies to stock issued on or after the date final regulations are filed with the Federal Register . For previously issued stock, see 26 CFR part 1 edition revised April 1, 1994, §1.305&hyph;3(e) Example (15) . Par. 3. Section 1.305&hyph;5 is amended as follows: 1. Paragraph (b) is revised. 2. In paragraph (d), remove the parentheses from the numbers in the headings for Examples (1) through (9) . 3. Paragraph (d), Examples 4, 5, and 7 are revised. 4. The revisions read as follows: §1.305&hyph;5 Distributions on preferred stock. * * * * * (b) Redemption premium _(1) In general. If a corporation issues preferred stock that may be redeemed under the circumstances described in this paragraph (b) at a price higher than the issue price, the difference (the redemption premium) is treated under section 305(c) as a constructive distribution (or series of constructive distributions) of additional stock on preferred stock that is taken into account under principles similar to the principles of section 1272(a). However, constructive distribution treatment does not result under this paragraph if the redemption premium does not exceed a de minimis amount, as determined under the principles of section 1273(a)(3). (2) Mandatory redemption or holder put. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to stock if the issuer is required to redeem the stock at a specified time or the holder has the option to require the issuer to redeem the stock.
