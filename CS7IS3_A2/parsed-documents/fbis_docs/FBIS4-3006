Xiao Biguang, a professor of Chinese literature at Beijing University, was detained by six officers from the ministries of Public Security and State Security at his home on Tuesday. His home was searched and several books and manuscripts were confiscated, a relative said. Prior to his detention, Professor Xiao, 32, had been under constant police surveillance for about week. He is being held under a "shelter and investigation" order issued by the Beijing Public Security Bureau and has not been allowed visits from his family. The police did not say why he was being detained. The detention order simply stated that he had engaged in "illegal activities" related to State Council Document No 56, issued in 1980, an administrative decree on the use of "shelter and investigation", which technically has no legal basis. However, Professor Xiao was a friend and colleague of the well- known jurist and labour activist, Yuan Hongbing, who was detained last month. It is believed Professor Xiao might have been detained in connection with Mr Yuan's case and or his work in the official Protestant Church. Mr Yuan was detained on March 3 in the southwestern city of Guizhou and has been kept incommunicado ever since. His wife has been to the Ministry of State Security in Beijing four times to inquire about her husband's whereabouts but officials at the ministry refused to discuss the case. When she tried to contact the Guizhou State Security Bureau, officials denied knowledge of Mr Yuan's arrest. Another labour activist, Zhou Guoqiang, who was detained in Beijing at the same time as Mr Yuan has also been refused contact with his relatives. Meanwhile, a government spokesman has defended the crackdown on dissent saying all those detained or arrested in the past six weeks were not democracy activists but "criminals" many of whom were still on parole. "While such criminals are on parole, the Chinese judicial authorities have the right to take action against them," Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said yesterday. Mr Shen criticised Western politicians and journalists for concentrating on a few famous dissidents such as Wei Jingsheng and not looking at the wider human rights situation in China. The case of Mr Wei was not a human rights problem, he said. "Human rights is not about releasing criminals and other irrelevant issues." Mr Shen said many Western journalists did not understand who Mr Wei really was but when asked if he himself had met the former Democracy Wall activist, he dodged the issue. "Just meeting someone is not necessarily the best way to understand them," he said.
