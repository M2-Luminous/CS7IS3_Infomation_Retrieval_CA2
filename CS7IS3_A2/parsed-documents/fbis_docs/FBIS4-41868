The proposal was made at his meeting on Wednesday with First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets who welcomed the idea saying "Russia should not lose long-standing relations with Chinese partners especially in those industries where it has good chances and advantageous positions". Soskovets called on China to "specify its interests in trade and economic, as well as in military and technical cooperation". Russia is "actively opening new markets now, including that of weapons", he said. Qian responded by saying that "trade and economic relations and military-technical ties comprise a very important part of our relations in general". Although the Chinese minister said trade relations are developing successfully between the two countries and the turnover reached eight billion dollars last year, he opposed the so-called "shuttle trade" when individual traders fill the Russian market with low- quality Chinese goods. He proposed to replace them by reliable and major companies. Soskovets, however, said that he can give no guarantees about any of the companies advertising themselves on the Russian TV. Soskovets expressed big interest in the Chinese experience of economic reforms and especially in creating free trade zones. "The Chinese experience is of great interest to us", he said.
