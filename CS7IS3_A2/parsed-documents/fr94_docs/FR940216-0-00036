Potential impacts of expected seasonal fishing for pollock on pollock stocks, marine mammals, and stocks and species taken as bycatch in directed pollock fisheries; 5. The need to obtain fishery data during all or part of the fishing year; 6. Effects on operating costs and gross revenues; 7. The need to spread fishing effort over the year, minimize gear conflicts, and allow participation by various elements of the groundfish fleet and other fisheries; 8. Potential allocative effects among users and indirect effects on coastal communities; and 9. Other biological and socioeconomic information that affects the consistency of seasonal pollock harvests with the goals and objectives of the FMP. A discussion of these factors relative to the roe and non-roe seasonal allowances (45 and 55 percent of the TAC, respectively) was contained in the final 1993 specifications for BSAI groundfish (58 FR 8703, February 17, 1993). Considerations under these factors remain unchanged from 1993 given that the relative seasonal allowances for 1993 and 1994 are the same. Apportionment of Pollock TAC to the Non-Pelagic Trawl Gear Fishery Regulations under §675.24(c)(2) authorize the Secretary, in consultation with the Council, to limit the amount of pollock TAC that may be taken in the directed fishery for pollock using non-pelagic trawl gear. This authority is intended to reduce the amount of halibut and crab bycatch that occurs in non-pelagic trawl operations. Regulations were implemented during 1993 to more effectively limit the bycatch of halibut and crab when directed fishing for pollock with non-pelagic trawl gear is closed (58 FR 39680, July 26, 1993). Given these regulatory constraints, the Council did not recommend limiting the amount of pollock TAC that may be taken in the 1994 directed fishery for pollock by vessels using non-pelagic trawl gear. NMFS concurs in the Council's recommendation, and no limit on the amount of pollock TAC that may be taken in the directed fishery for pollock using non-pelagic trawl gear is specified. Allocation of the Pacific Cod TAC At its June 1993 meeting, the Council adopted Amendment 24 to the FMP, which authorizes fixed allocations of the Pacific cod TAC among vessels using trawl gear, hook-and-line gear or pot gear, and jig gear. A final rule implementing Amendment 24 was published in the Federal Register on January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4009). That final rule specifies gear allocations of the 1994 Pacific cod TAC and seasonal apportionments of the amount of Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear. Sablefish Gear Allocation Regulations under §675.24(c)(1) require that sablefish TACs for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands subareas be divided between trawl and hook-and-line/pot gear fisheries. Gear allocations of TACs are specified in the following proportions: Bering Sea subarea: trawl gear_50 percent; hook-and-line/pot gear_50 percent, and Aleutian Islands subarea: trawl gear_25 percent; hook-and-line/pot gear_75 percent (Table 4).

The sum of both ITAC gear shares in a subarea is equal to the ITAC for that subarea in Table 1. 2Includes Bogoslof district. Allocation of Prohibited Species Catch (PSC) Limits for Crab, Halibut, and Herring PSC limits of red king crab and C. bairdi Tanner crab in Bycatch Limitation Zones (50 CFR 675.2) of the Bering Sea subarea, and for Pacific halibut throughout the BSAI area are specified under §675.21(a). At this time, the 1994 PSC limits are:
