[Text] Alexander Shokhin, Minister of the Economy, may become the most influential and powerful figure at the highest body of executive authority. Confidential sources have revealed that the government has prepared a draft resolution on the merger of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations (MFER) with the Ministry of the Economy (ME) of Russia. If this happens, the Ministry of the Economy, which is already the most powerful government department in Russia and is not accidentally compared to the former State Planning Committee, will get the most prized piece of the Russian economy as its subunit. In this way Alexander Shokhin will become a figure almost as influential as Viktor Chernomyrdin -- with all the political, economic and other consequences arising therefrom. Several circumstances that have made Viktor Chernomyrdin, who maintains good relations with the MFER's present-day head Oleg Davydov, come to favor this variant. Despite the premier's sympathies for Davydov, Russia's foreign economic activities cannot be described as too successful. In January-February of this year foreign trade turnover declined by 8 percent (12.7 billion dollars) in comparison with the same period in 1993. Exports, it is true, increased by nearly 3 percent, but this growth took place against the backdrop of the continued fall of world prices. Imports dropped by more than 27 percent (3.8 billion dollars). According to eyewitness reports, these facts are often reported to the premier by vice-premier Alexander Shokhin, who, as a result of the latest redivision of powers in the Council of Ministers, supervises this department. Relationships between Shokhin and Davydov are characterized as "very strained." Sergei Glazyev, who was forced to resign his post of Minister of Foreign Economic Relations last year, and now heads the State Duma's Committee for Economic Policy, sent Viktor Chernomyrdin an official document with the results of the parlimentary hearings, sharply critical of Oleg Davydov's work. It is characteristic that his committee's recommendations are based on the postulate that in 1992 the MFER under Glazyev's guidance developed a plan for foreign economic activities, which is not being followed now. As claimed by MFER employees, there were no significant differences between Glazyev and his deputy Davydov at that time. Today, however, the former minister, on the basis of parliamentary hearings, has presented a serious bill to his former subordinate on points dealing with accounting and control over foreign economic activities which he himself did not manage to organize during his tenure. Of special interest is that at the end of the recommendations Glazyev suggests on behalf of his committee that the government "examine the possibility of the MFER's merger with those subunits of the Ministry of the Economy of Russia which deal with foreign economic activities." The premier's decision is unlikely to be seriously affected by the recommendations of the parliamentary committee. But they are significant on the political plane: for the first time Sergei Glazyev, who has until now acted independently, demonstrates his alliance with Alexander Shokhin, and, moreover, on a fundamental issue. This may indicate a growth in the "shadow" authority of Shokhin who in the event of the MFER being stripped of its independence would then become the most powerful and influential figure at the highest executive body. If this happens, it will perhaps be possible to consider the path traversed by Alexander Shokhin during four years from being the Minister of Labor in Silayev's government, the connections he acquired and the prestige he earned during this time both at home and abroad to be the standard even in such a fantastic country as ours. Forecast of Foreign Economic Activities Based On The Figures of the MFER of Russia Foreign trade in 1994 is expected to equal 70.5 billion dollars, that is, practically at the level of 1993. Export. The overall volume of export is predicted to equal 44 billion dollars (43 billion dollars in 1993). The export of raw material commodities for state needs in 1994 is envisaged to equal a billion dollars or 25.5 of the total volume of export of raw material goods, technical assistance -- 1 billion dollars. Imports. The total volume of imports in 1994 may come to 26.5 billion dollars (27 billion dollars in 1993). The forecast of the import of basic commodities and services of vital importance for the country's economy and social sphere, given the funds of the federal budget, is estimated at 4 billion dollars. Moreover, in 1994, it is likely that goods will be purchased to fulfil the federal raw material programs and other state needs. The import of raw materials and supplies on account of the state budget is expected to amount to 1.8 billion dollars, plant and equipment -- 2 billion dollars, building services -- 0.2 billion dollars.
