The interior relations minister explained this unit will not be independent from the police. However, he continued, it will be formed by agents who will receive special training to handle demonstrations, because the riot police equipment gear is currently insufficient. Escovar Salom stated this decision was made because the government will no longer tolerate violence, where buses are burned down and store windows broken. He stated his opposition to police using their fire power in student distrubances, but he also opposed street disturbances without controls by authorities. [Begin Escovar Salom recording] Demonstrations must be conducted by observing a particular behavior. I explained to student leaders that they must carry out their actions peacefully; I asked them to assist not only the government but also Venezuelan society. Regarding firearms, I don't think anyone in Venezuela wants to see police using their firepower irresponsibly. Therefore, we must observe certain principles. The police weapons are called regulation weapons; they can only be used in keeping with police regulations. Now there must be a specialized and trained corps to fight street disturbances. [end recording] Escovar Salom termed the rumors of his alleged resignation from the Ministry of Internal Relations mere speculation. He reported he will soon present before Congress the Bill replacing the Law on Hoodlums and Thugs, which has been in force in the country since the times of former President Eliazar Lopez Contreras. Finally, Escovar Salom reiterated categorically the government will use the public force to prevent the food boycott of Caracas, planned by a group of union members of Inerca [expansion unknown] who oppose the restructuring of Coche Market by an intervention board.
