Bolkestein believes that the political leader of a party must not shirk the responsibility of leading a government. Four days ago, Bolkestein stated that he attached more importance to membership in the Chamber than holding ministerial or prime ministerial office. At a meeting in Alphen aan den Rijn, he stated yesterday evening that the VVD would not be bringing "any issues that can not be negotiated" into the formation of a new government. The VVD is seeking cutbacks of 17 billion guilders during the next term of government. If it is less than 15 billion, Bolkestein states that the VVD would withdraw its support.
