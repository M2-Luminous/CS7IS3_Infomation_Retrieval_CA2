Guns, tanks, and other combat equipment has also remained at the dpots, first because no orders have been given and, second, because there are no fuels or lubricants. It was for this reason that the movement of combat vehicles has been stopped or reduced to the absolute minimum. To study instruments on tanks, for example, they are not started up but simply given an electric charge. In other words, the Ukrainian army has found itself in the grips of an energy crisis, just like the whole of the country's national economic complex. Firing from an ordinary rifle is virtually the only accessible element of fire training. Yet over the same period rumors have spread in Ukraine that large-scale military exercises are being conducted in Crimea. [Crimean Supreme Council Chairman N. Bagrov] Any exercises on Crimean territory are coordinated with the Supreme Council and the Presidium. I repeat that the reports you mention are disinformation. No exercises are being conducted on Crimea's territory.
