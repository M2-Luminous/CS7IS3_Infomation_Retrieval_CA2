However, the unit commander has organized a 24-hour tour of duty by the unit personnel, maintaining regular contact with the local military and civil authorities. What caused such precautions? "The hospital base personnel, where citizens of our state are serving, decided to take an oath of loyalty to the people of Ukraine," Aleksey Yutsyuk, deputy commander of the Ukraina cruiser, told UKRINFORM-TASS. "But Captain First Rank Halaychev, the commander of the Black Sea Fleet ship repair and construction team, decided to ban the oath-taking by force. He arrived at the base, together with a subunit from the Slava missile cruiser sailors, after which his subordinates broke into the supply depot and began to load equipment and medicine stored there onto their vehicle. However, servicemen of the neighboring Ukrainian unit prevented the illegal removal of the fleet property." The hospital base personnel eventually did take an oath of loyalty to the people of Ukraine. Their commanders are currently drawing up papers to report an unauthorized attempt to seize the unit's property to the Procurator's Office.
