Commenting on this NODONG SINMUN today says: The remarks of Hata who had reprimanded the former justice minister, Nagano, for describing the Pacific War as "a liberation war" shows his double- dealing tactics. The analyst continues: The outcries of Japanese cabinet ministers distorting history show once again the aggressive quality of the Hata cabinet. The Japanese militarists who regard the restoration of the past policy of aggression as the strategy of the state set it as an important objective to restore the old colonial empire in Asia. Having completed political, economic and military preparations for overseas aggression through the efforts to turn Japan into a military power and step up her nuclear armament, enact an "emergency case law" and a "wartime mobilization law", the Japanese ruling quarters are intensifying propaganda to mobilize the people in a war. The key point here is to obscure the character of the past war of aggression and whitewash and justify it. The Japanese authorities reveal their intention to repeat the history of aggression when they affirmatively assess the past war of aggression and avoid the liquidation of the crimes of the blood- stained past. Japan schemes to realise its dominationist ambition worldwide with strength by securing the permanent membership of the U.N. Security Council and accelerating her nuclear armament. Japan must act with discretion, mindful that overseas aggression and war will lead her to her grave.
