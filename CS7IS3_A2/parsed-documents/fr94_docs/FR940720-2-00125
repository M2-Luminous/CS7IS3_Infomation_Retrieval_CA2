FR940720-2-00125 FR940720-2-00071 The Decision On April 26, 1994 (59 FR 21791), the PBGC published a request from The Home Team Limited Partnership (``the Buyer'') for an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) with respect to its October 4, 1993 purchase of The Orioles, Inc. (``the Seller''). No comments were received in response to the notice. According to the request, the Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan (the ``Plan'') was established and is maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between professional major league baseball teams and the Major League Baseball Players Association. The major league clubs have established the Major Leagues Central Fund (the ``Central Fund'') pursuant to the ``Major League Agreement in re Major Leagues Central Fund.'' Under this agreement, contributions to the Plan for all participating employers are paid by the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball from the Central Fund on behalf of each participating employer in satisfaction of the employer's contribution obligation arising under the Plan's funding agreement. The monies in the Central Fund are derived directly from (i) gate receipts from All-Star games, (ii) radio and television revenues from World Series, League Championships, intradivision play-offs and All-Star games, and (iii) certain other radio and television revenues from regular and exhibition games, including those from foreign broadcasts. The Buyer and the Seller entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement for the Buyer to purchase substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the Seller relating to the business employing the employees covered by the Plan. The final closing of the transaction occurred on October 4, 1993. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Buyer assumed the obligation to contribute to the Plan for substantially the same number of contribution base units as the Seller was obligated to contribute to the Plan. The Seller has agreed to be secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability should the Buyer withdraw from the Plan within five years of the sale. The amount of the bond/escrow that would be required under section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA beginning as of April 1, 1994, is $1,401,449 (the annual contribution the Seller made for the Plan year preceding the Plan year in which the sale of assets occurred). The estimated amount of the withdrawal liability that the Seller would incur if not for Section 4204 is $7,672,235. In support of the waiver request the Buyer stated that: The Plan is funded directly from the Revenues which are paid from the Central Fund directly to the [Plan's] Trust without first passing through the hands of any of the Employers. Therefore, the Plan enjoys a substantial degree of security *␣*␣* A change in ownership of an Employer does not affect the obligation *␣*␣* to fund the Plan *␣*␣*. Nor does a change in ownership in any way create the possibility that there will be difficulty in collecting Plan contributions due from any new Employer. Based on the facts of this case and the representations and statements made in connection with the request for an exemption, the PBGC has determined that an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement is warranted, in that it would more effectively carry out the purposes of title IV of ERISA and would not significantly increase the risk of financial loss to the Plan. Therefore, the PBGC hereby grants the request for an exemption for the bond/escrow requirement. The granting of an exemption or variance from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204 (a)(1)(B) does not constitute a finding by the PBGC that the transaction satisfies the other requirements of section 4204(a)(1). The determination of whether the transaction satisfies such other requirements is a determination to be made by the Plan sponsor. Issued at Washington, D.C., on this 14th day of July 1994.
