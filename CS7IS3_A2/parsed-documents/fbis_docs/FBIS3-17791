As our correspondent has learned, deputies have focused their attention on the monetary-credit policy. Probably, we will be able to tell you about the adopted decisions, however, only approximately, because this issue, according to the parliament speaker, is secret. This day can be considered, to certain degree, momentous in the work of the 13th session of the Supreme Soviet. Deputies have finally scheduled the presidential elections -- this event has been scheduled for 23 June 1994, for a regular working weekday. However, it used to be a regular working day -- it will be proclaimed a holiday, and we will have to make our choice. At today's session, deputies also discussed legislation on the Belarusian Constitutional Court and adopted a resolution on implementing it.
