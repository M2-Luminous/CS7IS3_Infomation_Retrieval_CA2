Everyone knows that the CPC has cut 1 million troops from the Army over the past several years, and it is alleged that the cuts will continue this year, but military expenditure has greatly increased at the same time. Where is the money going? The CPC's official explanation is that they will greatly increase remuneration for officers and men, and, in particular, increase wages and benefits for senior military officers to allow high wages to sustain honesty, solve the problem of servicemen's living conditions, tackle the phenomenon where servicemen's living standards are lower than civilians as a result of economic reform, and upgrade servicemen's social status, which is far lower than before. In fact, the above-mentioned explanation is a superficial reason. This 10 billion yuan cannot all be spent on "improving the standard of living of servicemen." A large portion of the money will be used to fund research and the manufacture of an aircraft carrier. [passage omitted] Neither Affordable Nor Technologically Viable Construction of an aircraft carrier involves combining the most advanced modern science and technology. Crucial problems, such as ship-borne aircraft, antisubmarine technology, and air defense radar, are the weak links of military technology in China, and judged from current standards, it seems that a breakthrough will not come easily. Therefore, although China can produce 10,000-ton cargo ships, it cannot build an aircraft carrier. In its attempts to buy one, China has already contacted several countries, and a case widely known to the international community was the negotiations to purchase one from Ukraine. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, one of the former republics, told the CPC it was willing to sell an unfinished aircraft carrier to Beijing. Tian Zhen, president of China's Naval Command College, led a delegation to bargain with Ukraine, which had asked for $2.4 billion. For a "Kuznetsov" class aircraft carrier, which has strong attack ability and good self-defense capability, this price should be considered fair to the Chinese Navy, which still does not have the ability to build and organize an integrated task force, this type of Soviet aircraft carrier, which has a very strong combat ability in itself, is perhaps more suitable than a U.S. aircraft carrier. But they failed to sign an official contract on the deal in the end. Minister of defense, General Chi Haotian, said during a trip to Malaysia that this was because China's defense budget did not have the money to buy it. Price was perhaps one reason, but the main reason, according to sources, was that Russia refused to provide the electronic equipment needed for the ship. During a trip to the United States, Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, was asked about the sale of the aircraft carrier "Varyag" to the Chinese Navy, and he categorically denied the deal. The issue of purchasing an aircraft carrier has subsided since the denials by both sides. Purchase of a Retired and Damaged Australian Ship at Low Price After the negotiations with Ukraine ran aground, China contacted the Australian military and bought a small, retired aircraft carrier from them. Because it was bought at the price of "scrap steel from a dismantled ship," the price was ideal. Not only was this ship very old, but it was also weak in combat ability, and hence, was dumped at Guangzhou's Huangpo Military Academy, for the viewing pleasure of naval officers and personnel specializing in research on aircraft carriers, and for the first time a real aircraft carrier had been provided by China's military to relevant personnel for technological research. For communist China's research personnel, who had only seen pictures of such a huge vessel, this retired Australian ship was first-hand teaching material. Internal Exhibition of Defense Weapons Frustrates People The lack of knowledge of aircraft carriers within the Chinese military can be illustrated by the following incident. In November 1990, a military museum in a western suburb of Beijing held an internal "exhibition of the most advanced defense weapons," and the organizers were the General Staff Headquarters and the State Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense. The exhibition was only open to senior military officers, industrial circles, and important political figures. During the exhibition, a model of an aircraft carrier and models of an carrier-led task force attracted a large number of visitors, among them Air Force Commander Wang Hai and Navy Deputy Commander Li Jing, as well as Ding Henggao, Xie Guang, and Ye Zhendai, who are respectively minister and vice minister of the State Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. The visitors learned that the construction of a carrier-led task force not only required various technologies, but also a handsome amount of money. Even the construction of a task force led by a medium-sized Soviet "Kiev-class" aircraft carrier would require more than 5 billion yuan. A guide at the exhibition gave a detailed explanation of the aircraft carrier concept and the necessary support facilities; afterwards, the visitors, who included the most senior military officers in communist China, realized that the construction of an aircraft carrier is never simple and that it was a far cry from the current technology level possessed by Communist China. "Walking on Two Legs" To buy, no money; to build, no technology. Facing this reality, the CPC decided to "walk on two legs," that is, on the one hand, continue contacts with foreign arms dealers, negotiate the purchase of an aircraft carrier and supporting weapons and facilities, and buy little by little; on the other hand, muster military experts, scientists, and technologists to tackle "key problems" in researching and manufacturing an aircraft carrier. CPC's Ultimate Goal Is To Build Aircraft Carrier Itself Since the 1980's, in the area of weapons purchases, the CPC has obviously laid emphasis on facilities related to aircraft carriers. As early as 1985, the Chinese Navy bought the "DUUX-5 Sonar" from France, and used it in its nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines and research on carrier-based antisubmarine technology. In 1986, Communist China purchased "towed array sonar" from the United States; and in 1988, it approached the Italian military in an attempt to buy a comprehensive sonar combat system and multifunctional control board from the Italian Navy. The above-mentioned activities were all carried out before the CPC formulated its long-term plan to develop an aircraft carrier, and this shows that from the every beginning, the CPC has inclined to build a series of aircraft-carrier-type weapons and equipment itself and has strengthened research in this area. According to information disclosed by sources, in the process of manufacturing a series of weapons and equipment for aircraft carriers, the weakest technological links facing the CPC are early warning aircraft and air-to-air refueling. During the Gulf war, the United States' E-2C early warning aircraft successfully directed Saudi Arabian fighters to shoot down two Iraqi Mirages in just 10 seconds. This U.S. early warning plane has since become a model for similar kinds of aircraft, and the CPC has frequently hinted at its interest in this kind of aircraft to the U.S. Government and military. But because of the significance of the matter, which is too sensitive, and out of global strategic considerations, the United States has never agreed to the CPC's requests. With no way to go, the CPC approached Britain, saying it was interested in buying the "Nimrod" anti-submarine early warning aircraft, which was still under research. Research on "Nimrod" has already cost the British Government 900 million pounds, and the test results still fail to satisfy the military. Mrs. Thatcher became angry and ordered a halt to the testing, and went to the United States to buy readily available early warning planes. Then, the CPC came and said it was interested in buying the plane, and the suggestion was undoubtedly a chance for Britain to revive the project, which made the British Government and arms manufacturers extremely happy. But the matter has been stalled for several years, and there is still no result. If an agreement cannot be reached, perhaps the reason stems again from the CPC's "political considerations," and it seems that the intensifying political row in recent years between China on the one hand, and Britain and the Hong Kong government on the other hand, has caused the CPC drop its intention to purchase. Aircraft Carrier Overall Planning Group Drafts Overall Plan In order to meet the need of the overall plan to develop an aircraft carrier, a few years ago, the CPC founded a group to take charge of the development of an aircraft carrier; the group was headed by Liu Huaqing, a former commander of the Navy and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, and included senior naval officers, such as Navy Commander Zhang Lianzhong and Deputy Commander Xing Yongning. According to information revealed by internal circles, at present, the group has decided to use the Chinese-built J-8 II fighter planes as ship-borne aircraft and the J-6 as an air-to-air refueling aircraft. The J-8 II, after its successful landing on a simulated deck at Lushun Naval Base in April 1987, has been chosen as one type of ship-borne aircraft, however, according to information, the CPC is carrying out research on another type, which is lighter and has all-weather capability and more advanced avionics, to replace the J-8 II in the future. Although the J-7 fighter bomber, which is equipped with British-made "Spey" engines and navigational systems, the "Yingji 8" air-to-surface guided missiles, and the "C-101" anti-submarine guided missile, was a new product of the Xian Aircraft Company in 1987, the CPC authorities only list it as a naval "shore-based aircraft" and do not consider it a ship-borne aircraft; this indicates that the military probably has a better type of ship-borne aircraft under research or being built. CPC Begins Propaganda for Building Aircraft Carrier The military disclosed that not long ago, the first "naval work meeting" since the founding of communist China was held in Beijing, where the senior level reviewed naval policy and fixed the Navy's development strategy for the 1990's and the early 21st century. Within that plan, the development and construction of an aircraft carrier was set as the main military goal of the early part of the next century. Recently, in order to support the arrangements of the senior level, relevant magazines on the mainland have carried articles on aircraft carriers to show support from "public opinion." HAIYANG ZHISHI [Ocean Knowledge] specifically opened a column on the issue of "China's aircraft carriers" to discuss the necessity of building China's own aircraft carriers; HANGHAI [Navigation] said that "letters and submissions come from every corner of the country" "suggesting the construction of China's aircraft carrier." This is to show the people's extensive support for the CPC's plan to build an aircraft carrier. A person in charge of propaganda for national defense in communist China wrote down his wishful thinking: "If we buy an aircraft carrier from a foreign country, we will have to pay $4-5 billion, and this is obviously impossible. However, if everyone in China gave 4 yuan, then 4.4 billion yuan could be collected from across the country, and this could build a 40,000-ton medium-sized aircraft carrier for the Navy, as well as a task force which could fight." This may be the true reason why the CPC has carried out propaganda. Once again it wants to appropriate military expenditure from the people in a disguised form. "Century-Transcending Personnel" Are Being Trained On the other hand, the training of senior officers for an aircraft carrier is busily underway. The diary of the commander of the North Sea Fleet, now no longer viewed as classified information, shows that at Lushun Naval Base in April 1987, "today, naval airmen will practice landing and taking off on a simulated aircraft carrier flight deck." "Chief test pilot Li Guoqiang has spent the past two years preparing for this project." In 1988, Guangzhou's Naval Shipping Institute opened a "class to train flying teams for the fleet," to make plans to train senior personnel such as captains. The president of the institute, surnamed Yao, said that the selection of a captain for an aircraft carrier from among the ranks of excellent pilots was a brand new concept, as well as one which was unprecedented in the naval academies. The future captain of an aircraft carrier could not just know about ships and not about flying. Yao, who is a rear admiral, confirmed that this unprecedented method had been proposed by Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, and had won unanimous consensus among those in charge of the Navy. As an expedient measure before an aircraft carrier is available, the CPC began work in 1988 to build a naval base on Yongxing Isle, one of the Xisha Islands, and this will reduce the voyage from the mainland to the Nansha Islands [Spratlys] by half, to 600 km. Although the naval base on Yongxing Isle is mainly designed to strengthen sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, if the CPC really has its own aircraft carrier by the early part of the next century, then Taiwan, across the Strait, will be the first to feel the repercussions, and perhaps this is also one reason why the CPC is so eager to build a carrier.
