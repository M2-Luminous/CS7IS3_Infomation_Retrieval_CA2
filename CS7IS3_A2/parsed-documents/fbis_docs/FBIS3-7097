Minister Yi made these remarks to stress that the ROK and the United States are all prepared for any emergency and are confident that they can meet any provocation of the North and to give a powerful warning to North Korea. This is the first declaration that even though the government adheres to the principle of peaceful reunification, it has a plan not only to defend ourselves but to pursue even reunification with armed forces [muryoktongilggaji mirobuchil] depending on the state of the provocation. This strategic concept stated by Minister Yi is based on a strategy of punitive retaliation contained in the "ROK-U.S. Combined Operations Plan (OP 5027). That is, this is a five-stage strategic concept in which if North Korea launches a preemptive attack, the government will not merely deter the enemy but conquer Pyongyang, isolate the North Korean regime, and enter into the stage of North-South reunification. North Korea has deployed 8,400 long-range cannon and 2,400 multi-warheaded missiles within 100 km of the DMZ at present. It reportedly has developed or is developing "Taepodong-1 and -2" missiles, in addition to the Nodong-1 and -2 and the Scud ground-to- ground missiles. In particular, it has hidden in underground tunnels aircraft for transporting commando units to infiltrate into the rear area when it launches a southward invasion and has beefed up the antiair batteries in Yongbyon, where there are nuclear reactors, from five to 47. In preparation against this, the United States has recently deployed five of the latest radar tracking devices and put areas north of the DMZ under comprehensive 24-hour surveillance and even mapped out a plan to attack those batteries in an emergency. The five-stage ROK-U.S. combined operations plan goes like this: In the prewar stage (first stage), if the ROK and the United States detect dangerous signs from North Korea, they will immediately call in the rapid deterrent forces (FDO). At that time, "Defcon (Defense Condition) 3" will be issued, and the Armed Forces will assume a combat ready posture [jontu chunbi taese]. This is because Seoul is a mere 40 km away from the DMZ and we have a mere 24- to 76-hour warning time for a North Korean attack. Then, North Korea will bomb frontline units in a concentrated manner and send commando units to harass the rear of Seoul. As a result, major roads will be crowded with refugees, who will serve as a decisive obstacle to the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces' northward movements. This is a second-stage situation. At that time, North Korea will infiltrate ground forces deployed along the DMZ into the South and attack Seoul in a concentrated manner by using Scud and Nodong-1 and -2 missiles. In response, the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces will attack the central area of North Korea, advancing infantry units, and fighter planes by using their superior air fire power and Mistral, Hawk, and Nike missiles and intercept incoming missiles by using Patriot missiles. This means that the defensive strategic concept which had been effective up until the mid-seventies and in which the ROK would launch a counterattack after abandoning Seoul has been replaced by a new concept in which the ROK would "repel North Korea north of Seoul." At around this time, the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Carl Vinson of the 7th U.S. Fleet will be deployed to the East Sea [Sea of Japan] and strike the enemy's rear area in a concentrated manner. At that time, AWACS early-warning planes and antisubmarine patrol planes (P-3C) will fly through the skies over the Korean peninsula, conduct aerial surveillance not only over North Korea, but also over areas of Russia and China, detect infiltrating aircraft and submarines in advance, and instruct the ground on shooting them down. In the third stage, the armed forces will annihilate the major combat forces of North Korea, break through the DMZ, conduct large-scale landing operations, and advance northward. At that time, the ROK and the United States will expand the frontline toward the Chongchon River, north of Pyongyang. However, in this strategic concept, the ROK and the United States left the issue of whether they will advance toward the Yalu River at this stage for further deliberations depending on the situation. No decision has been made on whether the 400,000 U.S. troops which will be reinforced with troops from the U.S. mainland will participate in the northward advance. The next stage is one of isolation. The forces will completely isolate Pyongyang from the rest of North Korea and establish a military rule, which includes civilian controls [chumintongjedung kunsatongchirul silsihanda]. The final, fifth stage will be a postwar phase. At this stage, the ROK will take the initiative to achieve reunification on the Korean peninsula.
