Against the background of countries in the West, where unemployment is several times higher, the situation is quite favorable. (American economists consider 5 percent of the economically active population to be a normal level of unemployment; only if unemployment exceeds this limit does it begin to have a harmful effect on the economy of the state or a region.) The level of unemployment in Russia as a whole is not high at present, but some individual regions have already gone past the critical point. The following have gone beyond the 5-percent threshold: Ivanovo, Kostroma, Pskov, and Yaroslavl oblasts and the republics of Dagestan, Kalmykia, Mordovia, and Chuvashia. Arkhangelsk and Kirov oblasts and the republics of Adygeya, Ingushetia, Northern Osetia, Udmurtia, and Chechnya are coming closer to that point. Unemployment in the Russian Federation (Beginning of 1994) There are various reasons why regions are led into such a situation. The Northern Caucasus Republic, a region which traditionally has a surplus of labor, has been exporting manpower for a long time not only to the capital's markets, but for construction organizations and seasonal work in practically every part of Russia. Many of the unemnployed persons from the Caucasus are working quite successfully far from home and are more a subject of interest to the tax authorities than social security organs. Some 60 percent of the unemployed in the Northern Caucasus are under 30 years of age. The ranks of criminal gangs and those involved in illegal businesses throughout Russia are increasing precisely because of this category. Unemployment in this region is reflected in crime from Kaliningrad to Sakhalin. And for this reason, the creation of jobs in the Northern Caucasus is more a struggle with the source of personnel for organized crime. The precipitous production decline in light industry, shipbuilding, and sectors of the defense complex has been the principal cause of the rise in unemployment in Central Russia and the Volga region. The crisis in domestic light industry led to mass firings of personnel in Ivanovo, Yaroslavl, and Kostroma oblasts, and the high concentration of enterprises in these oblasts led to a sharp rise in unemployment. The situation is becoming critical. Light industry enterprises do not have effective sectorial management organs which could lobby for their interests in the government. As a result, local administrations have been forced to take extreme measures to surmount the crisis and the unemployment which this crisis has caused. The hasty extension of preferential loans and reduction of local tax rates have not checked the rate of decline, but they have had a substantial effect on the regions' budgets. As a result, the budget deficit was 15 billion rubles [R] in Ivanovo Oblast, R20 billion in Kostroma Oblast, and only Yaroslavl Oblast made ends meet, according to the results for 1993. The average wage in these regions is also lagging behind substantially. In Ivanovo Oblast, it is 60 percent of the average Russian wage and one of the lowest in the Russian Federation. (According to Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics] data, the average wage in Russia in January was R134,161.) Most of the unemployed in Arkhangelsk, Vladimir, Kirov, and Pskov oblasts and republics in the Volga region and Udmurtia were employees in the military-industrial complex who were discharged. The difficult situation in the defense enterprises led to a reduction of over 700,000 persons in 1993, and a substantial number of them were added to the army of unemployed. The "militarized" regions with a high proportion of the VPK [military-industrial complex] in the structure of industry (in Udmurtia, for example, every fourth resident was employed in defense complex enteprises) have suffered the most. A further reduction of military orders stipulated by the budget for 1994 will lead to new large-scale dismissals, which will aggravate the acute social tension in these regions. The rate of increase in unemployment varies in different areas as well. The highest rates of increase are observed where unemployment is already higher than the average level in Russia. In 1993, unemployment in Mordovia rose by three times as much, in Kalmykia by 2.4 times as much, in Ivanovo Oblast by 2.2 times as much, and in Chuvashia and Udmurtia by two times as much. But unemployment has declined since the beginning of the year in the cities with the lowest level of unemployment (under 0.5 percent)--Moscow and St. Petersburg. Depressed regions are being formed where a precipitous production recession is combined with a high level of unemployment and a low average wage. In due course, the depression is deepened and negative socioeconomic processes begin to intensify each other. A 1-percent rise in unemployment in a depressed region leads to a regional decline of 2.5 percent in the gross national product. One-sixth of Russia's population is living in depressed regions today, and an effective system for their support needs to be established. Available experience in overcoming the structural crisis in industry should form the basis of the program. Nizhegorod, Samara, and Saratov oblasts, where the proportion of the military-industrial complex is no less than in Vladimir or Kirov oblasts, have resolved the problem by close integration between industrial and commercial structures. The use of commercial bank loans to supplement enterprises' working capital, targeted financing, and the formation of industrial-financial groups--this is far from a complete list of promising types of collaboration. Incidentally, it is characteristic that most of the territories which are going through a depression are lagging behind in the voucher rating at privatization auctions as well. A collapse is a collapse. On all points! Depressed Regions in Russia The opportunities of federal organs of authority are very limited today. By transferring to the regions a substantial part of its powers, the state has relinquished a significant part of its obligations. The transfer of 90 percent of employment fund resources to the regions has led to the point that the government has deprived itself of the opportunity to redistribute funds to the most needy territories. Because of the situation that has taken shape, it would have been sensible to make the federal organs of authority responsible for redistributing all the employment fund assets and provide a favorable environment for investments aimed at creating new jobs in the depressed regions.
