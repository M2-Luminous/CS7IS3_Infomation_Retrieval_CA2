The examination must be held with international observers, Interfax learnt from sources in the Georgian Prosecutor General's Office. A Georgian Security Ministry spokesman has told Interfax that the arrival in the republic of international experts and members of the Gamsakhurdia family is possible shortly. Zviadists who control the village of Djikhashkari in western Georgia where Gamsakhurdia is presumably buried are not so far allowing representatives of the present authorities or journalists to the village. The village is guarded, Interfax was told, by a large group of Zviadists who are armed with tanks, artillery pieces and rocket launchers. As it has become known to Interfax from unofficial sources, representatives of the Georgian authorities are negotiating the issue with Zviadists. The talks have provided no results yet because the authorities demand the extradition of Gamsakhurdia's body and Zviadists' disarmament.
