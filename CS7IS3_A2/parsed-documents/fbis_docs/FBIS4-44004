No statement was made on the SPD's goals and the speech did not say anything about possible coalitions. The question is no longer whether the SPD is tending toward a red-green coalition, but whether it will expand such an alliance into a popular front by including the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]. Scharping also failed to provide a clear answer on the party's attitude toward the PDS. Instead, the SPD just ran everything down: German unification, the economic upturn, and the government's foreign policy successes. Scharping's government program contains promises that would cost 60 billion German marks to realize, but the candidate for chancellor does not mention where the money is to come from. Scharping failed to explain how he would combat unemployment and modernize the economy. Under him, the SPD has become a party that is out of step with reality and keeps its head in the sand with regard to the changed political situation in the world in a way that would lead Germany into international isolation. CSU Land Group Chairman Gloss talked of a desperate attempt on the part of Scharping to use emotions to create the impression of unity on the part of the SPD.
