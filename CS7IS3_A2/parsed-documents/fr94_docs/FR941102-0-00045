FR941102-0-00045 FR941102-0-00007 One comment suggested adding language to the text of the Rule that introduces the examples of improper disclosures to provide that these examples are only improper absent disclosures elsewhere in the advertisement that clearly indicate the method of measurement utilized to obtain the given dimensions. 23 The Commission would be concerned that combining improper and proper disclosures in the same advertisement could engender consumer confusion or deception. Thus, the Commission has determined not to amend the Rule as suggested by this comment. 23 Comment of Zenith at 3&hyph;4. One of the examples identified in the Rule as being unacceptable is ``21 inch over-all diagonal_262 square inch picture.'' One comment suggested deleting the second half of the example that refers to square inch measurements, so as to permit such measurements for wide-screen televisions. 24 While the Commission has no information on the likelihood of manufacturers of wide-screen televisions using square inch dimensions rather than the more traditional forms of measurement, the Rule does not prohibit measurements based on square inches. Rather, the example cited above is intended only to convey that the term, ``overall'' is inappropriate, regardless of whether it is accompanied by the square inch dimensions of the viewable picture screen. To avoid confusion and to emphasize the phrase that causes concern, the Commission has determined to modify the example ``21 inch over-all diagonal_262 square inch picture'' in the list of unacceptable disclosures to read ``21 inch over-all diagonal.'' 24 Comment of Zenith at 4. 5. Does This Rule Overlap or Conflict With Other Federal, State, or Local Government Laws or Regulations? None of the commenters were aware of any law or regulation that conflicted or overlapped with the Picture Tube Rule. 6. Have Technology or Economic Conditions Changed Since This Rule Was Issued, and, If So, What Effect Do These Changes Have on the Rule? The Picture Tube Rule was first promulgated in 1966. Since then, both technology and economic conditions have changed significantly. A much greater percentage of households owns one or more televisions. Television sets have become more complex and offer an array of features. The television industry itself has expanded considerably, with the advent of cable and satellite television, and the introduction of interactive television combined with personal computers and telecommunications. However, none of these changes require any modification of the Picture Tube Rule. The technological change with the closest nexus to the Picture Tube Rule is the introduction of high definition television (HDTV), and the new, wider screens used to display these enhanced digital pictures. Most television screens today have horizontal/vertical dimensions in a 5:3 proportion, or aspect ratio, but the screens for the HDTV have a 16:9 aspect ratio. 25 The new ratio, however, does not necessitate any changes to the Rule, because the existing provisions can easily be applied to the new screens. HDTVs may be advertised as ``46 inch diagonal'' sets. Most consumers are familiar with this type of measurement for televisions, and will be able to use this measurement to compare different brands of HDTVs, as well as between high definition and more traditional screens. TV Digest , a trade industry publication, has suggested adding a ``W'' (for wide-screen) to the diagonal measure of the new 16:9 television screens. 26 Nothing in the existing Rule would prohibit this designation. However, the Commission does not believe the designation is necessary to avoid consumer deception or confusion because the ``46 inch diagonal'' or any other measurement allowed under the Rule should provide consumers with adequate information as to the size of the HDTV. Consequently, no additional designation such as ``W'' is required under the Rule for wide-screen televisions. 25 Comments of Electronic Industries Association at 2&hyph;3; Zenith at 4&hyph;5. 26 Comment of Zenith at 5. One commenter suggested that the Picture Tube Rule be expanded to encompass video display terminals for computer monitors. He indicated that he had purchased a monitor advertised as measuring 14 inches, but discovered that the actual dimensions of the viewable area were 13 inches. 27 Currently, the Rule is limited to ``television receiving sets'' and does not encompass computer monitors. The Commission is considering measurement problems with regard to computer monitors, but has determined not to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to amend the Picture Tube Rule at this time. Rather, the Commission is reviewing the extent of problems in this area, and is exploring other possible options for addressing such problems. 27 Comment of Chuck Cooper at 1. III. Effective Date These non-substantive amendments to the Rule will become effective thirty days after publication in the Federal Register .
