Our delegation included Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency; Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic; Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic; and Muhamed Sacirbey, ambassador of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the United Nations. The Croatian side was represented by Franjo Tudjman, Mate Granic, and Mile Akmadzic. The Croatian side presented a very detailed proposal on access to the sea for the future Bosnian Republic within the union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to the plan, access to the sea for the Bosnian republics would be on the territory of the Peljesac Peninsula, across from the port of Ploce. It would extend about 7 km. The length of access on land would be about 1.5 km. This involves the region between the bays of Serevo and (Ilisa) on Peljesac. The delegation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is to examine this proposal. The open question that imposes itself in this case is how to get from the port of Ploce to this proposed territory. A group of experts has been formed and it started work at 1100. At this meeting with the Croatian delegation the position of Mostar was broached. The Croatian side proposes the division of Mostar into six local communities, while our delegation insists on the whole of Mostar. A problem seems to be Rastani and Vracici and also the territory of Mostar airport, which should remain within the city region because, as Prime Minister Silajdzic pointed out, Mostar could hardly survive without the airport. The meeting of experts at 1100 is to discuss the airport issue as well, and, as was pointed out, the talks will continue. The talks will be resumed in Medjugorje this month, so more about these disputed issues will only be known in about two to three weeks. The meeting of all three delegations with cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg has just begun and the first version of the draft of the final agreement is expected to be made. Our correspondent Mirza Hajric will present the details of the plenary session at our next newscast after the meeting ends.
