FR940606-0-00066 FR940606-0-00019 (b) Temporary relocation. Only residential tenants who are eligible under 24 CFR 913.103 and who meet the PHA standards for tenancy established pursuant to 24 CFR 960.204 will be permitted to continue in occupancy. Any residential tenant who (though not required to move permanently) must relocate temporarily (e.g., to permit rehabilitation or major reconstruction) shall be provided: (1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporary housing, any increase in monthly rent/utility costs and incidental expenses. (2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of: (i) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation; (ii) The location of the suitable, decent, safe and sanitary housing to be made available for the temporary period; (iii) The terms and conditions under which the tenant may lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the building/complex following completion of the project; and (iv) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (c) Relocation assistance for displaced persons. A ``displaced person'' (defined in paragraph (h) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601&hyph;4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24. A ``displaced person'' shall be advised of his/her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;19), and, if the representative comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, such person also shall be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas. (d) Real property acquisition requirements. The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B. With respect to the Turnkey method of development (see 24 CFR 941.102(b)), 49 CFR 24.101(a) (1) and (2) apply to the PHA/developer and developer/owner transactions, respectively. (e) Notices. (1) As soon as possible after the date described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, the PHA shall issue a general information notice (described in 49 CFR 24.203(a)) to each occupant of the property. (2) At the time of the initiation of negotiations (defined in paragraph (i) of this section), the PHA shall issue an appropriate written notice to each person occupying the property. Those to be displaced shall be issued a notice of eligibility for relocation assistance. (This notice may be combined with the 90-day notice under 49 CFR 24.203(c).) Tenants (eligible under 24 CFR 913.103 and the standards for tenancy established in accordance with 24 CFR 960.204) who will not be displaced shall be issued a notice offering the tenant the opportunity to enter into a lease to continue in occupancy of the property under reasonable terms and conditions. (Also, see paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section.) (f) Appeals. A person who disagrees with the PHA's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a ``displaced person,'' or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the PHA. A person who is dissatisfied with the PHA's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office. (g) Responsibility of PHA. (1) The PHA shall certify (i.e., provide assurance of compliance, as required by 49 CFR part 24) that it will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section, and shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the PHA to comply. The certification in the PHA's ``Resolution in Support of Public Housing Project'' that the PHA will comply with all the requirements of 24 CFR part 941 shall constitute the PHA's certification of compliance with the URA, the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and this section. (2) The cost of required assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project costs. Such costs may also be paid from funds available from other sources. (3) The PHA must maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this section, including data indicating the race, ethnic, gender and disability status of displaced persons. (h) Definition of displaced person. (1) For purposes of this section, the term displaced person means a person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under this part. The term ``displaced person'' includes, but may not be limited to: (i) A person who moves permanently from the real property after receiving a notice from the PHA or property owner that requires such move, if the move occurs on or after: (A) For conventional or acquisition projects, the date of approval by HUD of the PHA proposal incorporating the site, or for scattered sites, the date HUD approves the applicable site; (B) For turnkey projects, the date the PHA proposal is submitted to HUD; or (C) For major reconstruction of obsolete public housing projects, the date the PHA issues the invitation for bids for the project; (ii) Any person, including a person who moves before the date described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, that the PHA or HUD determines was displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project; or
