He said in his speech: At present, there are many problems in social order and in the many factors affecting stability. Serious economic crime cases, serious criminal cases, and the phenomena of social evil have yet to be put under effective control. The criminal cases of hooligans, robbers, and thefts continued to increase. Therefore, we must be neither blind nor optimistic about social order. We must keep from becoming careless or paralyzed ideologically or practically. Ye Liansong said: The year 1994 is key to satisfactorily accomplishing the Eighth Five-Year Plan and to strive to fulfill the target of quadrupling the GNP ahead of schedule. On the basis of two consecutive years of fast economic development, we should continue to maintain rapid economic development. Therefore, the party committees and governments at various levels and the judicial, procuratorial, and court departments should accurately understand that development is the purpose, reform is the motivation, and stability is the prerequisite and grasp their dialectical relations. The party and government top leaders should ideologically understand the importance of stability as they understand reform and opening up. In doing their practical work, the party and government top leaders should exert real efforts to grasp stability as they do to grasp economic work. Ye Liansong stressed: Safeguarding stability is the common task of the whole party and the whole society. So, the whole party and all social forces should be mobilized and make concerted efforts to comprehensively improve social order. He urged: The party and government top leaders should not only be leaders for economic construction but also be the first to safeguard stability. We should strengthen the struggle for strictly dealing blows to criminal activities, expand the extent of attacks, and bring the rising tendencies of major cases under control. We should positively and actively wage the struggle against corruption and conscientiously investigate and handle major and appalling cases involving legal persons. Simultaneously, we should strengthen the construction of the contingent of the masses preventing and controlling criminal activities and enable it to come into full play as the first line of defense for eliminating contradictions, preventing crimes, and stabilizing society.
