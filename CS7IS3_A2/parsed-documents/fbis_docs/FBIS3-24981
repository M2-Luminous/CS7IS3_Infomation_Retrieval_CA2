He went to the region to appease the local people and to extend the government's sympathy to the bereaved families. He also pardoned some people who had been detained for their role in the 23 January attack on Abeche. Furthermore, members of the Chadian National Front will be dispatched to Moussoro where they will be trained and integrated in the Chadian National Army. Deby urged sultans and other village chiefs to leave no stone unturned to bring back those who deserted their families. Let us listen to the head of state: [Begin Deby recording] We must find a solution that will restore tranquility and calm in Ouaddai and ensure that the people live in concord. This cannot be achieved without the assistance of canton chiefs. We cannot solve your many problems unless we all do away once and for all with a number of evils that have undermined the region. I therefore urge you -- administrative authorities, sultans, and canton heads who wield considerable moral influence -- to help me as head of state and son of the region to safeguard peace and unity in this part of Chad and to restore the former luster of Ouaddai. I must stress that any conflicts in the region prompted by material considerations should stop. Let the traditional rulers assume their responsibilities and fully play their role as assistants to administrative authorities. The sultan must fully assume his historic responsibility and run Ouaddai Region in line with the tradition. [applause] Through you, paramount chiefs and canton heads, I extend a hand to our brothers who fled the region on 23 January. I urge them to see reason. We are prepared to receive them; we are prepared to hold talks with them; the government is prepared to hold sincere talks with them in the supreme interest of both our region and our country.
