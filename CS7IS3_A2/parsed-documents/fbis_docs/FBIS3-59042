He was also received by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. Kinkel held joint consultations beforehand with Douglas Hurd and Hikmet Cetin, his British and Turkish counterparts,. Kinkel said in Ankara that Bonn backed cultural autonomy for the Kurdish minority and firmly rejected frontier alterations in the region. He spoke in favor of a stronger regional role for Turkey, which was an important partner for Europe. Germany supported Ankara's efforts on the path toward the European Union (EU). The meeting with Hurd and Cetin, which was organized at Kinkel's initiative, also focused on developments in the Balkans, the Caucasus, and Iraq. Kinkel said the talks highlighted Turkey's special role in Europe's new security structure at the frontier with Asia as well as between Christianity and Islam. Ankara would have to carry out domestic reforms in the field of justice, for example, and still had "a certain amount of homework to do," Kinkel said. In this context, he drew attention to the human rights situation, the Kurdish question, and the fight against the banned militant separatist organization PKK (Workers Party of Kurdistan), as well as to the burden that Islamic fundamentalism posed for the NATO state Turkey. He reaffirmed Germany's obligation to look after almost 2 million Turks, who must not, however, be allowed to settle political disputes on German soil. "My party and I support dual nationality as well as local election voting rights for foreigners, including citizens from countries such as Turkey, which are associate EU members," Kinkel said.
