(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1085, 1094, 1099c; Section 4 of Pub. L. 95&hyph;452, 92 Stat. 1101&hyph;1109; E.O. 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189), 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235) 11. Newly designated ยง668.17 is revised to read as follows: ยง668.17 Default reduction measures. (a) Default rates. If the Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS cohort default rate for an institution exceeds 20 percent for any fiscal year, the Secretary notifies the institution of that rate and may, after consultation as the Secretary deems appropriate with cognizant guaranty agencies take one or more of the following actions: (1) Initiate a proceeding under Subpart G of this part to limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of the institution in the Title IV, HEA programs, if_ (i) The institution's Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS cohort default rate exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year after 1989 and has not been reduced by an increment of at least 5 percent from its rate for the previous fiscal year (e.g., a 50-percent rate was not reduced to 45 percent or below); or (ii) The institution's Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS cohort default rate exceeds_ (A) 60 percent for fiscal year 1989; (B) 55 percent for fiscal year 1990; (C) 50 percent for fiscal year 1991; (D) 45 percent for fiscal year 1992; or (E) 40 percent for any fiscal year after fiscal year 1992. (2) To help the Secretary make a preliminary determination as to the appropriate action to be taken by the Secretary regarding the institution, require the institution to submit to the Secretary and one or more guaranty agencies, as defined in 34 CFR 682, any information relating to that determination, as reasonably required by the Secretary, within a time frame specified by the Secretary. (b) Default management plan. If the Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS cohort default rate for an institution_ (1) Is greater than 20 percent but less than or equal to 40 percent, the institution must submit a default management plan that implements the measures described in appendix D of this part. An institution that wishes to submit a default management plan that deviates from the measures described in appendix D of this part must submit a justification for the deviation that includes a rationale explaining why the measures from which the plan deviates are not appropriate for the institution's specific situation. The institution must implement the default management plan upon notification from the Secretary that the plan has been approved; or (2) Exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year, the institution must implement all of the default management reduction measures described in appendix D of this part no later than 60 days after the institution receives the Secretary's notification of the institution's cohort default rate. An institution is not required to submit any written plans to the Secretary or a guaranty agency unless the Secretary or guaranty agency specifically requests the institution to do so. (c) End of participation. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, an institution's participation in the FFEL programs ends if the Secretary determines that the institution's cohort default rate, for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which the Secretary has determined the institution's rate, is equal to or greater than the applicable threshold rates. (2) For purposes of the determinations made under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the threshold rates are_ (i) 35 percent for each of fiscal years 1991 and 1992; (ii) 30 percent for fiscal year 1993; and
