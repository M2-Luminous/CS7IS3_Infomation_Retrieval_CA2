FR941103-2-00150 FR941103-2-00084 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS Privacy Act of 1974; Internal Computer Matching Program AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Notice of Computer Matching Program. Notice is hereby given that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to conduct an internal computer matching program. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Finance and Information Resources Management (FINANCE) are the components responsible for managing the systems of records that will be subject to the matching program. The purpose of the program is to identify and locate VA employees who owe delinquent debts to the Federal Government as a result of their participation in benefit programs administered by VA. Once identified and located, the debtors may become subject to involuntary offset of their pay under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982. The legal authority for undertaking this matching program is contained in the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;365), 31 U.S.C. Chapter 37, Subchapter I (General) and Subchapter II (Claims of the United States Government, 31 U.S.C. 3711 (Collection and Compromise) and 5 U.S.C. 5514 (Installment Deduction for Indebtedness). These statutes authorize Federal agencies to offset a Federal employee's salary as a means of satisfying delinquent debts owed the United States. VBA and FINANCE have concluded an agreement to conduct the matching program pursuant to provisions of the Privacy Act of 1972, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(o)). VBA is the recipient component and will perform the computer match. FINANCE will provide VBA with an abstract file from the Personnel Accounting Integrated Data system (PAID). The records entered on this abstract are limited to those employees who are identified as veterans by an indicator in the original PAID record. Each PAID abstract record includes the employee's full name, social security number and duty station identifier. The records in the PAID abstract are, then, matched to the Veterans and Beneficiaries Identification and Records Location Subsystem (BIRLS) file by comparing social security numbers in both PAID and BIRLS records. In those instances where a PAID abstract record and a BIRLS record have identical social security numbers, the BIRLS file number is entered on the abstract file. In many instances, the file number will be the same as the employee's social security number. After the abstract file is updated with file numbers from BIRLS, the file is compared to the Centralized Accounts Receivable System (CARS) file. In each instance where a file number from the PAID/BIRLS match is identical to the file number in a CARS record, the CARS record will be updated with the employee's duty station identifier. If the abstract tape was not updated with the employee's file number, the employee's social security number in the PAID abstract will be compared to the CARS file number. If those numbers are an identical match, the employee's CARS record will be updated with his or her duty station identifier from the PAID abstract. Records to be Matched: The systems of records maintained by the respective components from which records will be disclosed for the purpose of this computer match are as follows: FINANCE: Personnel Accounting Integrated Data (PAID) Master Records in the Personnel and Accounting Pay System-VA, 27VA047, which appears at page 942 of the document entitled Privacy Act Issuances, 1991 Compilation, Volume II. This system contains records of approximately 220,000 active VA employees. VBA: (a) ``Compensation, Pension, Education and Rehabilitation Records-VA'' (58VA21/22) appearing at page 967 of the document entitled Privacy Act Issuances, 1991 Comp., Volume II. (b) ``Loan Guaranty Home, Condominium and Manufactured Home Loan Applicant Records, Specially Adapted Housing Applicant Records and Vendee Loan Applicant Records-VA'' (55VA26), appearing at page 962 of the document entitled Privacy Act Issuances, 1991 Comp., Volume II. (c) Veterans and Beneficiaries Identification and Records Location Subsystem-VA (BIRLS), 38VA23, which appears at page 952 of the document entitled Privacy Act Issuances, 1991 Compilation, Volume II. Exchange of data pursuant to this matching program is consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(1) and 38 U.S.C. 5701(b)(6). The debtor records actually used to perform the match are maintained in the Centralized Accounts Receivable System (CARS). CARS records, which number about 414,000, are a subset of those found in Privacy Act system of records 58VA21/22. In some instances, data in an individual's record in the Privacy Act system of records 58VA21/22 include certain data extracted from the same individual's record maintained under 55VA26. This would occur, for instance, where an individual has a delinquent debt as the result of his or her participation in the VA loan guaranty program. The matching program is expected to begin on or about December 5, 1994, and continue in effect for 18 months. Matching activity will begin no sooner than 30 days after publication of this notice or 40 days after a report of this is matching program has been provided to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), whichever is later. The agreement governing the matching program and, thus, the matching program, may be extended an additional 12 months with the approval of VA's Data Integrity Board. Such extension must occur within three months prior to expiration of the 18-month period set forth above and under the terms set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(o)(2)( D). ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments, suggestions or objections regarding the proposal to conduct the matching program to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (271A), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420. All written comments received will be available for public inspection only in the Veterans Service Unit at the above address, between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays, until December 5, 1994.
