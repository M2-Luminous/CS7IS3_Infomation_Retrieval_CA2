Following the meeting Eliasson described the talks he had with Armenian, Karabakh and Azerbaijan leaders as "interesting and constructive." He expressed the hope that the peace process could be stepped up by the Minsk Group. Eliasson told journalists that an agreement would soon be made on sending international observers into the war zone. He admitted that the issues of a truce, troop withdrawal and security guarantees for the population had not been resolved and said that they would be discussed jointly with Russia. Speaking of Moscow's mediation, in particular of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's efforts, Eliasson said that all parties should act in unison so as to obtain the best possible results. He told Interfax that the warring parties appreciated the urgent need to resolve the Karabakh problem politically and this was a major achievement. For this reason, he believed, the CSCE, notably its Minsk Group, activity should not be regarded as unproductive.
