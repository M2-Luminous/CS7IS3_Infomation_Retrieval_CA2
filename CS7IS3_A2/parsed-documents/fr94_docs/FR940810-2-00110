Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements are set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change (i) Purpose of the Proposed Rule Change (a) Overview of Free-Riding and Withholding Interpretation. The purpose of the Interpretation is to protect the integrity of the public offering system by ensuring that members make a bona fide public distribution of ``hot issue'' securities and do not withhold such securities for their own benefit or use the securities to reward other persons who are in a position to direct future business to the member. Hot issues are defined by the Interpretation as securities of a public offering while trade at a premium in the secondary market whenever such trading commences. The Interpretation prohibits members from retaining the securities of hot issues in their own accounts and prohibits members from using sales of such securities to directors, officers, employees and associated persons of members and other broker/dealers. It also restricts member sales of ``hot issue'' securities to the accounts of specified categories of persons, including among others, senior officers of banks, insurance companies, registered investment companies, registered investment advisory firms and other persons within such organizations whose activities influence or include the buying or selling of securities. These basic prohibitions and restrictions are also made applicable to sales by members of hot issue securities to accounts in which any such persons may have a beneficial interest and, with limited exceptions, to members of the immediate family of those persons restricted by the Interpretation. (b) Rule proposal background . At its May 1992 meeting, the Board of Governors appointed a special committee (the ``Committee'') to examine the Interpretation to determine if the Interpretation's restrictions, definitions and obligations are relevant in today's securities markets. The Committee was comprised of representatives of the Association's National Business Conduct, Corporate Financing and Insurance Affiliated Members Committees as well as members of the NASD Board of Governors. The Board also asked the Committee to examine various interpretative issues that had been raised with the NASD. The Committee met numerous times from May 1992 until April 1993 and received input and suggestions, both in writing and in person, from members, issuers, law firms, the NASD's Legal Advisory Board, and the staff of various NASD departments. In June 1993, the NASD published for comment proposed modifications to the Interpretation based on its review and suggestions received. The NASD received 36 comment letters on the proposed modifications. The Committee considered the comments and made final recommendations to the National Business Conduct Committee (``NBCC'') in November 1993. The Board considered and approved the NBCC's recommendations on November 14, 1993. The proposed rule change includes language clarifications to facilitate understanding of the Interpretation's application, as well as substantive modifications. The following discusses the substantive modifications proposed. (c) Substantive proposed modifications . The NASD is proposing several substantive modifications to the Interpretation, including changes in connection with limited business broker/dealers, investment partnerships and corporations, stand-by arrangements, venture capital investors, securities offerings covered by the Interpretation, and issuer-directed securities. The NASD believes that the proposed substantive changes clarify the scope of the Interpretation and remedy certain unintended effects the Interpretation has had in its present form. Specifically, the NASD believes that the Interpretation has prohibited transactions which do not implicate the Interpretation's objective of a bona fide distribution of hot issue securities to the public, and may have created unduly burdensome restrictions and expense for NASD members and their customers. Thus, the NASD believes that the proposed changes, described further below, appropriately restrict prohibited persons from receiving hot issues without engendering unintended restrictions inconsistent with the purpose of the Interpretation.
