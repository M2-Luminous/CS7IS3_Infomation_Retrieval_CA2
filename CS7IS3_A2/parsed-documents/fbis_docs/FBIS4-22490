After a long silence the Association of Russian Banks has expressed its attitude toward this problem. A few days ago it sent a letter to the State Duma in which it essentially demands the repeal or the suspension of the operation of the pertinent Central Bank directive. In the opinion of the association's board of management, although the need to increase the internal resources of the banks under conditions of rapid inflation is obvious, "this process should be gradual, taking into account the actual resources of the banks and the needs of the economy." Under the present specific conditions the raising of a charter capital of R2 billion is a task beyond one's strength. There are simply no such resources in the majority of oblasts, krays and cities. In this connection new banks will not be created in the next few years and part of those already in operation will be closed down. And this given the fact that 27 oblasts and republics now have less than 10 banks each. Because of this each banking institution serves several rayons. For example, in Novgorod Oblast, which is made up of 22 rayons, there are only three banks and eight branches and in the 40 rayons of Kirov Oblast--seven banks and 17 branches. Naturally, in this case there can be no question of any competition in the banking sphere or of any quality of banking service. As to the question of a further increase of charter capital, it also appears moot to the Association of Russian Banks. The fact is that there are now in Russia only 28 banks with a declared charter fund of more than R5 billion. And even for them bringing internal capital up to R10-12 billion is a rather complicated task.
