FBIS4-55431 "dreeu094_k_94010" FBIS-EEU-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 CROATIA Serb Party Leader on Treatment of Serbs Serb Party Leader on Treatment of Serbs LD1305132594 Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service in Serbo-Croatian 1157 GMT 13 May 94 LD1305132594 Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] Zagreb, 13 May (TANJUG) -- Milan Djukic, chairman of the Serb National Party [SNP] in Zagreb, warned in a special statement for the public today that the position of the Serbs in Croatia "is no longer acceptable and can no longer be tolerated." He asked why the Serbs who remained in Croatia have become "second class citizens" and why they only have obligations and not rights stemming from the constitution. Djukic addressed a series of questions on Croatia's policies to Croatian authorities, demanding to know "whether Croatia wishes the Serbs to remain in Croatia at all," because the Croatian authorities are completely oblivious to "the manner in which the Serbs are leaving Croatia." Djukic asked: Does Croatia want to reduce the Serbs to 8 or 5 percent of the total population of the country? He added that President Franjo Tudjman was persistently trying to explain certain facts to the public that are "counterproductive at a time when a solution to the political crisis is being sought." He cited as an example the introduction of the kuna as the new currency; the genesis of this, he said, is well known to the Serbian people [the kuna was the legal currency in the Nazi-backed Independent State of Croatia during World War II]. Commenting on Tudjman's statement that communism had been more damaging to Croatia than fascism, Djukic assessed that this could only be acceptable to like-minded people but not to the Serbs in Croatia who are not ashamed of their contribution to the war against fascism and its domestic collaborators. These questions are being posed at a time when, on the one hand, the Croatian people are firmly determined to build a sovereign and national state, while on the other, the Serb people in Croatia "are having to put up with an imposed political status against their will." The Serbs that have remained in Croatia did not vote for a state belonging solely to the Croats, but for a Croatia belonging to all its citizens. They are not in favor of an obscure model of democracy -- such as the national model -- but of a bourgeois democracy, Djukic said. We are in favor of Croatia's integrity, "But not at all costs -- not at the cost of war," the leader of the SNP said.
