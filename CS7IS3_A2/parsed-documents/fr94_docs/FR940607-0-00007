FR940607-0-00007 FR940607-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;199&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8924; AD 94&hyph;11&hyph;08] Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Model 4101 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, that requires modification of the aileron drive quadrant support structure. This amendment is prompted by results of a stress analysis check, which revealed that the factor of safety of the aileron drive quadrant support structure on Model 4101 airplanes does not meet the tail-to-wind gust load design case strength requirements specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent cracking of the support structure, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Effective July 7, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Jetstream Aircraft, Inc., P.O. Box 16029, Dulles International Airport, Washington, DC 20041&hyph;6029. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream 4101 airplanes was published in the Federal Register on February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5359). That action proposed to require modification of the aileron drive quadrant support structure below the flight compartment floor. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. The FAA estimates that 4 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 20 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,400, or $1,100 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .

Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;11&hyph;08␣Jetstream Aircraft Limited: Amendment 39&hyph;8924. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;199&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 4101 airplanes; constructors numbers 41004 through 41018 inclusive, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent reduced controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Within 3 months after the effective date of this AD, modify the aileron drive quadrant support structure below the flight compartment floor in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin J41&hyph;53&hyph;011, dated October 15, 1993. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (d) The modification shall be done in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin J41&hyph;53&hyph;011, dated October 15, 1993. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. Copies may be obtained from Jetstream Aircraft, Inc., P.O.
