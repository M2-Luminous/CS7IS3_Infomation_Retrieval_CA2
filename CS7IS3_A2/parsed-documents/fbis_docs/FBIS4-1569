Mr. Chen said that the Chinese government hoped that the British Hong Kong authorities would take effective measure to control high inflation and soaring housing prices there. With regard to the leasing of land, Mr. Chen said that the Sino-British Land Group had been getting on well with their work on the leasing of more than 50 hectares of land in recent years as set out in Annex 3 of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. This amount did not include the leasing of land for public housing. The leasing of land approved for this year was expected to be no less than 100 hectares. The construction of the railway to serve the new airport, Mr. Chen said, involved both the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and the Land Commission, and this therefore needed consultation between the two parties. He said he hoped that the core project for the new airport would be completed as far as possible in view of the approach of 1997. [sentence as received] Mr. Murdock said that the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong would contribute to encouraging the American government to renew China's MFN status without preconditions. Mr. Chen expressed his appreciation, saying that MFN was reciprocal and if the American government took away China's MFN status, both sides would suffer losses and Hong Kong and Taiwan would be particularly hurt. Looking into the future, America would be the biggest loser, Mr. Chen added. In a 70-minute meeting, Mr. Chen repeatedly stressed that the Chinese government would unquestionably uphold Hong Kong's international financial and trade centre status. He said that China did not know how far the British side would go in breaching cooperation. Hong Kong's future was ultimately decided by the people of Hong Kong. After 1997, he said, the Chinese government would implement the policy of "one China, two systems" and "Hong Kong run by Hong Kong people" to the letter. To maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial and trade centre and its stability and prosperity was the only aim of the Chinese government.
