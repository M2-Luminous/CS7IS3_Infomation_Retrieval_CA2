Japan's new Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, who is on a four- nation Middle East tour, exchanged documents on the Japanese assistance in Cairo with Egypt's Minister for International Cooperation Yusuf Butrus-Ghali, the ministry said. The aid consists of up to 3.06 billion yen to cooperate in Egypt's project to rehabilitate the Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel [spelling as received] linking mainland Egypt and Sinai Peninsula, and 913 million yen for a project to improve medical services in the hospitals in Upper Nile, it said. The latest aid for the project to rehabilitate the tunnel is part of the 7.58 billion yen Japan has already pledged to provide over a four-year period beginning 1992, the ministry said. The Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel was built in 1983 but its condition is deteriorating because of the corrosion of concrete, it said. The 913 million yen will be used to purchase basic medical equipment for six public hospitals in Luxor city and the Qena Governorate, it said.
