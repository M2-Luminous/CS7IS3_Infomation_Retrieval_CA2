Summary of Proposed NSPS for New MWC's [Subpart Eb] a 1Plant size (MSW combustion capacity) 1Requirement Applicability The proposed NSPS would apply to new MWC units located at plants with capacities to combust greater than 25 Mg/day of residential, commercial, and/or institutional discards. b Industrial discards are not covered by the proposed NSPS. <25 Mg/day Not covered by standards. >25 Mg/day but < 35 Mg/day Initial report of MWC design capacity and startup date. >35 Mg/day but < 225 Mg/day (referred to as small MWC plants) Subject to provisions listed below. >225 Mg/day (referred to as large MWC plants) Subject to provisions listed below. ␣ 1␣ Good Combustion Practices: •Applies to large and small MWC plants. •A site-specific operator training manual would be required to be developed and made available for MWC personnel. The EPA or State MWC operator training course would be required to be completed by the MWC chief facility operator, shift supervisors, and control room operators. •The ASME or a State MWC operator certification would be required to be obtained by the MWC chief facility operator (mandatory), shift supervisors (mandatory), and control room operators (optional). •The MWC load level would be required to be measured and not to exceed the maximum load level as demonstrated during the most recent dioxin/furan performance test. •The PM control device inlet flue gas temperature would be required to be measured and not to exceed the level demonstrated during the most recent dioxin/furan performance test. •The CO level would be required to be measured using CEMS, and the concentration in the flue gas would be required not to exceed the following. ␣ 1MWC type 1CO Level c 1Averaging time Modular starved-air and excessair 50 ppmv 4-hour.

Air curtain incinerators that combust other MSW are subject to all requirements under the proposed NSPS. c All concentration levels in the table are corrected to 7 percent O 2 , dry basis. d Dioxins/furans measured as total tetra- through octa-chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. For plants complying with the TEQ format of the standard, TEQ is determined using 1989 international toxicity equivalency factors. e For MWC's constructed after September 20, 1994, but on or before September 22, 1997, the standard would be 0.50 ng/dscm TEQ or 30 ng/dscm total mass for the first 3 years of operation of the MWC. After the first 3 years, the standard would be 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total mass. For all MWC's constructed after September 22, 1997, the standard at startup would be 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total mass. f Method 29 is being proposed in a separate notice in today's Federal Register . g Two public meetings would be held for review of the materials separation plan. The first public meeting would focus on review of a draft materials separation plan. The draft materials separation plan and the summary of responses to public comments about the plan would be submitted to EPA prior to application for a construction permit under New Source Review (NSR). A second public meeting would be held after submission of the application for a construction permit and would focus on both the final materials separation plan and the siting analysis. The siting analysis, the materials separation plan, and the summary of responses to public comments on the siting analysis and the materials separation plan would be submitted as part of the initial notification of construction. h The proposed NSPS includes provisions that would allow small MWC plants to conduct performance tests for dioxins/furans, PM, Cd, Pb, Hg, and HCl every third year if the MWC meets certain specified criteria discussed in section II.F of this preamble.
