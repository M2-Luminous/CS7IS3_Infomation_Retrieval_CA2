A number of program documents were adopted and the powers of Aleksandr Rutskoy as party leader were confirmed. Having harshly criticized the policies of the existing power structures, he set the task of creating a nationwide social patriotic movement on the basis of the party to which centralism and compromise should be alien. In the end, this means the organizational formation of an uncompromising opposition, although Aleksandr Rutskoy himself is against such a term. [Begin Rutskoy recording] If we are talking about an opposition, then it has to be uncompromising. Why not uncompromising? What is the point of an opposition otherwise? The opposition is there so as not to agree with what is happening in the country today, and can you agree with it? [end recording] [Poklad] The PPFR program directives are little different from the aims proclaimed by many other parties. However, two tasks can be singled out--the restoration of the state within the frontiers of the USSR and the holding of early presidential elections in Russia. The delegates also spoke in favor of stepping up work with various sectors of the population and increasing the party's electoral readiness. The prospects for the Social Patriotic Movement that Aleksandr Rutskoy is trying to organize are as yet unclear. However, today it is already possible to say that the uncompromising opposition has obtained a leader in him. [Announcer] We have just received a report that the PPFR has changed its name to the Russian Social Democratic People's Party [Rossiyskaya Sotsial-Demokraticheskaya Narodnaya Partiya]. Aleksandr Rutskoy has been voted its chairman by a huge majority.
