At their summit in Corfu next week, the 12 heads of state and government of the European Union [EU] will have to choose between the government heads of Belgium and the Netherlands, Jean-Luc Dehaene and Ruud Lubbers. Yet, the likeliness that, instead, there will be embarrassing disagreement, is increasing day by day. French President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl will not catch the genie they let escape from the bottle. They achieved a 7:5 majority in favor of the Belgian at an early stage and were optimistic of winning the support of the entire community apart from Britain's John Major and Lubbers himself in time before the vote. They calculated that, at the summit, Major would most likely give in and Lubbers would be "defeated." However, things have not quite turned out that way. The official from the Netherlands, who, contrary to Dehaene, threw himself into the race, is with certain success making propaganda with some smaller EU partners but also Italy's new head of government, Silvio Berlusconi, against the "Franco-German axis," which was trying to put Dehaene, who allegedly complies with all their wishes, in front of them. If this were true, Corfu would become the summit of irony, because Mitterrand and Kohl have justified their choice not least by arguing that Dehaene had the outstanding skills of accommodating differing interests, while Lubbers was tending towards polarizing the club. During a time when the Romance south of the community is watching the increase in power of the "Germanic" north with suspicion, Dehaene's talents would be vital. Yet, now it looks as if the community is to be polarized not so much by the man from the Netherlands but rather by his opponents. The dividing line would then run between big and small instead of north and south. The "axis" would itself have disqualified as incompatible with the community. One can certainly believe that the chancellor is pinning Euro-idealist expectations on the new chief in Brussels. The French, however, are guided by national interests. People in Brussels have, for example, made the following calculation: France's state enterprises, from Air France to the Credit Lyonnais and the electronics group Bull, will have to rely on subsidies that are incompatible with the EU's competition rules for a long time to come. The conflict with Brussels is fully underway and is deteriorating in an unprecedented way. The French opponent of the French is the most able Belgian Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert. He would have to go if Dehaene came in, because Belgium is entitled to only one place in the Commission. That way, the path would be cleared for Edith Cresson, Mitterrand's former prime minister, to head the body that is so important for France's future. The chancellor will certainly be aware of his friend's ulterior motives.
