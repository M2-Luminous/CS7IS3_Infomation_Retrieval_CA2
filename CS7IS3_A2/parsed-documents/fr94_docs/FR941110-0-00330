FR941110-0-00330 FR941110-0-00019 (iii) Other low-income families who are neither public housing nor Section 8 residents at the time of application or selection.) (2) Applicants who are not already public housing residents, however, must also satisfy the requirements for admission to such housing. (d) Compliance with lease obligations. Eligibility shall be limited to residents who have been current in all of their lease obligations (in the case of Turnkey III homebuyers, obligations under their Turnkey III homebuyer agreements) over a period of not less than six months prior to conveyance of title (or, if so provided by the homeownership plan, such lesser period as has elapsed since the beginning of public housing or Section 8 tenure), including, but not limited to, payment of rents (or homebuyer's monthly payments) and other charges, and reporting of all income that is pertinent to determination of rental charges (or homebuyer's monthly payments). At the PHA's discretion, the homeownership plan may allow a resident to remedy under-reporting of income, provided that proper reporting of income would not have resulted in ineligibility for admission to public housing or for Section 8 assistance, by payment of the resulting underpayment for rent (or homebuyer's monthly payments) prior to conveyance of title to the homeownership dwelling, either in a lump-sum or in installments over a reasonable period. Alternatively, the plan may permit payment within a reasonable period after conveyance of title, under an agreement secured by a mortgage on the property. (e) Affordability standard. Eligibility shall be limited to residents who are capable of assuming the financial obligations of homeownership, under minimum income standards for affordability, taking into account the unavailability of public housing operating subsidies and modernization funds after conveyance of the property by the PHA. A homeownership plan may, however, take account of any available subsidy from other sources ( e.g. , in connection with a plan for cooperative ownership, assistance under Section 8 of the Act, if available and authorized by the Section 8 regulations). Under this affordability standard, an applicant must meet the following requirements: (1) On an average monthly estimate, the amount of the applicant's payments for mortgage principal and interest, plus insurance, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance and other regularly recurring homeownership costs (such as condominium, cooperative, or other homeownership association fees) will not exceed the sum of: (i) 35 percent of the applicant's adjusted income as defined in 24 CFR Part 913; and (ii) Any subsidy that will be available for such payments. (2) The applicant can pay any amounts required for closing, such as a downpayment (if any) and closing costs chargeable to the purchaser, in accordance with the homeownership plan. (f) Option to restrict eligibility. A homeownership plan may, at the PHA's discretion, restrict eligibility to one or more residency-based categories ( e.g. , for occupied units, eligibility may be restricted to the existing residents of the units to be sold; for vacant units, eligibility may be restricted to public housing residents only, or to public housing residents plus any one or more of the other residency-based categories that may be established under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section), as may be reasonable in view of the number of units to be offered for sale and the estimated number of eligible applicants in various categories, provided that the residency-based preference requirements mandated by paragraph (g) of this section are observed. (g) Residency-based preferences. For occupied units, a preference shall be given to the existing residents of each of the dwellings to be sold. For vacant units (including units which are voluntarily vacated), a preference shall be given to residents of other public housing units owned or leased by the seller PHA (over any other residency-based categories that may be established by the homeownership plan for Section 8 residents and any categories of nonresident applicants). (h) Self sufficiency preference. For vacant units, a further preference shall be given to those applicants who have completed self-sufficiency and job training programs, as identified in the homeownership plan, or who meet equivalent standards of economic self-sufficiency, such as actual employment experience, as specified in the homeownership plan.
