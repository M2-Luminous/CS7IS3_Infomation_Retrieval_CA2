Do you want to enter the election campaign as the party that advocates tax increases? [Scharping] We are paying too many taxes and fees. For this reason, I want to reduce the burden for 80 percent of taxpayers. Thus, Kohl wants to raise taxes for everybody, but I only for the top earners. [Kleine] You want to introduce a 10-percent unification surcharge for single people who earn 60,000 German marks [DM] or more per year and for married couples who earn DM120,000 or more per year. Over what period of time are you thinking? [Scharping] Until all the inherited burdens from the shadow budgets of the current Federal Government are removed. [Kleine] Your traffic expert Christoph Zoepel has suggested increasing the gasoline price by 20 pfennigs per liter... [Scharping] The SPD election program will not include an increase in the gasoline tax. Waigel wants to do that. His financial planning for 1996 provides for this measure. The politicians in Bonn are preparing for the next tax lie. The SPD wants jobs and justice. The whole debate must be seen in this context. [Kleine] You are commuting between Mainz and Bonn every day, and you work late into the night. Is the stress ruining you? [Scharping] My normal working week has 100 hours, sometimes more. There are many things that I have to settle personally. I do not and will not have an automatic signing machine. One can only do this job if one enjoys doing it and does not see it as a burden. [Kleine] The young socialists in southern Hesse want to poison a small dog in protest against the deportation of Kurds... [Scharping] This is the absolute ultimate in tastelessness.
