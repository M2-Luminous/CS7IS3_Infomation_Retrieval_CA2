The move eased an entry ban imposed on Palestinians from the territories following the wave of bombings in early April. Shahal said he hoped the move would lead to a return of normal life but this would depend on the Palestinian side. A Qol Yisra'el reporter adds that despite the closure of the territories, police have been arresting several hundred Palestinians weekly for illegal entry into Israel.
