Bowing out as deputy prime minister and finance minister, Boris Fedorov said that the new government of production fetishists would lead the economy to financial collapse in the very near future. We have asked today's guest, Aleksandr Khandruyev, to comment on this pronouncement. [Khandruyev] It does not really matter whether Boris Grigoryevich [Fedorov] has resigned or not. It seems to me quite simply unethical for a man who has done his utmost to trigger off this financial and budgetary collapse to talk about financial collapse. This is because the budget system is disintegrating. Nobody wants to accept responsibility for what I would call the restoration of a normal tax system, and the collection of taxes and revenue. We have already learned the preliminary results of 1993. They show that the Central Bank has kept all its commitments to the IMF, as expressed in the joint statement with the government, except for one. For technical reasons we were unable to hold a credit auction, although we have already adopted regulations on this auction. Our problem now is simply to free up funds that can be sold at a credit auction. But we have kept all our pledges. Credit injected into our economy has not exceeded the imposed ceiling. On the contrary, savings have been made. So where have we failed? In only one area -- the budget deficit. [Platonova] Aleksandr Andreyevich, brokers are not confident that the Central Bank has sufficient hard currency at its disposal. Are they wrong? [Khandruyev] When the Central Bank and the Russian Federation Government signed a joint declaration on economic policy on 24 May last year, we undertook not to maintain the ruble exchange rate by artificial means. However, at the same time, we said that we would use our hard currency reserves to influence the range within which it would fluctuate. We have abided by this commitment. We saw our main objective as being to prevent abrupt collapses or rises in the ruble rate. Generally speaking, the situation has never got out of control during the last one-and-a-half, two years. However, the situation that came about at the beginning of 1994 was a result of a coming together of numerous factors -- the break between trading sessions [during New Year and Christmas holidays], and the fact that the ruble exchange rate really was too high for a situation in which domestic prices continued to increase. Exports became unprofitable. Furthermore, as I have already said, the hard currency market is still very fragile, very delicate. It influences all sorts of unexpected factors. The possibility that there are certain players on the currency exchange who took concerted action to bring about a sharp fall in the ruble exchange rate cannot be ruled out. In these circumstances the Central Bank has done its utmost to make sure that this process does not become a collapse and to keep the situation under control. [Platonova] Our next question to Aleksandr Khandruyev is as follows: What, in the Central Bank's view, are the reasons for the slump in output? [Khandruyev] Well, first and foremost, I would like to agree with my eminent colleague, Igor Sergeyevich Korolev [deputy director of the Institute of World Economy]. I know him well. I agree with his assessment of the factors that are causing, provoking the slump. The Central Bank reckons that the slump is the result of a macroeconomic sickness throughout the economy. The slump is, generally speaking, a natural reaction to the excessively rigid conditions, the structure of the Russian economy, and the impact of budgetary and credit restrictions. It would be simply stupid to think that one could use monetary, budgetary regulators to push through industrial and, in general, structural policies. When this collapse assumed universal proportions, it became clear that you cannot shell out for everything. Therefore, somebody must accept responsibility for doing the dirty work. If you cannot sustain all areas of production, you must decide which are the most promising and efficient enterprises and sub-industries. This is precisely where you should invest money. The rest must be given time to modernize themselves or to diversify, or else face closure. So much has been said in our country about bankruptcy, but not a single one of the reformers has been willing to take responsibility for initiating the first bankruptcy, even as an example of what should be done -- even though they have been going on about this ever since the beginning of last year. [Platonova] Aleksandr Andreyevich, what does the Central Bank intend to do about GMM [Global Money Management, Inc.]? [Khandruyev] First and foremost, I would like to agree with my GMM colleague and his view of the article by Mikhail Leontyev in the newspaper SEGODNYA. A real, self-respecting boxer never hits below the belt. But my esteemed GMM colleague is mistaken. Certain banking operations can, in fact, be transacted by a non-banking institution. But, whatever happens, these non-banking institutions must obtain a licence to transact the range of operations listed in the Law on Banks and Banking in the Russian Federation. A mistake was made right at the start. When the GMM firm registered itself, the organization that registered it should have read through its rules. These rules mention operations that come under the Law on Banking. Before issuing a certificate of registration, this organization should have asked for a banking licence. However, this question is not worth the candle. It would have been enough for the GMM firm to apply to the Central Bank and it would have received this licence -- provided, of course, all the documents were in order. Then none of this fuss, so to speak, would ever have happened.
