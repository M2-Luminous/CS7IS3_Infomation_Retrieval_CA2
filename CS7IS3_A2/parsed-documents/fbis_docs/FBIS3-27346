One of China's provinces piloting in the reform of the land use system, Fujian leased out the rights to use 450 plots of land with a combined area of more than 600 hectares, which were valued at 5.5 billion yuan (632 million U.S. dollars). According to Ye Wenjian, director of the provincial land administration, the prices for land-leasing are becoming more and more scientific and rational; and the transactions of land-use rights are being undertaken according to law. Ye noted that Fujian will adopt a series of measures to standardize the land property market this year. The province will form a fair market competition mechanism to change the conventional government allocation of land to the paid transfer of land-use rights through bidding and auction.
