Meanwhile, the 10 enterprises raised about 1 billion yuan last year for technical transformation and expansion of production. A Tianjin government official said that the city started converting enterprises into joint stock companies in 1992. Now the city has 58 standard joint stock companies and hundreds of partnership companies. They include state enterprises in the manufacturing, commerce, communications and transportation, and real estate sectors. Three of the 58 companies have gone public and 32 are liability limited companies. Tianjin is one of the most important industrial bases in north China. The introduction of the joint stock system will help the enterprises to face the market, enhance their decision-making power and increase funds directed toward technological transformation and production. This year, the city will select 30 others from its 100 large- and medium-sized state enterprises to try the modern enterprise system.
