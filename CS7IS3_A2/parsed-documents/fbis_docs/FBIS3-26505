A council task force formed to evaluate the impact of GATT on the local economy said, though, that the rice-growing sector won't be as negatively affected as at first thought. Taiwan is expected to become a signatory to GATT by the end of the year. Council Vice Chairman Hsue Chih said stock breeders and fruit farmers will be most affected by GATT membership, as the international trade body will require Taiwan to slash tariffs on farm products and abolish its quota system and import limitations. Taiwan's gradual opening of its rice market, along with subsidiary payments to rice farmers, should keep the impact of GATT on those farmers to a minimum Hsue said.
