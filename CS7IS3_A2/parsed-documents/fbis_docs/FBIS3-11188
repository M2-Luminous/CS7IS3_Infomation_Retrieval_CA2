On 8 March, Oscar Espinoza Villareal, finance secretary for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, denied reports that his party had a special fund for the business sector to make donations to Luis Donaldo Colosio's presidential campaign. During a meeting of the PRI National Territorial Movement, Espinoza said "his party does not depend solely on the business sector for funds, and it would not use the sector as a means of finding other sources." He called on party leaders "to be wise in spending campaign money so as to prevent misunderstandings." (Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 9 Mar 94 p 11A) On 10 March, PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio met with trade and service leaders in Mexico City and offered to deregulate certain areas of the government bureaucracy which affects them. He said he would set "clear rules to eliminate subjective decisions and extensively simplify the tax process." He asked the leaders to present proposals during the campaign. Through dialogue, he said, "I want to find the best ways for the country to move into the 21st Century as a more sovereign and just nation." In addressing unemployment and the contribution of small and medium enterprise, he affirmed that "more guarantees should be offered for those who take the risk to invest." (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 5) On 10 March, PRI Candidate Colosio met with hundreds of radio and television industry businessmen, executives, and workers. He told them that "Mexico is a more informed, demanding, and critical nation." Therefore, he added, "information is fundamental for transforming Mexico." He said: "PRI and its presidential candidate are not afraid of political competition, but we do fear political incompetence." Pointing out that PRI was the first to call a debate, he said: "We want Mexican men and women to have access to better information to make their decisions." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 1430 GMT 11 Mar 94) PRI Candidate Luis Colosio attended several events on 10 March, including breakfast with the Rotary Club, lunch with party leaders, and dinner with members of the Mexican-Lebanese community. The message was the same at all three: Mexico has set its course, and that course will lead to social well-being. "I believe we must look toward our grass-roots communities," he said, "because nothing grows from the sky down. Everything grows from the ground up." (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 12 Mar 94) Luis Colosio visited Nuevo Leon University on 14 March. There he said that "Mexico requires a gradual democratic transformation. Pluralism is what makes us stronger." He stressed that in such a system "all Mexicans will have the wonderful opportunity to decide and to elect." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 1430 GMT 15 mar) On 9 March upon arrival in Monterrey for a meeting with university students, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate for the Party of the Democratic Revolution, PRD, said his party is totally independent from the government system. He expressed regret that there were no other independent candidates or parties, except for Pablo Emilio Madero, who is running for the National Opposition Union. He said Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party, PAN, and Rafael Aguilar Talamantes of the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, PFCRN, are playing the government's game. The meeting between Cardenas and the students took place at the Monterrey Technological Institute and was broadcast by satellite to several other universities throughout the country. He said: "Social spending should be planned responsibly, effectively, and efficiently, and without political conditions. This is the area that has seen the least progress in the past few years." He added that "inefficiency, corruption, waste, and selectiveness has been the general tone" in this area. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 10 Mar 94) PRD Candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas addressed proposals presented by the business sector on 9 March. "I do not know all the details," he stated, "but I am pleased that they agree with what I, as the candidate of the country's democratic forces, have been proposing to save our economy. I hope the business sector is, as they say, determined to offer their help in saving the country." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 1430 GMT 11 mar 94) PAN presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos and presidential candidate Jorge Gonzalez Torres, for the Mexican Green Ecologist Party, PEM, visited the National Autonomous University on 11 March. Fernandez de Cevallos spoke to chemistry students and said the nation's universities should serve as forums for political debate between presidential candidates. He said there should be better ties between the business sector and the universities to enhance specific areas of study. Meanwhile, PEM candidate Gonzalez Torres met with political science students and warned that Chiapas is an example of what can happen when there is no authentic democratic expression. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 11 Mar 94) Jorge Gonzalez Torres was formally registered on 14 March as the presidential candidate for the PEM. After the ceremony, he suggested holding a runoff election for the August contest. Gonzalez said: "It would be very good for Mexico." "If none of the candidates get 40 percent of the vote," he explained, "a run off election should be held. If the abstention rate reaches 30 or 40 percent, the number of votes that the winner receives would still be small, but never less than 20 percent." (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 15 Mar 94) On 10 March, Pablo Emilio Madero registered as the Mexican Democratic Party's presidential candidate for the August election. Following his presentation at the Federal Electoral Institute, Madero said: "We should think about electoral code reforms for the future. We can meditate, discuss, and implement them later, but it will not be possible for this election." He also spoke in favor of appointing electoral prosecutors to prosecute electoral crimes.
