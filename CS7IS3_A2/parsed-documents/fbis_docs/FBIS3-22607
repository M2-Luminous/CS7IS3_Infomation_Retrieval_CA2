Pahang state director of medical and health services, Dr. R. Mahadevan, however, said it is difficult to control them, as they seldom stayed in one place for long. Dr. Mahadevan said another source of malaria was the Orang Asli [aborigines] in the interior areas. They, too, move from place to place. Pahang has the second highest rate of malaria cases after Sabah.
