FBIS3-4679 "dreas040__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-040-A Document Type:Daily Report 1 March 1994 ANNEX Japan U.S. Unofficially Demands Measures OW0103044794 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 26 Feb 84 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0103044794 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] It was disclosed on 25 February that the United States unofficially delivered requests which the United States expects Japan to incorporate into voluntary market opening measures it has started to map out. Among other things, the main points of the U.S. requests are: 1) to significantly increase the budget for the fundamental 10-year project for public investment; 2) to voluntarily set a goal designed to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus; and 3) to front-load a plan to implement agreements, reached at the Japan-U.S. comprehensive trade talks, regarding priority areas of negotiations. The United States is assuming a stance of "watching the situation because Japan is voluntarily preparing measures," (according to a U.S. Government source). Because of this, the United States did not make an official request in writing. However, it is said that the United States unofficially informed Japan, through several channels, including the Japanese Embassy in the United States, that the United States is "very much interested in Japan's voluntary measures." On 25 February, the Japanese Government decided to prepare market opening measures before the end of March by holding meetings, which will be attended by the appropriate ministers. However, since the United States conveyed the requests, the focal point has moved to how many of the U.S. requests the market opening measures will reflect. The fundamental plan for public investments, which the United States is interested in, is designed to spend 430 trillion yen over the 10 year period starting in fiscal 1991. However, the United States wants Japan to significantly increase this amount, saying that it is not enough to reduce Japan's trade surplus. According to a U.S. Treasury Department calculation, the rate of public investments in the GNP will become lower than the current rate should Japan keep the 430 trillion yen. The same department also says that the current public investment rate will be maintained if 100 trillion yen is added. The United States has not disclosed the actual amount of increase it wants Japan to make. However, on the basis of the calculation by the Treasury Department, it seems that the United States thinks that an increase of 100 trillion yen is needed.
