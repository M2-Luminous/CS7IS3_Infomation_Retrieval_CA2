According to our information, the visit by the Defense Ministry political leadership and the National Guard General Staff military leaders falls within the framework of checking out sources for the military strengthening of the National Guard. The same sources also place the visit to Russia within the current government's efforts to purchase better weapons systems and other materiel for Cyprus' defense at the lowest possible prices now that the Government has decided to cease dealing with the French company SOFMA [French Weapons Equipment Company]. It is further noted that the Cypriot side will primarily focus on gathering information. This will not be limited to some specific weapons which the National Guard has in mind, but will also cover the technical support to be given in the event there are some purchases. We should also note that Russia and some other countries of the former Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc have informed the government that they would agree to payment through offset trade, that is, payment with Cypriot products.
