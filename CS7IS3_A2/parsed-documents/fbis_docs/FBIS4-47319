Sirotkin; UDC 621.039] [Abstract] This paper proposes a model describing the deformation and destruction of heat-releasing elements due to a pulsed energy release which arises in an uncontrolled release of positive reactivity into a reactor. The pulse is less than one second long. It is assumed that the jacket is destroyed by high-speed deformation due to internal pressure. In addition to pressure due to heating and evaporation of water, this paper also considers thermal expansion, fusion of fuel, and the presence of gas in the gap and within the fuel. A single approach is used to describe the dynamics of heat-releasing element behavior (in particular, the increase in internal pressure) and the threshold value of destruction in relation to energy release pulse parameters and the initial state of the heat-releasing element. Model figures agree with theoretical values for pressure amplitude and the onset of heat-releasing element destruction. As the proportion of gas increases, the threshold of destruction increases. The threshold power of the burst decreases as pulse length increases. Figures 4; table 1; references 9: 3 Russian, 6 Western.
