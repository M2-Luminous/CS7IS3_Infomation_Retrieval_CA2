Conaco contends that in light of its dependence, the government has pushed its commitment to pay the foreign debt to the limit, thus postponing every serious attempt at reactivating the economy to improve the people's standard of living through a massive program and fair salaries, as well as an equitable distribution of wealth. Conaco hopes that there may still be time "to replace these evil intentions" with good ones that would meet the Peruvian people's just aspirations for a better future. The statement notes that Conaco has unsuccessfully recommended that the government introduce a number of corrective measures into its economic stabilization program. Conaco adds that the letter of intent reveals that the Minimum Income Tax will be maintained, that no new tax stabilization contracts will be signed, that no new free trade zones will be created, that the prices of fuels and public utilities will be increased, that Sunat [National Tax Administration Superintendency] will tighten its control of taxpayers, and so forth. The statement adds that the government is using only $250 million of its privatization proceeds in social investments, and that part of these resources are instead being used to pay the foreign debt. Similarly, Conaco adds, the government will consolidate all of its custom tariffs at 15 percent in 1995, and will further increase its foreign debt by financing programs to restructure the current debt. Conaco states that the government insists on maintaining a rigid concept in its economic stabilization program, which is precisely the pivotal cause of the current recessive economic process "that brings about extreme poverty and unemployment." The statement notes that Conaco has requested the elimination of the Minimum Income Tax because this is an across the board tax that affects 2 percent of company assets. Conaco has also unsuccessfully demanded the reduction of the General Sales Tax and the Selective Consumers Tax as major steps toward reversing the shrinking of the market and boosting domestic production.
