Aguinaldo] [Text] The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has deactivated 25 companies of the controversial Citizen's Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) for the first quarter of this year as a result of the continuing decline in strength of different rebel and terrorist groups. According to a military report obtained by BUSINESS WORLD, CAFGU strength has been cut to 65,836 from the 67,691 militiamen in the beginning of 1994. The AFP said the dismantling of the units, composed of civilians trained by the military to assist in the fight against communist rebels in the countryside, was another proof they are consistently gaining the upper hand in military offensives. The CAFGU's have been tagged as notorious human rights violators, prompting several Congressmen to last year file a resolution for inquiry on the former's performance and abuses. [sentence as published] Several units were identified in the past as serving known politicians, businessmen and landlords in the provinces, even as complaints were received by various cause-oriented groups. However, the AFP said that during the latter part of last year, it had moved for the improvement in the training and motivation of CAFGU volunteers in order to prevent similar incidents. The AFP, in fact, said it had received no reports of human rights violations committed by soldiers and militiamen this year. Sources at Camp Aguinaldo said the decline can be attributed to the easing up of the situation in the countryside plus the training and education. For 1994, militiamen were instructed to provide security in areas cleared by the AFP and the Philippine National Police (PNP) and to limit the conduct of combat operations. At present, there are 956 CAFGU companies with a total strength of 65,836 deployed in 9,249 barangays [village] nationwide. More units are scheduled to be deactivated in the coming years under a plan that aims to reduce CAFGU's to zero before 1999. The same report said the decline of the threat from the Communist Party of the Philippines and the objective of transferring the counter-insurgency responsibility to the PNP next year should further enhance the good performance of CAFGU's for the remaining months of this year.
