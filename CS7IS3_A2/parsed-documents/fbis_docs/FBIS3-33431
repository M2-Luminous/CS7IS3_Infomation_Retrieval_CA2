A government cannot spend all its time dealing with the day-to-day business of the state. But the path must be cleared before the president appoints a prime minister. General Cedras must step down first. Everybody knows that the Malval government failed because the Army and the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti members prevented it from functioning.
