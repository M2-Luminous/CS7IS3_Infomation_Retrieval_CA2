Concerning the problem of security, the situation remains confused in some estates of Bujumbura, notably at Cibitoke, Kamenge, and Gikungu where gunfire was heard last night. We contacted the commander of the 2d Intervention Battalion, Commander Appolinaire Ndayizamba, who described to us the situation in the northern section of the town last night. Commander Ndayizamba answers questions from our colleague, Gregoire Nijimbere: [Begin recording] [Ndayizamba] In the course of last night, we heard sporadic shooting, notably from Gikungu, Gihosha, Cibitoke, and Kinama districts of Bujumbura. I must tell you that even if [word indistinct] conditions include leaving the Kamenge area, this is not good enough, as long as these people are not disarmed because those who acquired weapons did so for their own aims. [passage omitted]. [Nijimbere] You were requested to withdraw, but after the meeting between the prime minister and the president you were requested to deploy wherever necessary and to intervene swiftly, and to withdraw once security is restored. We would like to know your reaction. Does this make your task of restoring peace easier or does it complicate it? [Ndayizamba] [passage omitted] We believe that the decision is a political one. Those (?who made) it probably thought that those shooting would stop but the fact is that they are continuing to shoot. What we can say is that as long as these people, who I would describe as.... [pauses] Well, these people who are using weapons. As long as they are not disarmed, security will continue to be problematic. [Nijimbere] It seems two grenades exploded in the Gikungu area. I would like to know about the situation there. [Ndayizamba] The current situation there is that there were some gunshots, some shots with handguns. Grenades were launched with grenade launchers, rather, they were [word indistinct] shells. There were no casualties among the Gikungu area residents. After the shots -- I believe it was at 2000 -- there were no further shots. The rebels withdrew, probably towards the mountains, or hiding places, probably (?Kamenge). [end recording]
