During the talks Estrada reaffirmed his government's "one-China" policy, and Rong expressed his appreciation for this. Estrada said that the Philippine economic and cultural ties with Taiwan are confined to the non-governmental level. The Philippine Government adheres to its firm promise made in a communique signed between the two countries in 1975 and to its consistent stand that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China, and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. During the talks, which lasted for over an hour, Rong and Estrada exchanged views on bilateral issues and regional and other international issues of common concern. Rong spoke highly of the development of bilateral friendly ties over the past few years, adding that China and the Philippines are close neighbors, and leaders of the two countries have exchanged visits frequently. He noted that gratifying results have been made in bilateral exchanges and cooperation in the fields of politics, economy, trade, and science and technology as well as culture since the two countries established diplomatic relations 19 years ago. He said China places great importance on developing its trade and economic cooperation with the Philippines, and encourages Chinese industrialists and businessmen to conduct varied ways of cooperation in the Philippines. Rong said that the cooperation of Philippine industrialists and businessmen is also welcomed by China. He said he was convinced that, with joint efforts, Sino- Philippine relations will grow in depth. Estrada said he was satisfied with the growth of bilateral friendly ties and cooperation, and said he hoped that his visit would contribute to furthering such a relationship. He said he wished to increase the volume of bilateral trade and welcomed more Chinese entrepreneurs to invest in his country. During the talks Estrada invited Rong to visit the Philippines, and Rong accepted the invitation with pleasure.
