"We cannot sacrifice our nuclear programme for these. If we do not get them we have other options and we will make alternate arrangements," he added. In an exclusive interview with this correspondent at the Air Headquarter, the PAF chief said "we are looking for multi-functional planes which are readily available." He disagreed with the suggestion that the defence capability of the Air Force will suffer a setback as F-16 have become part of the national psyche and said that we have blown the qualities of the aircraft and of proportion. [sentence as published] He said that although the F-16 was a good plane but it does not mean that our Air Force would be incapacitated without them. To another question about the possibility of acquiring MiG-2000, SU-27 or MiG-29, the PAF chief said that we should not take hasty decisions on replacing F-16s. "We have to make a choice keeping in view our needs for the next 25 years and considering all technical aspects." Replying to another question, the Air Chief Marshal said that Mirage-2000-5 was still in its infancy and it would take at least three to four years for this aircraft to roll out of the assembly plant. He revealed that Taiwan was likely to be the first recipient of the plane in 1998. "Our priority is to opt for the planes which could be delivered immediately," he added. The Air Chief was of the view that nuclear programme and F-16 were absolutely different issues and these should not be intermingled "Our stand and that of the govt on the issue is similar," he added. He dismissed the suggestion of kickbacks in defence deals and said that the role of the PAF comes to an end the moment choice of planes is made. The PAF chief said the defence of Kahuta [nuclear power plant] was in safe hands and keeping in view the probable dangers defence of the vital national project has been made impregnable and so one can dare violate Kahuta air space. [sentence as published] He said no one wanted war. "Wars take place where diplomacy falls and our diplomacy is moving in the right direction. However if war was thrust on us, we are fully prepared to repulse aggression and are capable of defending the motherland," he added. He said that the six K-8 trainer aircraft have been acquired from China to fill in the gap created by American T-37 which have been returned after expiry of the lease period.
