In a letter sent to the president of the Legislative Assembly, the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce asked for the rejection of the bill as approved in a first debate by the Education Committee, and it called for modifications presented by the Panamanian Broadcasting Association (APR) and the Panamanian Radio Chamber. The APR also sent a letter to the assembly's Board of Directors asking for a rejection of the copyright bill because it contains regulations that violate freedom of speech and threaten the economic stability of radio stations. Meanwhile, the Education Committee, which asked for the approval of the bill in its second and third debates, said the bill takes steps to protect all types of literary, artistic, and scientific works in light of the fact that author rights constitute the basic foundation for stimulating national creativity. The commission said another reason for endorsing the bill was Panama's current position in the international community, because Panama has signed a number of agreements requiring it to protect national works.
