Lysenko"] [Text] On 19 January a trial began in the military court of the Warsaw Military District which attracted the close attention of the mass media not only of Poland but also of other countries. SBU [Security Service of Ukraine] Major Anatoliy Lysenko and Polish citizen Janusz Bojarski, accused of espionage activities against Poland, are on trial. According to the official version of the Polish military prosecutor's office, which has been carried by the mass media, Ukrainian intelligence officer A. Lysenko engaged in espionage activities against Poland and recruited J. Bojarski as a secret agent. The latter passed on to A. Lysenko information on so-called "white intelligence," in particular "on the economic and political situation in eastern voivodships, theological seminaries, the bishops of Przemysl, and so on." Immediately after the arrest of Major A. Lysenko (which took place on 23 August 1993), the Embassy of Ukraine in Poland established contact with him, and literally from the first to the last day regularly held meetings and conversations with representatives of the Polish authorities at the highest levels, including ministers, the general prosecutor, and the heads of relevant services, demanding the release of the Ukrainian officer, who had been arrested without grounds. The leadership of the Security Service of Ukraine, which sent three letters to the relevant Polish organs, resolutely demanded that Major A. Lysenko be released. Two notes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine were presented to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland; the notes warned about the possible consequences of the irresponsible actions of Polish special services. The Embassy of Ukraine in Poland also sent one note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland. Unfortunately, all these measures produced no results. What was the basis for the conviction of the Ukrainian side that Major A. Lysenko was arrested without grounds, and for this reason should be freed immediately? Major A. Lysenko is a rank-and-file associate of the Mostisskiy Rayon Department of the Administration of the Security Service of Ukraine for Lvov Oblast. He was never involved in any intelligence activities and did not accomplish any tasks or special assignments of an intelligence nature. As a rayon-level employee, he had functional responsibility for putting an end to smuggling and other criminal activities in the border rayon, as well as for reviewing issues associated with rehabilitation of the victims of political repression. His arrest as a spy cannot even be considered a misunderstanding or a consequence of the Polish special services being poorly informed. This looks much like a provocation, the objective of which is to sow discord in Polish-Ukrainian relations, whose favorable development is disliked by some. Staff members of the Ukrainian Embassy in the Republic of Poland met with A. Lysenko seven times in prison in Rzeszow and in prison in Warsaw on the eve of the trial. He gave the impression of being a depressed, broken, and very frightened or perhaps terrorized man. He was very concerned about the fate of his seriously ill 14-year-old son. He said that he was being intimidated with imprisonment for many years, and with being punished even more severely in Ukraine if he returned there. During one of the visits he said that it had been suggested that he renounce his Ukrainian citizenship. In return for this, he would be freed, would be able to stay in Poland and bring his family over. The question arises of whether Major Lysenko was arrested with a view to forcing him to betray the motherland, or whether the special services invented this later as a salutary way out of the unenviable situation they found themselves in when they failed to fabricate a "spy" case. The military court considering the case of A. Lysenko and J. Bojarski announced that the trial would be open and allowed journalists to attend the trial. The court rejected the protest of the prosecutor, after all. Perhaps the prosecutor did not want witnesses to see a "spy affair" that has been inflated by the mass media to the level of an international scandal turn into a ridiculous farce. Both defendants categorically rejected the charges of not only spying but also any other activity to the detriment of the Polish state. During the initial days of the trial, the court cross-examined defendants J. Bojarski and A. Lysenko. The entire case was clarified in the course of the cross-examination. Toward the end of 1992 a serious crime was committed in Mostisskiy Rayon: Copper contacts were ripped off the rail joints on a two-kilometer stretch of the railway. Major Lysenko looked into this case. Aware that this crime was committed for the purpose of selling copper to Polish smugglers, he began to pay close attention to citizens of the neighboring state. In January 1993 he noticed two Polish "tourists" hiding scrap copper under the seat. Having memorized the license number of one car, he gave instructions that it be stopped at the border crossing in Sheginy. The person detained turned out to be Janusz Bojarski, a small-time Polish smuggler from the small border town of Radymno. The major let him go, but gave him his telephone number and asked him to call when he was next in Mostiska. The major had one goal: to get through Bojarski to the sources of supply of nonferrous metals for Polish smugglers in Mostisskiy Rayon. Besides, he wanted to determine which of the Ukrainian customs officers were allowing the contraband through in exchange for bribes. The major did not manage to uncover the nonferrous metals thieves. However, a good relationship developed between him and Bojarski based on mutual services. A. Lysenko gave J. Bojarski passes with which the latter went through customs out of turn (at the time one would have to wait two or three days in line), while Bojarski brought the major citrus fruit for his sick son and merchandise from Poland. Polish special services learned about the contacts between Bojarski and the SBU officer, and he was arrested in June 1993. On 23 August 1993 Major Lysenko and his entire family went to Przemysl, where his son was supposed to be seen by a Polish specialist before surgery (already his fourth). He was arrested by functionaries of the Polish Security Service immediately at the border crossing. He was accused of recruiting Bojarski as a secret agent, directing his espionage activities, and receiving needed information. The charges of espionage against A. Lysenko and J. Bojarski are absurd. However, it was important to someone that this case be widely publicized through the mass media and presented in the light of a sensational espionage affair. It was precisely in this context that Ostankino also reported it, even after the second day of the proceedings, after the entire case had been clarified.
