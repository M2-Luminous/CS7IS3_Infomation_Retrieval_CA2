In a speech at the Washington ball of the Turkish-American Friendship Council, where he was the guest of honor, Karayalcin said peoples of many races and ethnic background have been living in Anatolia and the Middle East for hundreds of years. This created the mosaic we have today, he added. Karayalcin stressed that any border changes that might take place in the region from now on will create great problems. That is why, he stated, it is of great importance to protect Iraq's territorial integrity. Karayalcin pointed out that it will be a grave mistake to confuse the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorism with the Kurdish problem. Turkey is determined to end PKK terrorism, he stressed. Karayalcin will conclude his contacts in the United States and leave Washington today.
