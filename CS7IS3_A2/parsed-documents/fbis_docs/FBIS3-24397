What was most important for your professional career? And whom do you feel yourself to be? [Lukin] It's hard to say. It all happened spontaneously. As they say, "Fate leads those who agree and drags those who disagree." In my case, it either led or dragged me, but I didn't resist. As for whom I feel myself to be... Perhaps, first of all, "a citizen of the place where I live, but at the same time, a grain of sand of the Universe." One of my detractors said, aptly, "Vladimir Petrovich sees life as if he were looking out of the window of a speeding train." A desire to be inside life, "in a situation," and at the same time to look at it as it were from outside is, I think a good, useful quality. [Denisova] In 1968, when you were working in Prague at the international magazine, PROBLEMS OF PEACE AND SOCIALISM, you spoke out against the introduction of soviet troops into Czechoslovakia, for which you were deported to the USSR. For more than 11 years you were under a travel ban. [Lukin] There were several of us then who were "ceremoniously" dispatched to Moscow. In the same plane with us was Misha Polyakov, a nice guy, a specialist on America. There were also Kirill Khenkin and his wife Ira Kanevskaya--they are now working at Radio Liberty in Munich. There were others, as well. [Denisova] The last two years you were the Russian ambassador in the United States. What were you able and not able to achieve during your ambassadorship? [Lukin] An ambassador's is a bureaucratic job. Although I respect the ambassador's mission, I would say that in many ways it is a symbiosis of a postman and a waiter "with airs." A postman, because you get a communication from Moscow, with a list of whom to deliver it to, and what to say in the process. People in the host country are interested not in your personal opinion, which you are free to express unofficially: an ambassador is obligated to communicate the point of view of his country's official circles, the president or foreign minister. Well, and a waiter, because you continuously have to meet and treat high-ranking delegations. [Denisova] And were you successful? [Lukin] The first thing I managed was to master the ambassador's trade. I had specialized in international affairs and for a time worked on the central staff of the Foreign Ministry, but I had never been an ambassador. In Washington it took time for me to get to know the "thousand details" of the operation of a large embassy with a complex staff. The second thing I managed was to create an image of an authentic representative of our country during the time I represented it. I was, after all, the first Russian ambassador since 1917. Besides, I represented it during a period of development of democratic structures in our country. I have at home a U.S. diplomat of the year award. The means the Americans felt my work was successful. And third, I managed to establish good contacts with our compatriots. They saw me off literally with tears in their eyes. Yet until recently they would give a wide berth to our embassy. During that time I got to know the work of the Foreign Ministry's central staff fairly well. Alas, it is in constant turmoil, with endless restructuring and reorganizations. Does this serve any useful purpose? In both the central and foreign staffs discipline and interest in diplomatic work have declined sharply. Personnel policy is in disarray, and some appointments are simply bewildering. In addition, there is a lack of coordination or sense of cohesion in the work of one of the country's most important ministries. And, incidentally, with one of the smallest, if not the smallest staffs: there are less than 3,000 diplomatic personnel. In other words, something which was always very important to me and without which it is difficult to achieve good results is lacking: a cohesive, smoothly functioning "team" at both the lower and upper levels of the ministry. [Denisova] Your differences with Andrey Kozyrev are known, especially concerning views on the development of relations with the United States and the West as a whole. [Lukin] What can I say... When I am asked if I have differences with Kozyrev I say, no, and none are possible. One's opinions may differ from those of a person who has opinions of his own. But what if he changes them every three months? What differences can there be in that case? Whoever is interested in this can compare what I said six months or a year ago with what I am saying now. And what Kozyrev has said during the same time. Everything will become clear. I have not changed my views and am not changing them now. The situation developed in such a way that in his address to the Federal Assembly the president sharply criticized our diplomacy; he said what I have been saying over the last two or two and a half years. I am very pleased that our views coincide. Although I wouldn't like to look like the frog that says, "It was my idea! It was my idea!" I simply want our foreign policy to be independent, active, and show initiative. That it be given its due in the world and, most important, by our people. A good example, albeit an exception, that confirms the rule was our initiative in the Bosnian crisis. I suggested something. That "something" was taken up by the president and, in words, by the foreign minister. It would be alright if it had ended in a handshake with Kozyrev, as is customary in civilized society. But then a series of intrigues began... That, however, is not so important, the case isn't mortal. [Denisova] As I recall, it was not without your help that Kozyrev became foreign minister. [Lukin] Yes, I recommended him to Yeltsin. Actually, I recommended two people. Kozyrev was the second, but the first had declined. [Denisova] You just visited the United States with a Russian parliamentary delegation, you met with congressmen, diplomats, military people. Did you gain the impression that the latest events would substantially harm Russian-American relations for a considerable time? [Lukin] The problem is that our diplomacy made some very serious mistakes, moreover, of a conceptual nature. Currently they are being overcome on the conceptual level. But the Americans have already grown used to our smiling, passive, doting, a priori agreement with them, and it is hard for them to readjust. That is why we are now doomed to a period (not very long, I think) of heightened nervousness and some controversy. I don't believe that there will be any marked deterioration of relations; there is no reason for that. But there will be a period of painful acceptance by the United States that Russia is a state which also has its national interests. [Denisova] This is the second time you are heading a parliamentary foreign affairs committee. Is the committee capable, in the current situation, of influencing the formulation of the country's foreign policy and changing the situation in the Foreign Ministry? [Lukin] The unhealthy situation in the Foreign Ministry has developed primarily because it is deteriorating as a highly professional collective; 500 active professional workers left it last year alone. The Foreign Ministry should work as a cohesive collective, not as a "group of comrades" consisting of 7-8 people who make foreign policy while flying constantly from one airport to another. There should be concern for people in both the material and every other sense, but for that it is necessary to be "in the business" at least sometimes. Otherwise the diplomatic service will collapse completely. If the best forces leave, in future we will have no high-quality diplomacy. So far I don't know how to help solve this problem at the present stage, because under the current constitution the committee has no oversight functions with respect to the Foreign Ministry. However, we will, of course, do all we can for its personnel. As for our influence in the formulation of foreign policy per se, it will be realized in strict accordance with the constitution. During the election campaign I criticized some of its provisions, but once it has been adopted it must be obeyed. Under the Constitution the president determines and conducts foreign policy with the help of the Foreign Ministry. In this sense there should be no competition or attempts to invade their authority on the part of the Duma. At the same time, the Duma ratifies foreign treaties. Ratification is a powerful lever for influencing foreign policy. If its formulation is approached constructively, in the spirit of cooperation of the branches of power--which I would like very much--then we will be consulted before signing a treaty or agreement. Then we will be able to suggest what should or should not be done for the ratification of a document to proceed smoothly. [Denisova] But so far they seem to get along without your advice? [Lukin] Yes, if you have in mind the treaty with Georgia. They signed it first and only then realized that it would be very difficult to have it ratified. As a result, the president decided to temporarily postpone ratification. I hope they will eventually understand in the Foreign Ministry that it doesn't pay to bypass the parliament. I would also like to note that the appointment and recalling of envoys is done by the president after consultations with the appropriate committees of the Federal Assembly. The consultation mechanism is currently being worked out and should soon be put into effect. For example, as soon as I returned to Moscow (that was before the president's decree to recall me from the United States) I gathered the committee to approve my being relieved of my duties. We then sent an appropriate document to the president's office, after which the decree was issued. We shall continue in future to work in accordance with regulations, and the Foreign Ministry and president's office will, perhaps, submit their comments and suggestions to us. I hope we establish mutual understanding and effective cooperation with them.
