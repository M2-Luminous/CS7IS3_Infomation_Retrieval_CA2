Instead of appearing as scheduled at 1800 hours, which was put off first until 2000 hours and then until 2100 hours, he arrived at the meeting with journalists only at 2300 hours on Tuesday [22 March]. Only the hardest of the diehards were still waiting. We did not wait in vain. Just 20 minutes before the IMF delegation appeared in the hall of the Zubovskiy Boulevard Press Center, Mr. Camdessus revealed, he and Viktor Chernomyrdin had signed a joint statement. The theme running through it was the idea that the Russian Government has decided to take additional steps to mobilize income for the 1994 budget. In the next few days work should be completed on the compilation of a joint government and Central Bank memorandum on the Russian leadership's economic policy for all of 1994. Following this, the managing director [Camdessus] will be prepared to recommend that the IMF Board of Directors ratify the decision to release to Russia the second tranche of the $1.5-billion Systemic Transformations Facility. Thus, realistically, the loan will become available during April, in M. Camdessus' opinion. In other words, the mechanism for releasing the second tranche of the loan remains in principle the same as the one used to allocate the first tranche last June. The situation in the Russian economy a year ago was hardly any better than it is today. The composition of the government has changed. This may have influenced the talks. The size of the budget deficit and the inflation rate at year's end were the stumbling blocks in the long discussions between the IMF chief and the prime minister and other government members. The lack of coordination between approaches and assessments initially created a sense of deadlock -- something which was reported by most of the Russian and foreign media. Yet a specific result was objectively needed by both partners. V. Chernomyrdin's government needed it in order to assert its reformist image in the eyes of the international community following the departure of the reformers; the IMF needed it so as not to face an onslaught for the umpteenth time from the critics of its policy toward Russia both within the country itself and in the West. It was this convergence of interests that ultimately resulted in the positive outcome. "We do not have a single major problem left," Michel Camdessus stated following the signing of the joint statement. So just why did the Russian budget start looking better to the IMF chief at the last minute -- where did its extra revenue come from? Necessary amendments, he explained, will be forthcoming in previously highlighted areas -- certain dates for the receipt of specific revenues will be amended, and individual tariffs and taxes will be reviewed. Mr. Camdessus admitted that it has always been difficult to collect taxes in Russia and to obtain other revenue for the budget. Russians will now be helped to remedy this state of affairs by IMF experts -- fiscal texts will be drawn up more exactly, and a number of additional measures to enhance the effectiveness of the tax system will also be outlined. The draft Russian budget faces one further test in the next few days -- ratification by the Duma. Budgets generally find it hard going to pass through any parliament in the world, the IMF managing director noted. In order to get a better idea of the Russian budget's chances, he also met with Ivan Rybkin and Sergey Glazyev. In M. Camdessus' opinion, the parliamentarians are prepared to adopt the budget, although there will probably be some problems.
