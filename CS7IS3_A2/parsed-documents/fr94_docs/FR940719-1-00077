FR940719-1-00077 FR940719-1-00015 As with the existing standard, proposed paragraph (f)(1) would require one escapeway that is ventilated with intake air to be designated as the primary escapeway. The proposed requirement for prohibiting certain equipment from operating in primary escapeways in paragraphs (f)(3) through (f)(5) would not apply to areas of escapeways where separation of belt and trolley haulage entries from designated primary escapeways did not exist before November 16, 1992. To require mobile equipment in these areas of escapeways to be equipped with fire suppression would have no appreciable safety benefit because of the presence of trolley wires, trolley haulage equipment, and conveyor belts in these escapeways. Paragraph (f)(3) of the proposal would clarify existing requirements by explicitly prohibiting coal haulage in the primary escapeway. The existing standard permits equipment to be in the escapeway for purposes of hauling miners and materials and for maintaining the escapeway. The existing standard does not expressly prohibit the haulage of coal in the primary escapeway. As a matter of clarification of intent, the proposal would specifically prohibit coal haulage in the primary escapeway. Through experience with the existing rule and after considering comments received, the Agency is proposing to extend the prohibition of certain equipment to other areas of primary escapeways so that the prohibitions would properly extend to the majority of primary escapeways. The proposal would extend the prohibitions to areas of primary escapeways developed prior to November 16, 1992 where separation of the escapeway from belt and trolley haulage entries existed as of November 16, 1992. As with the existing rule, the prohibition would not apply to equipment necessary to maintain the primary escapeway in safe, travelable condition. The primary escapeways excluded from these prohibitions are the same as those excluded from the application of §75.380(g), that is, areas of escapeways where separation of belt and trolley haulage entries from designated primary escapeways did not exist before November 16, 1992. Comments are solicited on the proposed expansion of the requirements for protecting additional areas of the primary escapeway. MSHA recognizes the need to protect the primary escapeway and also realizes that different mine designs, the need to maintain air courses safe for travel, and the need to occasionally move equipment necessitates the operation of some mobile equipment in the primary escapeway. MSHA would allow certain equipment in the primary escapeway but would require fire suppression systems on the equipment. Paragraph (f)(3) clarifies that mobile equipment not hauling coal and the equipment listed in §75.340(b)(1) through (b)(6) may be used in the primary escapeway. Unlike the existing standard, proposed paragraph (f)(4) would permit certain mobile equipment to be protected with a manual fire suppression system instead of an automatic system, provided it is continuously attended by a person trained and proficient in the use and operation of the fire suppression system. For the purposes of §75.380(f) by ``attended,'' the Agency means that the mobile equipment operator would be on the equipment and be capable of responding immediately in the event of a fire. When a piece of mobile equipment is in the primary escapeway and is properly attended and equipped with a manual fire suppression system, the equipment operator can immediately respond to the situation, and the safety afforded by the existing standard is maintained. However, if no one is attending the equipment, an automatic system would be necessary to protect against fire. Protection is thereby provided against a fire when a machine is deenergized or shut off. If a machine is solely equipped with a manual fire suppression system, continuous attendance would be required under the proposal, regardless of whether the machine were operating or shut off, if located in the primary escapeway. Following publication of the existing ventilation rule, some persons construed the requirement for an automatic fire suppression system to apply to electric face equipment. This was not the intent of the Agency. On November 16, 1992, MSHA issued Program Policy Letter No. P92&hyph;V&hyph;4 addressing the operation and location of equipment in primary escapeways to clarify the Agency's intent. Under existing regulation, subpart L_Fire Protection, face equipment is required to be protected by a manual fire suppression system. The proposal recognizes this requirement and, other than an exception to permit a situation such as the movement of continuous mining machines from section to section without a continuous water supply, requires that face equipment equipped with a manual fire suppression system be attended when in the primary escapeway by a person trained and proficient in the proper use and operation of the manual fire suppression system, providing protection equivalent to automatic fire suppression systems. It is proposed in paragraph (f)(4) that with exceptions for continuous mining machines and as provided in §75.380 (f)(5) and (f)(6) that each piece of mobile equipment in primary escapeways, (1) be equipped with manually operated fire suppression systems installed in compliance with §75.1107&hyph;3 through §75.1107&hyph;16 and be attended continuously, or (2) be equipped with an automatic fire suppression system that is capable of both automatic and manual activation and installed in compliance with §75.1107&hyph;3 through §75.1107&hyph;16. Under paragraph (f)(5), personnel carriers and small personnel conveyances which are designed and used solely for transportation of personnel and small hand tools could be operated with a multipurpose dry chemical type automatic fire suppression system capable of both manual and automatic activation, if the system is suitable for the intended application and listed or approved by a nationally recognized independent testing laboratory. The proposal recognizes the small size and limited potential for fire of this particular type of equipment. The types of machinery under paragraph (f)(5) would not be required to meet the additional requirements of §§75.1107&hyph;3 through 75.1107&hyph;16. For example, it would be impractical and would not enhance safety to apply the minimum dry chemical poundage requirements of §75.1107&hyph;9 to small equipment designed and used solely for personnel and small hand tools. Personnel carriers and small personnel conveyances would be more appropriately protected by fully automatic systems of adequate capacity which are suitable for the intended application and listed or approved by a nationally recognized independent testing laboratory.
