Mustafa Khamis, who was a member of the PFLP-GC Central Committee and member of the Palestine National Council, said today in Amman that he has decided, along with a group of the cadres operating in the territories, to split in the wake of severe financial and administrative corruption within PFLP-GC ranks. The group that split from the PFLP-GC, led by Mustafa Khamis, accuses Ahmad Jibril and the PFLP-GC leadership of no longer being able to run the PFLP-GC, saying their fighting is not in the interest of the Palestinian people and its cause. Khamis said Jibril's nationalist attitude and his arrogance have driven him to destroy the PFLP-GC, noting that the decision to split follows the failure of the PFLP-GC leaders to persuade Jibril to change his unilateral conduct during the meetings of the PFLP-GC Central Committee, held in Damascus last month.
