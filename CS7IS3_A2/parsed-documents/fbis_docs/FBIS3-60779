Bastos said that to repair the lines a program of rotational cuts of between 20 and 30 minutes has been prepared. In a news conference Bastos explained that last night, between 1945 and 2120, three different acts of sabotage were carried out on the power lines coming from the El Chocon and Salto Grande dams, leaving some 800,000 people in this capital and an unspecified number of inhabitants in the country's interior without electricity. Since repairing the damage will require between 24 and 48 hours, a plan of cuts in electricity service during "peak" consumption hours had to be implemented. Bastos denied that the cuts could be extended until 31 December. The secretary said the energy supply through a line that links the Salto Grande hydroelectric dam with the locality of Santo Tome, Corrientes Province, was interrupted at 1945 on 28 December. When the failure was investigated, it was discovered that it was caused by a chain thrown on the high-tension power line. Later, at 2020, a second sabotage was carried out, this time on a pylon for a power line from El Chocon, in a place called Unanue, near the intersection of National Route 35 and Provincial Route 215, La Pampa Province. In this manner, the power supply was cut from one of the lines that link the dam with the cities of Puelches (La Pampa) and Henderson (Buenos Aires). An hour later, at 2120, a third attack was recorded only 12 km from the site, on the other high-tension power line that runs parallel to the first. Bastos said that although the reasons are not known so far, he did not rule out the possibility that the objective of these attacks might be the "disruption of the development of events in the energy field or the total political environment" in the country. "So far we have no evidence to attribute the responsibility for these attacks, but we fully rule out that they could have been instigated by Light and Power Union leaders," Bastos said. He added: "Since the repair work will demand between 24 and 48 hours by the Transener company, it is probable that rotational cuts will take place during peak hours, affecting 2 percent of the demand." The plan for cuts has been imposed because "since the links with the generating plants are cut, the distribution companies are restricting the supply to preserve the system."
