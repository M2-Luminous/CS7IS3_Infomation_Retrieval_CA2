This statement was made yesterday to HA'ARETZ by Fatah member Sufiyan Abu-Zayida in reaction to a report by security elements on the emerging cooperation between Fatah Hawks squads and Hamas. "In their press interviews, Dr. Ibrahim Yazuri and Khalid al-Hindi have encouraged the Fatah Hawks to act against Israelis," said Abu-Zayida, the PLO liaison with the Israeli authorities. Yesterday he was mentioned as one of the young leaders who have lost control over the Hawks. "It stands to reason that if they meant to forge such cooperation, they would not run to the press with their remarks of encouragement. In my opinion, this is just a guess on the part of the Shin Bet." [passage omitted] A senior officer said yesterday that the experimental period in which the pursuit of Fatah members was discontinued in return for their stopping all terrorist activity failed and therefore was called off. [passage omitted] Over the past month, the security forces have resumed their efforts to capture Fatah activists. Their most recent operation on 3 February, in which senior Fatah activist Salim Mu'affi was killed, caused an uproar in Fatah. Faysal al-Husayni said last Sunday that the Palestinians never really accepted the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] proposal concerning fugitives, including the clause proposing that the fugitives lay down their arms and transfer to Tunis. The senior officer added that Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, was briefed by senior IDF officers on the situation and voiced great disappointment in Fatah's inability to control the terrorists and their squads. He added that Rabin has endorsed the continued pursuit of terrorists.
