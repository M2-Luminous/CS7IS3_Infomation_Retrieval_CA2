Such is democracy. Ten days have passed since the negotiating table was established in San Cristobal de las Casas; of the 34 points presented, two are not resolved. The commitment of greatest transcendency is the summons of special Congressional sessions for electoral reforms that will bestow trustworthiness on the 21 August elections. Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis said democratic policy is the road to change and on this point he made reference to guarantees for the nation's progress. Here is what Manuel Camacho Solis said: [Begin Camacho Solis recording] Of the 34 initial points on the list of petitions, the two referring to national democracy are not part of the negotiation; however a response has been clearly given for these. Instead of taking the confrontation down a dead end street, we will all be part of a process of political and institutional changes. This process must take place in the civil society's institutions, in political parties, in the state branches, and in public opinion. Democratic policy is the road to change. The announcement that there will be special sessions in the Congress -- with the political parties' agreement -- to make reforms that will guarantee the impartiality of the electoral institutions and the communities' participation, is an important step toward democratic change. This will contribute to the construction of peace in Chiapas. [end recording] This morning at the San Cristobal de las Casas cathedral, in front of the media and the EZLN delegates, Camacho Solis said that the results of the peace negotiations are unique and are a source of pride for Mexico. Camacho Solis said that the road to justice has been traced without winners or losers, as the patriotism of the participants involved prevailed without adversely affecting the legitimate rights of third parties. Camacho Solis acknowledged that there were limitations in the dialogue, noting, however, that neither constitutional order nor sovereignty were ever hampered. In the document entitled Commitment for a Worthy Peace, the EZLN was offered the choice of the type or nature of its social participation. Deadlines from 60 to 90 days were fixed to initiate programs and resolutions on the demands of extension for electricity projects, rehabilitation of hospitals and health clinics, emergency programs to combat malnutrition problems, support for womens community organizations, and support for the transportation sector, as well as the concession or purchase of a radio station controlled by the Indians. With regard to the land problem, it was acknowledged that the agrarian reform process was not fully carried out in Chiapas. As a result, an initiative was presented on a general law on the Indian communities' rights, in response to the demands of government autonomy, as well as on economic, political, and cultural demands. Article 4 and parts of Article 27, which strengthen the State's powers for the restitution of lands and the division of vast land estates, will also be reformed. Also, in response to the EZLN's list of petitions, the creation of the Prosecutors Office for the Defense of Indians' Rights is highlighted. In addition, the Treasury Secretariat, within 60 days will respond to expired loans, while the eviction of Indians will be considered a crime. The Trade Secretariat will analyze NAFTA's impact on Indian communities while a new electoral law will be enacted in Chiapas. With regard to the EZLN demands to stage a political trial against former governors Patrocinio Gonzalez, Absalon Castellanos, and Elmar Zetzer, it was said that the spirit of peace should wipe out resentments. It was indicated that the release of political prisoners would be carried out once peace is signed and in keeping with the amnesty law. In addition, it is guaranteed that aid to the victims of the conflict will be channeled through community representatives. Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis indicated that the Federal Government's response includes all the Chiapas sectors although they have broader repercussions. Camacho Solis said that after consultations held by both of the dialogue participants on these proposals, the final peace agreement in Chiapas will be signed by the attorney general, the secretary general of Amnesty and Reconciliation for Chiapas, the secretary general of the Government, and the prosecutor. Meanwhile, for the EZLN, general staff representatives will be appointed. The consultations with the Indian communities and at government institutions' levels could be concluded before the end of this month. Meanwhile, the EZLN acknowledged that the response to their demands put on the San Cristobal negotiating table reflects true interest in finding peace. At the conclusion of this first phase of the peace and reconciliation efforts in Chiapas, EZLN delegates read communiques in which they set out their position on the negotiations. An EZLN representative -- who on this occasion was not Subcommander Marcos -- acknowledged that a true dialogue had taken place without deceit or lies, without the purchase or sale of dignity. Here is what an unidentified EZLN representative said: [Being EZLN representative recording] We found willingness and eagerness to hear the truth which we spoke. The San Cristobal dialogue was a true dialogue, there was no deceit or lies, nothing was hidden in our hearts [words indistinct] reason and goodness. There was no sale or purchase of dignity; we spoke and were heard on an equal level. It was a true and good dialogue. [end recording] The EZLN widely acknowledged its appreciation of Manuel Camacho Solis of whom it was said did not limit himself to just hearing and understanding them, rather he searched for alternative solutions. The EZLN also acknowledged its appreciation of Bishop Samuel Ruiz' true concern to overcome the obstacles found on the road to peace. The EZLN said that the mediators fulfilled their tasks not in the middle of peace and war, but as two voices that are still trying to find each other. The EZLN indicated that now it must speak to the collective heart of the Indians who are in the mountains. The armed group also thanked the honest and altruistic work of the nongovernmental organizations the representatives of which formed a peace cordon around the San Cristobal cathedral where this first stage of the dialogue for peace and reconciliation took place. This morning Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Cases, also gave his views on the conclusion of the dialogue's first stage. Ruiz said that the conclusion of this first stage of the efforts for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas represents a landmark in Mexican history in which the Indians demand and proclaim everyone's participation. Moreover, Ruiz indicated that hidden forces representing state control and the return to former ways which have been combated have been felt. The Chiapas conflict mediator said that the peace agreements will not be the result of discussions at a negotiating table but of the willingness of each member of society to contribute his part for the common well-being. The San Cristobal de las Casas bishop indicated that Chiapas had contributed to the nation's richness by its sacrifices and now it contributes to the enhancement of a new nation as it progresses in the construction of peace. Samuel Ruiz thanked the EZLN for their serious and appropriate list of petitions. Of Manuel Camacho Solis he said: We are now united on a common road, while he thanked him for his sincerity and eagerness to attain successfully a general consensus in the first stage of the dialogue. To conclude, the bishop said that the San Cristobal de las Casas cathedral will be protected in order to subsequently hold the final meeting of the peace and reconciliation efforts that will be preceded by initiating the implementation of the agreements.
