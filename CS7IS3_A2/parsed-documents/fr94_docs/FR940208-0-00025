FR940208-0-00025 FR940208-0-00016 (2) Statements of policy and interpretations that we have adopted but have not published in the Federal Register . (3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect the public. (We will not make available, however, manuals or instructions that reveal investigative or audit procedures as described in §503.8 (b) and (g) of this part.) (4) In addition to such records as those described in paragraph (a) of this section, we will make available to any person a copy of all other Agency records, unless we determine that such records should be withheld from disclosure under subsection (b) of the Act and §§503.8 and 503.9 of this part. (b) Before releasing these records, however, we may delete the names of people, or information that would identify them, if release would invade their personal privacy to a clearly unwarranted degree. (See §503.8(f).) (c) This Agency does not publish an FOIA index because it is impracticable to do so. §503.6 Restriction on some agency records. Under the U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (22 U.S.C. 1461, as amended), the USIA is prohibited from disseminating within the United States information about the U.S., its people, and its policies when such materials have been prepared by the Agency for audiences abroad. This includes films, radio scripts and tapes, video tapes, books, and similar materials produced by the Agency. However, this law does provide that upon request, such information shall be made available at USIA for examination only by representatives of the press, magazines, radio systems and stations, research students or scholars and available for examination only to Members of Congress. §503.9 [Reserved] 3. Section 503.9 is removed and reserved. Les Jin, General Counsel. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;2708 Filed 2&hyph;7&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8230&hyph;01&hyph;M
