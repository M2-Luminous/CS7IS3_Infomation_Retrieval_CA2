Those sources say that the MPLA-PT media have been stepping up their propaganda campaign, reporting alleged UNITA attacks on all Angolan provinces and suggesting that the Lusaka peace talks are about to break down, thereby psychologically preparing the Angolan people and the international community for its offensive. [passage omitted] Sources in Luanda say that many tonnes of war materiel are arriving daily in Luanda Harbor and Luanda Airport. Most of that war materiel is highly sophisticated and comes mainly from former Eastern Bloc countries, notably the Russian Federation which is, ironically, one of the Angolan peace process observers attending the Lusaka talks. Other countries supplying war materiel to Luanda are Brazil and Spain. Furthermore, Angolan reporter Aguiar dos Santos has reported that new consignments of sophisticated military equipment are constantly arriving at Catumbela Airport. Such equipment includes 6,000 Brazilian-made X-40 and X-60 missiles, for which the MPLA-PT recently paid $160 million. Diplomatic figures in Luanda have said that the secrecy UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye has imposed on the Lusaka peace talks has been of great assistance to the MPLA-PT's propaganda campaign and that the United Nations should demand that the MPLA-PT behaves in a manner compatible with the peace talks currently under way. [passage omitted] A source in the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] General Staff told the Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel yesterday that the loss of the city of Soyo by the MPLA-PT had left that party's ruling class without financial mobility and deprived the Defense Ministry of the benefits it used to enjoy, ranging from the acquisition of weapons at any price to a lack of control over logistics-related spending. That FALA General Staff source further noted that, contrary to what [Petroleum Minister] Albino Maria Assis had tried to have the Angolan people believe, oil exploitation in Soyo has already reached 120,000 barrels per day. Albino Assis had said that Soyo produced only 40,000 barrels per day. Should Mr. Assis' claims prove to be true, then the other 80,000 barrels were being diverted to labyrinthine power structures that must still be identified, including the Ministry of State Security, Minse, and the Directorate of Intelligence and Security of Angola, DISA, which used to have a powerful presence in Soyo. That source also disclosed that a daily 40,000 barrels of oil were taken from the offshore [preceding word in English], while 80,000 barrels were extracted from land oil fields. Vorgan promises to present evidence concerning the [words indistinct].
