FR940817-0-00036 FR940817-0-00014 Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species. If a Federal action may affect a listed species, the responsible Federal agency must enter into consultation with the Service. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will become involved with this plant species after listing through its permitting authority as described under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. By regulation, permits may not be issued where a federally listed endangered or threatened species would be affected by the proposed project without first completing consultation pursuant to section 7 of the Act. The presence of a listed species would highlight the national importance of these resources. In addition, insurance of housing loans by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in areas that presently support Lilium occidentale will be subject to review by the Service under section 7 of the Act. The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61 and 17.62, set forth a series of prohibitions and exceptions that apply to listed plant species. All prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale this species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce to possession the species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. In addition, for plants listed as endangered, the Act prohibits the malicious damage or destruction of any such species on lands under Federal jurisdiction; or removal, cutting, digging up, damaging, or destroying of such plants in knowing violation of any State law or regulation, or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered plants under certain circumstances. Such permits are available for scientific purposes and to enhance propagation or survival of the species. It is anticipated that trade permits might be sought because the species is in cultivation and is very rare in the wild. Requests for copies of the regulations regarding listed species and inquiries about prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503/231&hyph;6241; FAX 503/231&hyph;6243). National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).
