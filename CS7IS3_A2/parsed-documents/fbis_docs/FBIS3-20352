The interviews start with Democratic Party of the Left leader Achille Occhetto. Occhetto is asked by journalist Bruno Vespa whether he feels Berlusconi could give Italy a stable government. Occhetto says that as leader of the largest grouping, Berlusconi should be called on by the president to form a government. Occhetto says it will be difficult for three very different parties in the alliance to gel into an effective coalition, and that he will lead a strong oppostion, which will make life difficult for the new government should Berlusconi fail to maintain any of his promises. Occhetto says he most fears "the social conflict caused by the Right all over Europe." "I am afraid of French-style or Thatcherite policies," he says. Forza Italia leader Berlusconi is interviewed next. Berlusconi hopes he will be able to form a government quickly, because the electorate has made its wish very clear. Berlusconi tells journalist Bruno Vespa that he has resigned as chairman of Fininvest and saw no conflict of interests. But, Berlusconi says, "I have heard that some people say that if I want to be prime minister, I must sell my companies. Let them come forward. If there is someone willing to buy them from me, I have nothing against it." He says that if someone offered to buy a television channel from him he will hand one over and will be happy if "the price is right, if it reflected the true value of something that had been built with blood, sweat, and tears." Vespa asks Berlusconi if he would step aside if he realized that his bid to be prime minister would be a hindrance to forming a government. Berlusconi says: "I would step aside immediately if the proposed alternative solution was the better solution." Bruno Vespa finishes the interviews by asking National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini if he would accept Northern League leader Umberto Bossi's candidate for the post of prime minister, Roberto Maroni. Fini says he does not think a party with a purely regional power base has the right to lead the country as a whole. Fini says he does not understand what the League means by federalism and that this will have to be thrashed out since his own party is committed to the unity of Italy, although it does believe in more decentralization. He says the economy should be the new government's priority and that measures should be taken not only to provide tax relief for small- and medium-sized companies so that they could reinvest profits, but also to make it easier to employ people by abolishing certain regulations.
