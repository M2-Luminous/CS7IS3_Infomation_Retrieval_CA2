FR940830-2-00109 FR940830-2-00057 IX. Definition of ``Restrict'' Money Station suggests that the term ``restrict'' as used in paragraph IV.H and certain other clauses of the proposed Final Judgment is not sufficiently defined. It was not necessary to define this term since the phrase used was ``restrict in any manner.'' This broad prohibition on restrictions is all that is necessary; if any restriction is imposed, it will violate the proposed Final Judgment. X. Conclusion Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §16(e), the proposed Final Judgment cannot be entered unless the Court determines that it is in the public interest. The focus of this determination is whether the relief provided by the proposed Final Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint. United States v. Bechtel Corp ., 1979&hyph;1 Trade Cas. (CCH) ¶62,430 (N.D. Cal. 1979), aff'd. 648 F.2d 660, 665 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied 454 U.S. 1083 (1982). After careful consideration of the comments, the United States continues to believe that the proposed Final Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint and therefore that entry of the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest. After the comments and the response of the United States have been published in the Federal Register , pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §16(d), the United States will move the Court for entry of the proposed Final Judgment.
