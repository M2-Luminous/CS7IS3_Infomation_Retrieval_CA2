At a meeting of leaders of the government and ruling parties, Social Democratic Party Secretary General Wataru Kubo reported that the coalition parties want the reform bills to clear an upper house special panel on political reform on January 18 and the full upper chamber on January 19, Hatoyama told a news conference. Kubo was quoted as saying the coalition parties intend to set aside January 17 for a public hearing on the government-sponsored reform measures even if the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) opposes the idea. Once a public hearing finishes, a bill can be put to a vote at a Diet committee. The government approved the coalition plan to finish upper house deliberations on January 19 on political reform aimed at rooting out corruption that seems endemic to Japan's money driven political system, Hatoyama said. The reform package is intended to introduce single-seat constituencies combined with proportional representation for lower house elections and impose stricter controls on campaign funding. The bills cleared the lower house in mid-November and are pending in the upper house. Kubo reportedly said the coalition has no intention of beginning talks with the LDP on possible modifications of the bills unless the ruling and opposition parties agree to enactment of the bills in the current Diet session, which closes on January 29. The government and coalition parties should wait for the LDP's move on political reform despite LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori's remark on Friday that the party would help pass the bills in the current Diet sitting if they were first revised. Hiroyuki Sonoda, secretary general of Sakigake (Harbinger), and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, also called for prudence about talks with the LDP on possible amendments of the bills, saying it is still unclear whether the LDP is serious about reform, according to Hatoyama. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said earlier Monday that he welcomes Mori's remark, which was interpreted as suggesting a shift in the LDP's stance on political reform. Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi said the government and the ruling coalition parties should make clear that they pay due attention to minor groupings in the Diet, Hatoyama said. While Ichikawa voiced concern about the tight Diet schedule, Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the Democratic Socialist Party, expressed hope the LDP will present its plan as early as possible if it seeks modifications of the government reform bills. Kubo also proposed that the government promise the LDP to revise the bills after they become law in a bid to secure their passage through the Diet by January 29, Hatoyama said, adding that Ichikawa expressed his personal approval of the plan.
