Yusifova: "Banks Have Been Audited"] [Text] The Main Administration for Banking Control of the National Bank of Azerbaijan audited 31 commercial and joint stock-commercial banks in the first quarter of 1994. The audits revealed the following shortcomings: To this day a large amount of indebtedness on loans remains at many commercial banks; unlawful increases in banks' statutory fund, failure of some joint-stock banks to issue stock, absence of registrations by the Ministry of Finance of the republic, violations of the quota of cash holdings, provision of cash services to customers without permission from the National Bank, violations of rules in the process of accepting customer documents, violations of the economic standards of banks, failure to meet compulsory reserve requirements, and deficiencies in opening accounts have occurred. For the most part the absence of letters of guarantee from enterprises which are indebted to the banks, guarantees of security for personal property, and other credit guarantees, as well as the absence of control over the use of the credit issued were the reasons for the violations. Besides, it was noted that the founders of the Naftabank commercial bank have contributed to the statutory fund 460,000 manats out of the funds issued to them as a loan. Five other commercial banks have violated the percentage ratio for contributing monies to the statutory fund (it should be no greater than 12 percent). Some banks were not adequately equipped with security devices. Seventeen banks were fined 11.049 million manats for failing to comply with compulsory reserve requirements. In 728 cases, enterprises did not have certificates of registration with the tax inspectorate. Some 178 enterprises and organizations have not been registered by the Ministry of Justice.
