By way of justifying its inexcusable decision, the Department of State contended that the Iraqi diplomat, who has since returned to Baghdad, had been engaged in diplomatic and media activity incompatible with the agreement under which the two sides opened sections for looking after Iraqi and American interests in Baghdad and Washington. Our interests section head in Washington, the Foreign Ministry statement went on, never engaged in any action, conduct, or activity incompatible with the most basic principles of diplomacy. Our interests section head in Washington was not involved in anything beyond the kind of activities that occupied his predecessor, to whom the U.S. Department of State never objected. We, therefore, think that there is no real justification for the American Department of State's decision. The decision may have been motivated by political or psychological factors that have no connection with the activities of the head of the Iraqi interests section in Washington. In any case, we will increase the staff of our interests section in Washington in accordance with the bilateral agreement. The American interests section in Baghad operates out of the Polish Embassy under the Polish flag.
