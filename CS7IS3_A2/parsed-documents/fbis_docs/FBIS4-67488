Members of the council's special wildlife protection group visited 5,623 Chinese medicine shops in 23 cities and counties from 19 April through 30 April, the council announced on Tuesday [3 May]. The task force seized 349.8 grams of rhino horn and rhino horn powder in 15 stores and 4,424.7 grams of tiger bone in 22 stores. ``The move is to display Taiwan's sincerity to protect endangered species,'' a task force member said. Disguised as customers, police visited 519 herbal medicine shops out of 8,000 on the island in mid-March in Taiwan's first nationwide crackdown on the trade. In those raids, 34 stores were discovered to be selling tiger bone and rhino horn. According to Article 33 of the revised Wildlife Conservation Law, those found guilty of illegally importing, exporting, or trading in endangered wildlife or the products gotten from those animals can be sentenced to up to five years in jail or a fine of up to NT$ [new Taiwan dollars] 1.5 million (U.S. $56,820). Repeat offenders could be sentenced to up to seven years or fined up to NT$2.5 million. U.S. President Bill Clinton on 11 April issued an order prohibiting the import of legally traded wildlife specimens and products from Taiwan in retaliation for Taiwan's failure to stem the trade in rhino horn and tiger bone. The sanctions will result in an estimated U.S. $20 million to U.S. $25 million in annual losses for Taiwan and will limit exports of farmed crocodile and snake skins, orchids, and coral, local trade officials said. The sanctions will take effect on 11 May and will continue until December 1994, when the U.S. will review Taiwan's conservation efforts and decide whether to extend the import prohibition.
