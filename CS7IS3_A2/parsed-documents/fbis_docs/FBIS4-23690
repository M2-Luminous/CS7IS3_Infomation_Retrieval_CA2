A correspondent asked him for his reaction. Old Man Sindikubwabo, who has started to forget how to count, said it does not mean anything as the government still controls 10 prefectures. His counting due to advanced age is wrong as Rwanda does not have 15 prefectures. Rwanda did not grow bigger after his two-month stay in power. Rwanda has 10 prefectures and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] controls many of them. Among these are Byumba, Kibungo, Kigali, Gitarama and a big portion of Ruhengeri. Sindikubwabo no longer controls 10 prefectures, but five which he does not control completely. He controls Gisenyi, Kibuye, Cyangugu, and Gikongoro. He does not really control Butare as we occupy many of the prefecture's communes. By saying that he is just camping in Gitarama and that he will continue his journey to other prefectures, Sindikubwabo should remember that the liberation campaign is continuing and that the RPF is keeping up its campaign to rescue innocent people still being killed. In an interview with Radio France International, Sindikubwabo said the loss of Gitarama is an important setback, politically and militarily. No one knows when he became a soldier. However, this explains why his troops continue to be defeated as though they were not present. In short, Sindikubwabo, with a sad voice, at least accepted that if Gitarama has been captured then things are serious. Speaking in French, he said it is serious. He said this is because troops in all areas -- the south, Kigali, the north -- are no longer in contact. [passage omitted].
