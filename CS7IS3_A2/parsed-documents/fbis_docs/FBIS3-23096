Both of them were sentenced for the 1981 events and the assassination of the late President Anwar al-Sadat. Organization leader Shu'ayb is doing a life sentence in Tanta Prison after being convicted of involvement in the 1981 events and 40 terrorist acts in Asyut. Last March he began to contact a group of his colleagues and other elements from inside the prison in order to form an organization to be tasked with assassinating a number of public figures, with special emphasis on police officers and men. Ramadan Hasan Salih, Muntasir Ahmad Husayn, and Khalid Ibrahim 'Abd-al-Rahman, all of them from Asyut, helped him to set up the organization together with Mahmud Mustafa Hasaballah from al-Buhayrah, who is a doctor at the general hospital in Fuwah. The intelligence service discovered all the arrangements made by the terrorist organization and monitored the instructions sent from the prison to the various members in a number of governorates. All the arrested defendants were handed over to the public prosecution office for interrogation. [passage omitted]
