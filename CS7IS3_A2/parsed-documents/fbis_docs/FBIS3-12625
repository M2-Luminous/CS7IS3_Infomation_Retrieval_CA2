Shortly after this bloody tragedy, U.S. President Clinton invited 'Arafat to Washington to hold talks with the Zionist regime led by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on ways of solving implementation problems of the Gaza-Jericho accord. 'Arafat hastily accepted this invitation. However, the united and angry response of the Palestine people in the face of the Zionist regime's horrific crime and its repercussions in the entire Arab and Islamic world pushed 'Arafat into a corner and he excused himself. [passage omitted] It is quite natural that under the existing explosive situation in Palestinian society no one dares hold talks with the Zionist regime under the name of the Palestinian people. 'Arafat's decision to call off the talks at this stage is in fact a message to those responsible for the massacre of the innocent people that they should not worry as the talks will resume as soon as the circumstances change and the Palestinians calm down. Whereas the Palestinians in the occupied territories and the people of neighboring countries including Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon have staged rallies and protest marches to demand the ultimate cancellation of the talks. No doubt the adoption of a conciliatory approach on the talks with the Zionist regime -- at a time when there are clear signs that the Zionist regime was directly involved in the massacre of the worshippers in the Ibrahim mosque -- is a step to win the support of the Zionist regime and the White House statesmen. Such an approach definitely seeks to serve the interests of the Zionist regime and the White House. The Palestinians demand something different and have announced this demand explicitly.
