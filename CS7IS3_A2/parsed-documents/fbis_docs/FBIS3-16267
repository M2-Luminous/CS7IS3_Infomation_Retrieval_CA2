The bill stipulates that tapes of radio and television programs must be preserved for a period of three months. The bill establishes the principle of political balance under which the national broadcasting channels must give all political parties the same amount of air time. The bill bans tobacco advertising and advertisements that promote consumption of alcohol. It forbids the use of newscasters and political commentators in advertising. The broadcasting bill was drafted by former Justice Minister, attorney Mart Rask and Rein Lang, one of the owners of AS Trio that operates the Tallinn-based Kuku radio station.
