The National Transportation Coordinating Board (CNT) announced it ordered all of its members to suspend the strike "immediately" because President Ramiro de Leon Carpio gave a "favorable" response to all of their demands. The resolution to the conflict came at a time when the supply of fuel at gas stations was beginning to run out and officials feared the nation would become paralyzed within the next 48 hours. According to a CNT communique, telephone conversations were maintained "until the predawn hours" with President de Leon, who finally accepted the increase in rates and other demands made by transportation workers. The president had threatened to intervene and cancel current concessions with the striking businesses, transferring them to other enterprises. Nevertheless, De Leon ultimately yielded to the pressure of transportation businessmen.
