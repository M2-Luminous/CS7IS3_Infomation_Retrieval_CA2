In a statement on Tuesday the HSRC said it had processed data not included in its November/December survey which put the ANC's support at 67 per cent. The National Party's support was 15.5 per cent compared to tte HSRC's earlier estimate of 17 per cent without taking the TBVC states into consideration. The Inkatha Freedom Party could count on 4.5 per cent, compared to the previous six per cent forecast. The Conservative Party's support remained at three per cent, while support for other right-wing parties slipped from two per cent to 1.8 per cent, taking the TBVc states into account. The "large discrepancy" between the ANC's support in the PWV region (71 per cent) and nationally (67 per cent, excluding TBVC states) was largely due to the influence of Natal-kwaZulu and the Western Cape, the statement said. The ANC was the largest party in natal but obtained only 50 per cent of the vote, while in the Western Cape the ANC was the party chosen by 36 per cent of those surveyed. Spoilt papers were a "very serious prospect" and the HSRC was attempting to encourage and assist voter education efforts.
