He evidently referred to the extremist statement of former legislature to declare the major Black Sea Fleet base in the Crimea, the port of Sevastopol, as Russian territory. However, Russia should increase its political activity in the peninsula and be a guarantor of the stability in this autonomous republic of Ukraine, Igrunov stressed. He welcomed the idea of establishing a Russian consulate or a permanent mission of the Russian parliament in Simferopol, the Crimean administrative centre. The parliamentarian also spoke in favour of the exchange of lawmakers' delegations between Russia and the Crimea. Kiev should only praise such cooperation, as Moscow is not interested in the Crimean separatism, he stressed. Igrunov believes Ukraine should prefer the civilized cooperation with Russia to "an endless tug-of-war". The parliamentarian said that he had just returned from the Crimea and Kiev after the on-spot examination of the situation. According to him, the first popularly elected president of the autonomy, Yuriy Meshkov should avoid hasty steps and rely on the renowned local politicians and parliament leaders.
