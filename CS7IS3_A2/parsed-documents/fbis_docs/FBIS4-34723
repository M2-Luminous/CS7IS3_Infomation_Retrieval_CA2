"There are 10 people, who do not seem to be carrying any weapons. They are wearing civilian clothes, and their faces are not covered," Javier Borges, a member of the parish, told AFP by telephone. Worshipers who were inside the cathedral praying "ran out" when the former soldiers entered the church, Borges said. He added that together with Julio Cesar Videa, the archbishop of Esteli, he tried to persuade the intruders to leave the cathedral. The occupiers identified themselves as members of the National Self-Defense Movement (MADNA), which consists of former members of the Army and the Government Ministry who were dismissed by the government without being given indemnification. Meanwhile, police arrested at least 11 men who blocked an access road to Esteli for several minutes at the time the occupation was taking place, according to radio reports not officially confirmed. According to unconfirmed reports, MADNA is demanding from the government an indemnification of $2,000 for each demobilized soldier. Authorities, however, have refused to give them that amount.
