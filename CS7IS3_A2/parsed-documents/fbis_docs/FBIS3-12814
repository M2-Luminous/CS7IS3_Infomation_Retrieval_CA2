We will first go over to Oslo, which is being visited by PLO negotiators: [Correspondent Johan Fredriksson] The PLO's main condition for resuming the peace talks is that armed UN supervisors should be stationed in the occupied territories. It does not have to be a big force, the PLO's chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said when he visited Oslo today. [Begin Sha'th recording, in English] We are not calling for a major army of separation. We need the presence--the strong, effective presence--of people who know about security, and that is, I think, why we needed armed observers. [end recording] [Fredriksson] In addition to this, however, the Israeli Government must, on the one hand, put an end to the violence that its own army uses in Gaza and on the West Bank. On the other hand, it must also disarm the militant settlers in the regions, Sha'th says. [Begin Sha'th recording, in English] Half the element is to have an international presence; the other half is to have an Israeli restriction of the settler violence. [end recording] [Fredriksson] This is Johan Fredriksson in Oslo.
