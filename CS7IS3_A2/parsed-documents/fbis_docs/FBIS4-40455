This is expected to take place during an official meeting in the Kremlin with representatives of power structures and public associations, Abdulakh Mikitayev, chairman of the commission on questions of citizenship under the Russian Federation president, has announced. The program, he said, would incorporate three edicts already drafted by the commission he heads. The principal edict is entitled "On the Concept of Russian Federation Policy in Regard to Fellow Countrymen Living Abroad." Mr. Mikitayev pointed out that a package of documents on a mechanism of putting the edicts into effect will be up for approval. The government is completing work on this package. The draft law "On the Concept," according to A. Mikitayev, proclaims Russia's initiative to formalize at an interstate level measures that would guarantee the observance of the rights of nonindigenous populations permanently resident in new independent states. The two other draft edicts envisage specific aid to retired servicemen resident in the Baltic states.
