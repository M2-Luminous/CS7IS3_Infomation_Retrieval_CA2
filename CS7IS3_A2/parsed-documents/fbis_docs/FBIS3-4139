Finance Minister Liu Zhongli describes averting a budget crunch this year as an uphill battle. Liu puts the fiscal 1994 deficit at 66.919 billion yuan ($7.69 billion ). If repayment of domestic and foreign debts of 48.081 billion yuan ($5.53 billion) and international loans for State key projects of 14.245 billion yuan ($1.64 billion) are added, China faces a total debt of 129.245 billion yuan ($14.85 billion), which is 3.8 per cent of its gross domestic product. This proportion is slightly higher than last year's. Economists have predicted that China's debt is unlikely to shrink in the next couple of years. It is especially true since the government must finance a large number of infrastructure projects and subsidize teetering State enterprises. But the finance minister has masterminded a strategy that may prevent the debt burden from choking the economic development. "Basically we will follow a two- pronged policy this year to control debt," Liu said. One is to put a brake on investment in fixed assets, especially real estate. Officials fear that unchecked spending in this sector will lead to drastic price hikes for basic construction materials such as steel. Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has repeatedly cautioned that the real estate boom absorbing vast sums of money, is likely to turn into a bust, as it did in Japan when the bubble economy burst. Incomplete figures show that about a quarter of last year's foreign investment in China ended up in real estate, which does not augur well for the economy as it passes through the fragile transition from central planning to regulation by market forces. Last year, the real estate boom was largely fueled by local governments for local interests. Economists believe this freewheeling spending will end this year, since the central government has forbidden local governments from incurring budget deficits. The country's first budget law, which is expected to come out soon, will stipulate that only the central government can have a budget deficit. Despite protests from some regions, the central government will proceed with the new law. With more revenue in hand, the central government will be able to cut back investment in low-priority projects and concentrate on the key ones, such as power stations, railways, telecommunications, electronics and agricultural development. Another trump card for containing the deficit is the implementation of the tax-sharing system, which apportions revenues from the central and local governments. Under this system the central government can pool more money and effectively stop the haemorrhage in taxes, which in recent years has been condoned by local authorities. The central government will collect some 70 per cent of the new tax income of local governments on the basis of the 1993 level. "But," Liu explained, "this will be a long and gradual process." He said the new tax system will not dampen the boom in local economies because local governments will be allowed a share of the revenue from the value-added tax. Moreover, the central government has decided to let a number of inefficient State-owned enterprises go bankrupt this year, thus relieving itself of another heavy financial burden. And the State has planned to streamline subsidies to the grain sectors by setting up a new purchase and sales system. The details are expected to be available soon. But the central government will lose about 30 billion yuan ($3.45 billion) this year after canceling certain special taxes on the State-run enterprises.
