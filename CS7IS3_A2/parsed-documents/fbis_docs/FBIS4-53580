We conveyed a letter from the president to President Suharto concerning the proposed holding in the Philippines of the meeting on East Timor, an event over which the Indonesian Government had expressed its deep concern. We had the occasion to exchange views on the subject with His Excellency Ali Alatas, the foreign minister of Indonesia, and the other officials of the Indonesian Government. Our talks were characterized by utmost cordiality. We assured the Indonesian Government of the Philippines' continuing support for the territorial integrity of the Republic of Indonesia, including the province of East Timor, support which President Ramos had earlier reaffirmed in connection with the proposed conference on East Timor. We recalled the declarations of President Ramos, Vice President Estrada, and other Philippine officials that they shared Indonesia's concern over the implications of the conference. We made it clear that President Ramos had firmly dissociated the Philippine Government from the conference. At the same time, we pointed out that the event was being organized with Philippine private groups and individuals as formally the hosts, and we stressed that the Philippine Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and freedom of speech and that therefore the Philippine Government is unable to prevent, under normal circumstances, the conference from taking place. However, we informed the Indonesian officials that everything would be done in accordance with the Constitution and our laws to ensure that this unfortunate development does not harm the friendly relations between the Philippines and Indonesia. Foreign Minister Alatas expressed the gratitude of President Suharto to President Ramos for sending our mission. He conveyed the Indonesian Government's appreciation for our explanation and for the reiteration of the Philippine Government support for the Indonesian position on East Timor. He stated that other Indonesian officials had done and have done that Indonesia understood and respect the Philippine position on constitutional rule and human rights. [sentence as heard] He declared, however, that the proposed conference is not simply a matter of human rights. We noted Minister Alatas' observation that the scheduled meeting was neither a gathering of human rights nor an academic exercise but as part of a political action plan of a small secessionist exile group, using the Philippine conference to subvert Indonesia's sovereignty on East Timor. We noted that this small secessionist exile group was giving the central direction in the organization of the conference. We recalled the invaluable role which Indonesia has played in the Organization of Islamic Conference with respect to our secessionist problem. The mission expressed the Philippines' gratitude for this. We and the Indonesians agreed to continue exchanging views and information on this matter and on the Philippine-Indonesian relations in general.
