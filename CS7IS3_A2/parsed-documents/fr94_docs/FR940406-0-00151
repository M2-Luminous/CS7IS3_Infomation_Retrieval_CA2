FR940406-0-00151 FR940406-0-00011 6. A new §86.150&hyph;98 is added to subpart B to read as follows: §86.150&hyph;98 Overview; refueling test. (a) The refueling emissions test procedure described in this and subsequent sections is used to determine the conformity of vehicles with the refueling emissions standards set forth in subpart A of this part for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The refueling emissions test procedure may be performed as an individual test or in combination with the evaporative and exhaust emissions test sequences of §86.130&hyph;96. (b) The refueling emissions test is designed to measure hydrocarbon emissions resulting from the generation or displacement of fuel tank vapor during vehicle refueling. The refueling emissions shall be measured by the enclosure technique. (c) All emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a new motor vehicle shall be functioning during all procedures in this subpart except: (1) In cases of component malfunction or failure; and (2) during certain specified fuel drain and fill operations, at which times the refueling emission control canister is disconnected. Maintenance to correct component malfunction or failure shall be authorized in accordance with §86.098&hyph;25. 7. A new section 86.151&hyph;98 is added to subpart B to read as follows: §86.151&hyph;98 General requirements; refueling test. (a) The refueling emissions procedure, shown in Figure B98&hyph;12, starts with the stabilizing of the vehicle and the loading of the refueling emissions canister(s) to breakthrough, and continues with the vehicle drive for purging of the canister, followed by the refueling emissions measurement. The test is conducted following §§86.152&hyph;98 through 86.154&hyph;98 in order. (b) Ambient temperature levels encountered by the test vehicle throughout the test sequence shall not be less than 68 ○F (20 ○C) nor more than 86 ○F (30 ○C). (c) The vehicle shall be approximately level during all phases of the test sequence to prevent abnormal fuel distribution. BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSER06AP94.002 BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;C 8. A new §86.152&hyph;98 is added to subpart B to read as follows: §86.152&hyph;98 Vehicle preparation; refueling test. (a) Provide additional fittings and adapters, as required, to accommodate a fuel drain at the lowest point possible in the tank(s) as installed on the vehicle. The canister shall not be removed from the vehicle, unless access to the canister in its normal location is so restricted that purging and loading can only reasonably be accomplished by removing the canister from the vehicle. Special care shall be taken during this step to avoid damage to the components and the integrity of the fuel system. (b) Provide valving or other means to allow the venting of the refueling vapor line to the atmosphere rather than to the refueling emissions canister(s) when required by this test procedure. (c) For preconditioning that involves loading the vapor collection canister(s) with butane, provide valving or other means as necessary to allow loading of the canister(s).
