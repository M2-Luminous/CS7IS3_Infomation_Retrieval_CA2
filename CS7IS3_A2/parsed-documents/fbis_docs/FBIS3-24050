Here, as a rule, there are both sudden sharp, nerve-tingling curves and people tumbling from the saddle. Just a few days ago public attention zeroed in on the President's State of the Nation message to the Federal Assembly. Then, after barely having time to discuss it meaningfully, we, voluntarily or involuntarily, switched our attention to the development of the plot spawned by the amnesty. And now we are suddenly faced with the fact of the precipitous release from Lefortovo Prison of Aleksandr Rutskoy, Ruslan Khasbulatov, Albert Makashov, Viktor Anpilov, Ilya Konstantinov, and other instigators of the bloody October events and Mayday clashes, which also had casualties. Also absolved of punishment, regardless of the court's decision, are the organizers of the unsuccessful August coup. At the same time, Procurator-General Aleksey Kazannik was relieved of his position, albeit ostensibly at his own request. But let us get away from emotions and make an effort to comprehend all this, taking into account, among other things, the subsequent "exposure" of the ex-procurator. First, what actually happened? The Duma passed a decree in full conformity with the Constitution, though one could, of course, argue where amnesty ends and pardon begins and what, actually, are the prerogatives of the Duma and the President. But such a debate would surely be unproductive. What guided the Duma, or more precisely, the majority of its members? As the decree states, objectives of "national reconciliation, achievement of civil peace and concord." We can assume that it had other, or even entirely different, objectives. More precisely, some deputies were really guided by the idea of reconciliation, some were moved by revenge, some pursued their personal or group political goals, including setting their sights on the presidential election, some cherished the goal of destabilizing the situation, and so on. So what? That is real politics, the vector of which is the sum of the actions and reactions of many interests. It is another question how the Constitution could make such a sensitive, multidimensional problem as amnesty, moreover at such a complex, transitional stage from one social system to another, the sole prerogative of the Duma? But, Messrs. comrades, who is to blame but those who drew up the draft Constitution and introduced the final amendments to it? Tantrums should have been thrown then; now it's too late. Or, perhaps, at the time people had forgotten about Lefortovo? Second. Every complex matter has its pros and cons. Let us start with the latter. With the cons, for it is precisely they that are now arousing public opinion. Of concern is precisely what Kazannik spoke of in his resignation statement. It is dangerous and immoral to set free people who are guilty of the death and injuries of many people and of causing considerable material damage. Yes, that is so. Evil must be punished, because otherwise it tends to spread like a cancerous tumor. Essentially, the bloody October events became possible only because the organizers of the bloody May events had remained unpunished, and before them, the organizers of the Ostankino pogroms. The "implacable opposition" was quite openly preparing for violent actions with virtually no significant opposition. On the contrary, it was wholeheartedly supported by the former Supreme Soviet and enjoyed its patronage, coupled with the fact that the procurator's office and court mishandled things, and even now we find that the Procurator-General, whose resignation was swiftly accepted by the President, acted inappropriately. Clearly, the amnesty was poorly handled. The procurator, for his part, either did nothing or remained aloof and then acted too hastily. Why? Another mystery. It is something of a conundrum: By its very logic, amnesty presumes the guilt of the person to whom it applies, whereas Khasbulatov--and he is not alone--vociferously declares that he doesn't consider himself guilty, that he suffered in the fight for freedom. In other words, there is neither punishment nor remorse. In purely Russian style. The worrisome thing is that the people coming out of Lefortovo Prison may take up their old cause. Anpilov has already declared, in his purely public rally manner, that if, having gained freedom, he sees that prices are declining, then he'll concede the correctness of Boris Yeltsin's course, but if they rise, then he will raise the masses. And he has already taken part in a rally. Theoretically, there is the danger of inflaming passions in society and destabilizing the political situation in view of the mounting dissatisfaction with the practice of delaying wages, persistent problems of reciprocal nonpayment, the state of affairs in the economy as a whole, and the disastrous situation of many "budgeteers." There is a threat that the people coming out of Lefortovo will assemble a powerful opposition movement on a national-patriotic platform, a platform of counter-reform, and will seek to unite with the "implacable" in parliament. They will try to shift their main actions to the streets, inciting mass strikes, organizing disobedience campaigns, demanding a complete change in the course of reforms, and even an early presidential election. A hypothetical leader of the opposition is already being named: Aleksandr Rutskoy. Such apprehensions are already being expressed in the mass media, and I hear them from colleagues of mine, including like-minded people or people with views close to mine, with whom I have recently been heatedly exchanging views. One of them declared quite strongly: "The maneuver of President Yeltsin's opponents in the Duma has succeeded. The amnesty is a defeat for democrats. It is a victory for opposition forces; it is not accidental, after all, that Vladimir Zhirinovksiy came to Lefortovo specially to declare his solidarity with the leaders of the October rebellion. As for those democrats who voted for the amnesty, in particular Sergey Shakhray with his strategic calculations of sorts, they have miscalculated. They simply overplayed their hand." Only the future will reveal the correctness of one side or another, as well as who won, who lost, and who was duped. But what should not, what must not be forgotten? Firstly, that the Duma decree is a package. It includes not only the amnesty (moreover, not only political, but also economic), but also repeal of its previous decree of 16 February, "On Confirming the Members of the Commission for Investigating the events of 21 September-4 October 1993." It goes without saying that such an investigation would have excited public opinion no less than the amnesty itself. The decree also includes a Memorandum of Understanding, the significance of which should not be overlooked. The MPs have declared to the country and the world: "We are convinced of the impermissibility of destablizing the situation in a country which possesses such a huge weapons arsenal... Accordingly, we consider it necessary to engage in political struggle strictly within the framework of the law and not resort to, or in any form call for, violence, ethnic discord, or the suppression of people holding different views." If these are but empty words, then there is simply nothing to talk about. In that case the political elite is beyond the pale of civilization, beyond responsibility, in the power of primitive instincts, barbarian "political culture," and a society that brings forth such an elite can stop thinking of democracy. Our fate is dictatorship, we are incapable of anything else. But that is not really the case. Secondly, one should not disregard the fact that the events of August 1991 and October 1993 were of an unusual nature rarely encountered in world practice. Therefore, despite their similarity to many widespread phenomena, they should be treated as something exceptional. The human losses, spiritual, ethical, and in part even political losses associated with the "shooting of the parliament" were, I sincerely believe, forced actions to prevent civil war and disintegration of the country, and they lie solely on the conscience of those who first called people to arms. Besides, we may have been at the threshold of a new terror. But you must agree that all this took place in conditions of actual dual power. Thirdly, we have, apparently, not yet fully realized that we are living under a new Constitution, that we no longer have an almighty Supreme Soviet, and that in addition to the Duma we also have a higher chamber, the Council of the Federation. Let us suppose that Konstantinov, Anpilov or someone else would really like to fish in muddy political waters for the sake of that very "destabilization of the situation" mentioned in the Memorandum. What would follow then? Why, if nothing else works, the President would issue, with the approval of the upper chamber, an edict declaring an emergency situation. Then no one can tell him what to do! But if even then the situation gets out of control, the problem would be not the Anpilovs or Konstantinovs, but the bankruptcy of the political course itself, the people's failure to comprehend the essence of reform. But let us pose the question differently. Nonpayment of wages for months on end, chronic government debts for delivered produce, a stalemate because of mutual nonpayments, and the chaos pervading the economy in general: is all that normal and acceptable? It is not, after all, our intention to carry out reforms in the name of reforms and against the interests of people. As I see it, the President in his message to parliament considers such things completely abnormal and demands their quickest elimination. Or perhaps it is normal that neither Gaydar nor the people who have replaced him have deemed it necessary to keep up a constant dialogue with the people. We must explain to the people of Russia what kind of society we want to build, what our ideals are, what our new spirituality is. We should allay our compatriots' fears and give them confidence in the future. So far nothing like this has really been done. Third, and here I am taking up what may be in favor of "opting for": for positively resolving the question of the amnesty as an important component of the package decree. It is time for those who call themselves democrats, reformers, people dedicated to a rule-of-law (socio-rule-of-law) state and to market (socio-market) relations, who honor our traditions and care for our national interests, to stop arguing, splintering, and especially infighting. The society will soon lose any idea of who is really a democrat. PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] voted for the amnesty and, it is said, decided its fate. Also voting for it were "Women of Russia," "New Regional Politics," all or most of the "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] faction, and many of those who can't be called either anti-reform or anti-democratic. Actually, only "Russia's Choice" voted against. It is logical to ask why there is such divergence in the democratic camp? The reason is that there are, among other things, different views of the events of September-October 1993, and even, to some extent, of the events of August 1991. So perhaps it would be reasonable to try and bring them together, even at the risk of failure. Politics is impossible without taking risks. It is, actually, high time to recognize realities in the broader aspect and get out of the cocoon of sectarianism. If the concept of "democrats" is reduced to "Russia's Choice," what can they do without forming blocs with other political forces and making compromises with them? Retreat into total opposition or prod the President towards some kind of actions? Frankly, I see nothing positive along that road. Because in parliament there is a certain balance of forces supported by certain moods of our citizens. One can only blame oneself for inability to conduct a dialog with the people and for mishandling the parliamentary elections, roll up one's sleeves and work hard for the future. As for the President himself, I consider that he acted quite appropriately. There is no sense prodding him towards confrontation with Duma members. After all, work with the Parliament is only just beginning. And one more thing. It may develop that the supporters of reform would do well to accept speaker Rybkin's formula, which he proposed during his address to Parliament on 28 February. Essentially, the idea is to implement a program for getting out of the economic crisis prepared within the Duma. Provided, of course, that it is based not on intentions to abandon the course of market reforms altogether or to create a "government of national unity" made up of, say, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and, perhaps, Anatoliy Chubays, which would lead to the collapse of all and everything. What, essentially, is of fundamental importance to reformer-democrats? To preserve the democratic Constitution and the strategic course of reforms. And also, to win the coming presidential election. Fourth. The amnesty will, in my view, hardly promote the cohesion of extremist forces in society, and in this I tend to agree more with Shakhray than with his critics. Of course, there are still unknown quantities which make predictions difficult, although much will get clearer in the very near future. However, I have always considered--and so far have not changed my opinion on this score--that as soon as Aleksandr Rutskoy appears on the political scene Zhirinovskiy will fade away as a presidential contender, literally before our eyes. When he voted for the amnesty Vladimir Volfovich probably didn't even realize that he was thereby placing a mine under his ambitious plans. But I do not preclude the possibility that circumstances may force Boris Yeltsin to once again enter the arena of struggle for the presidency and, as the ancient Romans used to say, deserve his triumph. But we still have to live up to that time.
