That is why we are conducting a strategic command staff exercise. These are not military maneuvers and no technical equipment is being used, although we have already been accused of the opposite. There have been attempts to say that because Ukraine has no possibility to conduct such undertakings [military maneuvers]; it is holding a staff exercise. I want to point out to these gentlemen that if necessity arises, Ukraine will find strategic reserves and a possibility to use the equipment available in the Armed Forces. However, we have set no such task -- the task was absolutely different; but when people do not know what they want, or they see their strategic goals in spreading lies about Ukraine, we treat this with understanding. [words indistinct] [Reporter] As the commander in chief, can you say whether Ukraine is capable of defending itself? [Kravchuk] Resolving the problem of reforming the Armed Forces is not the same as resolving the problem of defense capability. I mean that we have arrived at the conclusions about the current state of our Armed Forces and all other structures and how ready we are in case of necessity. We will do everything to prevent such necessities, but troops exist and their normal task is to train. I believe that we can tell our people that the Ukrainian Armed Forces along with other ministries and departments involved in this [sphere], are capable of cooperating and performing their functions regarding the protection of Ukraine's interests, its national border, the people, and their peaceful labor. There are problems in supplies of say, lubricants and appropriate resources; there are personnel, discipline, and responsibility problems -- all this was demonstrated very vividly during the exercise and we saw that this [exercise] should have been conducted earlier. We were preoccupied with things like transforming a corps into a division or a division into a corps... or reducing military districts and expanding them. [words indistinct] Today, we have set a strategic goal -- that of Ukraine's defense, the readiness of both the Armed Forces and others for this sacred task of state defense. This is a qualitatively new task. This has been the first exercise and thus, I cannot give a precise and full answer about it. I believe that when we meet again at future exercises, we will be able to speak about their significance. However, even today we should say that it was needed and has brought considerable benefits.
