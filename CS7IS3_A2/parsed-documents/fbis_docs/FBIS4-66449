(Nippon Paper), has discovered a bacteria strain capable of efficient decomposition of lignin, a component of wood, and has developed a pulp bleaching technology with the bacteria. Nippon Paper claims that the new technology produces whiter regenerated paper than that produced by the usual method. Thus, the new technology is expected to replace the existing method of using chlorine-based bleaching agent that is the potential source for harmful substances, including dioxin, and the unpleasant odor. Lignin is a polymer contained in the ligneous parts of plant and is also a colored component in pulp production. The research group at Nippon Paper sought lignin-digestible bacteria from whitish, putrefied trees and certain groups of mushrooms. As a result, the group was able to isolate a strain of bacteria that was highly capable of discoloring pulp in agar media. When unbleached pulp (whiteness of 51 percent) that had been treated with oxygen and alkali was treated with the bacteria for one week at 30ï¿½C, the whiteness of pulp improved to more than 80 percent. Although some lignin-decomposing bacteria had been known in the past, this particular strain discovered by Nippon Paper was found to be more capable of bleaching than any of the previously known bacteria strains. Nippon Paper will try to grow variants from this strain and achieve a pulp whiteness of 88-90 percent, which is equivalent to the whiteness of high-quality paper. Today, pulp is being bleached with a large quantity of a chlorine-based chemical at a high temperature. This process has become an environmental pollution problem because, at such a high temperature, the chlorine-based chemical produces harmful substances including dioxin. Therefore, the technology using a microorganism is expected not only to alleviate environmental pollution, but also to reduce the cost of the pulp bleaching process.
