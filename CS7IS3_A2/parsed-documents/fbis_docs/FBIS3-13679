At this stage, we are talking about a symbolic payment, about gestures, about Israeli measures which will somewhat ease the life of the Arabs in Hebron. We are not talking about reopening the Oslo and Cairo agreements, pulling the settlers out of Hebron, or deploying an international force, as 'Arafat demanded. Perhaps we are talking about lifting the curfew, handing the central bus station in Hebron back to the Arabs, giving more authority to the qadi in the Cave of the Patriarchs, a plan for a Palestinian policing force which would be controlled by Israel but would get its authority from the PLO. Of course, this is only the beginning. Rabin promised to pay, and Rabin keeps his promises: He will pay. This will be the Goldstein tax. The ideas Israel raised to date about the form of payment have been rejected by Tunis. They were "nonstarters," just as 'Arafat's demands were "nonstarters" as far as Rabin was concerned. However, the principle was established. The Americans will be the ones who will set the final price tag. Half a year ago, on a hot and steamy day, Rabin and 'Arafat shook hands on the White House lawn. Then they said the Gaza-Jericho agreement would be signed on 13 December. Then they put it off to 13 January, and later to 13 April. Yesterday, on a bone-chilling day, Rabin spoke for the first time about early summer as the new date for the signing of the agreement. When the date of Rabin's visit was set, Israel thought it would be the opening shot for practical talks with Syria. However, this was not the case, which is also part of the Goldstein tax. Last night Rabin confirmed that Israel cannot wave the threat of reaching a separate agreement with Syria in 'Arafat's face. "It would boomerang against us," he said, "the Syrians will not show up before the Palestinians return to the negotiating table." It was a melancholic visit. The President, who had just returned from an exhausting political campaign in New Hampshire, almost fell asleep at the podium. Secretary of State Christopher, just back from Asia, listened to Rabin's remarks amid a deep slumber. Everybody has been through a lot since September, and none of it has been good. Rabin said Israeli prime ministers used to come to Washington with shopping bags. "The only item in my bag is promoting peace," he asserted. Rabin could not say whether he was leaving Washington with a full bag. He will have to fill up his bag with goods when he gets back home.
