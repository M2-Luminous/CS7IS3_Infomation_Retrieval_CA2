The Port Moresby based newspaper, THE NATIONAL, says Mr. Wingti told us that the Honiara meeting did not go ahead as planned because the government decided that Francis Ona and Sam Kouna had to be involved. He said the government did not want to waste its time by talking to a variety of people and then not getting any results. Mr. Wingti reportedly also said that the government would not make any announcements until talks between the leaders on both sides were over.
