The plan is to elect a so-called democratic parliament over a three-day period centered on 27 April. Have we given some careful thought as to how that "parliament" is going to look if it is ever elected? What follows here is a picture of what we can expect in that regard. Satanic worshippers, Hindus, Muslims, believers in witch-doctors, atheists, and a bunch of people calling themselves Christians will be sitting in the same benches. It is alarming but not too far-fetched to call it a Satanic parliament. That Satanic parliament, if it ever becomes a reality, will be making laws for us Christians. The country will be governed according to those laws. Those laws will regulate the education of our children and prescribe the kind of education for them. Do you think it is going to be a Christian national education? Those who think so are thinking like children. Do you think that that education is going to be given in your children's mother tongue? Do you think their teacher is going to be someone from the Boer-Afrikaner people? Do you think you are going to have any say on the school board of your children's school? Do you think that the neighborhoods are going to look any different than Soweto? Do you think that you will be able to go about outside of your fortified house or your squatter's hut after dark or even during the day? Do you think you are still going to have work and food for your family? And furthermore: Do you think that you as a white person are going to have any rights before the law? When your children are assaulted and your spouses are treated in a manner that will shock you, do you think that someone is going to listen to you? Have you so quickly forgotten the outrages in the Belgian Congo? Just ask those people. They are still living among us because they fled here in their extreme humiliation and ruin. For you there is no more opportunity to flee. The southernmost tip of Africa is Cape Agulhas, and that is still a part of South Africa. Just think carefully whether you want to participate in the creation of this Satanic parliament. There is something that we must remember well: We readily call ourselves Christians. The Word expressly says that the righteous may never pull together with the godless in the same yoke. There is no way for us to evade this prohibition--it stands fast. Any person who calls himself or herself a Christian and participates in the Satanic parliament commits high treason against Christianity. Those who take their place in that parliament as well as those who even vote for it are participating in it and will have to answer to the Creator for that. Those participants will just have to ponder whether a position and a big salary are perhaps the 30 pieces of silver. We are proud to say that the blood of the French Huguenots also flows in our veins. These are the people who fled from France, their homeland, with only the clothes on their backs and their precious Bible, baked in a loaf of bread. They left behind family, friends, property--everything except their faith in their Creator. That was more precious to them than anything else. Do you think that they would have wanted a position in a Satanic parliament for all the money in the world? Perhaps many of our people who call themselves Afrikaners or Christians should read the history of the Huguenots again. Perhaps they will then return in time to things that really matter rather than participating in a Satanic parliament for temporal gain and the hypocritical appearance of sacrifice. We have pity in our hearts for these people. They were once part of the Afrikaner-Boer people. They also have children who should become part of our glorious people but whom they now want to sacrifice to an alien conglomerate [sic]. What answers are they going to give to those ruined, crushed little children when they begin to ask questions? They will have to start looking hard for answers right now. The time for finding answers is extremely short. With open arms we invite our people to come back. Come back to your people who need you. Come, so that together we can build a free republic of the people where we can be ourselves, can govern ourselves, can serve our Creator in freedom and can raise our children as Christian Boer-Afrikaners for the next generation. The time is short and the days until 27 April are few. The sun is hanging low in the west. Soon darkness will descend upon Azania while the light shall dawn over the republic of the people. We know, we believe, we shall be victorious, we do not fight alone: While Azania fights in the darkness, we fight in the light.
