FR941027-1-00025 FR941027-1-00008 8. Interference With Shipping, Fishing, Recreation, Mineral Extraction, Desalination, Fish and Shellfish Culture, Areas of Special Scientific Importance and Other Legitimate Uses of the Ocean [40 CFR 228.6(a)(8)] While shipping is heavy at the Port of Miami, the infrequent use of this site should not significantly disrupt either commercial shipping or recreational boating. Commercial and recreational fishing activities are concentrated in inshore and nearshore waters. No mineral extraction, desalination, or mariculture activities occur in the immediate area. Scientific resources present throughout this area are not geographically limited to the proposed Miami ODMDS or nearby waters. 9. The Existing Water Quality and Ecology of the Site as Determined By Available Data or By Trend Assessment or Baseline Surveys [40 CFR 228.6(a)(9)] Water quality at the proposed ODMDS is variable and is influenced by discharges from inshore systems, frequent oceanic intrusions, and periodic upwelling. The proposed disposal site lies on the continental slope in an area traversed by the western edge of the Florida Current. The location of the western edge of the current determines to a large extent whether waters at the site are predominantly coastal or oceanic. Frequent intrusions or eddies of the Florida Current transport oceanic waters over the continental shelf in the proposed ODMDS vicinity. Periodic upwelling/downwelling events associated with wind stress also influence waters in the area. No critical habitat or unique ecological communities have been identified at the candidate site. Buffer zone protection has been applied to any existing fish havens, artificial reef communities, turtle nesting areas, and onshore amenities in the general region of the site. 10. Potentiality for the Development or Recruitment of Nuisance Species in the Disposal Site [40 CFR 228.6(a)(10)] The disposal of dredged materials should not attract or promote the development of nuisance species. No nuisance species have been reported to occur at previously utilized disposal sites in the vicinity. 11. Existence at or in Close Proximity to the Site of Any Significant Natural or Cultural Features of Historical Importance [40 CFR 228.6(a)(11)] No known natural or cultural features of historical importance occur at or in close proximity to the site. No such features were noted in a video survey of the proposed disposal area. E. Site Management Site management of the Miami ODMDS is the responsibility of EPA as well as the COE. The COE issues permits to private applicants for ocean disposal; however, EPA/Region IV assumes overall responsibility for site management. The Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) for the proposed Miami ODMDS was developed as a part of the process of completing the EIS. This plan provides procedures for both site management and for the monitoring of effects of disposal activities. This SMMP is intended to be flexible and may be modified by the responsible agency for cause. F. Proposed Action The EIS concludes that the proposed site may appropriately be designated for use. The proposed site is compatible with the 11 specific and 5 general criteria used for site evaluation. The designation of the Miami site as an EPA-approved ODMDS is being published as Proposed Rulemaking. Overall management of this site is the responsibility of the Regional Administrator of EPA/Region IV. It should be emphasized that, if an ODMDS is designated, such a site designation does not constitute EPA's approval of actual disposal of material at sea. Before ocean disposal of dredged material at the site may commence, the COE must evaluate a permit application according to EPA's Ocean Dumping Criteria. EPA has the right to disapprove the actual disposal if it determines that environmental concerns under MPRSA have not been met. The Miami ODMDS is not restricted to disposal use by federal projects; private applicants may also dispose suitable dredged material at the ODMDS once relevant regulations have been satisfied. This site is restricted, however, to suitable dredged material from the greater Miami, Florida vicinity. G. Regulatory Assessments Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules that may have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. EPA has determined that this proposed action will not have a significant impact on small entities since the designation will only have the effect of providing a disposal option for dredged material. Consequently, this Rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. Under Executive Order 12866, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. This action will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or cause any of the other effects which would result in its being classified by the Executive Order as a ``significant'' rule. Consequently, this Rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. This Proposed Rule does not contain any information collection requirements subject to Office Management and Budget review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
