Reina said that from now on "firm negotiations" will prevail during the meetings he will hold with the international financial organization. Reina is also scheduled to meet with either President Bill Clinton or Vice President Al Gore. Rafael Leonardo Callejas' successor will travel to Washington tomorrow accompanied by his economic cabinet. This is considered a very important step as he will analyze future relations with the financial institutions that forced the Nationalist to adopt unpopular measures. Reina said: "I am opposed to more blows against the people. This situation will be dealt with through firm negotiations, presenting solid arguments by prepared advisers. These advisers must find just and correct ways to solve the negative figures my government will have to face." Reina said he will go on his trip with a different mentality, believing that the international institutions will understand his desire to "give a humanistic image" to the effects of Callejas' economic measures. This is why "I hope these meetings will be very productive for projects aimed at developing our country." he noted. For the president-elect, the meetings he will hold with high ranking officials of the U.S. Government are "of significant importance and benefit for bilateral relations between Honduras and the United States." During the week, the president-elect asked his economic cabinet to analyze the state's finances in order to present a report to the multilateral organizations. This type of information "is fundamental to clarifying all the conditions imposed by the international organization and as a support to our moral revolutionary project," he explained. With reference to U.S. exerted pressures, Reina said that "you cannot demand a friendly government to make sacrifices with such high political costs. If they want to help, they will lend us their hand. That friendly hand will help our country resolve this truly sticky situation." In Reina's opinion "the international organizations are not hard, that attitude belongs to the cold war era." Upon his arrival, the president-elect will meet with John Spero, secretary of negotiations and economic matters of the State Department. Early tomorrow Reina will meet with envoy Charlene Barchefsky, from the Treasury Department; Carlos Munoz, chief of the Central American Division; and Julio Suarez, advisor to the executive director. Immediately thereafter, the president-elect will meet with Jeffrey Shafer, assistant (international affairs) secretary of the Treasury Department, and then he will have lunch with Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank. In the evening, the Honduran delegation will have dinner with senators and congressmen. On Thursday, Reina will breakfast with the members of the Council of the Americas and following that he will meet with Brian Atwood, under secretary for Management, State Department. At noon, Reina will lunch with Kathleen Hennesy, a State Department official, and in the afternoon he plans to meet with President Bill Clinton or Vice President Al Gore.
