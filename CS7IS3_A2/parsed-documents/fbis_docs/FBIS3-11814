He announced that he asked the business sector in his country to carry on with their investment plans for Mexico. During a news conference at the Canadian Embassy in Mexico City at the end of his three-day visit, Chretien said: "Mexico's entry into the OECD is a sign of the country's progress, which has been recognized by the organization's member countries as well as other nations." He announced that he had called upon members of the Canadian business sector to continue with their investments in Mexico because there is economic and political stability, despite the murder of the government's presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. Chretien indicated that he made the appeal during a meeting this morning with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. He told the entrepreneurs to remain calm and to continue with their investment plans for Mexico "in order to contribute to the growth of the economy and democracy." He made a similar appeal to the exhibiters at Canada Expo 94, which is the largest commercial exhibition ever organized for a foreign country. There are about 430 companies participating in the event, which opened on Monday in Mexico City. He said that Mexico is a stable country and that "what has impressed me the most is that the authorities and the people have remained calm following the tragic death of Colosio, and no violence has occurred despite the deep consternation." He denied that his country had granted financial aid to Mexico, but stressed that he is willing to do so if Mexico requests it. Regarding the upcoming general election in Mexico, currently set for 21 August, Chretien said that if Mexico requests observers or assistance Canada will respond. Chretien said that his first official visit to Canada had been successful. He reported progress regarding the talks with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to define the concepts of subsidies and dumping within the NAFTA framework. "Mexico and Canada are not strong enough to face the United States alone," he said, "therefore we need more countries to join NAFTA to balance out the situation." He reported that he had expressed his will to President Salinas to resolve the Canadian trade balance deficit with Mexico, which is approximately $1.5 billion. He also offered to open an office for the state-owned Mexican Petroleum in Calgary, Alberta, to sell its services and technology. Chretien made other proposals, such as a firm agreement under which the Canadian Cameco Corporation would sell uranium to Mexico for its nuclear power plant in Laguna Verde, Veracruz, in addition to the fuel is now supplies. Chretien left Mexico City just after midday to go to a Caribbean beach resort for a two-day rest with his wife.
