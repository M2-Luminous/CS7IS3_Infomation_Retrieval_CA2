FBIS4-29882 "dreas120_a_94023" FBIS-EAS-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan SDPJ Shows Interest in Rejoining Ruling Coalition SDPJ Shows Interest in Rejoining Ruling Coalition OW2206104294 Tokyo KYODO in English 1022 GMT 22 Jun 94 OW2206104294 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] displayed willingness Wednesday to mend frayed ties with the ruling coalition, from which it split in April, by presenting a policy outline at the outset of crucial realliance talks. The SDP put forth its platform on forming a new government during separate talks with the ruling coalition, the leading opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and New Party Sakigake [Harbinger]. In talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority coalition, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo expressed strong interest in returning to the ruling camp, party officials said. "We feel responsibility for destabilizing the government," he said in a meeting with Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] secretary general and the coalition's key strategist, and other coalition officials. The SDP broke off from the coalition in April immediately following Hata's election as premier after its partners moved to create a new Diet bloc, excluding the SDP. The party interpreted the step as an effort to put it in the backseat in policy-making. In Wednesday talks, the SDP and the coalition agreed on an early summit between Hata and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to iron out key policy differences. The main issues on the negotiation table are the timing of submitting bills to redraw electoral districts for the House of Representatives, a proposed consumption tax hike and the manner of policy-making within the coalition. The two sides will hold the second round of talks Thursday morning. The SDP made clear its primary target is rapprochement with the coalition, at least for now, rather than an alliance with the LDP, the SDP's longstanding rival, the officials said. The SDP turned down the LDP's overture for immediate talks to create a stopgap cabinet for a snap election. The LDP, which formally decided the same day to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet after the budget is passed, readily embraced the SDP policy blueprint and pressed the socialists to join hands with the party. The SDP response was noncommital. The coalition also greeted the SDP's proposals with eagerness, and Ozawa expressed hope for cooperation with the SDP to create ''a government with a strong foundation.'' The coalition also showed a compromising posture on the key issue of a consumption tax hike, a touchy issue for the SDP, by deciding in an executive meeting to delay a final decision on the size of the hike. The coalition's solo exception to the SDP plan concerned bills to redraw electoral maps for the lower house in line with political reform bills enacted in January. Ozawa called for such bills to be submitted to the current Diet session, which ends next Wednesday, while the SDP wants them submitted in the next session to avoid an extension of the current term. The apparently smooth start of realliance talks notwithstanding, the fate of the two-month-old Hata cabinet remains unclear, political analysts said. The SDP leadership is under pressure from party members who are leery about their leaders' readiness to return to the coalition, according to the analysts. Kubo, a pro-coalition leader, underscored awareness of the skepticism by telling Sakigake [Harbinger] officials that the SDP still wants Hata's resignation. Kubo said the SDP blueprint ''doesn't indicate acceptance of the current government. The role of the Hata cabinet will come to an end when the budget passes the Diet.'' Ruling and opposition parties agreed the same day to pass the budget bills through the House of Councillors Thursday evening to making them law. The spotlight will then be cast on the SDP, which holds a key in the nation's political course. Failure of the SDP-coalition talks would certainly lead to passage of a no-confidence vote against the Hata cabinet, leaving Hata with an unpalatable choice of stepping down with his ministers or dissolving the lower house for snap polls. Even if the talks prove successful and pave the way for the SDP's reentry into the ruling camp, Hata may still be forced to leave office, bowing to a possible SDP demand, SDP sources said. It is also possible that some SDP lawmakers will break ranks with party leadership and support the LDP plan for a no-confidence vote, the sources said. In any course, the Hata administration will face a critical test of survival in the days following the expected passage of the long- overdue budget Thursday, political analysts said.
