A Yugoslav memorandum handed over to the council on February 12 said Yugoslav border guards had seized large quantities of arms and ammunition carried by Albanian nationals as they tried illegally to cross the border. Twenty-one Albanians have died in the incidents since the start of last year, according to the ministry here. The memorandum was "an anti-Albanian document, provocative and full of slander," the ministry said, adding: "The border provocations are part of (Serbian President Slobodan) Milosevic's strategy to create tension and trigger war, and its consequences will be unpredictable." In its memorandum Belgrade also accused Tirana of supporting secessionist forces in Serbia's southern Kosovo province which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. But the foreign ministry said Albanians living in Kosovo were "no minority but an entire people living on its own land."
