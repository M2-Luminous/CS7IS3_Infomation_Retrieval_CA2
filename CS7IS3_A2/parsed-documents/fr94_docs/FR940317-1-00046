SUMMARY: The Department of the Army announces a revision and consolidation of 32 CFR parts 536, Claims Against the United States and 537, Claims on Behalf of the United States in order to bring them in line with new policies and procedures being promulgated in Army Regulation 27&hyph;20, Claims. This revision retains part 536 as The Army Claims System. Part 537 will be removed and held in reserve for future use. This part prescribes the policies, procedures, and responsibilities for investigating, processing, and settling claims against and in favor of the United States under the authority conferred by certain statutes, regulations, international and interdepartmental agreements, and Department of Defense directives. It is intended to ensure that claims are properly investigated, adjudicated objectively and fairly, and either paid or collection action initiated. Because of the complexity and length of changes and consolidation of parts 536 and 537, a breakout of the scope or responsibilities of each subpart to this whole part is listed in the Supplemental Information part of this submission. JAG offices, individuals and/or organizations currently using Army Regulation 27&hyph;20 or the current issue of 32 CFR part 536 and 537, dated 1 July 1993, should review this revision against the current versions in order to determine the additions, deletions or other changes being made. By reviewing the supplemental information portion, reading of the complete part becomes necessary in order to understand the entire part. DATES: Comments must be received by the Army Claims Service not later than April 18, 1994.
