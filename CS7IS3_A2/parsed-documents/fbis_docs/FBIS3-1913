When attending a soiree yesterday, Zhu Yucheng said: On the new airport issue, the Chinese side has all along acted in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on the new airport, but the British side has delayed for a long time before advancing its fourth financial proposal. There is still a big problem with the proposal, that is, who will actually bear the debt amounting to 23 billion Hong Kong dollars or so? The British Hong Kong Government intends to turn the Airport Authority into a so-called "corporation," saying that the debts will be shifted to the "corporation" in the future. However, the behind-the-scenes backer of the "corporation" is the Hong Kong Government. Like the Mass Transit Railway Corporation, the corporation is fully funded by the Hong Kong Government. Therefore, superficially, the new airport's debts are shifted to the "corporation" but at the end, they will be borne by the future special administrative region government and will be all shifted to the compatriots in Hong Kong. Zhu Yucheng pointed out: The objective of the Britons before quitting Hong Kong is very clear. Economically, grabbing the maximum benefits and politically, making arrangements for their group [ban zi 3803 1311], in an attempt to compel the special administrative region government to accept it and thus exercise British rule without the Britons. He hoped that the Hong Kong people would cast away illusions and no longer expect that a colonialist official could leave anything good for them. British officials can only grab the maximum benefits for the British side.
