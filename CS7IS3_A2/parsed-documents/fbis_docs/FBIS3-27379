[passage omitted] At the forum, in line with their working, ideological, and social reality, the 10 outstanding communist party members set forth their opinions and suggestions on bringing into play the communist party members' exemplary role in the new situation, strengthening the party organizational work, improving spiritual civilization, strengthening the ideological and educational work, and fostering an accurate world outlook and an accurate outlook on life. Chen Xitong conscientiously heard their speeches and noted down their opinions and suggestions. He said: You are representatives of Beijing's outstanding communist party members. The selection of 10 outstanding communist party members from among one million members is a great matter of Beijing. By disseminating the excellent deeds of the 10 outstanding party members, we have educated the party members and promoted party building. So, we should also continue to disseminate the advanced thinking and deeds of the 10 outstanding party members; the lofty ideals, sentiment, and morality of communist party members; an accurate world outlook; and an accurate outlook on life so as to further foster a new brilliant image for communist party members. Chen Xitong said: Today, we invite you to this forum to mainly discuss the great matter of strengthening party building in the new situation and the great matter of promoting reform and development. Your opinions are conducive to the work of the municipal party committee and the improvement and enhancement of party building. While talking about the building of party grass-roots branches, some comrades maintained that the party is likened to a big tree and the grass-roots party organizations are likened to the root of the tree. So long as the grass-roots organizations are well built will the party have powerful vitality and combat effectiveness. This opinion is very good. We should realistically strengthen the building of grass-roots party organizations, including those in such new spheres as high scientific and technological units and three types of foreign-funded enterprises; and bring into better play the functions of grass-roots party organizations. After election of new leading bodies, the districts and counties in the municipality should strengthen the building of grass-roots party organizations, particularly backward party branches. Chen Xitong said: Under the present situation that the planned economic system is being replaced by the socialist market economic system, we should continue to persist in the principle of "taking a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough," further upgrade our understanding, adopt effective measures, strengthen the improvement of spiritual civilization, and strengthen the ideological education. We should adopt various forms, that the masses are likely to see and hear, to strengthen the ideological and political work. It is necessary to disseminate an accurate world outlook and an accurate outlook on life. We should learn from the 10 outstanding communist party members, foster a great lofty ideal, give no thoughts to personal gains and losses, persistently serve the people wholeheartedly, and fight for making the country strong and building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Chen Xitong urged that in the new year, the 10 outstanding communist party members should do their jobs well, bring the communist party members' exemplary role into play, and make new progress in various spheres. Chen Guangwen praised that the 10 outstanding communist party members are the banners and models of the municipal party member contingent. He urged that the 10 outstanding communist party members should cherish their glory, accept trials, set more strict demands on themselves, bring their exemplary vanguard role into better play, and make greater contributions to the setup of the socialist market economic system and the improvement of the spiritual and material civilizations.
