A right-of-way thereon for ditches and canals constructed by the authority of the United States. Act of August 30, 1890 (43 U.S.C. 945). 2.

CLASSIFICATION COMMENTS: Interested parties may submit comments involving the suitability of the land for a Good Shepard Campus. Comments on the classification are restricted to whether the land is physically suited for a Good Shepard Campus, whether the use will maximize the future use or uses of the land, whether the use is consistent with local planning and zoning, or if the use is consistent with State and Federal programs. APPLICATION COMMENTS: Interested parties may submit comments regarding the specific use proposed in the recreation and public purposes application and plan of development, whether the BLM followed proper administrative procedures in reaching the decision, or any other factor not directly related to the suitability of the land for a Good Shepard Campus. In the absence of any adverse comments, the realty action will become the final determination of the Department of the Interior effective 60 days from the date of its publication in the Federal Register.
