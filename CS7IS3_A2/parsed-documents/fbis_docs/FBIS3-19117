Prior to the visit to the Czech Republic by Netherlands Queen Beatrix on 22-24 March, the prime minister outlined his country's views on the issues affecting present-day Europe. [Plesnik] Many leading Czech politicians believe that the integration of the countries of Central and East Europe will mean far-reaching changes not only for the postcommunist countries, but also for West Europe itself. [Lubbers] This is already happening. I will not only refer to the Association Agreements with the East European countries -- they are certainly opening the gates, and not just to one-way traffic. The current world is characterized by the globalization of the economy; in this new and changed situation, new pressure is coming from those seeking membership to the European Union, not only from the former communist countries, but also from countries such as Austria and Scandinavia. What is the result? Greater competitiveness, tougher competition, and new impulses. Let me give you an example: How do we stimulate investments in the financially demanding most modern technologies so that we stay abreast of Japan or the United States? Until recently, our financial system preferred direct taxation, because it guaranteed progressive taxes and, consequently, higher revenue for the state and the possibility of higher social benefits. Now, everything has changed quite substantially. Even the left-wing Greens, who were successful in the local elections on Wednesday [2 March], have beseeched us: Support indirect taxation; it could release funds for ecological projects, for other sources of energy. [Plesnik] Do you share the view of some politicians in the postcommunist Central European countries that the vision of a united Europe along the lines of Maastricht was premature and naive? [Lubbers] No, I do not think this at all. I look at the Maastricht Treaty on two levels: On the one hand, as a specific vision following the culmination of which the Community should shift as a whole to a higher level and, on the other hand, as something that contains the resources for fulfilling this vision. This is not a stiff, rigid strategy, but one that can be modified relatively flexibly. I have in mind, for instance, the negotiations on the affiliation of Austria and Norway to the European Union being held since the beginning of this week, negotiations that went into the smallest details. [Plesnik] The Russian nationalist Zhirinovskiy forecasts that, sooner or later, the Czech Republic will be swallowed up by Germany and, thus, the instincts of previous generations will be aroused. What are the Netherlands' experiences with European Germany as a partner? Does the country view it as such a threat as, for example, some of the Danes? [Lubbers] The Netherlands, as a small country, immediately and fatefully depended for centuries on communication and contacts with the surrounding world, including an economically and politically influential neighbor. This has something to do with national identity and preserving and developing it, because it is not ingrained forever. I view equilibrium in relations with a strong and influential Germany based on democratic principles, a Germany integrating into Europe, as a challenge and as a stimulus for the Netherlands itself. [Plesnik] Do you think that the Kingdom of the Netherlands will "disappear" in the future European federal superstate or will it try to preserve its identity? [Lubbers] I do not think that we would be lost in the Europe of the future. Society in the Netherlands in recent years has transformed itself from a traditional social welfare state into a state with a resolutely functioning government and responsible citizens and has found a certain equilibrium between these two elements. The state is simply moving toward the citizen as much as possible -- take culture, health care, and education. Of course, the state is not abandoning its mission, because some of the most pressing issues can only be resolved on a pan-European or even global level -- for example, ecology. Naturally, during the Cold War, while someone was labelled an adversary, it was simpler to lump people together. However, the situation has changed, and it is the task of politicians not to make promises that cannot be fulfilled, but to constantly communicate with the citizens.
