UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi immediately condemned the attack and said he had protested to Serb leader Radovan Karadzic over the incident, which comes ahead of peace talks scheduled in Geneva Thursday. The aircraft, an Ilyushin-76 arriving from Split in Croatia, took off again without unloading after nine shells landed in the close vicinity of the airport within a 20-minute period. There were no casualties. One of the shells landed 20 metres (yards) away from the emergency services' base, and another 200 metres (yards) from the airport's control tower, an UNPROFOR statement said. A radar system operated by a Jordanian contingent attached to the UN Nordic Battalion revealed that the shells were fired from Bosnian Serb position 16 kilometers (10 miles) southeast of the airport, the statement added. "Mr. Akashi said that such deliberate targeting of UNPROFOR, only a few days before scheduled talks in Geneva on a general ceasefire agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was regrettable," it said. "Mr. Akashi has expressed his deep concern regarding this incident to Dr. Karadzic." Tuzla airport was targeted by Serb artillery Monday afternoon when two shells were fired at it. Previous to that there had been no bombardments since May 17.
