We Would Seem To Have Run Aground"] [Text] Vladivostok -- The two and a half years of life under a so-called market economy have been sheer torment and torture for our ship repair plant. In the first five months of this year alone, the Pacific Fleet has run up debts to the plant in the order of 13 billion rubles [R]. This, in turn, includes R525 million in administrative fines and penalties which the plant owes to the state budget, the pension fund, and enterprises keeping us going on a day-to-day basis. Workers have not received their pay for three months running, and any attempt to explain to people why this is happening immediately turns into a spontaneous rally. Today, the plant's debts come to R2.5 billion. Another few days of operation, and then we will grind to a halt. We have run aground. The main directorate is asking that production continue even at the cost of halting military ship repairs altogether and occupying production capacities with any output. But how long will these measures last?
