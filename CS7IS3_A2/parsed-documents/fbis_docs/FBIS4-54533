[Begin Pawlak recording] If we are talking about abolishing wage controls, then, in a situation in which we have seen such a widespread strike action, those in favor of such a step being taken quickly and without any further safeguards are left without arguments. We respect all trade unions in an equal manner. We do not intend to single out any of them, and we are keen to resolve problems. Yesterday was a good day and a good example. These talks were undertaken with the participation of all important trade unions, which are cooperating within the framework of the tripartite commission. It has turned out that, when very varied milieux are represented in these direct talks, those that are very involved in traditional industries, those that are financed from the state budget, the teachers and the health service employees, then the exchange of opinions within the trade unions themselves makes it possible to understand the situation better and to find solutions. It also turns out that the government is not the only party that should take all of the actions that are required. The tripartite commission, attended by Solidarity and other trade unions, accepted that, as a first step, on 4 May, three matters would be discussed: the law on wage control, initial income tax installments, and a timetable for introducing laws concerning the pact on enterprises. The protests are not justified on such a large scale, nor is the dramatic involvement of the planning departments of our industry. All the same, however, they show very clearly how great the people's impatience is that these difficult matters be resolved. This is a sign for us. I believe that we need a sincere dialogue. [end recording] This was an excerpt from a statement by the prime minister, who was in Krakow today and took part in a meeting of the management from the national fire service and voluntary fire brigades.
