It is open to European democracies that commit themselves to the goals of the European Union. The current expansion by four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries -- namely Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria -- is the first one since the end of the Cold War. Their accession to the European Union will finally put an end to the competition of two West European concepts for the future shaping of our continent. The current model of the European Union, which is equipped with common institutions, has managed to dominate over the idea of a simple free trade zone. This is of extraordinary and important significance for the future European system. [applause] Already, today the European Union forms the one anchor of stability on our continent and reliably prevents the return of nation states and changing coalitions to Europe. It stands for a large single market, which multiplies the prosperity of all member states and increases their international competitiveness, and it stands for a Europe of solidarity that has set for itself the goal of gradually harmonizing the differences in performance and prosperity within the European Union. These are sufficient reasons for many European democracies to press into this union. Therefore, the current round of expansion will not and must not be the last one. [applause] Its conclusion will prove that the European Union is capable of acting on the basis of the treaty, which came into force on 1 November 1993. Being capable of action also means establishing a consensus to ensure peace in freedom and prosperity on our continent. The expansion will also -- and this is very important -- give an encouraging signal to the reform democracies in Central and East Europe that the European Union is not a closed society of the rich and the secure. [applause] This also makes it clear that the united Germany will not remain the eastern border country of the European Union. It is moving into the center of Europe again, politically as well. [applause] Ladies and Gentlemen, the acceptance of the three Nordic countries and of Austria into the European Union is an essential step on the path toward reestablishing the balance in Europe. The Federal Government has never identified itself with the concept of a western or southwestern union. It has always committed itself to the entire Europe. [applause] Just as in the 1980's, we acted as the advocate of the expansion to the south and emphatically -- I stress the term emphatically for a special reason -- came out in favor of membership for Spain, Portugal, and Greece. From the very beginning we have energetically supported the desire of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway to become members. The current round of negotiations is not taking place at the cost of Europe's southern countries. [applause] Just like all other member states and the new members, they also will benefit from the fact that the European Union will be strengthened in political, economic, and cultural terms by the addition of four tested democratic states with efficient national economies that are committed to free world trade. It is correct that the new members will better balance the European Union within itself, and it is obvious -- and we said this in Brussels during the negotiations and I am saying this here again -- that for Germany, in its central location, this is a not an unimportant benefit. Ladies and Gentlemen, during the current negotiations, the Federal Government has primarily been guided by the interest in strengthening the European Union and the stability of the entire Europe. German and European interests are identical on these questions. Germany's future is in Europe. Security and the prosperity of our country are linked inseparably with European unification. A failure of these negotiations, a stalling of the European unification somewhere in the middle, would harm all Europeans. [applause] Membership negotiations began on 1 January 1993, and in Norway's case on 1 April 1993. It is a really great achievement of all governments involved and of the Brussels Commission that these negotiations have practically been concluded with three states in approximately one year and that we are on the verge of a breakthrough with Norway. If the Council session next Tuesday [15 March] achieves this goal -- and the Federal Government will once again do everything possible to achieve this goal -- then there is a good chance that all four countries will be accepted into the European Union on time, on 1 January 1995, just as we planned. [applause] I would like to expressly note that Germany cordially welcomes all four countries as close partners in the expanded European Union. [applause] They enrich and strengthen the European Union. With the appropriate and necessary modesty, I would like to note that we certainly would not have come this far without the Federal Government's contribution. [applause] I feel myself confirmed and justified that we pushed for speed, thus producing and passing on the necessary momentum, and helped as mediators. On this occasion, I would like to thank all those in the Federal Government and beyond who contributed to getting this far. Over the past weeks, we went through marathons that were unique even for Brussels. The goal is right within our reach. It simply must not be that this expansion, which is so important for all of Europe, fails because of a few thousand tonnes of codfish. This cannot be right. [applause] I stated during the negotiations at night that it really can not be right that we are negotiating and talking about dimensions, which amount to 2, 3, or 4 million ECU. Norway's accession must not fail because of that. [applause] Nor must it be that the process of European unification suffers a serious setback because of internal problems among old members. No one should be deceived -- a failure of the membership negotiations would give rise to a serious crisis for Europe. Therefore, from this position, I appeal to the Spanish and, above all, also to the British Government to contribute constructively to achieving this goal that is so close now on Tuesday. [applause] Ladies and Gentlemen, the expanded European Union will constitute the largest market in the world -- with 370 million people and a clearly higher economic capacity than the United States or Japan. Two out of three German jobs in exports depend on trade with this economic area. I say once again here in the German Bundestag: There is no large industrial and economic country that can be compared with Germany in terms of being dependent on one single region -- namely, Europe in this case. One must tell the Germans this again and again. [unintelligible interjections, applause] From Germany's viewpoint, expansion is also advantageous because the ideas of the countries that want to join the European Union in terms of environmental protection and social safeguards largely correspond with our own. In addition, all new members -- perhaps also Finland -- will be net payers. At the beginning, this will not be fully effective because the European Union will help them with overcoming the difficult problems at the beginning, but later on, it will be important. In the medium term, the accession of economically strong European neighbors will contribute to easing the burden on Germany. Ladies and Gentlemen, the participation of the four countries in the development of the EU's foreign and security policy will be an important advantage. Austria, Sweden, and Finland, which have been neutral so far, also accept -- and this is very important -- the foreign policy achievements of the European Union without any if's, and's, or but's and commit themselves to the goals set down in the treaty. By the way -- and this should not be forgotten either -- they have a very high foreign policy profile and a lot of experience, in particular in the United Nations, regarding peacekeeping operations. This will benefit the European Union and the development of its own identity, especially in this field. [applause] Ladies and Gentlemen, the Federal Government on 15 March will go to Brussels with the firm will to achieve a breakthrough with Norway and a consensus on all other open questions. However, I would also like to say very clearly, calmly, and in a businesslike manner that its readiness for compromise hits its limits where the success of the referendums or the approval of the European Parliament are endangered. This would, for instance, be the case of the threshold for the blocking minority if the Council were to be put at such a low level that majority decisions would be made considerably more difficult. On 15 March, we want to formally conclude the negotiations with all four countries and hope that all other partners will act in the same spirit. [applause] Time is of the essence if we still want to maintain 1 January 1995 as the date of accession. Before the treaties can be signed, the European Parliament must approve them. From here, I also appeal to its deputies to take the political significance of the expansion into account and to deal speedily with the treaties, regardless of the forthcoming new elections and without any formalism. [applause] I am sure -- and this also must be known and taken into account by the European Parliament -- that this is extremely important for the credibility of European policy, especially before the European elections on 12 June. [applause] In addition to the approval of the European Parliament and the ratification of the membership treaties, a precondition for accession on 1 January 1995 is a positive result of the referendums in the would-be members. We should and must not forget that, and it should particularly be kept in mind by our partners during the talks on 15 March. I am an optimist. The Nordic countries and Austria have weighed the matter carefully. They know their future lies in the European Union. They also know that they need not fear any loss of national characteristics and domestic way of life. The European Union stands for a Europe of variety, a Europe of the citizens and the regions. I would like to expressly thank the German Bundestag for the constant support granted to the negotiating by the Federal Government. The awareness -- in particular, at such difficult negotiations, and they were and remain difficult -- that one is able to act on the basis of a broad political consensus means strength. I hope that the German Bundestag, which must agree to the membership treaties, will also do its part so that we can keep to the intended target date. It would be important for Europe and it would be important also for Germany. Therefore, we hope that the final breakthrough can be achieved on Tuesday. [applause]
