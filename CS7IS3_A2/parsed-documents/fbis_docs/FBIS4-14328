This process is important and consequential for Israel as well. The sources said that the rapprochement between the two organizations came against the background of Hamas attempts to share control of the autonomy institutions. The understandings between the two organizations were reached in a bid to reduce internecine fighting during the sensitive period when the Palestinians assume authority over the autonomous areas. The sources attribute great importance to the prevention of internecine fighting between the two organizations and say that an agreement between them could lead to a reduction in terrorism and violence in the Gaza Strip.
