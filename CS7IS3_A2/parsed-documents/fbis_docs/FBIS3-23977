It warmed up only during the last few days of the month; precipitation, on the other hand, was low (mostly 20-40 percent of the normal level). The coldest temperatures in the European part of Russia were registered during the first half of the month. The average temperature during that period was eight to 12 degrees below normal. However, on the greater part of the territory of the Central, Central Chernozem, in the south of the Volgo-Vyatka and Urals regions, and in the Middle Volga area winter grain crops and perennial grasses were securely protected from cold by a sufficiently high snow cover. In most places it was 35-45 centimeters high, which is one and a half to two times as high as the average value calculated over many years. The lowest soil temperature at the winter grain tilling depth here stayed mainly within the optimum range--minus six to minus nine degrees, and the extreme cold (minus 28-35 degrees and below) was not dangerous for the crops. In the Central Chernozem region, in the eastern part of the Central region, and in the Middle Volga area registered cold temperatures (below -28 degrees) could cause damage to flower buds and the annual growth of fruit-bearing plants in some places. In the Northern, the northern part of the Central, and in the north part of the Volgo-Vyatka and Urals regions winter grain crops were still under a very high (55-65 centimeters or more) snow cover. Soil did not freeze much under such a blanket. Rotting process have been noticed over the greater part of the month. Plants continued to intensively use up nutrients for breathing, which leads to their exhaustion. These conclusions are supported by results of test sprouting of winter crops conducted by meteorological stations. Higher than usual sparseness of winter rye plants in tests (more than 10 percent of plants, and in places more than 30 percent) has been already noted in a number of rayons in Vologda, Yaroslavl, and Kirov Oblasts, as well as in some fields in Arkhangelsk and Perm Oblasts and the Republic of Bashkortostan. The lowest soil temperature at the tilling depth of winter crops was around freezing in February as well. In the North Caucasus and the Lower Volga area the coldest temperatures were registered in the beginning of the second 10-day period of February. The average air temperature during this period was seven to 12 degrees below normal. There was no snow cover in the fields, or its height was no more than 1-3 centimeters. The soil cooled quickly. The lowest soil temperature at the winter grain tilling depth dropped to minus 12-15 degrees. In the south of Rostov Oblast, in a number of rayons in Krasnodar Kray, and in some rayons in Stavropol Kray, as well as in Kalmykia and Astrakhan Oblast, the soil temperature at the winter crops tilling depth was even lower--minus 16-18 degrees (in the south of Astrakhan Oblast -20 degrees). In this region, winterkilling is possible over a considerable part of the area, especially of underdeveloped crops of winter wheat and barley, and in the south of Astrakhan Oblast, of rye. An unfavorable factor for further wintering of winter crops is that a ground-in ice crust remains on the soil in the fields in the Northwestern, Central, and Central Chernozem regions and in some places in the south of the Volga Region. Its thickness practically has not increased in February and measured 15-30 millimeters in most places, and in Saratov and Volgograd Oblasts, 10-20 millimeters. In West Siberia, winter grain crops in February were under a snow cover that in most places was 25-45 centimeters high or more. Therefore, despite severe cold temperatures registered during some periods of the month, the lowest soil temperature at the winter crops tilling depth stayed mostly within the range of -7 to -12 degrees and only in some places in Altay Kray and Kemerovo Oblast did it drop to minus 16-20 degrees. The wintering of winter grain crops in February proceeded well. According to the preliminary forecast of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, the average air temperature in March over the greater part of territory is expected to be one to three degrees above average. Only on the greater part of the territory of the North Caucasus region will it be close to normal. The amount of precipitation to the south of the Kaluga-Penza-Samara line is expected to be below normal; in the Northwestern region and in the Urals--above normal. On the rest of the territory of the European part of Russia it will be close to normal. In the northeastern part of the European territory higher than usual temperatures expected in March (two-three degrees above normal) will help to melt snow in the fields and to diminish the rot damage to winter grain crops.
