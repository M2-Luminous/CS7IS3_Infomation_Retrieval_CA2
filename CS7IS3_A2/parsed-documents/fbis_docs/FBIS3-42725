Chernomyrdin by I. Yakovleva; place and date not given: "V. Chernomyrdin: `One of the Special Features of 1994 Will Be the Government's Realistic Approach to Promises. We Cannot Do Everything Now, But the Decisions We Make Must Be Backed Up By Finances': The Prime Minister of the Russian Government Answers Our Readers' Questions"] [Text] [Yakovleva] Viktor Stepanovich, a question that concerns all economic subjects: Will the reshuffling in the government cause a substantial correction of the course of reforms? [Chernomyrdin] The Program of Reforms adopted on 6 August 1993 and then approved by the president did not undergo any corrections when Ye. Gaydar joined the government in September last year. Neither are there now, nor will there be, any drastic corrections to the government's course of reforms. There will be a certain correction with respect to methods, which is dictated not by personnel reshuffling but by life itself. [Yakovleva] Speaking of methods of pulling the economy out of the crisis--combating inflation and preventing a catastrophic production decline are two ends of the same stick. Is one direction favored over the other? [Chernomyrdin] The government has never been divided into two groups--supporters of reining in the growth in the money supply and those in favor of preventing a deep decline by pumping money into the economy, with the resulting inflation. There has always been agreement that we need an optimum way of avoiding both hyperinflation and hyperdecline. The choice of some or other measures depended on a specific economic situation. I believe that the main task currently has been accomplished: we have constrained demand-generated inflation, when, figuratively speaking, money is chasing goods. Now it is important to halt inflation driven by costs, which is associated with the lack of real competition in the production of most varieties of goods. This is a slightly different task, which transcends the boundaries of purely macroeconomic regulation of the economy and demands different approaches capable of bringing about an improvement in the situation. For instance, it may be useful to introduce the practice of entering into agreements between the government, trade unions, and entrepreneurs with respect to setting output prices and fixing wages at a certain level for some period of time. At the same time we do not reject the strict financial policy of the past; control over the growth of money supply will not be loosened under any circumstances. [Yakovleva] On occasions you have said that the rate of inflation is in inverse correlation to the pace of reforms. What is your appraisal of the results of last year, keeping in mind that many people have not been paid and enterprises have not replenished their working capital for months? [Chernomyrdin] Financial stabilization efforts stumble against, on one hand, the structural crisis in the economy, which provokes investment stagnation and production decline. On the other hand, it runs into the actions of federal bodies of authority, which were compelled to make promises they cannot keep. I do not deny that the decline in the rate of inflation in the fourth quarter of last year, when it was brought down to 12-15 percent a month, was achieved through an increase in the government's budget liability. This is very difficult to explain to those who were affected by it, but I am convinced that we did the right thing. In our economy there is no other way of doing this. In the first quarter of 1994 budget expenditures are to remain on the level of the fourth quarter of last year. In addition, we will have to pay the most "burning" debts--to defense enterprises, the Far North, the agro-industrial complex, and the back pay to budget-financed enterprises. Back in November I foresaw that the rate of inflation in January would be 20-22 percent. True, the first quarter is always difficult; we started out the same way in 1993. On average, for the first half of the year inflation is expected to be in the range of 15-18 percent a month, and in the second half--11-12 percent; by the end of the year we hope to bring it down to 7-9 percent. Inflation in our country currently follows the inertial-oscillatory pattern. [Yakovleva] Do you see a way out of this vicious circle where the rate of inflation is predicated on the government not fulfilling its obligations? [Chernomyrdin] I do. First and foremost, the government should not make unrealistic promises. We need to conduct our work in such a way that we can carry out what we plan and promise. We should not develop a program and place orders for products unless we have the money to pay for them. This is one of the special features of this year--a realistic policy in this area. We will not be able to jump into everything--it is not possible, but once we make a decision, we have to provide financing. [Yakovleva] Can we count on preferential credits this year? [Chernomyrdin] I am a rather tightfisted man; I do not like to give away and hand out. The government will not engage in issuance of preferential credits right and left. With respect to investment, we have a program of selective support of production, and we intend to carry it out. As to unprofitable enterprises, there is a law on bankruptcy and the mechanism for its implementation. Unprofitable enterprises must be restructured or, if this is impossible, closed. Our efforts in the area of financial and credit policy must be reinforced by placing the emphasis on structural and investment policy, creating incentives for Russian producers. This will allow us to remove the causes that force the government to make promises that are hard to carry out. [Yakovleva] How can we ensure effective use of state money, to make sure that financial infusions will not be used for consumption? [Chernomyrdin] We now demand that a mechanism be put together for using credit, which will go first and foremost to the military-industrial and agrarian complexes. Such a mechanism is now being set up by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank together with these sectors. Enterprises have a lot of problems now--wages, working capital. But the important part is to ensure that this money goes into targeted programs. For the military-industrial complex this means covering unpaid-for defense orders; for agricultural enterprises--preparations for spring sowing, buying fertilizer, fuels, and spare parts, and repairing equipment. Unless such programs are submitted, enterprises will not get the money.
