Garten, visiting deputy U.S. Secretary of Commerce, here this morning at a press conference upon conclusion of his Beijing visit. Garten, together with a delegation of officials from the U.S. Department of Commerce and State Department, came to Beijing as a part of his Asian trip aimed at boosting U.S. export-promotion efforts to the "big emerging markets", including China and Indonesia. Garten said he had discussed current trade issues with officials of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-Operation (MOFTEC). "The talks have been cordial, business-like and productive," he said. The United States and China have agreed on the agenda for the upcoming meeting of the bilateral Joint Committee of Commerce and Trade (JCCT) in mid-April in Washington. "We would like to turn it into a major form of co-operation with China," Garten said. He noted that during the meeting both sides will talk about trade and investment; individual industries, including information, energy, environmental technologies and chemicals; and economic reforms. He said that exchanges of opinions on each other's economic reforms will enhance mutual understandings of differences. Garten said one of the purposes of his present trip was to demonstrate the increasing U.S. commitment to Asia. And no matter what happens, he added, the U.S. and China, two of the world's major economies, will continue to engage in the global economy.
