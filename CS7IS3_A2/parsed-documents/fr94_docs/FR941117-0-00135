FR941117-0-00135 FR941117-0-00011 §22.702 Eligibility. Existing and proposed communications common carriers are eligible to hold authorizations to operate conventional central office, interoffice and rural stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Only local exchange carriers that have been state certified to provide basic exchange telephone service (or others having state approval to provide such service) in the pertinent area are eligible to hold authorizations for Basic Exchange Telephone Radio Systems (BETRS). Subscribers are also eligible to hold authorizations to operate rural subscriber stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. §22.703 Separate rural subscriber station authorization not required. A separate authorization is not required for rural subscriber stations for which the effective radiated power does not exceed 60 Watts and for which FAA notification of construction or alteration of the antenna structure is not required (see criteria in §17.7 of this chapter). Authority to operate such rural subscriber stations is conferred by the authorization of the central office or base station from which they receive service. §22.705 Rural radiotelephone system configuration. Stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service are authorized to communicate as follows: (a) Rural subscriber stations are authorized to communicate with and through the central office station(s) with which they are associated. However, where the establishment of a central office station in this service is not feasible, rural subscriber stations may be authorized to communicate with and through a base station in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service. (b) Central office stations may communicate only with rural subscriber stations. (c) Interoffice stations may communicate only with other interoffice stations. §22.709 Rural radiotelephone service application requirements. In addition to information required by subparts B and D of this part, applications for authorization to operate a station in the Rural Radiotelephone Service must contain the applicable supplementary information described in this section. (a) Interoffice stations. Applications for authority to operate a new interoffice station or to add transmitters or points of communications to an existing interoffice station must contain an exhibit demonstrating that the requested facilities would be used only for interconnecting central office stations and explaining why the use of alternative existing radio or wire facilities is not feasible. (b) Technical information required. For each transmitter in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, the following information is required by FCC Form 401 Schedule B: (1) Location description; city; county; state; geographical coordinates correct to # 1 second, the datum used (NAD 27 or NAD 83), site elevation above mean sea level, proximity to adjacent market boundaries and international borders; (2) Antenna manufacturer, model number and type, antenna height to tip above ground level, the height of the center of radiation of the antenna above the average terrain, the height of the antenna center of radiation above the average elevation of the terrain along each of the 8 cardinal radials, antenna gain in the maximum lobe, the beamwidth of the maximum lobe of the antenna, a polar plot of the horizontal gain pattern of the antenna, the electric field polarization of the wave emitted by the antenna when installed as proposed; (3) The center frequency of each channel requested, the maximum effective radiated power, the effective radiated power in each of the cardinal radial directions, any non-standard emission types to be used, including bandwidth and modulation type, the transmitter classification (e.g. central office), and the locations and call signs, if any, of any fixed points of communication. (c) No landline facilities. Each application for a central office station must contain an exhibit showing that it is impracticable to provide the required communication service by means of landline facilities. (d) Interference exhibit. Applications for central office, interoffice and relay stations must include an exhibit identifying co-channel facilities and demonstrating, in accordance with §22.715 that the proposed station, if authorized, would not cause interference to the service of those co-channel facilities. This exhibit must: (1) For UHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located within 108 kilometers (67 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour exceeds 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles); and identify each protected Basic Exchange Telephone Radio System central office transmitter in the rural Radiotelephone Service within 231 kilometers (144 miles). (2) For VHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located within 135 kilometers (84 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 93.3 kilometers (58 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour exceeds 93.3 kilometers (58 miles). (3) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of distance calculations indicating that there would be no overlap of service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the licensee of or applicant for the protected transmitter and/or the applicant, as required, have agreed in writing to accept any interference resulting from operation of the proposed transmitter.
