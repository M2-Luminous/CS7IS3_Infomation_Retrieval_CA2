He told the Commons Transport Select Committee that Britain is keen to give U.S. airlines freedom to fly into regional airports. In return, Britain wants greater access to U.S. destinations. "We have offered an immediate lifting of all restrictions on services to all airports in the UK except Heathrow and Gatwick," Mr MacGregor said. "I very much regret that we have not had a positive response from the United States to these proposals. Nor, indeed, have they been able to agree a date for talks to resume," he added. American airlines argue that Heathrow and Gatwick are what they want because of their strategic value as a hub to the rest of Europe.
