The speech, supplemented by a discussion, was delivered in German. The addendum on Macroeconomic Rules, published below, was not contained in the speech. The subject of my speech is a discussion on the current epochal role of the postcommunist countries within the context of European integration. This role is characterized by a number of specific national traits and features; however, it also has its own general laws that are today better understood and better formulated and that will certainly soon be written down in a manual entitled "How the Communist System Is Being Transformed." The Domestic View There are three prerequisites for successful transformation: 1. Formulating a clear vision--that is, a vision of a social order in accordance with our own ideals (the ideological role); 2. Creating a general consensus in society, which, of course, is impossible without "selling" this vision in a contest among political parties (within the framework of parliamentary democracy); 3. Understanding for the peculiarities of the transition period and then, in particular, for the ability of the political representatives to put into practice, decisively and purposefully and, at the same time, sensitively, flexibly, and considerately, the reform strategy following from this. This means with regard to the social sectors of the population that will, in the short term, have to come to terms with certain negative factors in this process (the economic role). Of all of the postcommunist countries, the Czech Republic has made the most progress in this role, despite the unfortunate breakup of the state, which we really did not want. We have already achieved the following: --we have established a party-political system corresponding to Western standards, including ideologically "well-defined" parties; --we have won reliable support from the public (to date, there has not been a single serious conflict in the social sphere); --we have formulated a sensible and very liberal economic policy; --the Czech Republic has the lowest and most controlled rate of inflation (approximately 10 percent per annum); --we have a very low unemployment level (3.5 percent at the end of 1993); --we have a balanced state budget; --despite the fact that we introduced a functioning system for the Czech koruna's internal convertibility, we have a stable foreign currency exchange rate (for 37 months now, since December 1990); --we have a balance of payments surplus and rising foreign currency reserves, and our exports are increasing rapidly; --the decline of the gross national product has been halted; --we have attained a rapid pace in deregulation, liberalization, and privatization. These are all factors that plainly differentiate us from the other Central and East European states. The Obstacles and Twists and Turns of Transformation The results of the recent elections in Poland and also the political disputes in Russia--just to mention two examples--indicate that the transition process from communism to democracy and a market economy will not follow a direct route but will contain obstacles and twists and turns, and also that this process will take longer in different countries. In the West, the problems of the postcommunist countries are considered to be a consequence of the blocking tactics of the supporters of the old social orders. This is also the view held by a sizable percentage of the public in postcommunist countries. Unfortunately, these ideas do not correspond at all to the facts. Far greater obstacles to the reform process--of course, not so much in the Czech Republic as in the other postcommunist countries--are: --insisting on a negative vision (unity in rejecting the communist past is a characteristic feature, however) without establishing a positive consensus (the result is extreme political atomization); --a lingering unwillingness to give up state paternalism. Of course, satisfaction at the demise of political confinement and the bureaucratic restriction of economic freedom (especially private ownership) is clearly formulated here, but this is something else. Preference is still given to security (to a relatively high level of welfare) over the insecurity that may be caused by the greater risks of the results of a market economy; --the illusions of left-wing intellectuals (constantly nourished from the West) about various "third ways," about the possibility of establishing a just and efficiently functioning world, and about the necessity of managing social processes by a so-called select intellectual elite; --petty politicking instead of a realistic and pragmatic policy. The attempt to achieve the maximum political effect in the shortest possible time instead of a clear-sighted political strategy, and political gestures instead of everyday meticulous political work; --a misunderstanding of the inevitabilities of the epoch of transition, inability to cope with reform strategy, and the incorrect choice of the sequence of the individual reform steps. The Rules for Transformation I would like to mention in this regard a few basic but important rules for transformation. Any attempt to plan the individual reform steps in detail does not have a chance. Despite this, certain basic rules should be observed. My experiences tell me that we have to begin with a considerable dose of restrictive macroeconomic policy. This way, we will achieve the basis for liberalizing prices and liberalizing foreign trade and also, by reducing subsidies, a dramatic turnaround in the economic climate. A country that does not initiate this macroeconomic policy at the very beginning of the reform process will, inevitably, find itself in a situation that I described four years ago as a "reform trap": This is a vicious circle of high inflation (or even hyperinflation), repeated devaluation of the currency, rising foreign indebtedness, budget deficits, and so on. I venture to claim that the CSFR was, and the current Czech Republic is, a country that unequivocally and without any pressure from outside introduced, deliberately and more decisively, these unpopular but essential measures. Radical and merciless liberalization of prices and foreign trade is another essential measure. In this way, we will achieve: --the opening up of markets; --a market evaluation of property, goods, and services; --changes in the former irrational modes of behavior; --economic balance; --and the economic entities at the supply side of the market will receive the right signals. The exchange rate, at this point, must become a firm nominal anchor. It must operate like an Archimedes point for the whole economic system, the only stable nominal value for the economy that does not succumb to fluctuations. The currency, evaluated by its purchasing power parity, has to be substantially devalued on account of the enormous structural defects of the centrally planned economy, defects that manifest themselves in the form of a balance-of-payments deficit. After the government has resisted appeals for help, subsidies, modernization, and demonopolization, it must commence a comprehensive process of privatization. This is the only way to achieve far-reaching changes, this is the only way to find real (and, therefore, responsible and rationally behaving) owners, and this is the only way to strike a meaningful blow against the attempts of bureaucracy to control the economy. These basic rules for the course of reform are certainly neither original nor innovative. If they seem original to us, this is merely because they are often forgotten and ignored. The Foreign Aspects All of transformation must be carried out at home, and, therefore, the role of the "rest of the world" is small. We need general political support, we also need guarantees for our external security, and we need financial support in the form of loans from institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Otherwise, we "only" need our integration into the global economy. And this is far more difficult than it seemed at first glance. Our former artificial economic integration--the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance--now, fortunately, belongs to the past. Economic relations within the framework of this integration did not depend on the comparative advantages of the individual member countries; therefore, they cannot be--at least, without exerting coercive pressure--restored. It will be many years before these countries are again financially and economically consolidated; therefore, it is impossible in the short and medium-time frame to bank on an increase in mutual trade. For this reason, the proposals from the West concerning increasing cooperation--for example, within the framework of the so-called Visegrad Group--are also groundless. Such cooperation cannot be created from above, but only--and perhaps only--from below. Futile "Maastricht" Ambitions The Western world--first and foremost, West Europe and the European Union--has its own problems. These problems are characterized by the current unfavorable phase of economic development and by the excessive social burden of state interventionism. They also stem from lofty and, in my opinion, futile "Maastricht" ambitions, ambitions we can say of a unitarist or almost unitarist perception of Europe. This all leads--although the external rhetoric of West European politicians says otherwise--to less openness toward the postcommunist world. When I said a few months ago that, after the 1989 "Velvet Revolution" the West had hung up a "Do Not Disturb" sign, this was certainly an exaggeration and a extreme oversimplification. However, the continuing protectionism applied in multifarious forms represents a considerable threat to our transformation role. The East is often criticized for the nationalism of its ethnic conflicts, but I would like to point out that protectionism is also a form of nationalism. The collapse of the Soviet empire created a completely new situation for us, and we are aware of this. Naturally, the collapse of the Soviet empire also created a completely new situation for the West. It also brought new uncertainties, new doubts, and new questions. We observe ambivalent tendencies and phenomena at both ends of Europe, which we cannot accept passively. We have to proceed actively against them. Centralization, Bureaucratization, Lobbies In the West, we can also see: --increasing centralization of the economic processes and the bureaucratization of everyday life; --increasing activity by various lobbies asserting only partial interests, which endangers the entire community (new feudalization); --the transfer of decisionmaking to an international level, the consequence of which is that standard domestic control mechanisms lose their function and that the key role remains in the hands of an unelected bureaucracy; --a certain comfortableness in political life, a loss of political courage, and giving priority to one's own political survival instead of to fundamental decisionmaking, which is unavoidably associated with substantially greater risks; --certain etatist thinking, ideas about an all-providing welfare guaranteeing state, while only a few people realize that the state can guarantee such a function only under the precondition that its citizens surrender a major part of their freedom. A Challenge for the Whole of Europe Resolving these problems presented by the new situation is a challenge for all of us--in the West and in the East. During those periods in which Europe was not fatefully divided, it always represented unity in abundance. The vision of European union in the sense of unification was always, in the better instance, a utopia, a dream bearing no relation to reality. In the worse instance, for example, in its "Napoleonic" variant, it involved an attempt by the larger powers to assert a European hegemony. Such solutions were always short-term ones, and they were always characterized by the use of force. T. G. Masaryk, the first president of the Czechoslovak Republic before World War II, wrote the following about this problem in 1922: "The issue in Europe involves creating harmony between centralist and autonomist forces. Europe's unity consists of this harmony. However, unity is not just homogeneity. Europe is characterized by its ethnic and cultural differences. This variety was formed by thousands of years of development; therefore, European unity must be realized, first and foremost, in accordance with the historical principle and, apart from this, of course, in accordance with the given natural national and other differences." Masaryk, in the 1920's, considered the so-called Balkanization of Europe to be a great oversimplification. According to him, the issue in fact involved a historical process and an attempt by entire nations and countries to intensify their whole political and cultural life. The following conclusions are drawn from this: The current changes in Europe create the need for a new analysis about what Europe is and what Europe should be. Europe, whether we like it or not, was opened up to the East by the collapse of the communist bloc. Europe was in fact expanded and it must now react to this new situation. The idea that the postcommunist countries will gradually be "Europeanized" and the promises that they will then be able to be gradually integrated into an unchanged West Europe are inadequate and, in principle, false. We need a new vision and new initiatives. Truly meaningful European cooperation can only take place on the basis of openness and mutuality, and that is something that we in the postcommunist countries perceive and see only inadequately. We are prepared to take an active part in this work, and we believe that we will be given an opportunity for this. Macroeconomic Rules Finding the right time to change economic policy administration from a restrictive to a neutral or even an expansive policy is a very difficult task. During the radical transformation process, the economy is anything but a homogeneous unit. For this reason, the turning point on the aggregate supply curve--from the horizontal to the vertical part of the curve--is very acute and lies far below the level of full employment. Although in this situation there is considerable pressure to artificially stimulate the economy, we must resist it. In the first two years of our transformation, before and immediately after liberalizing prices, we asserted a restrictive policy with the state budget surpluses, and only then did we turn toward a neutral macroeconomic administration with a balanced state budget. We are sticking to this line today. According to my estimates, not one of the reforming East European countries has yet reached the stage at which liberating fiscal and monetary policy and initiating a Keynesian demand-oriented policy would be warranted. The unavoidable inflationary response following price liberalization must be announced in advance, explained, and defended, and, first and foremost, the political leadership must "survive" it. The initial price increases depend on the inherited level of macroeconomic imbalance; on the whole, it was slight in the CSFR and huge in Poland, Russia, and the other successor states to the USSR. On the other hand, the dynamism of prices later in the reform process is determined by the extent of the restrictions on finance and monetary policy. In the CSFR's case, the rise in prices a month after the start of the reforms was a "mere" 25 percent. In the ensuing three months, the rate of inflation stabilized at 7.0 percent, 4.5 percent, and 2.0 percent, and, during the next 20 months (right up to the introduction of the value-added tax), hovered at just under 1.0 percent per month. In the other reforming countries, there were--and still are--considerable fluctuations in the rate of inflation with repeated phases of a more rapid and then a slower rise in prices, for which the mistakes in macroeconomic policy are responsible. This policy can only hope to succeed if two aspects leading to the vicious circle can be limited: the price-wage and inflation-devaluation spirals. On the basis of our experiences, the two phenomena are closely associated with unforced errors in economic policy. During the phase of macroeconomic restrictions (1990-91), wages in our country were kept below the level of the general increase in prices. During the "neutral policy" phase (1992-93), wages rose rather faster than prices, while no serious problems arose from this; wages did not lose contact with the other pan-economic variable quantities. The same applies for the connections between inflation and the exchange rate. Reforming countries are, as a rule, confronted with a considerable macroeconomic imbalance (the consequence of which is unavoidable rapid price increases), overvalued currencies (with considerable payment deficits and exhausted foreign currency reserves), and high state budget deficits (the consequence of an inadequate restrictive policy). At the same time, reforming countries do not sufficiently devalue their currencies. The result of this is that, given increasing domestic prices, exports decline and imports rise. This leads to a worsening of the balance of payments situation, which necessitates further devaluation and so leads to the import of inflation. This in turn stimulates a rise in domestic prices, which leads to the vicious circle. In our country, the situation is and was different. The original inherited macroeconomic imbalance was slight, economic policy was cautious and oriented restrictively, and the devaluation, as it turned out, was sufficient. The substantial devaluation created enough scope for essential prices and costs' adaptation in the ensuing period. It seems that it is possible to avoid the danger of the vicious economic circle--under the precondition that economic policy pursues a sensible course.
