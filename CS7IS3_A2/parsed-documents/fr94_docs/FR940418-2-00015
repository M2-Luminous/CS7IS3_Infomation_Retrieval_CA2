FR940418-2-00015 FR940418-2-00005 Law 223/91 provides two means of removing surplus workers: early retirement and lay-offs under CIG&hyph;S. 1. Early Retirement Early retirement is regulated in two separate articles of Law 223/91, both of which were used by ILVA workers in the POI. Each article has different eligibility criteria, but essentially the program is available to companies in high-technologies and competitive industries that are undergoing restructuring. Under both articles, the companies pay 30 percent of the early retirement benefits, while the GOI pays the rest. The GOI sets an annual cap on the number of workers that can be retired under this provision. In 1992, 21 percent of the quota was set aside for steel workers. 2. CIG&hyph;S CIG&hyph;S (the extraordinary compensation fund) is also regulated by Law 223/91. CIG&hyph;S provides for lay-offs by companies that (1) are undergoing restructuring, (2) have more than 15 employees, and (3) belong to a wide range of industries. The GOI must approve use of this program, under which laid-off workers receive a certain percentage of their wages for three years. Thereafter, they may receive further compensation under a follow-up program (mobility). The GOI pays 80 percent and the companies 20 percent of the benefits. In a meeting with a U.S. Embassy official at verification, we learned that approximately 25 percent of the Italian workforce is employed in companies eligible for the provisions under Law 223/91. The remaining 75 percent work for companies that do not have to offer their employees any benefits upon separation except the obligatory severance payment that is also paid to workers who take early retirement or are placed on the CIG&hyph;S. Employees in these smaller companies who are laid off receive only government-provided unemployment compensation. ILVA, on the other hand, belongs to that category of companies (larger companies in structural and economic crisis), that have to undertake certain specific steps before actually getting rid of surplus labor. Therefore, the alternatives facing ILVA are early retirement and the permanent lay offs under CIG&hyph;S, provided under Law 223/91. In determining whether worker benefits such as early retirement confer a subsidy on the company, we look to whether the company has been relieved of an obligation it would otherwise incur. (See section 355.44(j) of the Proposed Regulations.) In this instance, we find that, in the absence of the early retirement program, the obligation that would be incurred is that imposed by the alternative available to ILVA, the CIG&hyph;S program. We have found that large companies in a wide variety of industries that are undergoing restructuring can use the CIG&hyph;S program to lay off workers. Therefore, we believe that this program establishes the benchmark for the obligations ILVA would otherwise have towards the workers it retires early. Based on the information we have received, we have not been able to make an exact comparison of the financial obligations ILVA would incur under CIG&hyph;S as opposed to the early retirement scheme. Because the benefits paid to a worker under early retirement can extend from one to more than ten years (whereas CIG&hyph;S payments are limited to three years) and because the percentage paid by the company is based on different amounts (the worker's pension, which varies from worker to worker, for early retirement and the worker's salary for CIG&hyph;S), we are doubtful that exact comparisons can be made. However, we have used the information we have and made certain limited assumptions to calculate the financial obligations on ILVA imposed by early retirement exceed the financial obligations that would be imposed by CIG&hyph;S. (See Memorandum from Team to Barbara R. Stafford dated April 11, 1994 on file in room B&hyph;099 of the main Commerce Building.) Therefore, we find that the early retirement program is not countervailable. B. Law 796/76 Exchange Rate Guarantee Program
