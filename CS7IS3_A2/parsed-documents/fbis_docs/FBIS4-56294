This distribution of food products is aimed at relieving the population of Cite-Soleil, victims of a violent fire on 27 December 1993. Furthermore, on 27 April, a note from the Ministry of Public Health pointed out the importance of a vast program to rebuild the small houses destroyed during the fire, which will require the sum of 35 million gourdes. MSPP [Ministry of Public Health and Population] had since promised the distribution of food to the victims. Many victims of the 27 December 1993 fire in Cite-Soleil demand that the Ministry of Public Health provide them with efficient help. In a news release dated 30 April, the Committee for People Whose Houses Burned in Cite-Soleil protested the meagre portions of rice and cooking oil distributed to the victims. It is also demanding sanitary conditions adequate for survival. Those signing the news release are threatening to demonstrate their dissatisfaction today in Cite Soleil during the food distribution planned by MSPP.
