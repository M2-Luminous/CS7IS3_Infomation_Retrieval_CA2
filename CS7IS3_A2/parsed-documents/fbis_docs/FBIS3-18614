The disadvantages for some groups, for instance in agriculture and in the foodstuffs industry, are far surpassed by the advantages of EU membership for the overall economy, Felderer said. Just the abolition of waiting times at the borders and of customs administration will produce annual savings of 8 to 20 billion schillings for the companies. If one adds the abolition of certificates of origin, the end of the discrimination in the processing trade and the no-longer-necessary import turnover tax, this results in a massive growth of 30 to 60 billion schillings or 2 to 3 percent, the IHS head said. These are only the advantages that can be calculated relatively easily; one also has to take the dynamism of the single market into account. However, it is difficult to put the specific effects into figures. Felderer thinks that a common European currency will "not" be introduced "in this century." The dates set down in the Maastricht Treaty will be negotiated once again because of the difficulties of individual member countries, the IHS chief believes. End of Anonymity Felderer said that the abolition of anonymous savings accounts and securities accounts is already "decided" -- which was, however, rejected by the Finance Ministry yesterday. Because of the "extremely attractive" final taxation within the framework of the tax on capital gains, one no longer needs anonymity; in case of the abolition of anonymity, he does not expect any negative effects on Austria as a financial location and on the savings quota.
