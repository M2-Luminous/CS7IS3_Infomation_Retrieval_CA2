De la Rua, who made the announcement during a brief news conference at the UCR Buenos Aires precinct, said the crisis affecting the UCR causes him "great bitterness." He also harshly criticized the UCR National Board because "it proscribed the Movement for Participation and does not understand that party unity is achieved through differences of opinions." De la Rua explained that he decided to withdraw the Movement for Participation list from the party elections "because of the proscription issued by the UCR National Board." He added that to continue with the campaign for the Constituent Assembly elections scheduled for 10 April "would be a contradiction" because the party faction he heads "never approved the Olivos Pact." De la Rua added: "The UCR National Board resolution is an official party statement and its enforcement is compulsory. It compels us to proscribe ourselves because we have always rejected the basis of the Olivos Pact." He referred to the [Raul] Alfonsin faction as "those who left us out of the referendum issue" and reasserted that "we had more than 30,000 signatures supporting the holding of the referendum." Minutes after making this statement to the press, De la Rua went to the first floor of the building where the UCR Buenos Aires precinct headquarters are located to address about 200 members of the party faction he leads. Escorted by UCR leaders Felipe Figuerero and Roberto Clienti, Fernando De la Rua, leader of the Movement for Participation, asserted that his decision to not include his name on the list of candidates "is based on ethical reasons." He again criticized the resolution that compels party candidates to adhere to the Olivos Pact because "it is a manipulation of the party grass roots" Clearly alluding to the Alfonsin-led faction, he said: "They have locked up the ballot boxes but we will not surrender because the UCR will overcome this crisis." De la Rua's brief speech was followed by his supporters' chants of: "We are proscribed for not signing the pact but we are a majority in the capital." Felipe Figuerero, president of the UCR Buenos Aires precinct, spoke after De la Rua. After explaining that this was "the most painful" day in his party life, Figuerero formally proclaimed the Movement for Commitment headed by Alfonsinist Deputy Jesus Rodriguez as the single UCR list in the capital. The document approved by the majority of the Electoral Board explains that the Movement for Participation list was not included because of "the regrettable situation raised by the official and compulsory enforcement of the UCR National Board resolution." The resolution, signed by the majority of De la Rua's followers, adds that "The Movement for Commitment is the only one that has met all the requirements to be officially proclaimed."
