It is unlikely, however, that the country will be engulfed in a cycle of violence. Only a few weeks ago, Jordan was one of the most stable Arab countries, despite isolated events over the past two or three years. But early in February, Jordan was hit by a cycle of violence that had disturbed some Arab countries. In just one week two explosions rocked two movie theaters: in Amman on 27 January and in al-Zarqa', the second-largest city, on 1 February. Also, unidentified gunmen assassinated 'Umran al-Ma'ayitah, first secretary at the Jordanian embassy, in Beirut. What has given rise to fears in Arab and Jordanian circles is that the security problems have been the result of two factors: first, the emergence of a crisis in Jordanian-Iranian relations, when Amman asked Tehran to withdraw 21 Iranian diplomats from the embassy in Amman. And, second, the official Jordanian announcement that the perpetrators were "Jordanian Afghans" [reference to Jordanians who fought in Afghanistan]. The connection between the security problems and the crisis with Iran and the Arab Afghans gives the situation a political dimension that triggers fears. Although Jordan has not officially announced that there is a crisis with Iran, and Tehran radio has denied any crisis between the two countries, the Jordanian request for the withdrawal of 21 Iranian diplomats could reflect Jordanian indignation, according to political circles in Amman. They say that the Jordanian authorities accuse Iranian diplomats of meeting with Jordanian Muslim extremists. Western sources in Amman say that Jordan is not happy with the presence of Iranian ambassador in Amman Ahmad Dastmalchian, who is a former Iranian Revolution guard and played a significant role in establishing Lebanon's Hizballah. However, this has not yet been confirmed. At any rate, the diplomatic crisis between the two countries is not the only explanation for the outbreak of violence in Jordan. Other circles link these acts to the big strides that Jordan has made on the road to peace. The events occurred a week after King Husayn announced in Washington that he is ready to meet in public with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Other circles, however, believe that the incidents were linked, that is, the crisis with Iran coincided with the Jordanian monarch's announcement. The question is: Are these isolated events transient or are they a prelude to an era of violence in Jordan? This is a particularly important question after the strongly worded statement by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' that Jordan's political options could affect its internal stability. It is difficult to answer this question. However, it is most unlikely that the situation in Jordan will become as serious as in some countries, such as in the Arab east or Arab Maghreb. This is because the acts of violence in Algeria, and in a less critical degree in Egypt, are prompted by difficult economic conditions and unemployment. This, however, is not the case in Jordan because the economic situation there is not that bad. Some people even say that the Jordanian economy has improved over the past two years. This is explained in the retreat of the Islamic movement in the recent legislative elections, when it won only 18 out of 81 seats in the parliament. The movement had 32 seats in the past. Furthermore, the Islamic movement in Jordan is different from that in Algeria or Egypt. It is a movement that has never resorted to violence and has accepted functioning in accordance with the democratic game. The Islamic movement in Jordan has continuously maintained good relations with authorities. Hence, perhaps this cycle of violence is a transient wave linked to specific tactics by certain regional and local forces, unless there are plans to involve Jordan in the acts of violence. It is premature to assess the events in Jordan. It is also difficult to say that the storm is over or that it will assume different shapes. What has happened should alert us, but it does not require us to reconsider our stances. What has happened cannot be more than a slight setback linked to certain tactics that are not aimed at sabotaging the strategic stability of Jordan, which represents an important link in the peace process.
