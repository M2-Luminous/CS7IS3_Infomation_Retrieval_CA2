We are awaiting these responses so that our people can feel safe, assured, and sense some achievement, Qaddumi told MENA. In his statement, which comes only hours before the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli talks on measures to protect Palestinians in Hebron, Qaddumi said an agreement should have been reached immediately after the massacre. He said that when the Israelis came to Tunis they promised to agree immediately to several points. Regrettably, they backed down on their promises, as they usually do, he added. Qaddumi said this Israeli policy will not help the political settlement. Indeed, he added, it will create further obstacles and difficulties. He noted that the Israelis are using the same tactics in their negotiations with the Jordanians, the Syrians, and the Lebanese. Qaddumi defined the Palestinian leadership's basic demands for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, which are scheduled to begin on 13 April. These include deploying sufficient international forces in Hebron and all other occupied Palestinian territories in accordance with Security Council Resolution 904, evacuating the settlers from Hebron, implementing the withdrawal as scheduled, and discussing the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. He said these settlements constitute not only an obstacle, but a threat to the entire political process. Qaddumi said the Israelis are evading the implementation of Security Council Resolution 904 on international protection for the Palestinians. He said talk about differences over the size of the Palestinian police force, the international protection force, and joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols is merely an Israeli attempt to dwarf Palestinian demands. It is as if the differences were over numbers, not principles, he said. He said Israel is still evading acceptance of these conditions, basically on the pretext of numbers, while it really does not want to implement the Security Council resolution. Qaddumi stated: "I challenge Israel to announce that it is ready to discuss the settlements, which represent an obstacle to peace. I challenge Israel to withdraw immediately or to disarm the settlers." All this, Qaddumi maintained, indicates that our differences with Israel are over principles, not over numbers or other similar things, which are raised only to play down the real differences at the negotiations. Qaddumi said the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are moving with extreme difficulty. We have had this in mind from the beginning, he said, noting Egypt's experience in its three years of negotiations with Israel over Taba. Qaddumi said in this regard that during those negotiations, Israel presented maps to Egypt, which had to go to Istanbul--as late Turkish President Turgut Ozal told him--to obtain the right maps. This shows Israel's constant policy of forging facts and procrastinating, Qaddumi said. He said that while Israel has repeatedly claimed it would withdraw from the territories it occupied in 1967, it is actually fabricating further obstacles and excuses to maintain its occupation. Qaddumi stressed that the Palestinian leadership is under pressure and strong criticism from the Palestinian people inside the occupied territories. He also noted frustration among the Palestinian people, which was reflected in the escalation of the intifadah. All this constitutes pressure on the Palestinian leadership, he said. The Palestinian people in the occupied territories, he added, want the negotiations to be broken up until Israel, the Security Council, and the sponsors of the peace conference--the United States and Russia--implement the Security Council resolution. He said the Palestinian people do not want the leadership to go to the negotiations before the world provides the necessary measures for the Palestinians to feel safe and assured. Qaddumi said: Our people have taken the initiative and escalated their intifadah against Israel to tell the world that they reject settlements and want a speedy withdrawal. These are two basic demands by the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. On Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar's implicit criticism that the Palestinians failed to coordinate with the other Arab parties involved in the peace process, Qaddumi said the Palestinians were the ones who sought coordination. He noted that the PLO worked to end its estrangement with Syria after the Gulf war. He explained: We went to Damascus and began to coordinate with Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Egypt. We are extremely eager for Arab coordination, which must continue. Noting that the Syrians consider the signing of the Oslo Agreement a departure from Arab coordination, Qaddumi said that despite the contents of that agreement--which he himself opposed-- one should not keep bringing up these matters because it will only weaken the Arabs' negotiating cards. He said that the Syrian foreign minister stressed during their recent meeting in Damascus that Syria was ready to coordinate with the Palestinians to mobilize international public opinion after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This is a positive Syrian position, he said. Qaddumi stressed that the Palestinian side is in direct contact with the brothers in Syria on coordination. All of us in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and the PLO are stressing the importance of Arab cooperation, without which we will weaken our negotiating cards, he said. He said that the Palestinian leadership has decided to return to this policy as soon as possible. On the importance of coordination before a return to the negotiations, the PLO Political Department chief said that under clear instructions from the Palestinian leadership he held direct talks with the foreign ministers of Syria, Jordan, and other Arab countries. He said he also instructed the Palestinian representative at the United Nations to coordinate with the Arab group and its chairman, Ambassador Nabil al-'Arabi of Egypt. He said the PLO also called for an urgent Arab League meeting, which resulted in resolutions condemning the Hebron massacre and explaining Arab demands. He said Arab coordination over the massacre was evident. At the end of his statement, Qaddumi expressed the belief that the Israelis will not be honest during today's talks in Cairo. By applying international pressure on them and exposing their positions, we must force the Israelis to meet the Palestinian demands, which were recognized by the UN Security Council, he said. He stressed that Israel fears to live in a political isolation that would hurt its society and heighten the internal dispute to the level of a clash, which is already happening.
