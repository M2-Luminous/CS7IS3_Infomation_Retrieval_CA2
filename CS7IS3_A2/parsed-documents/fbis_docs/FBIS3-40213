This is called linear energy translation (LET). We have obtained the LET of Galactic Cosmic-Ray components 1 � Z � 28, Galactic Cosmic-Ray anomaly components (C, N, O, Ne, Ar, Fe), and inner radiation-belt protons. And single-event upset (SEU) ratios produced by these particles are calculated, respectively.
