A statement issued after the meeting of the GCC foreign ministers or their representatives, which was held here today, called on the leaders of Yemen to put the interests of Yemen and its people above all considerations and stop the battles, fighting and practise utmost self-restraint to spare blood and protect lives and property. In the statement, the GCC member-states expressed their strong anxiety and regret "about the dangerous and painful impending breakdown witnessed by the Republic of Yemen as a result of the battles and fighting that broke out between brothers." The foreign ministers of Kuwait, Bahrain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the ambassadors of the State of Qatar and the Sultanate of Oman -- who acted for the foreign ministers who will arrive here later -- met here at midday today. Diplomatic sources said that the meeting tackled the preparations for the 5th meeting of the GCC's foreign ministers and their counterparts in the European Union, which will be held here tomorrow, in addition to the current situation in Yemen. They pointed out that the final statement, which will be issued tomorrow, will include reference to the events that erupted in Yemen last week. The sources added that the meeting dealt with some of the points included in the EU's proposals and will be discussed tomorrow. They said that the Council's foreign ministers had coordinated among themselves to respond to these points so that an agreement, which would contribute to the development of relations between the two sides, could be reached.
