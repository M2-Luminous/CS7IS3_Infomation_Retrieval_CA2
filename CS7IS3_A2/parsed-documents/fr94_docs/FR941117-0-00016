FR941117-0-00016 FR941117-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 30 CFR Part 904 Arkansas Regulatory Program agency: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior. action: Final rule; approval of amendment. summary: OSM is approving a proposed amendment to the Arkansas regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Arkansas program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). Arkansas proposed revisions to the Arkansas statute pertaining to the small operator's assistance program (SOAP). The amendment is intended to revise the Arkansas program to be consistent with SMCRA and incorporate the additional flexibility afforded by SMCRA, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486). effective date: November 17, 1994. for further information contact: James H. Moncrief, Telephone: (918) 581&hyph;6430. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background on the Arkansas Program On November 21, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Arkansas program. General background information on the Arkansas program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval of the Arkansas program can be found in the November 21, 1980, Federal Register (45 FR 77003). Subsequent actions concerning Arkansas' program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 904.12 and 904.15. II. Submission of Proposed Amendment By letter dated March 31, 1993, Arkansas submitted a proposed amendment to its program to SMCRA (administrative record No. AR&hyph;496). The proposed amendment relates to financial assistance to small operators. Arkansas submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative with the intent of making its program consistent with SMCRA, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486). Arkansas proposed to amend the Arkansas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act of 1979 at Arkansas Code Annotated (ACA) 15&hyph;58&hyph;104(11), by redefining the term ``small operator,'' and ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2), by expanding the permitting activities eligible for funding under SOAP. OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the April 22, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 21552; administrative record No. AR&hyph;500) and in the same document opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the substantive adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on May 24, 1993. No substantive comments were received. The public hearing, scheduled for May 17, 1993, was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify. During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to, among other things, SOAP funding for (1) the cost of the preparation of the results of test borings and core samplings at proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(B) and (2) the development of cross section maps and plans at proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(D). In addition, OSM required that Arkansas include, at proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2), the requirement for a coal operator to reimburse the State for SOAP expenses if the operator's coal production exceeds the allowable limit. OSM notified Arkansas of these concerns by letter dated June 23, 1993 (administrative record No. AR&hyph;507). By letter dated July 22, 1993, Arkansas responded to OSM's concerns by submitting revisions to its proposed program amendment (administrative record No. AR&hyph;505). Based upon the revisions to the proposed program amendment submitted by Arkansas, OSM reopened the public comment period in the August 23, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 44477; administrative record No. AR&hyph;511). The public comment period closed on September 7, 1993. During its review of the revised amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to, among other things, the coal operator's liability for reimbursement of the cost of SOAP services at proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2). OSM notified Arkansas of these concerns by letter dated October 19, 1993 (administrative record No. AR&hyph;513). By letter dated August 26, 1994, Arkansas responded by submitting additional revisions to its proposed amendment that replaced in their entirety the previously proposed revisions (administrative record No. AR&hyph;521).
