Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-21JAN94-CHINA Yang Shangkun Voices Support for Deng In an apparent effort to strengthen the hand of reformers as they at tempt to implement the new market reforms adopted at the recent party plenum, the PRC-owned Hong Kong daily Wen Wei Po has portrayed retired party elder Yang Shangkun as supportive of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping during Yang's early January "visit and inspection" to Shenzhen. Drawing attention to the symbolic nature of Yang's trip, the paper pointed out that it was his first visit to Shenzhen since 1992, when he "accompanied Deng" on the southern inspection tour that inspired the current wave of rapid economic growth and ambitious reform (9, 11 January). Judging by the 11 January edition of Wen Wei Po, Yang used the trip to air his strongest endorsement of Deng's reform agenda since retiring last spring. The paper quoted Yang as saying during a tour of a local industrial zone that the "tremendous" changes evident there "proved in every way" that the reform policies "advocated by Deng Xiaoping"-- the "chief architect" of China's reform and opening up--were "entirely correct." By contrast, neither the PRC-owned Hong Kong media nor the official PRC media reported that Yang had mentioned Deng Xiaoping during an 18-day visit to Yang's native province of Sichuan in October, noting only, for example, that Yang had merely applauded the change he saw in Sichuan and had expressed his hope that the province would "leap forward" in reform (Xinhua, 12 October 1993). Since October, PRC media have reported three appearances in Beijing by Yang (Xinhua, 2 November, 22 and 26 December 1993) but have not reported any remarks by the retired party elder. In what may have been an attempt to amplify the political significance of Yang's supportive remarks on Deng, the recent Wen Wei Po reporting portrayed Yang as physically healthy. The 9 January report, for example, described the 87-year-old Yang as "healthy and strong" and able to "walk steadily" and "talk cheerfully and humorously." Similarly, the 11 January article said that Yang had "walked around" in a Shenzhen park for "more than half an hour." Since January 1993, when Xinhua reported that Yang was "hospitalized" (21 January) for an apparent illness, official PRC media, aside from periodic references to the "vigorous strides" taken by Yang while walking in public, have not been known to have commented as explicitly on his health. PRC media are not known to have reported on Yang's visit to Shenzhen. (AUTHOR: VOSS. QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL CHIEF, CHINA ANALYSIS TEAM, (703) 733-6097.) EAG/BIETZ
