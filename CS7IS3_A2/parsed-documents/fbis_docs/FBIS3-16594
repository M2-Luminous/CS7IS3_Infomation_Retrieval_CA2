First, I wish to comment on the military and political factors that have created that viewpoint and paved the way for a better atmosphere in the region. It seems that Armenia's effort to deploy reinforcements at the front lines after losing many men in Azerbaijan's counterattacks during the past two months, the strengthening opposition in that republic against the war, and the decrease in the foreign aid Yerevan has received have undermined Armenia's plans to find a military solution to the dispute. Meanwhile, the intensified activity in Azerbaijan's foreign policy, the relations established between Azerbaijan and several countries that have supported Armenia, and the strengthening possibility that the recent political initiatives in the world on Abkhaziya and Bosnia may be broadened to cover the dispute in the Caucasus can be regarded as one of the reasons that has prompted the chairman of Armenia's parliament to urge his counterpart in Azerbaijan to agree to hold talks. Of course, Russia's anxiety in its foreign policy on what Armenia's situation will be in the battlefields and the Transcaucasus in general if the inclination in the world for an agreement strengthens has had a significant bearing on the meeting of the two officials. What is the difference between the talks held by the chairmen of the two parliaments and the meeting the deputy chairmen of the parliaments of Azerbaijan and Armenia held through Russia's mediation in 1993? The political nature of the talks clarifies that matter. It is true that Azerbaijan's anxiety and conviction that Armenia may resort to deceitful activities is justified. However, the fact that the meeting between the two chairmen has been realized as a result of that republic's initiative has, in one way or another, clarified the question as to which country has lost its potential in maintaining the war. Meanwhile, the talks and the principles and conditions that were agreed on, and which were also discussed during the meeting, have indicated Armenia's new political inclinations in its approach on the war in Karabakh, which was kindled by that republic. If that meeting has been the outcome of a sincere approach in Armenia's diplomacy, an approach that can hardly be expected from that republic, then it can be regarded as an indication that Yerevan may make an effort to contribute toward the solution of the problem. Obviously, holding high-level talks between Azerbaijan and Armenia will be possible if, as the chairmen of the two parliaments have agreed, a strong guarantee is given for the withdrawal of the Armenian Armed Forces from the occupied territories in Azerbaijan. The high-level talks will also facilitate the realization of the other measures that the two chairmen have agreed on. Naturally, the intensive talks with Armenia will expose the claims made by the Armenians in Karabakh, regardless of the effort that has been made to present them as a side to the problem. They will also facilitate the realization of the conditions the chairmen of the two parliaments have agreed on, reactivate the UN resolutions on the dispute, and pave the way for the return of hundreds of thousands of people to their homes. Undoubtedly, one of the important tasks of Azerbaijan's diplomats is to take political and legal measures on the hope-inspiring provisions of the agreement between the two sides, which are still on paper.
