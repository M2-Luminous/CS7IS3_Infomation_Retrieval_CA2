In a telephone call to AFP, the former 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement student leader said he feared for his safety. "Two plain clothes police accompany me wherever I go, walking alongside me and fixing me with menacing looks," he said. Wang Dan, 24, said that four or five other police in plain clothes and uniform are outside his home day and night. "Neighbours have complained about the situation and my mother has gone today (Tuesday) to the local police station to get this persecution stopped. If the police are still there Wednesday at 9:00 p.m. (1300 GMT) I will start a hunger strike," said Wang, who returned to Beijing after spending time in Shandong province, east China, to avoid trouble with police during the fifth anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen massacre.
