FR940314-2-00007 FR940314-2-00004 RIN 0584&hyph;AB62 Food Stamp Program: Maximum Allotments for the 48 States and DC, and Income Eligibility Standards and Deductions for the 48 States and DC, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands AGENCY: Food and Nutrition Service, USDA. ACTION: General Notice. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to update for Fiscal Year 1994: (1) The maximum allotment levels, which are the basis for determining the maximum amount of food stamps which participating households receive, (2) the gross and net income limits for food stamp eligibility which certain households may have, (3) the standard deduction and maximum amounts for the excess shelter expense deduction available to certain households, and (4) the homeless household shelter deduction. These adjustments, required by law, take into account changes in the cost of living and statutory adjustments. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 1, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Judith M. Seymour, Supervisor, Eligibility and Certification Regulations Section, Certification Policy Branch, Program Development Division, Food Stamp Program, Food and Nutrition Service, USDA, Alexandria, Virginia 22302, (703) 305&hyph;2496. Copies of the Regulatory Impact Analysis, which is summarized in this preamble, are also available from Ms. Seymour. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Publication As required by law, State agencies must implement this action on October 1, 1993 based on advance notice of the new amounts. In accordance with regulations published at 47 FR 46485&hyph;46487 (October 19, 1982), annual statutory adjustments to the maximum allotment levels, income eligibility standards, and deductions are issued by General Notices published in the Federal Register and not through rulemaking proceedings. Classification Executive Order 12866 The Food and Nutrition Service is issuing this notice in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and has determined that it is an ``economically significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, it has been determined that this action will increase Food Stamp Program's cost by more than $100 million. It will not result in a major increase in costs or prices except to the Federal Government, nor will it affect competition, productivity, employment, investment or innovation. Executive Order 12372 The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set forth in the final rule related notice to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29116, June 24, 1983), this program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. Regulatory Flexibility Act William E. Ludwig, the Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The action will increase the amount of money spent on food through food stamps. However, this money will be distributed among the nation's food vendors, so the effect on any one vendor will not be significant. Paperwork Reduction Act This action does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Regulatory Impact Analysis
