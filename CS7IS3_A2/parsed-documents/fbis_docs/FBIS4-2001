Guo Zhanyuan, director of the Regional Committee for Agricultural Development, said that since 1982, a massive farmland improvement campaign has increased the area's irrigated farmland by more than 30,000 ha and ordinary farmland by 120,000 ha. Compared with ten years ago, the farmland per person in the area has risen from less than 0.06 ha to 0.12 ha in 1993, and the grain output for each person went up from 92 kg to 275 kg. In the same period, the average income for each farm increased from 126 yuan to 375 yuan a year. With a population of 2.1 million in an area of 39,000 square km, Xihaigu was once one of the poorest areas in China, due to poor farming conditions caused by dry climate, infertile soil and severe water loss and soil erosion. Seeing that improving the farming conditions was critical to the fight against poverty, the local government launched a massive campaign to create more irrigated farmland and to transform broken hillsides into larger pieces of terraced land. The larger and flatter pieces of land are not only easier to cultivate, they also retain more water and reduce erosion of soil and fertilizers, and can therefore increase grain output by one half. Encouraged by the initial success, the farmland improvement campaign is proceeding on a larger scale and with better planning. More and more bulldozers are being used. Guo Zhanyuan said the area plans to create 200,000 ha of new farmland in ten years, so that the area of farmland per person will rise to 0.2 ha. If that goal is achieved, the area's population will be able to get rid of poverty completely, Guo said.
