An official from the provincial foreign economic and trade commission said the province approved some 7,229 foreign-funded firms last year, involving a total contractual foreign investment of about 7 billion U.S. dollars, exceeding the total amount for the previous 14 years. To date, business people from some 61 countries and regions in the world have established about 13,073 joint ventures in Shandong, with a total contractual foreign investment of some 12.45 billion U.S. dollars, the official said. He added that about 72 percent of the foreign-funded firms fall into the area of manufacturing and 28 percent are in such fields as agriculture, aquatic production, the service trade, energy, transportation and high technology. The province has capitalized on its abundant natural resources and superior geographic situation and made painstaking efforts to improve its infrastructure over the past decade. Shandong now has three international airports, more than 50,000 km in highways and seven seaports open to the outside world with a total handling capacity of more than 90 million tons annually.
