This organization received "a microphone for transmitting conversations and a wiretapping device," which were found on 9 June, from Samper's campaign office. "The Prosecutor General's Office is conducting the investigations and technical tests required to establish the criminal action and responsible parties," Ana Lucia Obregon of the Press and Information Office announced. The Colombian "Watergate" gave rise to a serious controversy on Thursday when Horacio Serpa Uribe, one of the members of Samper's presidential campaign, accused "the Pastranistas" (reference to supporters of Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana Arango) of being responsible. The reaction of Pastrana and members of his electoral campaign followed. They accused Serpa Uribe of "slander" and of using the strategy of "lies in view of their fear of the support received by the Conservative Party candidate" throughout the country. "They are inventing many things out of fear," a member of Pastrana's electoral campaign stated. Fernando Botero Zea, chief of Samper's electoral campaign, reiterated that "only the Prosecutor General's Office can determine who the spies are," emphasizing that "we do not have any evidence." According to Botero Zea, the police released a report to Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, "giving a detailed account of how the incident took place." Political circles of the two parties are hoping the results of the investigation by the Prosecutor General's Office will conclude before this coming Sunday's elections when Samper and Pastrana will face one another in the runoff elections for the Colombian Presidency. The National Civil Registry Office, charged with organizing the elections, reported today that it distributed 18 million voting cards throughout the country and that 72 hours before the elections, which will take place between 0800 and 1600 (1300 and 2100 GMT), "everything is perfectly controlled."
