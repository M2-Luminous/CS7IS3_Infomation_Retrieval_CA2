FR940630-2-00167 FR940630-2-00128 (d) Conduct a Needs Assessment to identify the type and nature of the assistance needed by the recipients of the assistance. The needs assessment should identify the nature of the problem to be addressed by the technical assistance services; the plan of action to address the need including the type of technical assistance services to be provided, the duration of the service, the staff assigned to provide the assistance, anticipated products and/or outcomes, and the estimated cost for the provision of services; and the relationship of the proposed services to the planned or expected Consolidated Plan submission to HUD and to other technical assistance providers providing service within the locality. (e) Obtain approval for the technical assistance delivery plan from the HUD Field Office(s) with oversight for the area in which service will be provided. (f) Work cooperatively with other TA providers in their geographic areas to ensure that clients are provided with the full range of TA services needed and available. TA providers are expected to be knowledgeable about the range of services available from other providers, make referrals and arrange visits by other TA providers when appropriate, and carry out TA activities concurrently when it is cost-effective and in the interests of the client to do so. HUD Field Offices may direct TA providers to conduct joint activities. (g) CDBG TA providers will be expected to obtain designation as technical assistance providers by the chief executive officers of each community within which they are working as required by 24 CFR 570.402(c)(2). CHDO TA providers will be responsible for securing a technical assistance designation letter from a PJ stating that a CHDO or prospective CHDO to be assisted by the provider is a recipient or intended recipient of HOME funds and indicating, at its option, subject areas of assistance that are most important to the PJ. (h) When conducting training sessions as part of its TA activities, TA providers will be expected to: (1) Make provision for professional videotaping of the workshops/courses as directed by the GTR and ensure their production in a professional and high-quality manner suitable for viewing by other CPD clients; (2) design the course materials as ``step-in'' packages so that a Field Office or other TA provider may separately give the course on its own; and (3) arrange for joint delivery of the training with Field Office participation when so requested by the Field Office. (i) Report to the HUD Field Office(s) with oversight of the geographic area(s) in which TA services are provided. At a minimum, this reporting shall be on a quarterly basis unless otherwise specified in the approved TA action plan. (j) HUD Field Offices will be active participants in the delivery of all technical assistance by funded providers throughout the term of the cooperative agreement. HUD Field Offices may modify funded providers' responsibilities to adjust to the demand for assistance, or its internal ability to provide effective oversight. HUD Field Offices may also establish technical assistance coordinator roles through a funded TA provider or other entity, or perform this role themselves. (k) Where appropriate or requested by HUD Field Offices, HUD Headquarters staff will serve as active participants in the delivery of technical assistance by funded providers, serving in such roles as Cooperative Agreement Officers, Government Technical Representatives, coordinators, etc., as needed. (6) CHDO Pass-Through Funds. TA providers proposing pass-through grants are required to: (a) Establish written criteria for selection of CHDOs receiving pass-through funds which includes the following: (i) Participating jurisdictions (PJs) must designate them as CHDOs. (ii) Generally, the organizations should not have been in existence more than 3 years. (b) Enter into an agreement with the CHDO that the agreement and pass-through funding may be terminated at the discretion of the Department if no written legally binding agreement to provide assistance for a specific housing project (for acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction or tenant-based rental assistance) has been made by the PJ with the CHDO within 24 months of receiving the pass-through funding. (See 24 CFR 92.300(e).)
