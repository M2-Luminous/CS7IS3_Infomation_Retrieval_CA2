FR940318-2-00194 FR940318-2-00115 POSTAL RATE COMMISSION Postal Rate and Fee Changes, 1994; U.S. Postal Service's Filing of Proposed Postal Rate and Fee Changes; Ruling on Motion for Settlement Conference; and Order Concerning Related Commission Proceedngs Order No. 1007; Docket No. R94&hyph;1 Issued March 15, 1994 Notice is hereby given that on March 8, 1994, the United States Postal Service filed a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on proposed changes in rates of postage and fees for postal services. 1 The Service simultaneously filed a motion seeking Commission authorization of settlement negotiations, which it suggests could proceed on a parallel track with the usual rate case deliberations. In furtherance of a settlement, the Service is distributing a proposed draft Stipulation and Agreement. 1 The Service filed the request pursuant to section 3622 of the Postal Reorganization Act (39 U.S.C. 3622). The Service's request has been assigned Docket No. R94&hyph;1. The request is on file with the Commission's docket section and available for public inspection during regular business hours. The Service's draft Stipulation and Agreement, which will provide a basis for settlement discussions, has been sent to previous rate case participants. Additional copies are available from the Postal Service by contacting Ms. Stephanie Majors at (202) 268&hyph;2988. Justification for Filing The Postal Service asserts that without rate and fee changes, it will incur a substantial revenue deficiency in the proposed test year, 2 in contravention of 39 U.S.C. 3621. Request at 1. In support of this claim, the Service identifies a test-year revenue requirement of approximately $55.2 billion and total revenues of approximately $50.5 billion, producing a revenue deficiency of approximately $4.7 billion. As 39 U.S.C. 3621 requires that total estimated income and appropriations equal as nearly as practicable total estimated costs, the Service proposes rate and fee changes ``as a basis for providing sufficient revenues in the test year to cover the projected revenue deficiency.'' Id. at 1&hyph;2. (Footnote omitted.) The Service claims that adoption of the suggested rates will increase total revenues by approximately $4.1 billion, change the revenue requirement by $0.61 billion, and yield a revenue deficiency of about $0.8 million. Current and proposed rates and fees are contained in Attachment A to the Service's request, which is reproduced as Attachment A to this notice and order. 2 The proposed test year is October 1, 1994 - September 30, 1995. Overview of Proposed Rate Changes. Testimony supporting the Service's request describes this rate filing as ``an across-the-board increase'' of 10.3 percent, which corresponds to a three-cent increase over the current 29-cent First-Class (first-ounce) stamp. Rates, fees and discounts for subclasses of mail and special services are adjusted by 10.3 percent, or the nearest percentage that corresponds with historical rounding constraints, such as a whole-cent increment for the First-Class Mail additional-ounce rate and a tenth of a penny increment for third-class bulk regular rates. USPS&hyph;T&hyph;11 at 6. Significantly, Postal Service testimony acknowledges that in certain cases, an adjustment other than 10.3 percent is required, entailing larger increases for subclasses which have experienced large attributable cost increases, and larger or smaller increases to achieve legislated cost coverages for preferred rate categories. The net result of these considerations is described as an overall average rate increase of 10.0 percent. Id. at 6&hyph;7. Average percentage increases, by major class, subclass or category, are set out in the following table.
