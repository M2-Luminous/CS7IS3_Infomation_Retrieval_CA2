The military unrest was more clearly expressed in the report Lieutenant General Mario Candido Diaz, chief of the Armed Forces Joint Staff, handed yesterday to Defense Minister Oscar Camilion after consulting the heads of the three Armed Forces branches by phone. Diaz reported to Camilion on a legal detail which, according to the military, nullifies the Italian court officials' procedures. Military sources reported to CLARIN: "The situation has created intense uneasiness among military leaders, who are alarmed at the decision to reopen a process they believed to have been definitively closed. We reported this yesterday to the political branch." Lawyers Marcelo Gentili and Giancarlo Maniga arrived in Argentina on 13 February. Judge Antonio Cappiello and attorney Antonio Marini are expected to arrive on 15 February. They will hear testimonies by 30 relatives of the missing Italians, while a trial of those who are allegedly responsible for their disappearance is being prepared in Rome. If the Italian courts find the Argentine officers guilty, an international order for their arrest may be issued. Although such order is not applicable in Argentina, it will be complied with abroad. According to the Convention for Legal Assistance on Penal Matters, which was signed by Argentina and Italy on 9 December 1987 and ratified by Law 23707 on 13 September 1989, the Italian court officials cannot conduct investigation in Argentina, but can act under federal government supervision. In this case, Federal Court Judge Gustavo Adolfo Literas will hear the witnesses' testimony and decide on the extent of participation in the lawsuit. This evidence may be given to the Italian court officials. The Argentine military believe the government should only assist the Italian courts when these are investigating crimes perpetrated in Italy and not those committed in Argentina, where the Law of Expiration, the Due Obedience Law, and the Presidential Pardon Law have been enforced.
