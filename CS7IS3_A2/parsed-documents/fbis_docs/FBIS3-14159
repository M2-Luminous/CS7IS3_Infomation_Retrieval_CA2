So lose not heart, nor fall into despair; for ye must gain mastery if ye are true in faith. If a wound hath touched you, be sure a similar wound hath touched the others, such days of varying fortunes we give to men and men by turns. [Koranic verses] Brothers, family, our struggling masses, and our revolutionaries and mujahidin: I address you to express my appreciation and that of your brothers in the Palestinian leadership for your superb steadfastness and courageous stand, which has shown the great qualities of our people, especially at this time of calamity and hardship. After the ugly massacre committed by the murderous settlers and the occupying army, our entire people stood up to defend their presence, their sacred places, and their dignity, as well as the hope they hold in their hearts as they wait for the moment the ugly Israeli occupation ends and the national authority materializes, leading the way to the establishment of the independent Palestinian state, with its capital our holy Jerusalem. I address you in sincere and clear words; the words of those who kept the trust and, at the same time, put their life at risk, to enable our people to win their future, freedom, dignity, and independence. With all brotherly feelings and frankness, I emphasize to you the importance of standing fast in these critical days. We should turn a blind eye to what some people are trying to do by spreading programmed rumors and a climate of despair. I tell you very frankly that we are facing one of our fiercest battles at a time when our people, under the PLO, are banging, with all their strength, on the doors of independence and freedom. It comes at a time when the world community is looking forward to seeing the realization of the Palestinians' rights amidst all the successive events. It is also one of a series of battles that we have not stopped fighting since the first bullet was fired on 1 January 1965. These battles were crowned by the start of the great national intifadah, which is continuing and growing, and which will continue to escalate until our peoples's objectives are realized; that is, until the occupation is terminated and the independence and freedom of our people, territory, and sacred places are realized. The settlements were one of the obstacles that we faced, and are still facing, in our negotiations with the Israelis. The world community and the international resolutions support us in this regard and consider the settlements an obstacle in the path of peace. Therefore, we were always certain that these settlements would finally be dismantled and the settlers would leave our land. What is founded on myths is basically wrong. Events have confirmed the soundness of our position. The world has also become aware of the seriousness of this matter. Disarming the settlers has now become a basic starting point for dismantling settlements and removing them from our territory. With the cooperation between units from the Israeli Army and the armed settlers, we are facing the same situation that faced our Algerian brothers during the first and second Lausanne Talks. We faced this dilemma in the same way we faced other dilemmas in the past. They only strengthened our beliefs and convictions in the justness of our cause. Therefore, we underlined this position, which is dictated by the national responsibility, and emphasized the need to provide international protection for our people and forced the world community to face its responsibility as regards this dreadful scheme. While we were fighting a diplomatic battle in the Security Council to obtain a UN resolution and discussing among the Palestinian leadership the ways to run that battle, certain professionals in stirring seditions were sowing the seeds of suspicion, passing false judgments, and writing false statements. We did not pay any attention to their falsehoods because we have always avoided being pushed into side battles and we have always believed, and still believe, that the battle is with the occupying enemy. The battle revolves around the basic contradiction with the occupiers, it is not aimed at creating confusion, which is the dream of the enemies of the Palestinian people, the Palestinian homeland, and the Palestinian presence. Do not call each other by offensive nicknames. [Koranic verse] I tell you, brothers, that we have shouldered the trust, and taken the pledge and the vow--the pledge of the pious martyrs and their vow. To honor our responsibility, we must firmly face all tests and trials and their fierceness should increase our firmness, faith, and determination. In moments of trial and challenge we must all stand as one with one aim. We must think of our responsibilities and search for all means of confrontation, including the assistance of public opinion and the bodies of international legitimacy, particularly the UN Security Council and the international and Arab bodies such as the Arab League, the Nonaligned Movement, the Organization of African Unity, the Islamic Conference Organization, and all friends in the world. We fought fierce battles in the Hebron massacre, the Jerusalem and 'Ayn Qarah [Rishon LeZiyyon] massacres, as well as the Sabra and Shatillah and Dayr Yasin massacres, and the difficult confrontations in Janin and Rafah, the Triangle area, Galilee, Nazareth, and the Negev. We have stopped the negotiations with the Israelis and have clearly announced that they will not be resumed before our people have obtained all guarantees to provide international protection for them and before the powder keg of the settlements, which is threatening the peace process, is removed and the perpetrators of the murders have been punished. The battle will not stop at this stage. We have many other details and our agenda contains fateful issues that require just solutions so that just peace can be established. One of the urgent issues is the question of our detained brothers in the prisons of occupation. We will neither sleep nor rest until all of them win their freedom so that they can participate in the battle of building our national authority and independent state. We have resolutely refused all enemy attempts to categorize or classify them and refused the release of the Fatah detainees alone, despite the fact that they form the majority of the detainees. We insisted that all must be treated in the same way because they are the beloved sons of Palestine. At these difficult moments, I appeal to you to stand united to confront this new situation. I ask our people everywhere to close ranks, realize national unity, and keep their hearts united at moments of difficulty and trial. We are a people of martyrs, revolutionaries, and mujahidin. I ask our people to expel all instigators of sedition and divisions from their ranks. Despite this darkness, the light of dawn is coming. The dawn and victory are coming. This ugly repression by the occupation authorities and their settlers remind us of the repression, tyranny, and killing that usually intensifies just before peoples win their independence. One salient example come to mind at this moment -- the movement launched in Algeria by the hardline French settlers and their supporters from the military on the eve of Algerian independence. We must learn these lessons and understand these signs and defeat the Israelis extremists who are trying to hinder our triumphant march toward independence and an independent state whose capital will be holy Jerusalem. That even the apostle and those of faith who were with him cried: When will come the help of God? Ah, verily the help of God is always near. [Koranic verse] Brothers and sisters, our struggling people. The Israeli authorities are continuing the same policy despite agreements signed with them to begin a new phase on the way to establishing a just peace. The Israeli soldiers are continuing their repression, attacks, and crimes, firing at children, women, and the elderly. In this way, Israel has continued to violate the Declaration of Principles. We have the right to seek all legitimate means of response and to look for all prospects that suit us to foil the attempts of circles hostile to peace in the Israeli military establishment and the armed settlers--circles that have had free rein to spread destruction and anarchy in their attempts to stop the wheels of history. We genuinely want peace, but we reject capitulation. We seek a just peace and will not submit or surrender. We will not transform the peace agreement into an agreement of submission. I tell you that the Palestinian blood will not be cheap. This blood ignited the torch of our struggle and jihad--a torch that will not be smothered, with God's help. In honor of this blood, we will adopt all measures and stands required by our people's supreme national interests. We greet all the steadfast people in Hebron and in all parts of our beloved homeland. Greetings from revolutionaries to revolutionaries, the pledge of free men to free men. On the eighth day of this month, the world celebrated international women's day while the Palestinian women stood firmly amid fire, bidding farewell to the martyrs and facing the occupiers' bullets and repression with indignation, sacrifices, and martyrdom. We greet the great Palestinian woman and we pledge to her that in the coming years she will celebrate women's day in a free, independent, and democratic homeland for the people of free and revolutionary men. Sisters and brothers, I renew my pledge and vow to you. I tell you that difficulties will only increase our strength, faith, and firmness. A hammer breaks glass but flattens iron. We have taken speedy steps and offered thousands of martyrs and will not cease our struggle in all forms until our people obtain their full rights. Let this triumphant march continue. The path to the independent state still requires sacrifices, struggle, and suffering. However, our indefatigable stamina and unconquerable determination will continue. God bless our people, the generous people of martyrs and sacrifices. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. God's good pleasure was on the believers when they swore fealty to thee under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts and he sent down tranquility to them; and he rewarded them with a speedy victory. [Koranic verse] Revolution until victory. Your brother, Abu 'Ammar
