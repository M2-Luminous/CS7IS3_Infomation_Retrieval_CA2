"Inspections (of North Korea's nuclear facilities) are becoming increasingly difficult. The situation is at an important stage and is tense," the officials quoted Kakizawa as telling Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan. In a 15-minute meeting with the Chinese visitor, the Japanese foreign minister repeated calls for China's cooperation in solving the problem, adding he wants to hold close consultations with China. Tang told Kakizawa China has been making efforts to seek a breakthrough on the problem and will continue to make its utmost efforts to peacefully solve it through dialogue, adding China's approach to North Korea has limits, the officials said. The resumption of dialogue among North Korea, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United States is important in seeking a breakthrough to the standoff, Tang was saying. He also reiterated China's basic stance that it supports denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and maintenance of peace and stability in the region. China played a "constructive role" in compiling the UN Security Council's presidential statement issued Monday, Tang said. The council statement "strongly" urged Pyongyang to cooperate in pulling spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor so IAEA inspectors could determine if any material has been diverted for nuclear weapons. Tang delivered an invitation from Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen for Kakizawa to visit China. If unable to make the trip, the two foreign ministers may be able to meet at a meeting of foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its dialogue partners in July, or at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Jakarta in November, Tang quoted Qian as saying.
