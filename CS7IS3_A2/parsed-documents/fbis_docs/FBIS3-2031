Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor called the Super 301 a "strong market opening tool" which was to "complement our market opening efforts and to establish trade priorities." As early as November 1991, during the presidential campaign, Clinton pledged to reinstate the trade law, which was called America's ultimate weapon in forcing trade concessions from foreign countries. "It should be clearly understood we are not designating or identifying any practice of any country today, rather, we are putting in place the Super 301 procedure." Kantor stressed to reporters. In 1994 and 1995, Kantor said, the U.S. Trade Representative Office will identify unfair trade practices of the priority countries by September 30, six month after the annual trade estimate report on March 31. Twenty one days after the September 30 identification, priority countries will become the subjects of U.S. investigation on unfair trade practices. The first step, Kantor explained, is the consultation in effort to eliminate barriers to the U.S.. If no agreement is reached, further U.S. investigation will be conducted which might lead to trade sanctions. The Super 301, Kantor said, was a "flexible instrument" and an "early warning." "Our goal is to eliminate all the major trade barriers around the world which block market access for our products and services. No one should doubt our commitment to move forward," he said. The trade representative stressed, meanwhile, that Super 301 was a message to "any country" which practices unfair trade with the U.S.. "Japan is unique among developed nations in maintaining trade barriers, it could have impact on Japan and other countries," Kantor said.
