The experts who presented the forum expressed deep concerns about the current status of Xinjiang's production of fine wool, which has been in continuous decline in recent years. In their introduction, relevant people explained that fine wool is chiefly used for supplying the raw materials in wool spinning. In the last two years, lower wool prices plus part of the wool being kept in storage has dampened the enthusiasm of local cadres and masses of herdsmen for producing fine wool. But on the other hand, mutton prices rose repeatedly in 1993. Because the cost of raising fine wool sheep is a bit higher than for local wool sheep, there appeared a trend of ignoring fine wool sheep production, even to the point of not buying male sheep for stud and rejecting artificial insemination. This caused a backward trend in varietal improvement while resulting in a great number of stud male sheep being in stock. All of the sheep-raising experts making presentations were deeply upset about fine wool sheep suffering such cold treatment. Xinjiang has 40 years of history of improving fine wool sheep varieties, starting in the fifties, and it has reached today's level only after several generations' of hard work. Raising fine wool sheep is an industry of excellence in Xinjiang, and it holds first place nationally, regardless of whether one speaks of quantity or quality; if we lose this dominant position, the dominant position of Xinjiang's husbandry will be lost with it, and the region's wool spinning industry, with over 100,000 spindles will be in the bad situation of lacking raw materials. Research Fellow Yang Erji [2799 1422 3444], formerly Assistant Director of the Autonomous Region's Institute of Animal Husbandry, 1422 3444) believes that mutton production and fine wool sheep production should be given equal attention, with no partiality to either side. We must not lose confidence because of the current temporary slump in the wool market, but must take the long view. The wool spinning industry has developed very rapidly in China, with the nation having to spend $600 million importing 150,000 tons of wool. This demonstrates that it there is not too much, but far from enough. We should take development of fine wool sheep and protection of our national wool production as long term and difficult assignments for China and Xinjiang. Also, when we speak of increasing the quantity of mutton, doing a good job of raising fine wool sheep can be an important way of easing the demand for mutton in Xinjiang. Of course, future development should pursue the goal of improving the quality of fine wool, or else a great deal of foreign wool will come in after we have joined GATT, and Xinjiang's fine wool will probably be defeated. We especially should popularize Chinese Meilinu sheep, setting out a goal higher than the more than one million Meilinu sheep which this established breeding system attained some time ago. Meanwhile, we should take full advantage of our natural grasslands for feed; strengthen feed supplements in winter and spring, taking crude feed as the major feed, cutting down on the use of fine feed to reduce feed costs for fine wool sheep. At the same time, we should grant such favoritism as a husbandry industry insurance system, a variety of tax rates, etc. Adopting these protective measures will reverse the declining situation of fine wool sheep production in Xinjiang in the fastest possible time, and create a wonderful future for fine wook sheep production.
