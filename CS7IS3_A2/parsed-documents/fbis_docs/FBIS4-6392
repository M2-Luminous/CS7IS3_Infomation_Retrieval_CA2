"It's hard to think of what we might do," a government source said. An international financial source said no new steps are likely as the effects of measures taken thus far are likely to be enough. Coming in a report just days before a gathering Sunday of finance leaders from seven major industrial nations, the nudge from the IMF is sure to be a topic at the Washington meeting. The report sees a mere 0.7 percent real economic growth for Japan this year, the weakest of the Group of Seven (G-7) nations and 2.3 percent in 1995. "For the upswing to gain sufficient momentum, continued fiscal support and a further easing of monetary conditions may well be required," it says. Those steps include a record 15 trillion yen stimulus package in March and a series of official discount rate cuts to bring the key lending rate to a record low 1.75 percent a year. Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno denied Tuesday that he is considering cutting the discount rate again and warned about inflation and overheating from "an over-ambitious macroeconomic policy to rectify the internal imbalances." A Finance Ministry official noted that the IMF report says "bilateral trade and current account positions are clearly not an appropriate focus for trade policy" and that trade disputes should be solved "in a manner that is consistent with multilateral principles."
