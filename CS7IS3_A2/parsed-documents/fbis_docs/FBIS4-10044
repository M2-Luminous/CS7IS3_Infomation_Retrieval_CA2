He added: [Begin Robaina recording] Let us work to join the subregional processes toward a Latin American dimension. Let us attain a regional consensus on social, economic, and political issues aimed at Latin America's integration and our fair insertion in terms of economic and international relations. Let us seek to go further by progressively integrating production and service sectors. Scientific and technological cooperation would also be an instrument vital to the integration process.
