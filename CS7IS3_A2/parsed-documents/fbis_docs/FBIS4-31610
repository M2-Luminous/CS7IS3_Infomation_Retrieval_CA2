Five or six rockets from an unknown source fell at midday in the first truce violation at Brcko since the UN-brokered ceasefire came into effect on Friday, Commander Eric Chaperon said. "However, the overall situation remains calm, with a slightly higher level of activity than in the morning," he said in mid-afternoon. [passage omitted] Chaperon said earlier he did not know where the shells had been fired from. Brcko commands a narrow strip of land across northern Bosnia-Herzegovina that forms a crucial supply line for Serbs between their stronghold of Banja Luka in the west and Serbia to the east. The area, known as the Posavina corridor, has seen a build-up by both Bosnian army and separatist Serb forces in the past two months. Chaperon said UN troops recorded 11 detonations at the northeastern town of Srebrenik, a few detonations at Dastansko, in central Bosnia, and 16 mortar rounds at Ribnica, a Bosnian army position in the north of the republic. A UN patrol at Gorazde in eastern Bosnia "came under light arms fire from Bosnian Serb forces," Chaperon added. In the northwestern Moslem pocket of Bihac, the situation was calm Sunday after attacks a day earlier by Bosnian army forces in which they recovered territory captured by secessionists loyal to maverick Moslem leader Fikret Abdic, Chaperon said.
