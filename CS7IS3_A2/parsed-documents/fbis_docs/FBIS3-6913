Police arrested Nguon Non -- also a member of co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh's cabinet -- mid-morning at the MORNING NEWS offices, his son Norin Lakshmi, the newspaper's publication director told AFP. A high-ranking police officer, requesting anonymity, confirmed the arrest, which he said was due to a defamation case. "Mr. Nguon Non was summoned twice before a tribunal and he did not respond," he said. The government would make no comment on the arrest, except to say it was studying the incident. The MORNING NEWS was founded at the beginning of the month, and has a reported circulation of 30,000. According to Norin Lakhsmi, who called the arrest an "abuse of rights," the arrest of his father was linked to recent articles denouncing official corruption in Cambodia. Nguon Non's arrest followed the publication last month of assurances by King Norodom Sihanouk that press rights in Cambodia would be respected.
