The proposal was made in connection with the government's latest decision to uniformly freeze proposed hikes in public service rates until the end of the year in easing the burdens on a recession-hit private sector. Speaking to reporters, Hata said many cabinet ministers agreed earlier in the day on the need for a "thorough and drastic review" of the current rate-fixing system. Hata especially criticized "a pool system" used to calculate highway tolls as a mechanism that always works toward a rate hike. He cited the use of the government's fiscal investment and loan fund as one option in replacing the pool system in which funds collected by drivers finance new highway construction. The government announced Wednesday it will suspend rates for services such as telephones, rents on government-owned houses and public transportation. The plan was approved by Friday's cabinet meeting. On utility charges, Hata said the issue should be separated from charges subject to the latest rate hike freeze. Rates on gas and electricity were cut last November as part of efforts to pass on to consumers the companies' windfall profits from the yen's appreciation against the dollar. The companies said the cuts would be effective until the end of September this year. What to do after September is a matter to be handled by the industries concerned after taking into account various economic factors like crude oil prices and exchange rates, Hata said. On the growing difficulty of female college graduates to find jobs, with many companies refusing to hire women, citing the recession, the trade minister said he will ask the business community to "refrain from hesitating" to recruit such students. The tendency, if covered by the overseas media, would undermine the reputation of Japanese corporations, Hata said. He said he will make the request when he meets leaders of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) next Tuesday. Turning to the ongoing Japan-U.S. informal trade talks in Washington, Hata said he has yet to receive any information about the meeting. The two countries began subcabinet-level talks Thursday in a bid to find common ground for resuming the stalled negotiations on a new bilateral trade framework.
