On September 14, 1993, the CNG's Board of Directors adopted the Non-Employee Directors' Restricted Stock Plan (``Plan''). The purpose of the Plan is to assist CNG in retaining highly qualified persons to serve as non-employee directors by enabling such directors to acquire a proprietary interest in the company, and by providing such directors an incentive to continue to serve CNG. The aggregate number of shares which may be granted as restricted stock (``Restricted Stock'') under the Plan is 15,000 shares of CNG Common Stock, $2.75 par value per share, subject to adjustment in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the participants' rights under the Plan in the event of a stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization or similar event. Such shares may be authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares of CNG. Any Restricted Stock granted under the Plan which is forfeited pursuant to the terms of the Plan is not available for further grants under the Plan.
