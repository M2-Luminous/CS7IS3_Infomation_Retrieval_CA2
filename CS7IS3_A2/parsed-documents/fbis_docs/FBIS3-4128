The four-day meeting is being attended by a Chinese delegation led by Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Gu Yongjiang, and Deputy Minister in Charge of the State Commission for Economy and Trade, Yu Xiaosong. Establishing a world trade organization was one of the important achievements at GATT's Uruguay Round of talks, which concluded last December and in which China participated. Deputy Minister Gu said the meeting of the working party, held after the Uruguay Round, has lent new meaning to China's reentry into GATT, which would make the country one of the founding members of the future trade organization. Under the Uruguay Round agreement, the new organization is to be established by July, 1995. However, many countries are now asking that this date be moved up to next January. Gu said that conditions for Chinese membership in the world trade organization have now matured after 15 years of efforts in the reform towards a market economy, and the standardization of China's foreign trade system in accordance with GATT requirements. Delaying China's return to GATT will mean delays in carrying out China's commitments made in the Uruguay round, and will not help the contracting parties to make use of the opportunities offered by China's economic growth, said Gu. He added that any delay would also take away the confidence that the Chinese business circle has in GATT. In his speech, Gu gave a detailed report on China's reform measures taken since late last year, especially those on the regulation system for foreign exchange. Meanwhile, Yu Xiaosong briefed the representatives in detail on the measures adopted or soon to be adopted by China in reforming its import regulation system, lowering tariffs, and reducing non-tariff obstructions. At the meeting this morning, representatives from countries including the United States, Japan, and the European Union (EU) welcomed China's reform in foreign exchange regulation. The EU representative, praising the reform as "encouraging," said that the EU hoped to conclude the working party on China with a decision to allow it to soon reenter GATT. Japan, Uruguay and the Nordic countries all expressed the same hopes.
