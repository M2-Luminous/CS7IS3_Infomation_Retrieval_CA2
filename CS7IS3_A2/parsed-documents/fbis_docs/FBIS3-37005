According to Kozyrev, the status of observer at the General Assembly would make it possible to strengthen interaction between the CIS and the UN in real terms. Karasin also said that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will be on a visit in Moscow between the 1st and the 5th of April. During his visit he will discuss the ways to strengthen cooperation between Russia and the UN with a view to raising the effectiveness of the UN, and building up its potential in securing peace, stability and international cooperation, Karasin said. Sensations or "historic breakthroughs" can hardly be expected from the official visit to Russia to be paid by the British Prime Minister, John Major, on February 14-16, Karasin said. According to him, Moscow believes that the talks between President Boris Yeltsin and John Major will consolidate Russian- British partnership. Britain is one of the Western powers particularly active and consistent in their efforts to support economic reforms in Russia, promote free-market relations and implement extensive social programs in our country, Karasin noted. Besides Moscow, the British prime minister will visit Nizhny Novgorod, a major center of reviving Russian entrepreneurship, he said. Karasin also said that Russia's Foreign Ministry prepared and submitted to the State Duma a list of international treaties and agreements to be ratified by Russia's Federal Assembly. International agreements and treaties to be given top priority in the process of ratification are singled out in the 105-point list. They include documents regulating Russia's relations with such countries as Austria, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Germany, Greece, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Slovakia, the USA, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Czechia, Estonia, and others. "Some of the documents included in the list concern disarmament issues (chemical arms, START-II), confidence-building measures (open skies), and Russia's joining a number of international conventions and protocols," Karasin said. According to him, the Foreign Ministry has also submitted to the State Duma its proposals on working out over 20 draft bills, including those on international agreements, on diplomatic service, on procedures connected with Russia's participation in peacekeeping activity sponsored by the UN, the CSCE, and the CIS, and others.
