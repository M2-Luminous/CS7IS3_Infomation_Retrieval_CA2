As soon as a compromise is reached, the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry will start negotiations with the U.S. to avert possible U.S. trade sanctions, the sources said. The U.S. has said it will retaliate against Japan if Japan fails to open the cellular phone market to the products of Motorola Inc. Japanese cellular phone company Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) has indicated readiness to make further concessions on Motorola's demand for more purchases of its systems and equipment. Motorola has said it will urge the U.S. Government not to impose sanctions if it reaches a settlement with IDO, according to the sources. IDO in January came up with a plan for installation of more Motorola-type cellular phone stations, but that failed to satisfy the U.S. Under that plan, 134 such stations were to have been established by March 1997. But Motorola asked, among other things, that IDO implement the plan two years earlier. IDO and Motorola are continuing negotiations on the plan, the sources said.
