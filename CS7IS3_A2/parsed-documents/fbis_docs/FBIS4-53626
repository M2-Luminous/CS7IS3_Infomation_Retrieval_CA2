Also, controls within bid-rigging groups are weakening. Unexpected changes at the construction sites of public works are emerging nationwide. For example, companies from different types of businesses or from other prefectures are winning contracts, something inconceivable in the past. Because the change is so sudden, local gpvernments and the construction industry are not able to cope with it. General Contractors as Subcontractors Takao Mikoshiba, managing director of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. [Ishihari], said in bewilderment, "We do not have the experience of using general contractors as subcontractors...." His concern results from the fact that his company has been awarded a lump-sum contract for not only the machinery part but also the civil engineering part of the construction of a basement parking lot in Fukui City which is worth approximately 51 million yen in total. But, the management of engineering works for a machinery manufacturer is impossible. Although there is a need to subcontract general contractors, they are usually Ishihari's large clients from whom it takes up orders for such construction machinery as shield drilling machines and cranes. Until the completion of the construction due in March 1996, the person in charge of the project at Ishihari will not feel relaxed. Many local governments are in trouble because the bribery scandals involving general contractors have widened and too many companies are disqualified from bidding for public works projects. A construction company in Niigata says, "The prefectural government mainly awarded contracts to Takenaka Komuten Co., Ltd., which was not involved in the scandals. However, Takenaka was not able to cope with the task since its know-how was limited." Although Obayashi Corporation was suspended from bidding because its vice president and executives were arrested on suspicion of bribing former mayor of Sendai, it was not excluded from the construction of Sendai's Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) base. Also, Nagano City has unofficially contracted with a joint venture (JV) that includes Kajima Corporation, which was barred from bidding in March, for the construction of the main structure of speed skate rink for the [1998 Nagano] Winter Olympics. Because so many companies were involved in bribery scandals, the Sendai City government had to reselect the contractors for the LNG base construction project twice before it finally contracted with Obayashi and JDC Corporation. Under the pressing conditions in which no more delay was allowed because the time limit for a change from town gas to natural gas was approaching, the Sendai City government had no choice but to ignore the fact that Obayashi had been banned from bidding for public works projects. The case of Nagano City is the same. Plenty of larch is used in building a speed skate rink that has an elaborate wooden structure with a suspended roof. Changing the members of the JV was impossible because the time left for the construction to be completed before the opening of the Nagano Olympics was barely enough. Shigeru Ban, Structure Design manager at Kajima which designed the rink, said in high spirits, "We will build a unique facility that cannot be found anywhere else." "80 Percent of Estimated Price" Under a conditional open competitive bidding system introduced experimentally by the Hiroshima prefectural government, Daioh Corporation (Kochi City, President Kusuo Yasuoka), a Shikoku-based construction firm, won the contracts for the construction of administration building of Hiroshima Prefectural Junior College of Health and Welfare at Mihara, and tunnel construction for a prefectural road in Fukuyama City. The fact that a construction company from a different prefecture at the other side of the Inland Sea won a contract in Hiroshima has attracted attention as well as the fact that its bid price was "80 percent of the prefectural government's estimated price," (according to a medium general contractor). "In the construction industry, the overall profit margin for completed construction projects is approximately 10 percent. When the difference between the estimated price and the bid price is larger than that, there is no profit," Kenji Maeda, chairman of Japan Federation of Construction Contractors, Inc., says. In Hiroshima, the managing director responsible for the Hiroshima branch office of a major general contractor is said to be still active as the coordinator for a bid-rigging group. He has not tolerated a company to place a bid at a low price that deviates from the concerted actions of other bid-riggers. But, it seems that he was not able to control companies outside the prefecture. Things are changing from their roots at the forefront of bidding for public works projects in the local areas. Restricting Entry of Companies At the second floor of a building in front of JR [Japan Railways] Kannai Station in Yokohama is Purchasing Section, Property Custody Division, Planning and Finance Bureau of the Yokohama City government. A paper which reads "Businessmen, No Entry Please" has been posted next to the reception desk since last January. There is also a notice next to it saying, "Consultation is offered at the section next to the reception." Although some construction companies protested, "Are you going not to let us do business?" Terumasa Ikeda, chief of Purchasing Section, refuted, "What kind of business activity is possible by coming inside our office?" As a matter of fact, whether one can go beyond the reception desk and enter the office is a big problem for small and medium construction firms. Almost lacking the ability to determine a bid price by making estimates on their own, they have used former officials of the autonomous bodies and have them talk with the person responsible for a public works project to find out the estimated price of the project, and used the price as a reference up to now. This practice will be no longer possible. "Making an estimate for a project before bidding will cost you about 0.5 percent of the amount of a contract, if you do it seriously," Tetsu Goto, president of Tokyu Construction Co., Ltd., says. Under the open competitive bidding system, a construction company might suffer a total loss after failing to win a number of contracts. There is a possibility that, "a firm that earns about 10 billion yen a year can go bankrupt for the estimation costs after placing 10 unsuccessful bids." Prior to the introduction of open competitive bidding system, Yokohama City held hearings on the new system with the local construction companies, and the firms requested one after another to "reduce the number of projects to be contracted under the open bidding system as much as possible." Many local autonomous bodies have started to consider the introduction of entry restriction similar to that of Yokohama. It is becoming more difficult for construction companies to walk around the lobbies of the government offices and collect information. Also in the United States, gathering information through former government officials is difficult. Because of this, there has been a scandal in which a congressman was used to collect information for a bidding from the section in charge. "In Japan also, local assembly members might be used," says the person in charge at a major general contractor, frowning at the next possible cause of corruption.
