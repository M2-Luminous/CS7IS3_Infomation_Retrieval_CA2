Therefore one of the policy suggestions presented by Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang to the CPC higher leadership in their national condition study report entitled "Root Out Corruption Through Systemic Reform" is "to lower the customs tariff rate and remove non-tariff trade barriers." Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: Although high customs tariffs can serve to protect national industries in their infancy, such a policy will be unfavorable to their efforts to go beyond their infancy. When these industries are monopolized by a few enterprises, these enterprises may give up their efforts to upgrade their technology, improve product quality, and increase their competitive power on the market because they are protected by high customs tariffs. In any case, they will continue to enjoy a profit rate much higher than that enjoyed by other industries. In this regard, mainland China's automobile industry is a very typical case. The net prices of automobiles, either completely manufactured automobiles or those assembled in China, are much higher than the market prices of products in the same categories in the United States and Japan. Therefore, one should lower the tariff rate for imported cars by a wide margin and lift the restrictions on car imports rather than devote much energy to fighting car smuggling. Hu and Kang's analysis shows that mainland China's foreign trade structure, especially the import structure, still retains some very conspicuous characteristics of the planned economy, such as foreign trade monopolies, import license and control, and high customs tariffs. The general managers of some companies dealing in foreign trade put it bluntly: "If enterprises were vested with the power to run import-export trade, what would we rely on for survival?" It is obvious to all that artificially imposed customs tariff barriers, foreign trade monopolies, and high tariff rates are, in substance, the components of a government policy protecting a small number of government-run organizations, monopoly groups, and vested interest groups, as well as some manufacturers. This policy has been hindering the overall opening up of the Chinese economy and is unfavorable to the effort to promote competition at home and abroad. Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang have put forward the following proposals: -- To lower the customs tariff rate and lift non-tariff import restrictions. To rescind the import license system for major commodities, lift administrative control of commodity imports, reduce tariff rates, and simplify the tariff system. To withdraw the authorization for localities to reduce import tariffs or to grant import tariff exemptions. The power to levy tariffs should go to the central government. -- To rescind the foreign trade monopolies, authorize enterprises to handle import-export business directly, and treat state-owned enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises equally. Enterprises' qualification to run import-export business should be examined and approved by the departments concerned. Permits for the import of major commodities can be put on public auction. -- To lift the ban on foreign-funded business establishments running commerce, trade, banking, insurance, communications and transport, postal and telecommunication services, real estate, and tourism, so as to increase the competitive power of the domestic tertiary industry sector. -- To effect a gradual transition to the commodity price framework of the international market, and to link the international and domestic markets. -- To implement a policy to protect China's agriculture and some industries in their infancy, while introducing a more liberal policy to mitigate the monopolies in the automobile industry, the petrochemical industry, and so on.
