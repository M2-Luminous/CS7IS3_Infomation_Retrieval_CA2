At this significant armed forces day parade, I would like to emphasize to the leaders about the [words indistinct] emerged along with the economic endeavor; traditions of the Defense services; our present efforts to build political, economic, and social conditions with the aim of a peaceful and prosperous country; and the efforts to make our Defense Services a skillful one to defend our country. Continuing, he said: Comrades know that the country was under servitude for over 100 years. Our people lost everything politically, economically, and socially under this servitude. National pride was degraded. Forty-nine years ago, on 27 March 1945, our Defense Services, together with the national people, took whatever weapons were available and staged a resistance. They sacrificed their sweat and blood for the return of our people's political, economic and social rights. Armed Forces Day, or resistance day, has been held annually to mark that day for the last 49 years in our country. He added that the Defense Services, while fighting the enslavers to free the nation from servitude and to make the country a sovereign state, was founded with the full support of the national people. The fundamental spirit and attitude that the Defense Services has always upheld since its inception in December 1941 until today are: to defend the country and interests of the people with its life, and to work for the interests of the nation and the people. He said the comrades must note that this spirit and attitude are the fundamental quality and good traditions of the Defense Services. The commander in chief of the Defense Services continued and said: Our country was freed from servitude for over 40 years. For over 40 years, our people have been suffering from the pain of the internal insurgency that emerged with independence. Due to this suffering, our country is not as developed as it should be and it lagged behind and (?became poor). Our country has good landscape and weather, and has an abundance of forests, food, and natural resources. While having the basics to become a rich country, our country is poor because of internal instability and insurgency. Our country can become a modern, prosperous, and developed state if we -- the whole nation -- (?discuss) and build the nation in a peaceful and united way. He then said: Due to historical responsibility, the Defense Services took state power on 18 September 1988. The whole nation knows that our Defense Services dutifully and honestly controlled the country when disturbances and uprisings were going on all over and the country was on the verge of collapse. Besides our original responsibility of defense and security, we have to shoulder the responsibility of restoring peace and stability in the country and to modernize and develop the country. The comrades know that this is why the Defense Services are trying to build the nation and work day and night with good intentions and goodwill for the utmost betterment of the country even as it takes responsibility for the country. The comrades have also seen our country's improved political, economic, and social conditions. Continuing, he said: Our country's situation is one where we are at a crossroad. While the country's old system has stopped, the country's new system has not exactly emerged yet. At present, there are two responsibilities to be carried out for the emergence of a peaceful and modern country. They are: national reconciliation [two preceding words rendered in English] and the emergence of a new constitution. Continuing on national reconciliation, the commander in chief said the fighting among our national people has been going on for over 40 years since our independence. We all are relatives and brethren national people, so the killing and bloodshed should be enough by now. He said: Seek repentance. See the wrong and make it right. For the sake of the country and the people, repay the historical debt. We see that while the country possesses the basics to become rich, it is poor due to disunity, fighting, and killing among one another. During this time -- while we are taking responsibility for the country -- we, with the good intention and goodwill and with the aim of building a modern and developed state together with all the people in a peaceful and united way, have discussed, coordinated, and invited the armed organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold. Due to the invitation, 10 armed organizations in the jungle, which understood our goodwill, have returned to the framework of a peaceful political system. They are working hand in hand with us to implement development programs in the states and we have achieved considerable success. He then added: Some armed organizations are still holding discussions with us. At the same time, some groups do not understand our genuine goodwill and sincere overture. Some groups are conspiring to exploit the situation politically and militarily by saying that we are offering peace because we are facing political crisis and we are weakening. We, however, are still patiently waiting for them to return because these groups still hold on to old political ideas and ignore the development of the country. They are only working for the interests of their own group or party. Continuing, Than Shwe said: Peace overtures were made not because we are facing a political crisis nor are we weakening. You must understand that national reconciliation is indispensable and for this reason we are making the overtures. This is not only the responsibility of the Defense Services, but it is also the historical duty of the national people and it must be carried out today. Another point is the responsibility and effort to draw up the constitution. While there must be national unity for the emergence of a stable and developed country, it is also necessary to have a constitution. The comrades also know that we, on the one hand, have been inviting the armed groups in the jungle to return to the legal fold; on the other hand, we have organized and held the National Convention to successfully draw up a constitution by organizing the delegates from all social strata -- workers, peasants, intelligentsia and technocrats, etcetera -- and parties and organizations in the country. Today, the National Convention has laid down the basic principles to draw up a constitution and it is being held with momentum. He addedd: You must not forget the responsibility with which we, with good intentions and goodwill, must work up to the stage where the country is governed peacefully by the forming the organs in accordance with the constitution that will emerge. Continuing, the commander in chief of the Defense Services said: While carrying out these two political responsibilities, we are also working for the development of economic life -- welfare of the national people etcetera. We are also transforming from the former Central Plan Economy [three preceding words in English] -- Socialist Economic System -- to the present Market Economy [two preceding words in English]. The freedom to do business and trade is also granted. Our national people are allowed to do business and trade and live freely depending on their caliber and skill. The right to freely control a legal business and one which does not affect the major interests of the country are also granted. These are implemented to facilitate the economic transformation which will be suitable to the new country to emerge in the future. While we are carrying out the political transformation on one side, we also are carrying out the suitable economic transformation on the other side. For the transformation of economy, we are working on private sectors and also creating an atmosphere for the public sectors to boost the country's economy. Due to today's position, our country has to base its economy on agriculture. We have to develop our country Targeted and based on agriculture. That is why, to [words indistinct] the comrades are participating in irrigation works to develop our nation's economy, which will be based on agriculture. Our country has to base its economy on agriculture and gradually develop other areas. While the country is not in a position to become an industrialized nation overnight or to become a rich nation, the country must base its economy on agriculture, which is favorable to our country and will gradually transform it into a modern and developed nation. He also said that comrades have to participate energetically and enthusiastically in agriculture, which is the basis for our country's economy, and in other nation building programs. He added: Comrades, after building good political and economic foundations, the country will have good foundations for establishing a peaceful, modern, and developed state of the future. The comrades should understand that we, with genuine goodwill, are working day and night on political and economic matters during this transitional period to avoid getting into trouble due to frequent political and economic instability and to allow a new government -- whoever it may be -- to govern peacefully, prosperously, and with stability. The commander in chief of the Defense Services said: The comrades know that we all are trying to build our country into a modern and developed state. To defend our country and to perpetuate national sovereignty until the end of time, there is a need for a strong and skillful Defense Services. It is an inevitable responsibility to build a strong and skillful Defense Services to secure and defend our country. He said: As physical materials are indispensable for the Defense Services to be strong, the spirit of the comrades is also very important. He then said spirit and discipline are the lifelines of the Defense Services. The comrades must have a spirit of not giving up easily and a spirit to discharge duty with responsibility. The three national causes -- nondisintegration of the union, nondisintegration of national solidarity, and perpetuation of national sovereignty -- are the belief and pledge of our Defense Services. Our Defense Services have to [word indistinct] these national causes. The Defense Services have to be build upon the training, leadership, welfare, and spirit to become strong and skillful. Only then, will the units and comrades have the five essential qualities -- spirit, discipline, loyalty, unity, and efficiency. He told the comrades not to forget that they can defend the country only when they have these qualities. In conclusion, he solemnly urged the comrades to observe the good traditions of the Defense Services; to carry out dutifully the national political responsibility, which is being shouldered by the Defense Services; to participate in the all-around development of the nation's economy; to strive for a strong and skillful Defense Services to protect and defend our country in accordance with the motto -- the nation will have strength only when the Defense Services have strength; and to observe the code of conduct of soldiers.
