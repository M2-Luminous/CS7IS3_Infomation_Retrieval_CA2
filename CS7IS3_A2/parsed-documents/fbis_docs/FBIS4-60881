As always happens with such demonstrators, there was no lack of anti-president and anti-government slogans. All the speakers finished their appearances with hurrahs for international workers' solidarity day. However, in contrast to previous years, there were no representatives of the international proletariat at the meeting. The Moscow Federation of Labour Unions collected about ten thousand demonstrators for its march from Triumfalnaya (Triumph) Square to the Manezh just across from the Kremlin, which started at nine a.m. this morning. By the time the procession reached the meeting place, it had lost half its participants. Dominant were representatives from almost all the trade unions, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and guests from many Russian regions. The meeting was over at 10:30, by which time the square had practically emptied.
