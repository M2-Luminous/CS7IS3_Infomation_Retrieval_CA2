De Leon demanded that the National Transportation Coordination Board (CNT) lift the strike, warning them that otherwise he would have to open up the fuel transportation business in order to eliminate the monopoly. At a news conference at the Presidency, De Leon said that the government's final position is to grant a 10 percent adjustment to current tariffs and 0.5 centavo of a quetzal per gallon of fuel transported as insurance. The CNT has not replied to the president's offer, who said that transportation businessmen must "accept today" the decision of the Economic Cabinet. "I urge businessmen to end the strike immediately; otherwise, we will take" drastic "action," de Leon stressed. De Leon said that the strike called by the transportation businessmen is illegal, as they abandoned a dialogue with a high-level government commission. He added that the Attorney General's Office has been instructed to initiate legal action against the businessmen because they are disrupting public order by creating a fuel shortage. "The government will not tolerate illegalities from the businessmen, as they have already caused too much harm in addition to encouraging a strong feeling of uncertainty among the people," the president warned.
