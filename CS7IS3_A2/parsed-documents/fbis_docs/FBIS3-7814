With these views, you often fall out even with [Defense] Minister Baudys, whom you certainly do not suspect of an affiliation with these people.... [Fejfar] This is a two-tier question. It is true that, on the one hand, I am known as a sharp critic of the situation in the Army; on the other hand, my colleagues tell me that I am father of the soldiers. On the one hand, I claim that we need a smaller, strong Army, with which we would be acceptable to NATO, and, on the other, I must say that almost nothing has changed in the Army over the past three years, and therefore it must be cleansed. Nonetheless, I am not so naive to imagine that such a cleansing can be done from one day to the next. It is a process, and, when I speak of cleansing, I certainly do not mean the former communists. They represented 90 percent of the Army. [Adamickova] So, whom do you have in mind? [Fejfar] If I am interested in anyone at all, they are two categories: There are the former members of military counterespionage, several hundred of whom have remained in the Army, which certainly is not right, and the other category is the political instructors, albeit not all of them, but, above all, the chief indoctrinators, the entire apparatus of the Main Political Administration. After all, these people are still hiding in the Army, where, I believe, they have no place. They are very experienced and able and have their own information channels, and that is extremely dangerous. [Adamickova] It seems, however, that Minister Baudys does not share your concern when he says that, under his charge, the process in the Army started to move and that a lot has changed in the command ranks.... [Fejfar] That is a very optimistic view. Of course, it happened partially, and there is a certain success in the extraordinary assessment of the professional soldiers. Nevertheless, some damage caused by this assessment, which unnecessarily disgusted normal soldiers, is greater than the resulting effect. I believe that it could have been done otherwise, but it is done. [Adamickova] How otherwise? [Fejfar] For example, the Army could have parted with these people in some way other than by screening. On the other hand, I must concede, in defense of the minister, that it is easy to talk when we do not bear any responsibility. We are only deputies and do not have any powers in this respect. [Adamickova] You have repeatedly voiced a suspicion publicly that KGB agents operate within the Czech Army.... [Fejfar] There are some facts, to which I have access, but of which I cannot speak. It is a combination of factual knowledge combined with a certain suspicion. [Adamickova] It has not been long since Minister Ruml reached an agreement with Russian Intelligence Chief Primakov that the intelligence services would not work against each other. After all, a similar "gentlemen's agreement" was signed once by [then] Minister Langos. However, real life demonstrates that, in this sphere, it rather is just wishful thinking. What do you think? [Fejfar] It would be naive to believe that foreign intelligence services, including the Russian one, do not operate here. The question is whether they work against us or only monitor the situation, whether their interest has shifted to the economic sphere. I believe that Russian intelligence understands that today we are not its sphere of influence, that it is not likely that 1968 will be repeated. Thus, its orientation certainly must be changing. In my opinion, certain cooperation links must exist, particularly in matters of organized crime. I would not object there. The more the intelligence services contact one another, the better relations will be. In summary: The intelligence services certainly operate here, but the question is whether their activities can be confined within certain limits. [Adamickova] How would you assess, as a person involved primarily in the issues of defense and security policy, the work of the Interior Ministry? [Fejfar] I believe that it is far from being as tragic as it seem at first sight. Frankly, to put in order such a pigsty as the Interior Ministry was, is a tremendously complex task. True, an occasional error turns up, but I am convinced that, in this situation, it is very understandable. Just remember the state of Minister Hradilek as he was leaving the Interior Ministry: He was a person on the verge of collapse. Minister Sokol approached it somewhat differently, with a smile and almost with a tennis racquet in his hand. He trivialized some problems and is very clever today and ready to advise what the present interior minister is to do. Minister Ruml, as I know him, is a truly honest person, and he wants to move things forward. I believe that the reason for the occasional scandal is the inexperience of some people at the Interior Ministry. If I am certain of anything, it is that the Ministry should have its peace. I do not mean either that no one is to control it or that the papers are not to write about a wrongdoing if it occurs. However, constant attacks against its leadership will not help the issue. [Adamickova] The Interior Ministry is becoming the target of criticism, not only because of the scandals, but especially because of the security situation, the solution to which people consider the most pressing problem.... [Fejfar] I believe that sometimes it is overdone. The hysteria present in society, the feeling that every citizen is in danger, is completely unnecessary. If you ask someone whether anything happened to him, he usually answers: Just read the horrors in the papers. Therefore, I believe that a little calming down would not harm. [Adamickova] Of course, only a greater feeling of security would help to calm things down.... [Fejfar] Certainly. The situation is being dealt with, as we speak. We are stricter even in the legislation. The pseudohumanistic period, when the inmates, for instance, lived better than other people, is long past. You are well aware of the much stricter regulations in several criminal laws. [Adamickova] How do you feel about the expressed opinions that the Interior Ministry is controlled by a group of friends that has nothing professional about it? [Fejfar] That is difficult. The same arguments can be applied to our intelligence service. General Lorenc would certainly make a very good chief of counterintelligence because what I know about him indicates that he was a perfect professional. A changeover took place here, however, new people started, and they are learning the job. If you get in such a situation, you have two possibilities--either you leave the old tested professionals at the Ministry, which is certainly not possible, or you depend on friends, whom you trust. If there are various scandals at the Interior Ministry, then, I believe it is because the new clashes there with the old. It is the same problem as in the Army, where, however, no problems are mentioned. [Adamickova] Do you know of some? [Fejfar] No, I do not, but I sense that they will begin as soon as a radical change takes place there. [Adamickova] At the beginning of February, you took part in a meeting in Rome between your committee and its Italian Parliament counterpart. Have you considered the possibility of using some of their experience in our legal code? [Fejfar] From my point of view, the most interesting part was the talks with the Defense Commission and the methods they use to monitor or are planning to monitor the Army budget. The computer networks of the Defense Ministry and the parliament are connected via satellites, and the monitoring is regular and topical. This should be our effort and objective. In addition, we brought back a lot of material that we will gradually utilize.
