Mieno told the House of Representatives Budget Committee more time is still needed to judge if bright spots in the economy will overtake the bad ones and spread to a general recovery. He said more "conditions for recovery" are falling into place now than a year ago, when hopes for a turnaround were dashed by the surging yen, bad weather and political turmoil. Mieno cited such improving conditions as companies' progress in stock adjustments, the effects of government fiscal and monetary stimulus measures and increasing robustness in the world economy, especially the United States. But he expressed continued concern over the effects of trade friction, the high yen and balance-sheet adjustments, such as the mountain of bad loans that financial institutions are trying to clear off their books. He repeated that each country's monetary policy must be based on a "comprehensive judgment" of the economy and not such single factors as exchange or real interest rates. As the U.S. has raised rates and Germany cut them, Japan's central bank has led money market interest rates to repeated record lows through generous market funding. Many market players infer the moves are coordinated and designed to curb the yen and prop up the dollar.
