Governors Carlos Reutemann and Mario Moine signed a document outlining the guidelines for the assembly which will modify the Constitution. The ceremony for signing of the document -- initially scheduled for yesterday, but postponed because it was impossible for Reutemann and Moine to travel to this city -- was held at the provincial Government House. The ceremony was also attended by La Rioja Governor Bernabe Arnaudo and Acting Senate President Eduardo Menem. Also present were Parana Mayor Julio Solanas, Santa Fe Mayor Jorge Obeid, and Domingo Carlos Trulla, the chairman of the Supreme Court of La Rioja. The text signed by Reutemann and Moine has eight points, the first of which states that the agreement seeks to "formulate a proposal for the distribution of the functions of the Constituent Assembly between the two cities." The agreement states that Parana will handle the inauguration of the Assembly, the special sessions, and the closing session -- for which the Entre Rios provincial Government will provide the Tres de Febrero Municipal Theater. Meanwhile, Santa Fe will host the Constituent Assembly plenary sessions and the board of Assembly authorities and secreariats, for which the Reutemann's Santa Fe administration will provide "the esplanade of the Litoral University and the facilities which may be needed for authorities, secretariats, and assistants." The document also establishes that advisory committees will be housed "in places established by the Constituent Assembly, seeking an equitable distribution between the cities of Santa Fe and Parana." The new Constitution will be approved and sworn-in at San Jose Palace, in Concepcion del Uruguay, as previously announced. Arnaudo said that because the agreement was signed in this capital "it will be recorded in La Rioja's history," adding that "the province is once again the stage for major national events." "We are committed to this process of change, promoting a national consensus for recreating the Constitution to match the new model of Argentina," Arnaudo said, emphasizing the importance of "introducing needed changes at this time of economic and social transformation." Moine highlighted the significance of the agreement "at this historic moment." He said: "Never before have the majority parties -- which represent the will of 80 or 85 percent of Argentines -- reached a consensus for this reform that is so necessary." Moine emphasized that the reform "does not relate to the present, but with the future," adding that reforming the Constitution is a "contribution to the common good." He promised to "do his best to fulfill the objectives outlined in this document." Reutemann thanked Senator Eduardo Menem "for everything he did toward a successful outcome," noting that "when Sante Fe and Entre Rios were chosen to house the event, everyone began to speculate about the difficulties that would arise between the governors." Finally, Senator Menem -- the first cadidate for Constituent Assembly member for the Justicialist Party of La Rioja -- said: "Many times, those who play a role do not realize they are making history," adding that "many events in Argentina and in the world were achieved by men who were unaware they were making history." "We know that, with the constitutional reform, we are rewriting history, a history that stems from the past and projects itself into the future," Menem said, noting that the election of Santa Fe and Parana as the seats of the Constituent Assembly "acknowledges their major role in organizing the country."
