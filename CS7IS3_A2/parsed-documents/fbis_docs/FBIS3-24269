Almost all the highest-ranking officials of the former MB [Ministry of Security] have undergone recertification. One of the key departments in the new service's structure is the counterintelligence operations directorate. The official appointed as this directorate's chief is Lieutenant General Viktor Mikhaylovich Zorin, who held an analogous position in the MB. We asked Viktor Mikhaylovich to comment on the current changes in the security organs. [Zorin] Speaking of reforming the special services in general, our foreign colleagues, including the Americans, are continuously in a process of reform, albeit perhaps not as cardinal as ours. The process of reform is underway in the intelligence directorate of the U.S. Department of Defense; a number of CIA services are being reoriented. As to our reform, it is a logical extension of what began in 1991. Or, if we dismiss all ideological coatings, we can probably even speak of 1989, when the Fifth (ideological) Department of the USSR KGB was disbanded. The current reform is aimed at transforming us into a special service. This means first and foremost removing from the FSK system punitive, repressive functions. We no longer have an investigative department. Inquiry remains--this is a necessary procedure. Neither do we have places of incarceration anymore--the investigative detention facility in Lefortovo has been transferred to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. [Question] As applied to your directorate--how was the old structure different from the one being formed now? [Zorin] The name of our directorate has changed--it is now closer to what we actually do. Instead of a counterintelligence directorate it became the counterintelligence operations directorate. Because our main function is working against foreign special services on the territory of Russia and their stations, the conduct of operations to frustrate intelligence actions. For instance, the directorate of counterintelligence support for strategic objects is to a great extent "object-based counterintelligence," whose main function is protection of the latter. In line with the changes in main tasks, corresponding structural changes took place. A number of departments and lines have been reduced; some have been strengthened. [Question] American reforms probably also are associated with our new conditions in Russia? [Zorin] We have information that Russia remains a priority target for American special services. They demonstrate that they have reduced their activities on the territory of Russia and are not conducting agent operations--sort of keeping their gentlemen's promise. But this does not at all mean that their work has been curtailed. Nontraditional methods and sources are being widely used, in the form of various kind of firms, commissions, foundations, including informational. If you read the questionnaires that are being published you can see that with skillful processing you can get excellent intelligence information that sometimes cannot be obtained through agents. Western special services use the territories of contiguous states, including former Soviet republics and socialist countries. Cooperation with the special services of the latter has helped us lately to keep an eye on foreign intelligence services. And they are today, to use military language, a beachhead. The direct contacts we have with representatives of foreign intelligence services permit us to remove some issues in a civilized manner. Although in this respect we also have problems. For instance, a foreign state officially declares a representative of its intelligence service on the territory of Russia. Protecting him to an even greater extent by refusing similar status for our representative. [Question] You no longer have an investigations department. Have you not lost the main tool of your work? [Zorin] Our main work is operations. Investigation is the concluding part of our efforts; now the procuracy will do this. [Question] Who is now directly involved in exposing spies? [Zorin] Operations services. They are also, as a rule, the ones who detain them. With the procurator's sanction, of course. And then we help him, if the investigation requires it. [Question] How did your certification go? [Zorin] There was a goodwill atmosphere in the commission. The questions covered a person's professional qualities, his work experience, and a certain part of political views. I think, though, that for counterintelligence the latter did not play a major role. Especially keeping in mind that this was less relevant for our directorate's staff: We were not involved in political surveillance. [Question] Did the interview resemble an exam? [Zorin] To a certain extent, yes. I was told to come at a certain time, so I came. The personnel department chief came out and invited me in. I entered and saw that in the center was Oleg Lobov. We exchanged greetings; I was offered a seat: How are you doing? How is work? What problems are there in the directorate? Sergey Adamovich Kovalev (the president's adviser on human rights--D.Kh.) asked: "I see you have worked in many places, have you not?" I said: "Sergey Adamovich, I understand your question. You want to know whether I have worked in the fifth line? No, I have not. I began in Checheno-Ingushetia; then Orel Oblast, graduate study, the former Committee. Always in counterintelligence, including at secret plants. But sometimes I happened to run into political issues." Then Vladimir Arsenyevich Rubanov (Lobov's deputy--D.Kh.) asked about the problem of diplomatic security, whether there is a law. One of our directorate's functions is to ensure the security of our citizens abroad. I say: "There is no law, but we have submitted a proposal on how to solve this problem." All in all, the conversation lasted about half an hour. [Question] Was the decision made on the spot? [Zorin] No, the decision was announced later and affirmed by presidential edict. [Question] Now you have to conduct recertification of your directorate's staff. How are you going to go about it? [Zorin] We have organized a commission and included in it the most authoritative people, mainly top officials, as well as personnel department staff. The commission will work according to a statute that has been drafted in keeping with the president's edict. The subjects of evaluation will be professional qualities, work results, and moral qualities. [Question] So you will be evaluating "how many spies a person has caught"? [Zorin] Not just that. In counterintelligence, arresting a spy is far from the only, and not always the best, result. We know from history that on the threshold of the war with Germany the British did not arrest a single German agent. When the war started, they took them all at the same time, leaving only one or two. And German intelligence basically did not score any serious successes in England during the entire war. [Question] Is the possibility of getting rid of undesirable staff members during certification ruled out? [Zorin] There is a law on military service. It regulates the procedures for discharge from service. All actions of the commission fall clearly within the boundaries of the law. Otherwise these days you will face endless litigation. [Question] Can a discharged person turn to the court? [Zorin] This is his right as a citizen. [Question] Do you believe that in the future, decades from now, the functions of counterintelligence will die out? [Zorin] Way back in the institute we all memorized that this could possibly happen when the function of the state dies out. Then probably there will be no counterintelligence. Historically, as soon as a conflict situation arises, there is immediately a need for countering intelligence. Counterintelligence existed under Ivan the Terrible, and Peter the Great--the famous Romodanovskiy. In principle, the system of questioning at the border, travel documents, already had a counterintelligence function. In tsarist Russia, by the way, counterintelligence was quite sophisticated. And the Germans' failures in the beginning of the first world war, especially at sea, to a certain extent could be traced to the fact that Russian counterintelligence outplayed them. I believe that today counterintelligence emerges and is present wherever there is threat to Russia's security, wherever intelligence activities are conducted. The same correspondent may ask openly: "How many ballistic missiles do you have in such and such oblast?" We probably should not condemn him for this.
