Postponement On September 20, 1994, three of the four respondents in the antidumping duty investigation of fresh cut roses from Ecuador requested that the Department postpone the final determination in that investigation 127 days, in accordance with section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 1673d(a)(2)(A)), in order to ensure that the Department has adequate time to conduct verification and to consider fully all the issues in the case. In addition, on September 27, 1994, Asocolflores, the Colombian Flower Growers Association, as well as fourteen of the sixteen Colombian respondents in the antidumping duty investigation of fresh cut roses from Colombia, requested that the Department postpone the final determination in the Colombian investigation 128 days in order to ensure that the Department has adequate time to conduct verification and to consider fully all the issues in the cases, in accordance with section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act. On September 27, 1994, the fourth Ecuadorian respondent requested that the Department align the final determination dates in the Colombian and Ecuadorian cases. Finally, on September 28, 1994, the other Ecuadorian respondents requested that the Department also align the final determination dates by postponing the final determination 128 days. We find no compelling reasons to deny these requests and are, accordingly, postponing the dates of the final determinations for both cases until not later than January 26, 1995, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b)(1). This notice is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673d(d)) and 19 CFR 353.20(b)(2). Dated: September 28, 1994. Susan G.
