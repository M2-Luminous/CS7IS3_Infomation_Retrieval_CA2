The political party groups jointly drafted a statement drawing the attention of world public opinion. The statement, which was read out by Mustafa Kalemli during today's session, is as follows: The declaration of 19 May, which marks the beginning of the Turkish liberation struggle, as the anniversary of the so-called Pontus massacre by the Greek parliament reflects an extremely dangerous and warped mentality. We regret and condemn this meaningless and baseless decision of the Greek parliament. The Greek parliament appears to have forgotten that 75 years ago Greece attacked Anatolia with the aim of eradicating the Turkish nation. We would like to remind world public opinion of the tyranny and barbarism applied by occupying Greece against innocent people in Anatolia between 1919 and 1920. The actions undertaken by Greece in Anatolia in violation of the law on wars have been documented by the Lausanne Treaty, which is a multilateral international document. Given this situation, it is evident that the fact that the Greek parliament is turning hostile attitudes against Turkey into a state policy by distorting historical facts will merely undermine bilateral relations and regional peace. We ask the Greek parliament to display intelligence and common sense.
