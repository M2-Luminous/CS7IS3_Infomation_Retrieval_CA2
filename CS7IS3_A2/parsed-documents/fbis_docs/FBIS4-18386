For the European Union (EU) has once again been saved, thanks to a compromise which, though the product of a Greek brain, deserves, more than anything else, to be classified as Belgian. After all, a compromise on the voting procedure following the EU enlargement was finally reached with the awkward British and Spanish. The fact that this settlement places European decisionmaking and integration on unsteady footing is evidently a worry to the members of our government. Normally speaking, the blocking minority in the European Council of Ministers, after the accession of four new member states, should increase proportionately from 23 to 27 votes. However, the United Kingdom and Spain managed to negotiate an understanding that if member states together accounting for between 23 and 26 votes oppose a decision, then that decision will be subjected to a "reasonable" delay. In other words, the British Government wants to be in a position to block any further step toward European integration, while the Spanish Government is seeking to protect its financial interests. The British Government, in particular, succeeded in making British obstinacy a "European problem." After all, the question as to how Europe intended to resolve the British problem was asked openly. In that context, it once again emerged that the British attitude was connected not only with the intention of maintaining its present position of power, but also with the uncertain position of John Major as party leader and head of his government. Instead of putting the British under fire, telling them that they should jolly well solve their own problems, and that they certainly had no right to change the rules governing European decisionmaking with the help of the Spanish, the other member states were brought to their knees by the threat of British and Spanish intransigence. The excuse made by those 10 member states was that, if no concession had been made, then the accession of the candidate member states on 1 January 1995 would have been put at risk, as if the postponement of accession was a more daunting prospect than weakening the EU itself by undermining the decisionmaking process. The Ten maintain that the blocking minority in fact was set at 27 votes, and that a minority of between 23 and 26 votes can only delay any particular decision for a "reasonable" period of time. To begin with, the concept of "reasonable period of time" is extremely open to interpretation. Furthermore, the possibility of such a delay contains all the germs of fresh crises and stalemates. While any member state and the European Commission can call for a vote at any moment, will this really happen if a number of countries steadfastly refuse to allow it? The EU is reaping what it has sown. The irresponsible refusal to address this issue before the talks on accession began has meant that the so painfully secured rule of voting by a qualified majority is now at risk once more. Even if no use is ever made of the famous compromise in practice, it is still irresponsible to lay such a time bomb underneath the Union's decisionmaking process. And the fact that the compromise will only apply until the upcoming Intergovernmental Conference scheduled for 1996 is pure nonsense. What British or Spanish Government will then relinquish the rights it has only just acquired? There is one thing that the governments of the Twelve can certainly not deny: Nothing has come of their solemn promise to see the EU enlargement be accompanied by its deepening. On the contrary.
