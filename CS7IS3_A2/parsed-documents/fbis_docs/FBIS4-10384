High-ranking judicial branch authorities, who asked not to be identified, made this comment in recalling that the extradition of Asunta Roca Suarez to the United States generated a negative reaction from the Bolivian public. After this case the Supreme Court announced that it would not extradite any more Bolivian citizens to the United States unless a treaty in this regard was signed by the two countries. One of the sources said: "The United States would have to exert a lot of pressure to obtain Rico Toro's extradition, because the Supreme Court was quite clear on the issue." All the U.S. requests for extradition refer to cases of drug trafficking and, in that sense, the sources stated that the 21 April 1900 treaty signed by the two countries does not mention that type of crime. Drug trafficking was a crime not known at that time, and this is the argument of the Bolivian Court to reject the U.S. requests for extradition. Although the extradition of Asunta Roca was based on the 1900 treaty, and was approved with the Vienna Convention signed in 1988 (a multilateral accord which includes drug trafficking as a crime for which a delinquent may be extradited), the sources explained that that document is contradictory.
