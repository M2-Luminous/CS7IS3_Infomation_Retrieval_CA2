Reacting today to the latest accusations by Renamo's Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo, Nihia told journalists that he has never been involved in any plan to give military training to 1,000 men and 350 riot policemen in a training camp on the outskirts of the city of Nampula. The supreme Frelimo leader in Nampula Province asked how it would be possible to secretly train 350 men in a big and densely populated city like Nampula. Gen. Nihia explained to journalists that the so-called Poligono-2, where troops and a riot police force are allegedly being trained, is being used as a transit point for government troops moving to assembly areas of Namialo and Angoche. He said the area is also being used by Bangladesh troops in the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] for their physical exercise. [Begin Nihia recording] Well, I can say that the truth is there are no men being trained there. The men who are there are waiting to be moved to assembly areas in Namialo and Angoche. I do not know why Mr. Ngonhamo is inventing these accusations, citing my name. Since I was posted as the first secretary of the Frelimo Party in Nampula, I have never visited a single military unit. In Nampula I travel alone. I am never escorted. In all districts I have never been escorted. I move alone because I believe in the peace accord. I believe in the end of war. [end recording] In view of what he described as inventions, the first secretary of the Frelimo Party in Nampula then said and I quote, Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonhamo is not the reasonable person I thought he was, unquote. The Frelimo Party official in Nampula Province said ironically that the Maringue Military Academy, where Ngonhamo was trained, teaches its cadets subjects like lies, arrogance, and terrorism. We asked Nihia whether he would take legal action against Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo. [Begin Nihia recording] It may go that far. If people are not careful, things may go that far. Gen. Ngonhamo is a citizen and in his capacity as a citizen he should not make false charges against a free citizen, as I am. It may go that far, if he continues with these accusations and he does not present concrete reasons. He will not be able to present reasons for me to say yes, it is true. What I am saying is what I mean. [end recording] Asked to explain why he changed his impression of Gen. Ngonhamo, Eduardo da Silva Nihia said power has spoiled the Renamo officer who is today in the High Command of the future unified army. [Begin Nihia recording] Ngonhamo was recently appointed as a member of the High Command of the future nonpartisan forces in the country [words indistinct]. Before being appointed, he [words indistinct]. Now that he has been appointed to that post, he thinks that he has power [words indistinct]. [end recording] Gen. Eduardo da Silva Nihia doubted whether Ngonhamo has the capacity to become lieutenant general. He said it is not his desire to join the new army to consist of soldiers from the government and Renamo, but if this happens, he would not [words indistinct] be commanded by Ngonhamo, as long as he demonstrates that he is responsible and honest in his command.
