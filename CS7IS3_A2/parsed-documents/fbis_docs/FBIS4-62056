It is being carried out by Interior Ministry forces with the help of procurators, customs officials, and other services. The main purpose of the operation is to check the observance of Russian residence laws and regulations by foreigners. It is an open secret that the territory is now overrun by guests from CIS countries and other foreign states. What is more, their numbers can hardly be properly recorded. Many of them come to Russia legally, but then settle here arbitrarily, engaging in poaching, shady businesses, and other not very seemly occupations. Many come to the territory illegally, with forged documents, while some even have no documents at all. Particularly many foreigners have settled in the Ussuri Taiga, which they are devastating most ruthlessly and impudently. Officials of the territorial interior department hope the operation "Foreigner", expected to last until May 20, will help the foreign guests to "learn the particulars" of the regulations in force and to respect Russia's laws.
