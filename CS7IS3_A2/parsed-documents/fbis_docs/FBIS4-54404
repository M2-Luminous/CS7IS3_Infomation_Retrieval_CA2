The Pact on Security and Stability in Europe was proposed by French Premier Edouard Balladur in June 1993. It aims to ensure stability and security in Europe and protect economic and trade interests of European countries and to end in conclusion, by its member states, of agreements on good neighborliness and on respecting ethnic minority rights. According to the French plan, European countries and the United States and Canada would be signatories of the pact. Daskalov said that Bulgaria considered every initiative aimed at stability in Europe profitable. He added, however, that the prepared documents should put all countries on an equal footing. Daskalov said that Bulgaria did not have problems either with borders or with ethnic minorities and it announced earlier that it would not participate in round-table discussions on these issues. Nevertheless it actively supports the preparation of the Paris conference and hopes that the submitted document would correspond to its interests, he added. Daskalov told CTK that as far as the 800,000 Turks living in Bulgaria are concerned Bulgaria believes that their rights had been ensured in the course of last years' democratic changes. In practice this issue had been successfully solved through attracting the Turkish population to managing of the state, he said. "It is important not only to demand that rights are observed but to share responsibility," he said. Over one hundred of mayors of Turkish origin had been elected during the latest local elections, Daskalov said. Moreover, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, the third strongest political party in Parliament, represented the Turkish minority in Parliament, Daskalov said. He pointed to the fact that Bulgarian Premier Lyuben Berov was a representative of this very movement. "I do not know whether there exists another state in Europe whose premier is a representative of a certain minority group," Daskalov said. He said that Bulgaria had settled problems in this field. If it was not so then events similar to those in neighboring Yugoslavia could happened in Bulgaria. On the contrary, thanks to the fact that ethnic minority problems had been solved and thanks to its moderate internal and foreign policy Bulgaria had a certain stabilizing role in the Balkans, Daskalov said.
