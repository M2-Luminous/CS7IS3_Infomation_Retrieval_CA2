FR940523-1-00017 FR940523-1-00006 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Parts 1, 73 and 76 [MM Docket 94&hyph;34; DA 94&hyph;495] Cable Services; Amendment of Equal Employment Opportunity Rules AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: On May 12, 1994, the Office of Communications of the United Church of Christ, the Institute for Public Representation, and the Minority Media and Employment Council (hereinafter ``Petitioners'') filed a Request for Extension of Time to Submit Comments to the Commission's Notice of Inquiry, FCC 94&hyph;103, released April 12, 1994. Petitioners requested that we extend the dates for submission of comments 21 days, through and including June 13, 1994, and give a comparable extension of time for the submission of reply comments. We believe that the petitioners in this case may be in a particularly good position to assist the Commission given their longstanding involvement in these issues. Accordingly, we grant the requested relief. We extend the dates for filing comments and reply comments in this proceeding to June 13, 1994, and June 28, 1994, respectively. DATES: Initial comments due June 13, 1994; reply comments due June 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, Washington DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Hope G. Cooper, Mass Media Bureau, Enforcement Division. (202) 632&hyph;7069. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Order Granting Motion for Extension of Time to File Comments Adopted: May 16, 1994 Released: May 16, 1994 By the Chief, Mass Media Bureau: 1. On April 20, 1994, the Commission adopted a Notice of Inquiry, FCC 94&hyph;103, released April 21, 1994, to obtain comment on the effectiveness of the Commission's rules, procedures, policies, standards and guidelines in promoting equality of employment opportunity. Comment and Reply Comment dates were established for May 23, 1994, and June 7, 1994, respectively. 2. On May 12, 1994, the Office of Communications of the United Church of Christ, the Institute for Public Representation, and the Minority Media and Employment Council (hereinafter ``Petitioners'') filed a Request For Extension of Time to Submit Comments. Petitioners requested that we extend the dates for submission of comments 21 days, through and including June 13, 1994, and give a comparable extension of time for the submission of reply comments. In support of their request petitioners stated that the 30 day time period is an insufficient amount of time to prepare a comprehensive response to issues raised in the Notice. They state that they are limited in staff size and lack the resources to respond to the Notice in such a short time. They also argue that an extension of time would aid the Commission's decisional processes by enabling a greater number of parties to participate and by allowing them the opportunity to further the quality of their submissions. 3. As set forth in §1.46 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR §1.46, it is our policy that extensions of time not be routinely granted. However, we believe that the petitioners in this case may be in a particularly good position to assist the Commission given their longstanding involvement in these issues. Accordingly, we will grant the requested relief. However, given the October 5th deadline for the Commission to submit its report to Congress, we do not intend to grant further extensions of time. 4. Accordingly, it is ordered, that the Request For Extension of Time filed by Petitioners is granted. 5. It is therefore ordered that the dates for filing comments and reply comments in this proceeding are extended to June 13, 1994, and June 28, 1994, respective. 6. This action is taken pursuant to authority found in Sections 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §4(i) and 303(r) and §0.204(b), 9.283 and 1.46 of the Commissions Rules, 47 CFR §0.204(b), 0.283 and 1.46. 7.
