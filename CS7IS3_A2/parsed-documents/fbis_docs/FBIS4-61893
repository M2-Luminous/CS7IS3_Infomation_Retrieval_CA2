The station will be utilized for space, the world ocean and seismic research. This was decided by the Latvian Academy of Science today. The radio radar station with a 32-meter parabolic aerial is situated near Ventspils (180 kilometers to the north-west from Riga). It is considered one of the three Russian military strategic facilities on Latvian territory along with the radio radar station in Skrunda and the military port in Liepaja. The Latvian Academy stressed that the radio telescope could be used jointly with the Russian Academy of Science. The two academies had signed a protocol on intentions in late April. Head of the Department for Control over Russian troop withdrawal in the Latvian government, Ilgonis Upmalis, emphasized that utilization of the station for scientific purposes would raise the authority of Latvian science and let Latvia contribute to international research programs. The Russian military facility will be transferred to Latvia on August 31, 1994 (after Russian troop withdrawal is over).
