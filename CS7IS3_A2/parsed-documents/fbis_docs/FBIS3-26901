According to Mr. He, Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, now has 673 Taiwan-funded enterprises and 277 enterprises invested in by people who have relatives in the island and of these enterprises, 10 each have investment of U.S.$10 million and 90 percent of these enterprises are earning profits. The newly-set-up enterprises of this kind have their businesses shifting away from simple shoe-making into light industry, chemical industry, electronics, textiles, machinery, real estate and domestic animal-breeding. Mr. He said that the new tax system starting to be implemented this year would pose no bad influence to Taiwan businessmen's earnings in the city and the city's favorable policies set for them remained unchanged. Moreover, the city would continue to improve its services to them. Mr. He held that though much effort was being made in the introduction of funds from Taiwan, the city was backward in this sector compared with the Yangtze River delta area. The city would, therefore, grasp the present opportunity, make every effort to improve the environment for investment and find new ways for making greater progress in the introduction of capital from the island. Mr. He revealed that the city would engage in four main activities in this sector. First, it will convene a meeting on Taiwan-related economy and trade. Second, it will invite a batch of Taiwan compatriots to take part in the Litchi Festival to be held in the city. Third, it will send a delegation of entrepreneurs from the city to visit Taiwan and fourth, it will invite big financial groups, famous entrepreneurs and personnel from economic circles in the island to pay inspection visits to the city.
