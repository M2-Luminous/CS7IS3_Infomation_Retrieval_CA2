During the debate on this draft law, people's deputies expressed two opposite stands: Anatoliy Yahoferov and Ivan Makar believe the provisions of the law are geared to restoring the administrative methods of managing economy while Borys Mokin and others were convinced that they stimulate energy by saving production methods. The laws concerning legal proceedings will come into force on the day of their promulgation, in particular the law "On the Bodies of the Judges' Self-Government" (formerly called "On Conferences and Congresses of Judges"); "On Qualification Commissions, Qualification Certification, and Disciplinary Responsibility of Ukraine's Judges"; and "On Introducing Amendments to the Law `On the Status of Judges.'" Changes have been introduced to the Supreme Council resolution "On Putting the Law of Ukraine `On Road Traffic' in force." The people's deputies expressed most of their interest during the debate on two draft laws: "On Introducing Amendments and Additions to the Cabinet of Ministers' Decree `On the Regime of Foreign Investments'" and to the Land Code of Ukraine (concerning the privatization of plots of land under incomplete construction projects). People's Deputy Volodymyr Petrenko pointed out: "We must examine this issue as a concept. Does the Supreme Council give the opportunity to foreign natural persons and legal entities and also to persons without citizenship to buy plots of land under the current inflation and distorted exchange rate of the coupon [karbovanets] in relation to the dollar?" The majority of the speakers agreed with his opinion that it is impossible to grant foreign citizens or persons without citizenship the right to buy land and remarked that their right to lease plots of land could be envisaged in the completed variant of the documents. The deputies voted for introducing amendments to the Cabinet of Ministers' decree "On the Regime of Foreign Investments." Chairman of the Supreme Council Ivan Plyushch said that on 3 February two important issues would be considered: the draft law on local self-government; and conformity with the trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia to the Supreme Council resolution on START I ratification.
