He told Interfax Monday [7 February] that he did not see much sense in hurrying up the signing of a treaty between the Russian Federation and Tatarstan on mutual delegation of powers at the expense of "unprincipled concessions" by Moscow. "The treaty is being worded, there is a schedule of drafting documents and there has been no departure from the constitutional process," Payin believes. In his view, similar treaties on power sharing between the center and the Federation's constituent parts must be signed with all Russia's areas. "It would be highly undesirable to make some constituent part an exceptional case," Payin emphasized. Staying away from the elections does more harm to Tatarstan than to Russia, Payin said. In his words, by ignoring the December parliamentary elections that republic lost the chance of being represented in the Federation's top legislature and of influencing federal policies, particularly as far as the shaping the structure of the Federation is concerned.
