Commenting on a BANGKOK POST report saying that the government forces had used chemical weapons in the Pailin onslaught, the KRAF spokesman said the royal government has never purchased any chemical weapons and that no chemical weapons have ever been supplied by another country during the war. He pointed out that in the Anlung Veng and Pailin areas as well as in (?Kompong Thom Province), more than 10 KRAF combatants have died after drinking water from streams and ponds poisoned by the Khmer Rouge. Regarding the Khmer Rouge strategy, the general said after the attacks on Anlung Veng and Pailin, their biggest strongholds, the Khmer Rouge have regrouped at Malai in order to plan their last- ditch strategy to further their destructive war against the nation as they have done in the past.
