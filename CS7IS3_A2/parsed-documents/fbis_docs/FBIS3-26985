Yeltsin explained: "Some people are trying to solve the problems of Bosnia without Russia. We shall not allow this to happen." In an interview with reporters after he and visiting British Prime Minister John Major signed a joint statement on reciprocal non-targeting of strategic missiles, the Russian president also stressed the need for the heavy guns deployed around Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to be handed over to U.N. forces. Yeltsin told reporters that the Bosnian problem was discussed in detail during his talks this morning with Major. "Our stands are identical on the main point; that it is necessary for the heavy guns to be handed over to U.N. forces to bring an end to the shelling. "Moreover," Yeltsin said, "both sides have confirmed during the talks that the Bosnian problem should be resolved primarily by peaceful means, through negotiations." "This will allow us to put an end to the war in former Yugoslavia," he said. He reminded reporters that the Bosnian problem was now being discussed in the U.N. Security Council. "This body must issue a mandate to the blue helmets (U.N. peacekeepers) to accept the guns removed from positions around Sarajevo. This is important," he said. However, the president added that he believed that the strategic positions of the hostile parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina could be bombed only if U.N. forces were attacked and called for help. Meanwhile, the joint statement signed by Yeltsin and Major immediately after their talks in the Kremlin stipulates that the two countries would not order their strategic nuclear missiles to be targeted at each other. The agreement come into effect not later than May 30, 1994.
