If the siege of Sarajevo is not lifted, NATO will begin bombing Serb positions. [Commentator F. Tavrovskiy] This is far from the first ultimatum that has been given. One can cite similarities with the years of the Cold War when China gave the United States its 547th serious and final warning for violating its territorial waters. Things are different here, and the most important difference in this ultimatum is the existence of a strictly defined 10-day period. Moreover, now NATO does not need to spend a long time seeking consent from the large UN bureaucracy. The decision to start bombing will be taken directly with the participation of Butrus-Ghali. Now there is only Russia which can lift the threat from the Serbs. Today Russia called for the urgent convening of the UN Security Council to discuss the crisis. As Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Adamishin stated, Russia is calling for a settlement of the Bosnian conflict by means of demilitarizing Sarajevo and handing over the city to UN control. Adamishin expressed disagreement with the view that Butrus-Ghali has given NATO authority to carry out bombing strikes. Butrus-Ghali has only asked whether the North Atalantic Alliance is ready, if necessary, to make its aviation available but he did not hand over UN functions to NATO, Adamishin stressed. The deputy foreign minister said that in the near future Boris Yeltsin will have telephone conversations with the leaders of Western countries on the question of Bosnia. [Announcer] All the same, it should be noted that the statement made by Russia today puts it in a rather complicated position. In the first place, the decision by the North Atlantic Alliance is already based on a UN Security Council resolution which allows military force to be used in extreme cases. Therefore, the attempts of the Russian leaders to transfer the discussion of the Bosnian question to the Security Council will, most likely, not be successful. This dissenting position by Russia, perhaps for the first time in recent years, is putting it on the path toward confrontation with Western diplomacy.
