FBIS4-9612 "dreeu083_p_94010" FBIS-EEU-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 POLAND Polls: Less Approval for Walesa, More for Pawlak Polls: Less Approval for Walesa, More for Pawlak WS2804115394 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 28 Apr 94 p 2 WS2804115394 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA Polish BFN [Article by R.W.: "Public Opinion Research Institute for RZECZPOSPOLITA; More Consent for Prime Minister Than for President"] [Text] The number of people who agree with the way Prime Minister Pawlak is wielding power increased in April, while popular support for the governing style of President Lech Walesa decreased. Slowly but surely, the president has been losing support since March; the prime minister lost in March but regained popularity in April. These opinion polls are conducted for us by the Sopot Public Opinion Research Institute. Each time the respondents had to answer questions under different circumstances: In February, strikes were going on in Silesia; a huge demonstration, deemed "five km of Solidarity" by the papers, was staged in Warsaw; the coalition was just getting over the crisis ensuing after the resignation of Marek Borowski, finance minister and deputy prime minister. The president launched his legislative initiative to enable 100,000 citizens to submit a draft constitution, but the Sejm had not rejected it at the time. The results: The president's style was approved by 25 percent of respondents, the prime minister's style by 36 percent. In March, Pawlak left for Moscow on a visit that, according to many observers, was ill prepared; the president was ostentatiously taken aback by this visit. Dariusz Rosati had only just emerged as a candidate for the new deputy prime minister and finance minister, he was already accepted by the prime minister; the president had not taken a stand on that yet. The approval rating for the president 22 percent, for the prime minister 33 percent. In April, the dispute over Rosati had been going on for many days; it was only unclear whether it was a conflict between the president and the coalition or between the president and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. In only a few days, Walesa was supposed to meet with the SLD Parliamentary Club, as a consequence of which we witnessed an "armistice." The president had already vetoed the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] and the gminas [smallest administrative units] councils electoral law; the budget was already signed. The prime minister started suggesting to unionists that there might be no new popiwek at all. In this situation, the way Walesa wielded power was approved by 20 percent of respondents; in the case of Pawlak, there was twice as much support. The greatest support for the prime minister can be noted among elderly people, including senior citizens and disabled pensioners, those with elementary education, unskilled manual workers, housewives, and especially peasants, voters for the Polish Peasant Party and the Peasant Accord. Those who express the least favorable opinions are young people, including school and university students, educated people, well-to-do individuals living in big towns and cities, voters who supported the Liberal-Democratic Congress and the Democratic Union in the September elections. Walesa's style meets with considerable approval among people over 60, election supporters of the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms, Solidarity, and the Fatherland coalition. Slightly more-than-average approval is expressed by educated people holding managerial posts, but mainly because, in this group, there are seldom any problems with expressing an opinion. The poll was conducted on 16 and 17 April on a sample of 1,071 adult inhabitants of the country; a comparison was made with similar polls carried out in the middle of March and February. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Do you support the way power is wielded by President Lech Walesa? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |No |Yes | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Feb 1994 |59|29| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Mar 1994 |63|22| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Apr 1994 |65|20| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Do you support the way power is wielded by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |No |Yes | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Feb 1994 |35|36| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Mar 1994 |37|33| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Apr 1994 |34|40| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
