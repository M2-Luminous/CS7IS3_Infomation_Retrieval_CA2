In his words, the Supreme Soviet is now discussing the points that are out of line with the country's national interests. In the meantime, Goryn says it is up to a new parliament, to be elected on March 27, to consider the ratification of the Moscow declaration because of inability by the Supreme Soviet to take a measured resolution on the issue. He said the parliament would adopt a resolution, but with some strings attached. Last November, the parliament ratified the Start-I agreement and the Lisbon protocol, but conditioned that to economic aid and security guarantees to Ukraine. The Lisbon protocol was ratified without its article 5 which provided for Kiev's adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a nuclear free state. President Kravchuk on Tuesday called on parliament to approve the protocol in full, arguing that the tripartite Moscow agreement met all of the parliament's stipulations for ratifying the paper. However, Goryn said the President's statement "goes beyond the framework of the parliamentary resolution."
