This 558-km-long trunk line, a critical segment of the Asia-Europe overland fiber optic cable, uses imported single-mode long-wavelength optical fiber and fiber optic cable throughout. The initial phase has four fiber optic cable digital transmission systems employing 1310-nm-wavelength fiber with a 140 Mbps [i.e., DS4] transmission rate.
