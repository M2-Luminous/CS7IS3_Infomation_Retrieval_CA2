It is a disturbing sign, according to Sasi, that the new ideas are originating outside the party. On Saturday [19 February] Sasi called for an internal party debate on values and the future of the kind that has been started by the young Finns under the leadership of Dr. Risto E. J. Penttila, who in fact also belongs to the Coalition Party. Speaker Riitta Uosukainen (Coalition Party) warned Saturday against damaging the working possibilities for "a unified Coalition Party that does real work" and demanded that the party gather its strength for the election effort next year. A debate on the state of the party has flared up in the Coalition Party, and there has been criticism of party chairman Pertti Salolainen in particular.
