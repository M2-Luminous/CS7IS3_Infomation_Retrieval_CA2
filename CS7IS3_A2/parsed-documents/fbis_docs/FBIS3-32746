He recommended, however, that the president meet with the Foreign Relations Commission. Here is what Andres Pastrana Arango said: [Begin Pastrana recording] The president, for whom I have all due respect, should have met with the foreign relations advisory commission to clear up the situation. In my opinion, it still is not too late, because if international treaties currently in force are used as an argument, the honorable members of that body can offer ideas on how to avoid personal traumas as well as call off the process at the commission to investigate charges. [end recording] I have not given my opinion at the last minute [words indistinct] Pastrana Arango said, recalling that at the given time he had spoken out on the issue.
