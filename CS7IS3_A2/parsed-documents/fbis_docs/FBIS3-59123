The federal government was also committed to creating concrete prospects for membership of the European Union, Kinkel said this evening in a speech before students at Speyer College of Administration. The West had to support the democratic reforms in Russia to secure peace in Europe in the long-term, he said. However, the financial support given Russia had long ago reached the limits of the budget's capacity. The minister called upon the other Western industrial nations to provide greater financial support for Russia. In Speyer, Kinkel once again spoke in favor of a permanent seat on the UN Security Council for Germany. The German Government wanted to play a part in deciding international problems that affected Germany. To that end, Germany would have to take part in UN military peace missions. It was important for the constitutional basis for Bundeswehr missions abroad to be established at last.
