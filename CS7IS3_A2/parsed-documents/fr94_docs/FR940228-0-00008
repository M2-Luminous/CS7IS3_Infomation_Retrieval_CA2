FR940228-0-00008 FR940228-0-00002 Comment: Two comments indicated that the wheat provision will allow any insured producer whose wheat sustains early damage to destroy any remaining wheat, pay a reduced premium rate, and receive a full indemnity. The comments suggested that the provision should be changed to prohibit this practice, and to require the insured to notify the insurer prior to destroying any insured wheat. Response: FCIC agrees that the reduced premium should apply only when there is no insurable damage. FCIC also agrees that the insured should notify the insurer prior to and after destruction of any acreage of the insured crop. This notification will allow the insurer to make any necessary inspections and adjustments to the Acreage Report. The provision has been revised accordingly. Comment: Two comments indicated that the provisions for destroyed acreage are difficult to assess without seeing the proposed prorata premium charges, or the deadlines which will be designated in the Special Provisions. The comments asked if the expense reimbursement to reinsured companies for acreage destroyed by the deadline in the Special Provisions would be calculated using the total premium or the reduced premium. Response: Premium rates for destroyed acreage will vary in accordance with the probability of loss in individual geographic areas. If insurable damage occurs prior to the crop being destroyed by the grower, the loss will be processed in the normal manner and 100 percent of the premium will be due. Expense reimbursement will also be calculated on this basis. If the insured destroys the acreage by the date designated in the Special Provisions and does not claim insurable damage on such acreage, the reduced rate will be used to determine the premium and the reduced premium will be used to determine the expense reimbursement. Comment: One comment recommended that if the terms of the Late Planting Agreement Option are added to the Small Grains Policy, an option should be allowed for insureds to decline this coverage. The comment supported giving insureds the opportunity to make a management decision on whether their late planted acreage has coverage. Response: Provisions for late planting coverage have been added to these provisions in order to provide more complete coverage for insureds. If insureds are allowed to opt out of the coverage it may result in adverse selection against the insurer. When agronomic conditions are good many insureds would tend to opt out of the coverage, but if growing conditions are poor, insureds would tend to keep the coverage. Comment: One comment inquired about the lack of availability of the late planting option for late planted winter wheat. The comment pointed out that the option is available for both fall and spring planted barley, and suggested that it be available for winter wheat. Response: FCIC has received comments indicating that the wheat final planting dates are now set as late as it is normally practical to plant. The additional planting period allowed by the Late Planting Agreement Option (LPAO) permits planting too late in the year to expect production equal to or in excess of the insurance guarantee provided by the Option. Although coverage similar to that provided by the current LPAO will no longer be available, coverage for winter wheat planted after the final planting date will be available under the prevented planting provisions (section 12). FCIC received no comments opposed to removing the LPAO for winter wheat. Comment: One comment recommended changing the wording in subsection 6.(d) to: ``If you do not select one of the options for alternate coverage, you agree that in counties for which the special provisions designate both a fall final planting date and a spring final planting date, any damage to fall planted wheat which occurs between the fall final planting date and the spring final planting date due to any cause is not insured.'' Response: Subsection 6.(d) (renumbered as 6.(c) in this final rule) is intended solely to inform the insured of the availability of the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement. Section 7 (Insurance Period) clearly indicates the coverage limitations for fall planted wheat in counties with both fall and spring final planting dates. Additional language in subsection 6.(d) is not necessary. Comment: A comment suggested that FCIC provide a deadline for selecting Option A or B under the Winter Coverage Option. Response: The sales closing date will be the last date an insured can select either Option A or B under the Winter Coverage Option. FCIC agrees that the Option should indicate this date and has revised it accordingly. Comment: One comment stated that if wheat insurance attaches at different times depending on which style of insurance a grower has purchased, it will lead to administrative problems. The comment suggested that insurance on wheat attach on the day the acreage is planted or the date the application is accepted_whichever is later. Response: The insurance provisions attach on the later of the date the application is accepted or the date the crop is planted. This does not vary based on the insurance options chosen by the insured.
