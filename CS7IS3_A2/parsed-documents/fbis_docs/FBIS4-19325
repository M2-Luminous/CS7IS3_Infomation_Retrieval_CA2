In the Frankfurt talks of Hesse radio, Kinkel stated today that the information and documents provided by human rights groups are being evaluated. Everything suggests that it will again be difficult to prove the allegations. Examinations in the past also failed to furnish evidence that the Turks are using the weapons against the Kurds. Nothing is being covered up in this respect. If the allegations should turn out to be true, this "would not be good for German-Turkish relations," Kinkel stressed.
