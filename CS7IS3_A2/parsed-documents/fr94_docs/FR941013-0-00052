ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 62 (between 154 and 159 W. long.) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the 1994 total allowable catch (TAC) for pollock in Statistical Area 62. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), October 10, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael L. Sloan, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. In accordance with ยง672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the 1994 TAC for pollock in Statistical Area 62 was established by the final 1994 specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) as 23,870 metric tons (mt). The fourth quarterly allowance of TAC for Statistical Area 62 became available at noon, October 1, 1994, pursuant to ยง672.20(a)(2)(iv). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with ยง672.20(c)(2)(ii), that the 1994 TAC for pollock in Statistical Area 62 soon will be reached. The Regional Director established a directed fishing allowance of 23,000 mt, and has set aside the remaining 870 mt as bycatch to support other anticipated groundfish fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 62 is prohibited, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., October 10, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง672.20(g). Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: October 7, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25354 Filed 10&hyph;7&hyph;94; 1:51 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
