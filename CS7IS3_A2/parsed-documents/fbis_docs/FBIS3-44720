(Huang Yen-tao), director general of the Board of Foreign Trade and the government's chief trade negotiator, pledged not to give in easily to Washington's demand when he meets with U.S. negotiators on January 19. The U.S. Trade Representative Office gave the Board of Foreign Trade a list of 2,785 products last year in November on which the U.S. [words indistinct] wants Taiwan to cut trade tariffs on as a prerequisite for its entry into the GATT. Of the 2,785 products, Taipei was given a December 3 deadline to lower tariffs by 50 percent on 699 items. Among the 699 items she mentioned in the ultimatum, 514 were auto and industrial manufacturing products. Taipei rejected Washington's request in December last year but agreed to discuss the issue in bilateral tariffs negotiation early this year.
