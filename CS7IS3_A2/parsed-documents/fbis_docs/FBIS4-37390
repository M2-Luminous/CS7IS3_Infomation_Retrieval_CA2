Hard-Liners Insist on Fighting to the End"] [Text] Amman -- A senior Yemeni official has said over the telephone from Sanaa that a sharp disagreement has erupted among senior northern leaders over the mission of the UN secretary general's envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, and the proposal he submitted two days ago to hold a meeting in Cairo between Sanaa and Aden delegations. The official said that the disagreement necessitated holding an emergency meeting under Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. It was attended by Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the House of Representatives, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, and 'Abdallah al-Anisi, representing the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG]; and by Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar, and Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, representing the General People's Congress [GPC]. The official said that a severe disagreement dominated the meeting, and that Dr. al-Iryani was the first speaker, maybe in coordination with President 'Ali Salih. And that he -- that is, al-Iryani -- stressed that Sanaa has tried everything to resolve the situation, and it is impossible for things to continue in this manner forever. According to the Yemeni official, al-Iryani stressed that his country has become isolated and has lost the support of neighboring states and numerous Arab states. And that it has been placed in the category of Iraq and Iraqi President Saddam Husayn -- which will lead it into an unenviable situation. Al-Iryani proposed that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih personally make an Arab tour to include neighboring states, Egypt, and some other states in order to break what he termed the political siege imposed on Sanaa. He also proposed that southern [as published] deputies make an Arab tour to explain the northern Yemeni capital's view of the ongoing war. The Yemeni official stressed that the YRG leaders -- Shaykh al-Ahmar, 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi, and Dr. al-Zindani, supported by Col. Muhsin al-Ahmar -- rejected the idea of sending a delegation to Cairo and insisted on continuing the fighting and not responding to the UN mediation. They said that Aden is now in their grasp and that any cease-fire is going to make them lose the military battle after having lost the political battle. The official pointed out that President Salih is in an unenviable mental situation. That he has made great efforts to persuade senior members of his leadership to send a northern delegation to Cairo. And that he threatened to boycott the meeting before the participants agreed to his proposal in this connection. The Yemeni official noted that the delegation Sanaa sent to Cairo has a partisan and not an official capacity -- which means that the northern leadership insists that the dialogue with the southerners must remain within the framework that existed before the eruption of the fighting, as discussions were conducted between the GPC and the YRG on the one hand and the Yemeni Socialist Party on the other.
