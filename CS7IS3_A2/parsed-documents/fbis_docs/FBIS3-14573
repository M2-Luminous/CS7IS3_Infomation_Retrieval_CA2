Political observers deem the visits as "very important" and in line with bilateral interests for further strengthening of political, economic and cultural ties as well as regional and international cooperation. In the pre-revolution era, Africa was ignored by the shah's regime which had ties with only certain African countries such as the racist South African regime. However, the following the triumph of the Islamic revolution in 1079, Iran severed its relations with the racist South African regime upon the orders of the father of the Islamic revolution the late Imam Khomeini, and expanded its ties with sub-Saharan African countries. Islamic Republic of Iran now has established ties with 20 African countries at the ambassadorial level and "very sincere" relations with many others, but is yet to develop healthy economic ties with them. The six African countries which Velayati is to visit are rich in gold, diamonds, silver, bauxite, zinc, iron, copper, tin and cobalt as well as in such agricultural products as coffee, cocoa, tea, rice, cotton, sugar cane and pineapple. Iran can have favourable cooperation with the said countries and can invest in their mineral and agricultural sectors in favour of common interests. However, Iran has no direct aerial and marine transportation links with the said countries to promote economic cooperation. Contrary to Iran, the European Community, U.S., Japan and even the Zionist regime have embarked on economic investments in sub-Saharan Africa unilaterally to plunder the rich natural resources of the deprived continent.
