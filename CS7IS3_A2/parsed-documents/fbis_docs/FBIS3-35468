[Begin al-Hasan recording] First of all, I wish to express the Jordanian Government's strong condemnation of the criminal massacre committed this morning against innocent, unarmed Palestinian citizens inside the Ibrahimi Mosque, a house of God, and one of the most sacred places for the Muslim nation. This condemnable crime, committed against worshipers in the middle of Holy Ramadan, has shaken us and every single Arab, Muslim, and individual in the world. It should not be allowed to go by as a passing incident. The world must view it as a result of the arming of fanatical settlers. Jordan has always warned against the serious consequences that arming settlers would have on the peace process. Israel, the world, and the international institutions must bear their responsibilities and immediately act to end the settler's terrorist acts. This, of course, means that, first, these criminals must be punished and disarmed to prevent such incidents in the future; this includes even removing the settlements all together from the occupied Arab territories. As we extend to our kinsfolk in occupied, steadfast Hebron, and to the families of the martyrs our warmest condolences, we in Jordan warn the world that this incident and several others in the past only exemplify the consequences of the occupation of the Palestinian territory and the prevention of the Palestinian people from exercising theirs right on their soil. The world must bear the responsibility for stopping these incidents by ensuring the achievement of an honorable, comprehensive settlement that will lead to Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories and granting the Palestinian people their legitimate rights.
