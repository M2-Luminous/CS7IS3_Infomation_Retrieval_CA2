[Rodriguez] Regarding the pacification process, we can say that it is 90 percent under control in the northern region (San Martin). This means that the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] and Shining Path [SL] have been almost totally annihilated. In the southern region (mainly in Tingo Maria) we are still facing problems with subversion because the last subversive groups persist in their genocidal venture and have not surrendered to authorities. However, I can inform you that the entire area will be completely under control very soon. [Orellana] The legal measures issued by the government, such as the Repentance Law, have yielded excellent results in other regions. What was the impact of this legislation on the antiterrorism struggle? [Rodriguez] Look, initially these measures were received with some mistrust in the region. People did not believe they would result in anything positive. It was thought that the measures' objective was to pressure people. Time has gone by and these people, I cannot say to what sector they belong, have realized how mistaken they were. There have been many terrorists who have voluntarily resorted to the Repentance Law without any sort of pressure. When these terrorists presented themselves to the Armed Forces barracks and units their human rights were respected, and this attitude also has influenced subversives to resort to this new law. [Orellana] What other factors have yielded positive results in the counterterrorist struggle in the Huallaga Front? [Rodriguez] In addition to the Armed Forces' actions and the legal measures, we can say that citizen participation has been another fundamental element in winning the war against terrorism. Their cooperation has been valuable in the last few years. In addition, the Armed Forces are actively participating in this effort and we are constantly engaged in clashes with terrorist groups with very positive results. Finally, I must say that psychological operations are also an essential part of the war we are currently waging against the SL and MRTA. In the jungle area, we drop pamphlets from our airplanes telling terrorists, who have been recruited by force, about the serious mistake they are making by staying with the terrorists. Many already have abandoned these shelters and surrendered under the Repentance Law. [Orellana] In the Huallaga Front, there have been some cases of the involvement of military officers with drug traffickers. What can you tells us in this regard? [Rodriguez] We have sustained harsh blows from these bad elements of society who have seriously damaged our institution. The Peruvian Army will never allow its members to be involved in this illegal activity. However, we bear the full responsibility and we fully trust that this situation will end there. Corruption is not part of the Armed Forces' institutions. [Orellana] How are you combating drug trafficking in the Huallaga Front under your command? [Rodriguez] At the present time, our units, our commands, and the Huallaga Front commander himself are directly involved in fighting drug trafficking. We are constantly destroying airfields and the shelters the drug traffickers build in the more remote jungle areas. We conduct dragnet operations whenever we have specific information to capture the "drug traffickers" and this is yielding very good results. [Orellana] This, of course, is forcing drug traffickers to withdraw to other areas where they are also under attack. [Rodriguez] Quite so. We are destroying all illegal activity in this area. This is why drug traffickers are withdrawing to other areas, where they are being attacked in the same manner. They will have no way out when we control the entire region. We witnessed this when we seized three metric tons of cocaine paste some time ago in Manu. We have had access to this information since January. This is very important for us because very soon we will eradicate them from the entire San Martin region, although not entirely. [Orellana] General, how has the respect for human rights developed in the pacification process? [Rodriguez] We uphold human rights in every aspect of the word. There are no human rights abuses in this area. If there have been charges in this regard, they have been from biased parties uninterested in seeing the Armed Forces working in the region. I will give you one example: When we entered Bellavista within the framework of a military operation that upheld all the laws in force and that even appointed a special prosecutor, there were people who reported that the alleged terrorists we arrested had been allegedly mistreated. All these fabrications were later denied by the special prosecutor who accompanied the military operation. [Orellana] Does this mean there is no evidence of the alleged human rights violations charges that have been raised? [Rodriguez] No there are not. None of the charges raised against the Armed Forces' activities in the area have been proven. Perhaps some may have been very aggressive but this does not mean that people have deliberately committed abuses against those arrested in Huallaga.
