The meeting was organized by the Tevzeme (Fatherland) national association which dislikes the initialed agreement because it stipulates temporary functioning of a Russian-operated radar facility and guarantees rights of Russian war pensioners in the Baltic country. The picket held slogans "The Oppressors Should Not Stay on the Land of the Oppressed," "Latvia No Resort for Russian Officers," chanting "Down with Government that Sells the Latvian Nation" and "Occupants -- Get Out." The demonstrators demanded Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs or Special Tasks Minister Edvins Inkens to come out and speak on their record in front of the rally. But the officials did not appear. Latvian National Independence Movement leader Aristids Lembergs was present in the meeting. Lembergs said that the agreements have not been ratified in the Saeima (parliament) yet and they bear no signature of the Latvian president. Consequently, the picket may help to form the opinion of deputies, he added. The Cabinet is discussing the withdrawal agreement today.
