While narcotics were smuggled into Turkey from Iran and Syria in the past, the drug traffickers are also bringing in supplies from Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan at the present time. It is common knowledge that they used the "Balkan route" to transport their narcotics to Europe in the past. However, the recent use of ports in drug trafficking has drawn attention. It has been reported that even the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] has complied with the changes in transportation routes and moved to intensify its activities in Italy and Greece. [passage omitted] Regarding the PKK, the report said: "It has been ascertained that the PKK will maintain its underground activities, intensify its drug trafficking operations, take harsh steps to continue to extort funds, and shift its activities from wherever it is banned to neighboring countries (particularly to those that have a coastline). The obstruction of PKK's activities in the countries in which that organization is banned will be impossible if its members are not expelled."
