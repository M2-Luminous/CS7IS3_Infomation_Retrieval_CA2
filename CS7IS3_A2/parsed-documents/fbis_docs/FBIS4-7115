It represents both a departure in Australian trade policy and a seminal commitment specifically to South-East Asian future. The ASEAN six -- Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, The Philippines, and Brunei -- represent, outside China, the most dynamic economies in the world. Keating has proposed joining the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] to the Closer Economic Relations [CER] agreement that exists between Australia and New Zealand. This could create a vast free trade area worth $1000 billion [currency not further specified] a year. The overall size of the South-East Asian economies is still relatively small. As Keating pointed out, their combined gross national product roughly equals that of Australia and New Zealand. But this statistic can be misleading for the fact that a far higher proportion of their GNPs goes to international trade than ours. Singapore is the world's 18th biggest exporter, while Australia is 21st. Indonesia and Thailand rank 26th and 27th respectively. Thus the symmetry between Australia-New Zealand and ASEAN is really false. As trading economies, ASEAN combined far outweighs Australia-New Zealand. And, despite Australia's good growth this year (which some estimates put as high as 5 per cent) the ASEAN economies will almost certainly grow much faster than Australia and New Zealand over the next decade. Moreover, we run a substantial trade surplus with all the significant South-East Asian economies. Already, there are a bigger market for us than either the European or North America. They have also shown by far the most rapid growth of any region in the world in buying our elaborately transformed manufactures. Therefore we stand to gain far more than ASEAN do from a fusion AFTA and the CER. Indeed, it is not clear how practical Keating's proposal is in the short term. Its real value probably lies in its symbolism, the signals it sends both to South-East Asia and more widely about where Australia stands. The reason Australia would gain far more than the ASEAN members from an AFTA-CER link lie partly in the different stages of development and liberalisation of Australia and the South-East Asian economies. Under AFTA, the ASEAN economies are pledged to reach a common preferential external tariff on manufactured goods of 5 per cent within 15 years. There are moves to accelerate this timetable, especially, from Thailand, but that is the limit of the existing commitment. Most Australian tariffs, with the exceptions of motor vehicles and textiles, are already at or near that level now. Certainly, they will be within 15, or even 10 years (10 years being the proposed accelerated timetable for AFTA). Moreover, each AFTA-country is allowed to nominate temporary exemptions from the common tariff and Australia could nominate motor vehicles and textiles as its exceptions. Therefore under the provisions of the actual AFTA agreement, Australia would not have to take any specific actions to qualify for membership. This begs the question of what benefit would be in an AFTA-CER link for the ASEAN economies. The answer is, in the short term, not much. The most important likely consequence of AFTA coming into existence will be to affect international investment decisions. Because AFTA will provide them with a common South-East Asian market for most manufactured goods, multinational companies investing in South-East Asia will have an incentive to concentrate their investments in one single country, rather than needing to invest in several countries to get behind local tariff walls. Australia could be a significant loser in this process as even relatively hightech investment could be diverted away from Australia and towards South-East Asia. Moreover, Australia has a poor record over the past decade of actually investing in South-East Asia, as oppose to selling exports there. The creation of AFTA will probably make the link between investment and trade more important than it is now. For Australia to get on the inside of AFTA, therefore, could be immensely valuable. For ASEAN members, the benefit might include that when they are selling themselves as investment sites they could more clearly point to the bigger combined market including Australia and New Zealand. There might also be significant non-tariff area of co-operation which could attract members to an association with Australia and New Zealand. However, the moves have to be seen in the context of wider politics of international trade. There is currently a semi-official American proposal for a Pacific Free Trade Area including all of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation economies. This seems to be completely inconsistent with ongoing American trade actions against China and Japan. There is also an older American proposal to extend the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] across the Pacific, possibly starting with Singapore. This deeply worries many Asian governments as it offers the potential for the United States to pick off Asian countries one by one and get whatever concessions it wants on a bilateral basis. At the same time, Malaysia is pushing for its East Asian Economic Caucus [EAEC]. America opposes this (rather hypocritically, given its support of NAFTA) on the basis that it could divide the Pacific, driving America and East Asia apart. Australia has opposed it also, originally because we were excluded. Recently our friends in South-East Asia have offered to deal us in on the EAEC but we have continued to oppose it strongly on behalf of the Americans. All of these proposals are swirling through the Pacific at the same time as the world is trying to bed down the final details of the agreement to conclude the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. There is thus great uncertainty and much exploratory thinking about what kind of trade arrangements are going to dominate the Pacific. In part everyone is waiting to see which way America jumps, and indeed, if Keating's proposal looks serious, the Americans may well be peeved. It may be, however, that some wise heads in South-East Asia see the move to join AFTA and CER as a way of making good use of Australia's standing with Washington, to use Australia partly as a protective shield in trade politics. It has been little reported but the US has been harassing some of the best performing South-East Asian economies, namely Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, over what Washington alleges are oppressive labour laws. This is regarded in South-East Asia as rank hypocrisy and simply America deciding to penalise South-East Asia for becoming competitive. It may be that with Australia joined fully in an AFTA-CER partnership we can be of some assistance in fending off the more brutish American trade impulses. However, no one should think securing effective Australian membership of AFTA will be easy. The ASEAN-members do not want to be dominated by a developed, predominantly Caucasian country. Australia's robust political style and use of English tend to make it effective, but also quite impatient, in international forums. ASEAN diplomacy, although involving very intensive processes of dialogue, is much more low key, quiet, consensus-seeking -- at times a painfully slow business. ASEAN would not want to find itself suddenly dominated by Australia. It is very questionable whether Australia could adapt adequately to the ASEAN style. txt}Singapore has said publicly it has no objections to an AFTA-CER link. And it was the Thais who first proposed it. Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister, Suphachai Phanitchaphak, last November in Melbourne suggested Australia could join both AFTA and the EAEC. Indonesia has not publicly opposed the suggestion but has said its priority is to bed down AFTA first and it doesn't want to move too quickly. But Malaysia has been resolutely against the idea. Some Australian officials travelling with Keating briefed the travelling press to the effect that Malaysia could be enthusiastic about Australia linking up with AFTA. This must rate as a postwar high on preposterous wishful thinking, spin doctoring and misleading briefing. Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, was asked last November to respond to Suphachai's suggestion that Australia could join AFTA. He dismissed it out of hand and said: "How can a country outside ASEAN join AFTA... unless of course Australia becomes a member of ASEAN. Geographically, Australia is excluded." There is no doubt Malaysia can exercise a veto on an AFTA-CER link. This demonstrates once again the foolishness of the row Keating got himself into with Mahathir last year and equally the foolishness of the view which Keating now seems to hold that Australia can effectively ignore Malaysia in its regional diplomacy. This is just not true. Certainly, while Australia continues to actively oppose Malaysia's EAEC, there is no chance of Malaysia allowing us in effect to join AFTA. This is where the risk in Keating's proposal comes in. If months and months go by and absolutely nothing happens on Keating's initiative, it will be seen to have been mere hot air, just more windy Australian blah. And if this happens too often, the Prime Minister's word will be significantly devalued. However, the trade minister, Senator Bob McMullan, will, at the end of this month, launch a report by the East Asian Analytical Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the effects of AFTA on Australia and the possibility of an AFTA-CER link. It will offer a path forward which will begin very modestly with proposals for formal dialogue mechanisms. This is probably achievable and will allow Keating to claim that some progress is being made. There are two other important dimensions to Keating's proposals. Embracing so keenly such a big preferential trading arrangement marks a step along the road of Australia apparently abandoning its long-held commitment to traditional open regionalism, that is, reducing trade barriers on most favoured nation basis to everyone whether they are inside the group or not. As it is still hard to evaluate what real-world consequences Keating's proposals will have, it is difficult to know whether this is a departure in substance or just rhetoric. The opposition's reaction yesterday was essentially to caution against this chance. Second, making the whole proposal in Thailand is important. Thailand is Australia's 12th largest export market. Our exports there last year grew by an astonishing 50 per cent to $1.2 billion. Thailand remains one of the fastest growing economies in the world. It is a nation of nearly 60 million people. It is pivotally placed strategically and a natural entry point to Indochina. Paradoxically, because we have had so few problems in our relationship with Thailand we have tended to neglect it. It does not have the common British colonial experience of Malaysia and Singapore, nor is it, like them, a member of the Five Power Defence Arrangements, after ANZUS Australia's most important military commitment. Nor does it press on the Australian psyche in the way the sometimes brooding presence of Indonesia does. We have found it culturally distant. But it is an extremely important player in ASEAN, and APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]. It has also paid in its citizens' blood to establish a credible democratic system of government. Keating's visit to Thailand was made to overcome partial Australian neglect. This is reflected in the formation of a Thai-Australian Ministerial Council, like those we have with Indonesia and Japan. This is designed in part to spread our interests in ASEAN so that the relationship with Indonesia, admittedly very good, does not have to carry the full weight of our aspirations in South-East Asia. At least since the publication of Garnaut report in 1989, Australia has understood the importance of North-East Asia -- Japan, the three Chinas and Korea. In this trip Keating has made some headway in alerting the nation to the equal importance of South-East Asia, even if some of his more ambitious trade proposals do not come to pass.
