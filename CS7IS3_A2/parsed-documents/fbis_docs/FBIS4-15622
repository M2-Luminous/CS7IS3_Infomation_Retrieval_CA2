Despite the fact that the Agency's statutes clearly define the trends of its activity as studying the history of the Jewish people, providing assistance in holding Jewish national holidays, developing ties with the state of Israel and Jewish communities of other countries, the Agency and its head are carrying out active work aimed at illegally boosting the emigration to Israel, under the pretext of education purposes, of the most intelligent, gifted, and physically fit boys and girls aged between 15 and 17, so that they would subsequently adopt Israeli citizenship and Judaism. We believe that this is interference in our state's internal affairs by Sokhnut, since the education of Ukraine citizens abroad is regulated by interstate agreements or bilateral agreements between educational institutions that are only concluded through coordination with the appropriate power structures. So far, there are no such agreements between Ukraine and Israel. Such activity developed by Sokhnut extends far beyond its statutes and is in violation of Ukraine's Constitution and Ukraine's law "On Public Associations." In addition, in accordance with information provided by the chief of the State Tax Inspectorate in the Kiev City State Administration, in violation of the requirements specified by Article 24 of Ukraine's law "On Public Associations", Sokhnut is not, to this day, registered by the State Tax Inspectorate and is evading taxes in foreign currency. It conducts its financial operations through small enterprises, in particular, through the small enterprise "The Green Theater." On the basis of the above and proceeding from Article 29 of Ukraine's law "On Public Associations," Ukraine's Ministry of Justice, as a legalizing body, is issuing a warning to the Agency for the violations of the law committed by Sokhnut. Should such illegal activity continue, the Ministry of Justice will consider taking stricter measures, as stipulated by current legislation, against the Agency to the extent that it may be forced to disband (to be abolished).
