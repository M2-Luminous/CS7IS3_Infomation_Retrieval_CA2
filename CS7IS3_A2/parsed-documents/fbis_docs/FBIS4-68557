Its founders are comprised of large advertising agencies, with the controlling packet of stock (30 percent) belonging to the "Ostankino" television company. The rest of the stock is distributed between the founders as follows: The agency "Premier SV," "Inter ViD," "Video International"--15 percent each; "Maxima"--12 percent; "LogoVaz press" and "Oster"--6.5 percent each. Professionals in the advertising business worked on developing the model for the holding company. Foreign experience was also taken into consideration, and specifically the practice of creating television advertising agencies on the state channels of Germany and France. Aleksandr Dmitriyev has been appointed president of the a/o [joint-stock company] "Reklama-Holding," and Sergey Kuvaldin--its general director. Our correspondent spoke with the latter, and asked him to explain in greater detail about the new commercial structure. [Correspondent] Will there be a principle change in the life of the first state channel with the creation of the holding company, and what will the viewer get as a result of its activity? [Kuvaldin] The creation of the holding company is the first important element in the new economic mechanism which is gradually being developed at "Ostankino." Its main goal is the centralization of advertising. What is the advantage? A singular program and price policy is established, dumping (pricing below production cost) is not permitted, and the uncontrolled placement of advertisements on the basis of barter is discontinued. The quality of the advertising product is improved. Moreover, "Ostankino" will not only get a percent of the profits from placement of the advertisements, but it will also receive a three-month advance on the funds which it so badly needs for production of its programs. The holding company will pay out in advance the sum at which "Ostankino" estimates its advertising time for the quarter. The viewer will also not lose out. At present, I fully understand his irritation when there are 15 minutes of advertising in a row--at the end of a broadcast, between broadcasts, and at the beginning of the next broadcast. Now we will be able to build an advertising schedule which does not exhaust the television viewers. Advertising should not take up more than 15 percent of the air time, and will be distributed equally throughout the course of the day. This means that some broadcasts will not have any advertisements at all, while in those such as "Field of Miracles" their presence is not only justified, but also economically expedient. Advertisements for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products may be aired during the evening hours. It is true, I must concede--significant changes will not take place right away. We must not forget that "Ostankino" has already concluded agreements until the end of the year. Naturally, "Reklama-Holding" will have to work in a mixed regimen, fulfilling the former obligations while trying to mildly implement its own policy. [Correspondent] How will the holding company's price policy be formulated? [Kuvaldin] The most preferable scheme is the following: "Ostankino" appraises its advertising time and defines its amount. This advertising time is "cut up" into packets, which include "prime" and "non-prime" time. These packets are then put up for auction, with the starting price being the "Ostankino" price plus 10-15 percent. Understandably, it is profitable for the holding company to sell the advertising time at a higher price. First of all, because the founders expect dividends, and secondly because it is necessary to justify the expenditures for maintenance of the agency. The arithmetic here is simple: The higher the price at which the holding company sells the advertising time, the greater profits both the joint stock company and its founders will receive. However, it is inexpedient to raise the price endlessly, or it will be impossible to find buyers. By the way, one of the tasks of the joint-stock company is to help "Ostankino" reach real advertising valuations. [Correspondent] What will be the relationship between "Reklama-Holding" and independent producers working at channel one? [Kuvaldin] Their interests, undoubtedly, must not be infringed upon. The producer must receive as much as his program costs by estimate and in accordance with its rating. If we proceed from notions of profit, then the holding company is interested in a good channel and quality broadcasts. A dull and boring channel cannot have expensive advertising, and expensive and high quality advertising is one of the means of reducing its volumes. [Correspondent] There are mixed feelings at "Ostankino" about the creation of the joint-stock company. What, in your opinion, is the reason for this? [Kuvaldin] As in any new endeavor, they doubt its success simply because we have never had anything like it before. Moreover, the centralization of advertising touches upon the personal, corporative interests of some workers at "Ostankino." Small advertising services in the studios are being cut, and the company itself will change its relations with its producers--studios and associations. "Ostankino" will buy broadcasts from them, and the number of purchased broadcasts will determine the staff numbers of the studios, their financial condition and their capacity for providing their associates with social benefits.
