Ten highway projects, including one to the capital airport and an expressway from Beijing to Shijiazhuang, capital of neighboring Hebei Province, added some 200 km to the city's road length and the length of expressways ranks first among Chinese cities. Now, its more than 100 flyovers account for 70 percent of the country's total. Among them 22 were built last year. Meanwhile, many projects which help improve citizens' daily life were completed in 1993, such as the second pipeline carrying natural gas from the Huabei oil field to Beijing and the upgrading of the Beijing coking factory, which will enable it to supply more coal gas. Telecommunications also experienced robust growth. After 182,000 more households gained private telephones last year Beijing vaulted to the top of the list of cities in this category. Meanwhile, the environment has been greatly improved, with 541 more hectares greened in 1993. The city introduced 500 million U.S. dollars from companies in Hong Kong to undertake 18 infrastructure projects last year, including two highways and a museum of marine science. It also received 300 million U.S. dollars in loans from nine foreign governments and international financial organizations for infrastructure construction. It is reported that this year Beijing is to inject 12.4 billion yuan, mostly in the form of overseas investment, into 23 infrastructure projects. And about seven billion yuan of this will go to highway projects.
