"We are continuing to discuss with the United States concerning the Team Spirit `94, and we have not yet reached a decision," Han told reporters at a press conference after meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry. Han stressed that "we are prepared to deal with this issue through dialogue and by peaceful means." The U.S. administration decided on March 19 to resume the joint military exercise with South Korean forces after the talks between South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea failed over the issue of nuclear inspections and the exchange of envoys. "There is no final decision on when to have it," Han noted, "the question on Team Spirit is still be discussed between the two governments." Han also said the UN Security Council president's statement yesterday "represents a big diplomatic step toward dealing with this North Korean nuclear issue."
