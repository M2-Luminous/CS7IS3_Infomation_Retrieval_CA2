Issues to be discussed at the summit will concentrate on "European nations and not Japan," Saito told a regular press meeting. He was referring to earlier comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who indicated discussions at the two-day meeting in Detroit from Monday would include financial measures. "I don't know what he (Bentsen) actually said," Saito said, but the summit is to discuss "medium- to long-term structural problems," he indicated. Japan has no such problems, Saito said. Considering a meeting of finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Hawaii later this week, he said the gathering is intended to exchange views "freely" and not to stage negotiations. He said a meeting between Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Bentsen is yet not set. Meanwhile, Saito said his ministry will "soon" decide on a "strict" punishment for Kankaku Securities Co., which is accused of committing illegal loss-compensation practices. Japan's Securities and Exchange surveillance commission recommended Friday that the ministry take administrative action against the second-tier brokerage house. Kankaku is accused of compensating customers with losses through so-called "tobashi" deals, which are prohibited under the securities and exchange law. The practice involves shifting loss-carrying transactions from one client to another with a promise to buy back the shares later at higher prices.
