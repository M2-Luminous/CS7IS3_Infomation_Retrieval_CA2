According to the parliamentary groups of the CDA [Christian-Democratic Appeal], VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], and D66 [1966 Democrats], the recent political developments in Russia are reason enough to stop further cuts to Netherlands defense budget. Of the four main groups, only the PvdA [Socialist Workers Party] considers it "still too early" to make a similar decision. The PvdA wants to retain its own proposed plan of budget cuts worth more than 900 million guilders for the next legislative period. However, according to the CDA, VVD, and D66, the Priority Memorandum accepted earlier this year by the Chamber [Memorandum to the House outlining the government's priorities] must be carried out "to the letter." Spokesmen for the CDA, VVD, and D66 also expect that a fundamental debate on conscription will have to be conducted all over again as soon as the necessary constitutional amendment is put on the agenda. "If a man like Zhirinovskiy were to come to power, we should not give him a chance to say: The West can do nothing because their armies are powerless," CDA foreign affairs spokesman De Hoop Scheffer said. Consequently, the CDA "is wary of the PvdA's call for further defense cuts," Hillen, CDA vice chairman of the [House] Defense Committee said. Van Heemskerck Pillis-Duvekot, the VVD's defense spokesperson, also senses -- both in her own party "and beyond it" -- a real unwillingness to implement further cuts right now. "We had already reached the limit, and certainly now that the situation in Russia has developed in this way, we cannot allow further reductions to our armed forces." Eisma of D66 also believes that the bottom has been reached. Nonetheless, PvdA finance spokesman Melkert wants to adhere to the [PvdA's] analysis that further cuts are possible. However, he said that "if NATO were to give further security guarantees to the countries of Central Europe and if extreme rightist-nationalist Zhirinovskiy managed to strengthen his power base in Russia, then we would have to reconsider the configuration of the Netherlands Army."
