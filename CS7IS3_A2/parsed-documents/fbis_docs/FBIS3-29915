So far, 51 armed people who trespassed on the people's land in the three districts of Phnom Penh and put up armed resistance against government security forces on the afternoon of 17 February have been arrested, along with some firearms. A military police officer who took part in the campaign to crack down on anarchy said that the operation -- conducted in an area of Sivatha Street, north of Phsa Depot Market, where the three culprits were arrested -- could not be regarded as a success because an important person was able to escape. It has been learned that the man, who called himself Lieutenant General Men Samkol, was one of the ringleaders behind the illegal occupation of public land. According to a reliable source, among the ringleaders, a man named Brigadier General Leng Serei claimed to be the commander of Division 015 of the Khmer Angkor Resistance Movement's national forces. It was also Leng Serei who lined his own pockets by issuing bogus titles to the illegally occupied plots of land. The same source said that among the 51 people who were arrested, a man identified himself as Lt. Gen. Tep Phirum, a senior officer in the headquarters of the Khmer Angkor Resistance Movement's Division 015. It is not yet known where the bogus general was arrested. Tep Phirum also said that he is an officer in the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] tank unit. The KRAF General Staff has confirmed, however, that the name of that person as well as the names of his accomplices were not in its records. It was also said that these bogus armed units, which claimed to be part of the Khmer Angkor Resistance Movement and caused anarchy and fired on government security forces on the afternoon of 17 February, were not officially recognized by the Defense Ministry or the Royal Government. Although the cause of the trespassing is not yet known, it is suspected that the groups intended to commit sabotage against the government. According to analysts, the strategically important area is located between the state radio station and Pochentong Airport. A reliable source said the KRAF General Staff's Second Bureau is actively investigating in order to arrest the ringleaders of the armed groups. It is worth recalling that the Khmer Angkor Resistance Movement has frequently been involved in deceitful troop recruitment activities in the recent past.
