(Recently, there have been rumors about the intention of the president to submit to the State Duma a number of amendments to further delineate the powers of top state bodies -- IF). Filatov emphasized that the Civic Accord Pact had not been clear enough on which provisions of the Constitution may be amended. He recognized that development of society would make it necessary to amend the Constitution. "However, introduction of any amendments will be carried out jointly by all power structures," he stressed. Filatov did not agree with the point of view of some influential politicians who prognosticate a kind of revenge by the Soviet system, primarily at the local level and later at the federal one. Namely, Chairman of the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms Gavriil Popov shares this concern. Filatov reassured that the principle of division of powers was working both in the center and at the level of the federation's constituent members. He sees no threat of restoration of the Soviet system at the regional level. Filatov believes that the tendency of local representative bodies influencing the executive power is not dominant. However, he admitted that such attempts took place, "especially at the level of the republics." Filatov cited Mordovia as an example. A surveying commission composed of legal experts from the government and the president's administration, has lately come back from Mordovia. The commission concluded that most of the recent decisions adopted by the Mordovan Supreme Soviet contradicted the Russian Constitution, Filatov pointed out. He made it clear that the Russian president had no intention to solve this problem by force. Filatov said that after the conversation which had been held with the chairman of the Mordovan parliament, it was now possible to hope that the parliament's decision on restoration of the Soviet system at the regional level would be reviewed.
