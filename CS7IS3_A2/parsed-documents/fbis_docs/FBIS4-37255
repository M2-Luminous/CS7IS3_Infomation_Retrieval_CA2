This raid is part of a series of criminal actions carried out by this traitorous gang against economic and civilian installations and targets in our country that began with the firing of Scud missiles at defenseless civilians in Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, Zinjibar, and (al-Rahidah), and includes the shelling of vital installations in Aden, led by the Aden refinery and the power generating station in al-Hiswah. These attacks express this gang's profound enmity toward the people and their achievements, as well as its hostile desire to destroy the homeland and implement the scheme designed to fragment its unity. The source added that these hideous criminal acts committed by the rebellious gang against economic targets and installations and residential areas in the cities come at a time when many vital installations and targets in Aden, where this criminal gang is entrenched, lie within the range of our valiant Armed Forces' artillery. Our Armed Forces, however, are extremely eager to preserve and protect these installations from this traitorous clique because they are the property of the homeland and the people, and also because the Armed Forces are complying with the leadership's strict instructions not to inflict any harm on these developmental achievements, which are the people's wealth and the fruit of their efforts and sweat.
