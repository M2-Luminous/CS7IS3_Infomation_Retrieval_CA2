Members of the standing committee of the provincial party committee, including Shao Qihui, Ma Guoliang, Tian Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Yang Guanghong, Wang Xianmin, Li Qinglin, and Yu Jingchang, attended the meeting. At the meeting, Shao Qihui, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and provincial governor, relayed the directives given by the central leading comrades on the work of Heilongjiang. Vice Governor Sun Kuiwen relayed the guidelines of the central rural work conference and devised plans for Heilongjiang Province's current rural work. Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee, gave an important speech. He said: From the directives of the central leading comrades, we notice that the central authorities have been concerned about Heilongjiang's development, fully realized Heilongjiang's difficulty, affirmed the contributions of the people in our province and the work ideas of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, supported our province to overcome difficulties, and pinned great hopes on our province. Sun Weiben said: The guidelines of the speeches of the central leading comrades have defined an orientation of advance for building and developing Heilongjiang and for revitalizing the old industrial base. Sun Weiben pointed out: We must promote the spirit of keeping the eyes inward, not adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and making unremitting efforts to improve oneself among the broad masses of party members, cadres, and the people, and overcome the difficulties on our way of advance by deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability. Sun Weiben said: Our province's petroleum, animal husbandry, coal, grain, and war industries have all witnessed new economic difficulties. In addition to the factors of improper systems and structure, and price hike, the most prominent issue is that we are shackled by the system of larger in size and collective in nature and three unified managements in enterprises. We should strive to create a good external environment for these enterprises, guide them to make unremitting efforts to improve themselves, deepen reform, change operational mechanism, and enhance vitality. Sun Weiben said: Over the past few years, border trade has developed continuously and become an important channel for opening the province to the outside world and an important economic growing point. In order to give further play to this special advantage of our province and to develop the international market to alleviate the difficulties in our economic life, we must further emancipate the mind, decontrol policies, simplify procedures, and open the green light for expanding opening up. While making continued efforts to occupy the CIS markets, we should also implement the strategy of establishing various markets and actively develop markets in ROK, Northeast Asia, and east European countries. Sun Weiben pointed out: To overcome difficulties and to accelerate development, a task of top priority is to give prominence to three priorities and grasp two key points. The three priorities are to implement the guidelines of the recent central rural work conference and strive to reap a bumper agricultural harvest this year; exert efforts to invigorate large and medium-sized enterprises; and promote the project of establishing township enterprises in other counties. The two key points are projects and funds. Party committees and governments at all levels must further emancipate their mind, broaden their field of vision, and have a stronger sense of drawing support from other localities to seek development. Sun Weiben stressed: Under such a difficult situation, we should all the more try in every possible way to maintain stability. At present, the key to handling the relations of reform, development, and stability is to stabilize the market and commodity prices and to control inflation. Principal leaders of the party committees and governments at all levels should personally grasp three affairs well. Prior to the end of May, they should promote the system of carrying a price tag in all commodities throughout the province; implement the system of supervising and controlling the prices of 22 government-set daily necessities that are essential to the life of residents; and conduct an overall price inspection among all enterprises, individual industrial and commercial traders, and scientific research institutes rendering paid service. Leading comrades of the provincial people's congress, the provincial government, the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the provincial discipline inspection commission, and secretaries of various prefectural and city party committees attended the meeting as observers.
