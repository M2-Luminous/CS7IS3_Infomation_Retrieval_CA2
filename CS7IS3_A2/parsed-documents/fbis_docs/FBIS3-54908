Below is his exclusive interview. IF: What, do you think, is the main result of 1993? Shushkevich: I believe it was the materialization of the idea to create the Commonwealth of Independent States, the idea which rules out the difficult option of secession. An example of this is Azerbaijan and Georgia joining the CIS. Now all republics except the Baltics are members of the Commonwealth. Constantly improving approaches in relationships within the CIS, we, I hope, as early as 1994, will be able to solve painful economic problems which cause enormous difficulties, say, for Belarus. I hope member-states will reach mutual understanding in this respect and policy-makers will put the emphasis on strategy, not on minor tactical comforts or elevating certain political groups in different countries. I believe that some aspects of economic relations run counter to the ideas and goals of the Commonwealth. Those aspects seem to have been originated by political tensions in some CIS countries. However, the situation is back to normal in most member-states, which brings hope that things will develop for the better. IF: You mean the relationships between the CIS countries and Russia, don't you? You granted an interview to INTERFAX in which you proposed creating within the CIS a bloc of republics which would work out a common policy towards Russia. Shushkevich: I am sure we must demonstrate to Russia, the country which has more weight economically and demographically than all the rest member-states together, that we have common difficultiess which we would not like to identify with Russian policies. The course pursued by certain Russian politicians is not necessarily that expected of true statesmen and thus fatal, I believe. Sometimes they make statements towards this or that CIS member which could be described as insulting to all the rest member-countries. Once we have decided to build a community and want that all its member-countries respect the Russian speakers just as Russians are respected here in Belarus, let's act adequately! Because the protest against the outbursts of some Russian politicians may grow over into an anti-Russian policy. However, I emphasize, none of the CIS republics pursues an anti-Russian policy. The principles of economic relations, first of all, in terms of Russian energy supplies, are the most important unresolved issue within the CIS framework. OPEC is a kind of community of oil-producing states. Inside the CIS, Russia plays the role of such a community because the republics are virtually unable to buy oil anywhere else. But do the OPEC countries determine different oil prices for its partners, say, France, Germany or Britain? No, they do not. Prices are the same for its own "customers". If there are any differences in prices, they are due to the unsatisfactory political conduct of individual countries. In view of this I would like to emphasize: I flatly reject any concoctions about my alleged restraint or dislike of Russia. The idea was invented by narrow-minded politicians. Fortunately, these are not leading political figures in Russia. Take all my statements and interviews. You will find in them not a single negative hint towards the country. Those who accuse me of anti-Russian sentiments are guided by petty instincts, not by commonsense. IF: What do you expect from the new year of 1994? Shushkevich: The coming year must return to us the feeling of self-dignity. If the Supreme Soviet adopted by a majority of votes a statement, according to which instead of an all-Belarus referendum on trust in parliament and government early elections were promised to be held in March 1994, the pledge must be kept and a solution to this question must be found. But so far we have been in a deadlock, which, instead of being exploited by our best forces is regrettably being taken advantage of by other elements. If something is overlooked by the constitution and legislation, people resort to action, but God forbid it comes to violence. So, the main thing for me in the new year is to hold new democratic elections. IF: A presidential election, too? Shushkevich: I am not against holding it even before parliamentary elections but only on a legitimate basis. For this reason, parliament should adopt a new election law and schedule new elections as soon as possible. IF: As is known, signatures are being raised among lawmakers in support of a vote of confidence in the Supreme Soviet's Chairman at the next session of parliament? Are you not afraid of losing the post? Shushkevich: I have never been afraid of that. Experienced in political struggle and invigorated by recent hospital treatment, I'm fully determined to counter any sinister scheme like that. IF: Some legislators predict that the issue on your resignation will be raised during parliamentary debates on the ratification of the CIS Charter, one of the major sections of which commits CIS participant-states to collective security ... Shushkevich: Not long ago, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich quite tactfully declared in the press that CIS countries did not regard Belarus as a member of the Commonwealth security system. Most signatories disagree with that republic's "special status," conditioned by a number of reservations on which Belarus would accept collective security (for one thing, reservations rule out Belarusian troops' involvement in fighting outside the republic - IF). I've kept on repeating that the collective-security system participants will never admit Belarus on special terms. So, what could happen? If in line with the reservations, endorsed by our parliament, there were an area of trouble in a neighboring country, Belarus would not send a peace-keeping force there. However, if we faced troubles, all CIS countries would, for some reason, be obliged to help us. But that's not collective security but an attempt to profit by the collective security system being formed nearby. All the hullabaloo on whether I've signed the collective security accord or not has been contrived by "a narrow circle of persons," alleging that I am against collective security at all. Nonsense. I am only against obscurantism in collective in security. I am positively against collective security attempts at others expanse. I am convinced that a state can be secured by totally new approaches to be based on the principle of neutrality, proclaimed by the Belarusian Parliament as harmless for anyone's interests. If we want to be part of the CIS collective security system, and that is only for the Supreme Soviet to decide, we should realize that our sons, in such a case, would be up for draft at any volatile spot across the Commonwealth from the Kuril islands to Brest, from Franz Joseph Land to Kushka. But since Belarus has not been involved in a single conflict in CIS, I do not realize why Belarusian men have to be involved. That's illogical. For this reason, I have always been an advocate of neutrality for Belarus. To fulfil the parliament's will, I signed a collective security treaty with the reservations determined by the national legislature. (Stanislav Shushkevich signed the original of the CIS Collective Security Treaty on December 31, 1993, "to avoid dubious interpretation" of the form of signing the accord - IF). IF: Does this mean that Belarus will stay away from peace actions of the UN and other international organizations? Do you plan to respond to the UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's request to dispatch a battalion of Belarusian troops to back up the international force deployed there to settle the Balkan conflict? Shushkevich: I've had a discussion on that with Lord Owen and other representatives of Butrus-Ghali. Although the Supreme Soviet realized how essential it was for Belarus to take part in international actions on settling armed conflicts, it felt scared even to debate the issue because of "an acute Afghan syndrome" in the republic. Belarus suffered heavy casualties during the USSR crusade in Afghanistan. There is yet another reason: The never-ending painful memories of the second world war, which claimed the life of every fourth citizen of the republic. No other CIS country lost so many lives during the war. I told Lord Owen: Give us a respite.
