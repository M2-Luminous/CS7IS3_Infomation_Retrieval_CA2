Among the three countries which Defense Minister Yi will visit, two countries--Japan and Russia--have direct influence on the security situation in the Northeast Asian region. This is relevant to President Kim Yong-sam's order that was made early this year to strengthen military exchanges with neighboring countries. In particular, this is the first time for an ROK defense minister to visit Japan. The upcoming visit to Japan has significance in that it will be an opportunity to carry out military exchanges that were restricted by past relations between the two countries. Currently, the only form of military exchange between the ROK and Japan is the exchange student program for one or two officers of each's military schools to study in the other's country. In the past, through military agreement with the United States, the ROK and Japan have maintained peace in the Northeast Asian region. Even though the two countries recognized each other's military importance because they are close geographically, in reality, military exchange between the two countries was very limited. It was learned that Japan has assumed a more active attitude in carrying out military exchange with the ROK. On several occasions in the past, Japan had promoted mutual visits of the ROK defense minister and Japan's director general of the defense agency. However, our government had not accepted it in consideration of the people's sentiment toward Japan. While in Japan, Defense Minister Yi will discuss ways to enhance military exchanges with Japan. Concrete agreement is expected to be reached on enhancing exchanges in military education to the level of the National Defense College and to increasing the exchange of maritime training students aboard naval vessels. The ROK and Japan have kept up consultations on preventing mid-air collisions of military planes. It is expected that with Defense Minister Yi's visit to Japan, the two countries will cooperate on the level of promising exchange in the form of a letter. It seems that Defense Minister Yi's visit to Germany will be an opportunity to introduce advanced German military technology with a letter of intent. Until now, Germany has been passive in military technology cooperation due to North Korea. However, it has changed its attitude since 1992. It was learned that the Defense Ministry is especially interested in introducing German aviation technology. In the final leg of his visit to three countries, Defense Minister Yi will visit Russia to revise the 1993 memorandum of understanding on military exchange which was concluded in late 1992 to the 1994 and 1995 memorandum of understanding. Its level will be somewhat enhanced also with the addition of clauses on the exchange of visits by high-ranking military officials, mutual inspection of military installations, and exchange of students. Russia is expected to once again offer to repay its economic cooperation loan with weapons exports, but since the government has not come up with a policy on this matter, it seems that it will be difficult for Defense Minister Yi to reveal whether it will import weapons from Russia. Through military exchanges with neighboring countries including Japan, China, and Russia, the Defense Ministry's strategy is to set up a plan for security on the Korean peninsula after reunification is achieved. Defense Minister Yi's upcoming overseas trip will be an opportunity to broaden the depth of understanding on the security situation with the defense ministry officials of these countries.
