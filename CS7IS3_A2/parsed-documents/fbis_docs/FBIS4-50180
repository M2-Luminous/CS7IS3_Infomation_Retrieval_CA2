According to local officials, more and more overseas investors have invested or intending to invest in research and development, consultancy services, warehousing and storaging, commerce and catering trade. The city approved the establishment of 898 foreign funded enterprises in 1993, with the total investment reaching about 2.67 billion U.S. dollars. Of the newly-registered enterprises, there are four projects whose investment exceeds 100 million U.S. dollars each and 78 projects whose investment exceeds 10 million U.S. dollars each. The confidence of overseas businessmen has been enhanced and most of them have extended the term of their investment in the city. In the past, the term of cooperation for overseas-funded enterprises is usually from 10 to 15 years, but last year the term was extended to 20-50 years. Fuzhou's economic and technological development zone, free trade zone, overseas-Chinese economic development zone, Fuxing Investment District and high-technology parks have become the major bases for overseas investment. Now overseas-funded enterprises have become pillar enterprises in the textile and garment, shoe-making, motorcycle and foodstuff trades in Fuzhou City.
