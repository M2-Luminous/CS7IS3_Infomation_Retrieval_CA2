This was announced here by Andrey Kozyrev and Alain Juppe after they had held an hour and a half of talks. The opportunity for real cooperation is now better than ever before, the Russian minister told journalists. It is now extremely important to take this opportunity. The contact group which the four have set up to prepare a full report on the situation as regarding a Bosnian settlement could now be given one week rather than two. This would "avoid missing the chance for positive development" and make it possible to move on to ministerial talks on preparation of a summit meeting. Speaking after his Russian counterpart, Juppe recalled that France supports the idea of a "summit" on Bosnia. He said that agreement could be reached quite quickly on the venue and date for the ministerial discussions. It is important that the contact group work correspondingly fast, he said.
