"As soon as the government gives the order, we will start the withdrawal," a military spokesman told AFP, but he refused to go into detail. "We are wound up and ready to go into action," one senior officer told Friday's [11 February] YEDI'OT AHARANOT newspaper. Military officials said planning is complete for the operation which will see troops pulled out of Jericho and redeployed in Gaza. Army bases will be dismantled and moved from built-up areas on the strip where Israeli forces will remain to protect the 4,000 Jewish settlers. Chief of Staff General Ehud Baraq has already appointed the appropriately named General Hagai Shalom, a logistics specialist, to carry out Operation Rainbow. The Army has asked the government for another 100 million dollars on top of 83 million already allocated for the withdrawal. More than 50 million dollars is being spent to build a 60-kilometre (36-mile) fence around the Gaza Strip. A seven kilometre stretch has already been completed. The fence, the same as one put up along the border between Israel and Lebanon, is intended to prevent infiltrations. The system includes electronic gates and continuous patrols. Southern region command will oversee the operation on the Gaza Strip and the Central Region Command will take care of Jericho. As soon as the orders are received, Army bulldozers and trucks will move to take down the razor fences, the watchtowers, observation posts, water and fuel storage facilities and so on which clutter the landscape of the occupied territories. All the equipment removed will be stored in temporary camps while new installations are built. Soldiers from combat units will have to sleep in tents until new barracks are constructed. Water pipes, drains and electrical systems will be destroyed. Palestinians have watched with great pleasure the first moves with the Army quitting several posts in Gaza in recent weeks and the departure of the hated occupier from the refugee camps is expected to produce an outpouring of emotion. According to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres Israel will strive to pull troops out without further delay, "We are not committed to the April 13 deadline," Peres said referring to the target date for Israel to complete the withdrawal under the September 13 agreement. "However I think we will all make a real effort to reduce the delay because our people also wants to be convinced that the agreement is workable." The start of the pullout, scheduled for December 13 under the agreement, has been held up by disputes centered on the security aspects of autonomy. Israel and the PLO settled most of the differences in Cairo on Wednesday night, although Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is insisting all outstanding issues on autonomy, including economic, be resolved before the withdrawal begins. Rabin said he expected that to take at least another month while senior Army officers said it would take only one month for the withdrawal to be completed.
