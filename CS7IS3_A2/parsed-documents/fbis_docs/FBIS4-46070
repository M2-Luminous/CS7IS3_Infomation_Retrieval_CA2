They are trying to drive the situation to an extreme circumstance [kuktanui sanghwang] by saying that the nuclear issue has entered a grave stage, that the replacement of our fuel rods is a grave violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and the safeguards accord, that our issue must be brought to the UN Security Council and sanctions implemented, and so on because we started to replace the fuel rods. This is a violent distortion of the facts, and tells us that the United States and its following forces are persistently maneuvering to crush [apsal] our Republic. The issue of replacing the fuel rods at our five-megawatt experimental nuclear power plant, is a natural consequence resulting from the rupture of the DPRK-U.S. talks by the United States. In reality, up until now the United States had used the DPRK-U.S. talks as a lever to realize its selfish goal by strengthening its pressure on us. The United States created a nuclear crisis and increased pressure on us inside and outside the talks. Also, under the cloak of modernizing the U.S. forces stationed in South Korea, it shoved in numerous military equipment into South Korea, including the Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters, for offensive use and obtained enormous economic interests, and strengthened its military presence in South Korea, which is a strategic point of Asia. On the other hand, we are receiving a grave military threat from the United States. The third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks was disrupted. The DPRK-U.S. agreement on changing the graphite-moderated reactor system to light-water moderated reactor system have a long way to go due to the betrayal act of the United States. Under this circumstance, we could no longer indefinitely freeze the operation of the graphite-moderated reactor system even by suffering an enormous economic loss. Therefore, it was inevitable for us to move toward the road of normalizing our peaceful nuclear activities. No one can pick a quarrel with the issue of replacing the fuel rods at our five-megawatt experimental nuclear power plant, even from the technology safety point of view. The fuel rods in the five-megawatt experimental nuclear power plant were (?placed) in 1986. Since, we have delayed the replacement of the fuel rods until now to provide a favorable environment for the DPRK-U.S. talks. Today, a considerable number of fuel rods have been damaged. In particular, due to the damage of the ventilator, a situation was created in which we had to stop the operation of the experimental atomic reactor [sihom wonjaro]. As a result, a serious safety issue was put forth in the operation of the experimental atomic reactor, and thus it became inevitable to take out the fuel rods immediately. Out of such urgency, we sent as many as five telex messages to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] regarding the replacement of fuel rods. In the telex messages, we called on the IAEA to take necessary measures regarding this--such as being present at the scene to seal and dismantle [haechae] them--while informing in advance our plan on replacing the fuel rods. In addition, we explicitly clarified that in the event the IAEA Secretariat did not take appropriate measures at the right time, we would be compelled to recognize this as an action that the IAEA has empowered us with the authority to break the seals at appropriate (?spots) [kuromyonso kigusogigugi haedanghan taechaegul chaettae chwihaji annungyongu haedang (?kaesoaeso) ponginul ttel kwonhanul uriege puyohangosuro injonghalsubakke optanungosul myongbaekhihayotta]. What is more, we agreed to all the IAEA's demands on the witnessing activities, except selective measurement of fuel rods because it is against our unique stance, and immediately issued visas upon request. However, the IAEA Secretariat unreasonably came out with demands tantamount to irregular inspections [pijonggi sacharae manmongnun yogurul murihagae tulgonawatsumyo] by babbling about selective preservation of fuel rods and, thus, rejected the witnessing, openly ignoring our unique status following the temporary suspension of the effectuation of the withdrawal from the NPT. Under such circumstance, we, as means of last concession, sent an emergency letter to the U.S. side writing that if our unique stance was settled [haesodoemyon] now by bringing the package deal between the DPRK and the United States to a success, we could allow all regular and irregular [chonggimitpijonggi] inspections -- including selective preservation of some fuel -- even during the course of replacing the fuel rods. Nonetheless, the United States also rejected this proposal and did not respond to the talks with the DPRK. Under such conditions, we could no longer delay the changing of fuel rods due to technical safety reasons [kisul anjongsang iyuro]. In view of this, the beginning of our work on replacing fuel rods without the presence of the IAEA Secretariat's inspectors was an unavoidable step entirely stemmed from the IAEA's unreasonable acts. Such being the case, there is no grounds for the United States and the IAEA Secretariat to say so and so about our replacement of fuel rods. Before picking on us, the IAEA Secretariat should reflect on its acts in avoiding its obligation to guarantee the normal nuclear activities of a member nation. It is an unbreakable mission of the IAEA to go to the spot for confirmation and to take necessary measures when an abnormal situation crops up in a member nation. Although we requested the agency to immediately take appropriate measures, including a quick removal of the seals under unavoidable circumstances, the IAEA Secretariat avoided to be present in the replacement of the fuel rods for the reason that we refused to meet their unilateral demand of being allowed to choose and keep some of the replaced fuel rods. And it is now raising quite a row, informing the member nations of the agency's Board of Governors and the UN Security Council that we unsealed the facilities and violated the NPT. This is obviously a mean, conscienceless act unbecoming to an international organization. The U.S. action is also the same. If the United States had responded to the DPRK-U.S. talks and brought a package deal to a success as demanded by us, such complicated problems existing now would have not even been raised from the beginning. Nevertheless, the United States avoided the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks, ignoring problems put forth by us and continuously persisting in unreasonable preconditions. Therefore, for the United States to make an issue of the replacement of our fuel rods now is the same as a thief turning on the master with a club. In particular, some officials in the United States are currently stirring up the public opinion as if we were replacing the fuel rods to extract plutonium to produce four to five nuclear bombs. This is truly preposterous. Unavoidably, we started the replacement of the fuel rods without the presence of the IAEA, but we are working our best to verify that the nuclear materials are not being diverted for other non-peaceful purposes in the process of replacing the fuel rods because of the consistent will to prove the innocence of the peaceful nuclear activities. The IAEA can never be allowed to choose and keep the fuel rods before our special status is brought to an end. However, this does not mean that the continuity of the safeguards would be broken. The work of replacing our fuel rods is now going on under the strict observation of the inspection cameras installed by the IAEA and as soon as the fuel rods are taken out, they are kept under the restriction and surveillance of the IAEA. We are carrying out the work on replacing fuel rods in such a manner as to fully preserve the possibilities of measuring all the replaced fuel rods when the nuclear issue is resolved in a package deal and the partiality of the agency removed [urinun appro haengmunjeui ilgwaltagyoli silhyondoego kiguui pulgongjongsongi haesodoenun sichomegaso kyochedoen modunyollyobongduladaehan chukchong kanungsongul chungbunuhui pojonhanun panghyangeso nosimyollyojagobul chinhaenghagoitta]. This matter can be solved through negotiations between the DPRK and the IAEA. Nonetheless, some forces inside the United States are trying to forcibly [okchiro] link our fuel rod replacement work with nuclear development. This can only be seen as a childish plot [yuchihan sulchaek] designed to find a justification to impose sanctions on us by deliberately aggravating the situation. At present, the attempt to justify its unreasonable argument with any wild guess or assumption can never get through. The nuclear issue should also seek a fair solution on the basis of the reality, squarely seeing the reality. The United States and the IAEA Secretariat must no longer make mistakes in the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but take a proper position for honestly solving the issue.
