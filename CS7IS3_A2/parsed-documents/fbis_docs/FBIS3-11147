[Begin recording] [Lacayo] We believe the visit was very beneficial, productive, and good for Nicaraguans. Mr. Watson clearly expressed the Clinton administration's policy on Nicaragua in his speech at noon yesterday. He also reaffirmed what Ambassador Maisto said here in September. Watson said problems in Nicaragua should be resolved by Nicaraguans for Nicaragua. This is indeed a great advancement, because previous U.S. administrations had another way of looking at things. He also said this administration should end its constitutional presidential term normally and turn the government over to the duly elected president in the same way that [words indistinct] elected. He thus expressed total support for the democratic principles, the institutionalization of the electoral process, as well as his clear support for the government of Violeta de Chamorro, prompting it to continue its path toward peace, democracy, and the improvement of our economy. We are very happy with Watson's visit and believe he was also quite satisfied with the talks he held with several sectors. I think the visit has improved relations between Nicaragua and the United States and has committed the Clinton administration to supporting the work done by Nicaraguans. [Unidentified reporter] [Question indistinct] [Lacayo] We, through our foreign minister, have already expressed the government's point of view on the human rights report. We believe the report is outdated and does not reflect the real situation in Nicaragua. It is written in very obscure language and does not reflect the efforts made by the government and all Nicaraguans to live in peace. The people who wrote the report were not objective. We stated our position more than a month ago when the report first came out, and I reiterate it on this occasion. We also understand that other sectors in the country commented on the report to Watson. [end recording] Engineer Lacayo also touched on the topic of the massive evictions and said such issues are basically handled by the judicial branch. [Begin Lacayo recording] It is a matter that concerns the judicial branch exclusively. The judges are responsible for such issues. The National Police force, in accordance with the law, responds to a judge's call when he requests the support of the police. We are, however, very concerned because we have seen a [words indistinct] and it could be that judges have acted illegally in certain cases. That is very dangerous. We have already contacted the Supreme Court [words indistinct] to express our concern and [words indistinct] that all the judges are acting in accordance with the law. [end recording]
