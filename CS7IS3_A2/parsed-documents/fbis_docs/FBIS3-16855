Answering questions from journalists about whether there was discussion at their meeting of the problems regarding steps Moscow might take in regard to Pyongyang, which is suspected of developing nuclear weapons, the Russian minister said: "We shall firmly insist upon fulfilment of all necessary obligations and procedures." The forms in which this issue might be settled, he pointed out, are now being discussed at bilateral negotiations and the relevant consultations are under way, including through IAEA channels. "I think we shall be acting with Japan very closely, as well as with other partners," Andrey Kozyrev stressed.
