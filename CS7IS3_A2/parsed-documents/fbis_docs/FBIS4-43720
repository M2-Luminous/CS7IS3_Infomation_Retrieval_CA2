A total of 123 Mox fuel elements consisting of uranium and plutonium, which the electrical company in Essen once produced for Kalkar, are to be brought to Beloyarsk. Nikolay Oshankov, chief engineer of the fast breeder in Beloyarsk in southern Russia, told this Greenpeace environmentalists. "This was not our initiative, it came from the German experts." Negotiations are under way with the responsible RWE subsidiary Fast Breeder Nuclear Power Plant Company (SBK) and with Siemens. An RWE spokesman confirmed the contacts: "However, the talks are not in a decisive stage." There are also contacts with the operators of the Japanese breeder reactor in Monju. In addition, the reprocessing and direct final storage of the fuel elements is also being considered. At the moment, the fuel elements, which contain 1.2 tonnes of plutonium, are still stored in the so-called federal bunker in Hanau. When it became clear in 1991 that the breeder reactor in Kalkar would never be put into operation, the RWE subsidiary SBK (RWE share 67 percent) first tried to bring the fuel elements, which contain 40 percent of plutonium, to Dounreay in Scotland. Breeder fuel elements made in Belgium had already been flown to the Scottish nuclear plant in 1991. According to Greenpeace information, the SBK even rented storage room in Dounreay for 1.2 million German marks. But then more and more obstacles emerged for the transport to Scotland. Despite existing permits by the Federal Government, considerable resistance against transporting the plutonium by plane developed. The Hesse government did not want to tolerate a flight with 1.2 tonnes of the fiendish stuff aboard from Frankfurt/Main Airport. And local and land politicians responsible for Pferdsfeld, the airport in Rhineland-Palatinate, which should have been used instead, also reacted negatively. Second, the fuel elements in the federal bunker in Hanau had been radioactively contaminated during a nuclear accident at Siemens, which is located in the same building. At first, the fuel elements were not permitted to be transported in this contaminated state. However, one could not clean them, either, because the facility at Siemens has been out of operation since the 1991 accident. Now they are supposed to be sent to Beloyarsk. The operators of the fast breeder there are pleased. Chief Engineer Oshankov told Greenpeace: "The German side supplies us with the fuel elements, and we use them in our reactor. And with our technology we would finally process the used fuel elements further." The reprocessing is to be done in the ailing nuclear factory of Mayak near Chelyabinsk in the southern Urals. Oshankov also affirms that the contracts have not yet been concluded. The responsibility for potential accidents has not yet been clarified. In addition, a bit of reconstruction has to be done in Beloyarsk for the German fuel elements. It is unclear who is going to pay for the reconstruction. "If we reprocessed the German fuel elements, we would no longer need the reconstructed facility afterwards," Oshankov says. Yesterday Greenpeace said the planned transfer of the plutonium is completely irresponsible. Fire broke out in the 14-year-old BN-600 breeder reactor in Beloyarsk in October and May because of leaks in the cooling system. Each time radioactivity was released. And plutonium for the Soviet/Russian nuclear weapons program was produced in Mayak until 1992. In 1957 a nuclear waste container exploded in the plant. Thousands of square kilometers of land and several hundreds of thousands of people were contaminated with radioactive elements.
