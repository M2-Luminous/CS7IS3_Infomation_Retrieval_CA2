Given that such words come from a distant island, one can imagine what the Albanians have to say about their ancient neighbor -- a neighbor who historically has only thought about how to tear his neighbor to pieces! Lately, particularly now, the Hellenic nature has become more cruel and is being manifested to its full extent. It has been proclaimed on the pages of newspapers and at mass rallies, from congress rostrums and in diplomatic corridors, at paramilitary commando camps and at holy altars. In all these places the Hellenic nature shrieks. The term "Greek chauvinist circles" is by now outdated. The term "certain circles" is also lackluster. The madness of the senile Sebastiano [ethnic Greek head of the Albanian Orthodox church] can no longer be called simply madness. The anti-Albanian activities of the criminal Omonia organization, the killing of Albanians while they sleep in the night or by a stab in the back; the maltreatment of the Albanian refugees -- all these and other reported or unreported things show that the efforts to Hellenize Albania have become Greek state policy. Hundreds of anti-Albanian bulletins, books, maps, and calendars are being published. Dozens of mass protest rallies are being staged to call for the liberation of Vorio-Epirus. All these things are taking place in Greece, but the Greek Government claims to know nothing about them. The holy Greek state denies any responsibility for the paramilitary groups who cross the border to kill Albanians at night (as if they were not soldiers, but a cloud of rain passing from Greece into Albania). The Greek state knows nothing and disclaims any responsibility for what is going on and what is being engineered in Greece against Albania and the Albanians. However, does the Greek state know what the 50,000 pampered Albanian Greeks are doing in Albania? Or what the Omonia people and the men of God, the priests, are doing? Even these things are not known to the Greek state. It happens perhaps because governing the European Community has given great problems and concerns to the Greek state! Let us then remind the very busy Greek state that a good part of the Greek minority in Albania, who are coddled by the Albanian state and people, illegally distribute their books, bulletins, appeals, and calendars, all calling for Vorio-Epirus to be liberated. Let the Greek statesmen know that Omonia is a criminal organization that pursues anticonstitutional and anti-Albanian activities! Let them learn that the angels of the Orthodox church in Albania want it to be a solely Greek Church! All these things must be taught to the Greek statesmen. They must be taught, although they are already aware of such things. First and foremost they must be taught that the 40-50,000 Greek immigrants who came to Albania to earn a crust of bread can never Hellenize this country. "When you shake hands with a Greek, count your fingers afterward," as the English say.
