The adopted statement says that the media, spurred on by the Black Sea Fleet press center, are spreading slander about the so-called "Odessa incident." Facts show that the Black Sea Fleet command is constantly involving the officers and personnel of the fleet in various political actions and encouraging their active participation in anti-Ukrainian political parties and movements. The meeting pointed out that Black Sea Fleet Commander Eduard Baltin is continuing to grossly violate the laws of Ukraine, and appealed to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia for his dismissal. They also urged everybody who valued peace to resist provocations by destructive forces.
