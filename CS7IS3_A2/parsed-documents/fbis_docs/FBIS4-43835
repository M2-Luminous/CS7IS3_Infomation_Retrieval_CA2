But as we know, reaching the final decision on the Oresund project was not without its cost for the Swedish Government. The Swedish yes gave the real starting signal for the marketing of the whole of the Oresund region. And there should now be room for a more visionary debate on priorities and the exploitation of the many possibilities that the fixed link across the Oresund brings with it. Even though there were probably very few people who could imagine the Swedes running away from a crystal-clear agreement, it is at least a fact that words like "water throughflow" and "water rights court" have surfaced more frequently than concepts such as growth and vision when the Oresund link has been discussed recently. Of course it has been both necessary and important to guarantee a zero solution out of respect for the environment. The debate on the environment has also been extremely useful, even though it has at times been excessively technical. But at present what is important is to look forward. With the fixed link, Malmo-Lund will be linked to Denmark's capital city region in one continuous Oresund region, and this will make it possible to take up the struggle with Europe's other big cities. Integration and growth will not of course follow automatically on the fixed link, but the necessary preconditions will be in place. The project is first and foremost an investment in a piece of infrastructure that will make transport time between Malmo and Copenhagen almost insignificant. When the fixed link is finished around the turn of the century it will be both quick and cheap to get from one side of the sound to the other, especially if you travel by train. Precisely because the Oresund link represents a conscious investment in public transportation in the Oresund region, it will be much cheaper to chose the most environmentally friendly way to cross the sound -- namely, taking the train. The Oresund link will on the whole create a number of traffic improvements in and around the capital with particular emphasis on the public transportation sector. Thus the Oresund link is a conscious investment in Copenhagen and the capital region. In the first instance the actual work of construction will create hundreds of jobs in and around Copenhagen. But it is of course more important that in the longer term the Oresund link will hopefully also be able to give Copenhagen a much needed boost. I am convinced that it will be possible for Copenhagen to exploit the combination of good infrastructure and well-sited industrial development areas -- not least Orestaden -- to set in motion in earnest competitive urban development. A number of initiatives linked to the Oresund link -- chiefly the Orestad Company, the Oresund Committee, and Copenhagen Capacity -- have already been launched. Now that the final decision about the link has been made, the various initiatives should be translated into action as soon as possible, so that from the start the capital will be able to exploit and fill the role of the Oresund region as the growth-dominated center in northern Europe. Remember that the Oresund region is a region characterized by economic prosperity, a well-educated labor force, a high level of public services, and a clean urban environment. Further, the region is centrally placed between Scandinavia and the Continent and between western and eastern Europe -- something that is underlined by the fixed link. In a large number of fields it will therefore be natural to exploit the possibilities that a united Oresund region brings with it. Two obvious examples that can be mentioned are the education and research sector and the transportation sector. In the region there are universities and institutes of higher education with places for over 100,000 students. The new transportation possibilities will make it possible for the students to choose the best teaching from a long list of educational establishments, and it will also be possible to make more effective use of research and education establishments on both sides of the sound. In the transportation and distribution sector Denmark already belongs to the super league, but with a fixed link with Sweden the Danish transportation sector will have yet another strong card in its hand in the tough competition in Europe. In particular Kastrup airport will of course acquire a better position in the competition with other European airports. Both because the potential passenger catchment area will expand dramatically, and because with the construction of a railroad station in the airport a new and very smooth link with the public transportation system will be created. As a Dane I think that there is good reason to be happy that with Sweden's final yes a very important step has been taken along the road toward creating a united and dynamic Oresund region. It is of importance to all of Denmark that with the Oresund link we will be creating some of the most fundamental preconditions for increased growth in the capital. For regardless of whether you live in Hobro, Ronne, or Glostrup the same rules apply: Investments in and around Copenhagen benefit the whole of Danish society more than investments made in Hamburg.
