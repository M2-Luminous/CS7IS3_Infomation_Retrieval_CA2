[6 February] -- Kadazans can choose from many other capable leaders who are honest, hardworking, and who care for the people to lead them, Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said today. He said the people of Sabah, particularly the Kadazan/Dusun community, should not sacrifice their well-being by supporting Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party -- PBS] President Datuk Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan's aspiration to continue as the chief minister. [passage omitted] Dr. Mahathir said as Sabah was lagging behind in development, the people now had the opportunity to be on par with their counterparts in other states by giving the mandate to the BN in the coming elections. He said a Barisan government would be fair to all races. "When the BN makes promises, they will be delivered," he said to the applause of the large crowd. Dr. Mahathir said Barisan had nothing against the PBS but could not get along with its leaders, particularly Pairin, who had proven himself to be insincere. He said that during the 1990 general election, Pairin played out the BN by pulling out of the coalition a few days before polling. "Pairin now wants to return to the BN, but how can we trust him?" He urged the voters not to be duped by the PBS' tactics of confusing the people that UMNO [United Malays National Organization] was trying to grab power in the state. [passage omitted]
