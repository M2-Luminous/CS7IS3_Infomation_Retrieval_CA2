As a result, operational and intelligence services by this specialized unit in its fight against the Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) have decreased considerably. Various sources consulted have asserted that, compared with previous years, the budget has been reduced 30 to 40 percent. It also has been reported that the number of trips to the provinces usually taken by Dincote members have been reduced to only extremely necessary ones, like when the presence of 2d Counterterrorism Intelligence Division (Divicote-2) personnel was requested in Trujillo. This operation ended with the arrest of six important MRTA leaders. Aside from this, no trips have been taken to the interior. Until 1993, personnel from different Divicotes and even the so-called "Delta" Group frequently traveled to the interior. Their trips yielded good results and several members of regional MRTA directorates, who also belonged to the MRTA national board, were arrested. Budget cutbacks are also affecting the serious and patient intelligence work (basic pursuits) by Dincote detectives. They said: "Now the chiefs are recommending we do not spend more than the indispensable expenses. Nonetheless, if we do not risk some expenses, we will not be able to succeed. If we had followed orders, we would not have arrested Abimael Guzman and his leaders. Sometimes we have to grope in the dark until we are able to obtain important information." It also has been reported that, so far, almost 30 high-ranking officials have been appointed to the National Intelligence Service (SIN), including those comprising Divicote-1 or the Special Intelligence Groups (GEIN) that captured Abimael Guzman. They have explained that only now, with the presence of these specialized detectives, is SIN really conducting intelligence work and supplying appropriate information to the operational units that conduct the required raids.
