The task of the committee will be to: 1. Report on the background and reasons for the establishment of the trust through legislation; 2. Examine and report on the implications of the act, inter alia including the security of tenure of the residents in the prescribed area, the functioning of the Land Claims Court in the area should any historical land disputes arise and its possible impact on a future land reform programme; and 3. Make recommendations to Cabinet after such investigation on the position of the trust, with primary consideration of the interests of dispossessed African people, and the security of tenure of rural communities. Cabinet approached the discussion with a view to reaching a consensus that will contribute to the process of nation-building and reconciliation. All parties represented in Cabinet reaffirmed their commitment to such an approach. The committee has been charged to prepare a report for the Cabinet as soon as possible.
