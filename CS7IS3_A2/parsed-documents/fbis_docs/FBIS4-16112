Tupp attached great importance to the adoption of the law on service in the defense forces. He said it's a good law, but that now several lower-level legal acts need to be passed. The law on peacetime national defense is waiting to be adopted and in May the government will probably pass to the parliament a bill on national defense in wartime, the Defense Ministry official noted. He added that legislation on compulsory duties in wartime, military career, and military police must be adopted. Under defense policy, a national defense doctrine must be worked out and the share of defense expenditures in the budget established, Tupp told reporters.
