Party President Vojislav Kostunica spoke about the work of the Serbian Government in the last three months and the peace negotiations on the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Katarina Andric-Milosavljevic reports: [Andric-Milosavljevic] The Democratic Party of Serbia holds the view that the public has been presented a distorted picture on the work of the Serbian Government in the past 100 days. The assessments presented by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic yesterday differ from those that had been heard in the Serbian Assembly in the past few months, Kostunica said. While the president and the prime minister spoke about very successful work of the Serbian Government, the Serbian Assembly often has long debates and often hears certain politicians' sharp criticisms regarding the lack of efficiency in the implementation of the Serbian Government's measures, Vojislav Kostunica said. The Democratic Party of Serbia takes the view that offered solution for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to which the Muslims would get 51 and the Serbs 49 percent of the territory, conceals many shortcomings for the Serbs. This stems from the fact that before the war the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina owned over 60 percent of territory and were in an absolute majority, territorially and population wise. The new division, giving a slight advantage to the Muslim side, appears to be an attempt to make an entity whose advantage would be extended in the future to numerous institutions that will serve the Muslim and Croatian sides. Despite this, the Serbs must insist on the continuation of the peace negotiations in order to obtain a more favorable solution, officials of the Democratic Party of Serbia say.
