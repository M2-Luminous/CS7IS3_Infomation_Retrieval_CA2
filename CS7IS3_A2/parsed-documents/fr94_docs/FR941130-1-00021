FR941130-1-00021 FR941130-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;153&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747&hyph;300 and &hyph;400 Series Airplanes Equipped With BFGoodrich Stretched Upper Deck Evacuation Slides, Part Number 7A1323&hyph;(␣) AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Boeing Model 747&hyph;300 and &hyph;400 series airplanes equipped with certain stretched upper deck evacuation slides manufactured by BFGoodrich. This proposal would require modification of the slide's main restraint strap, regulator assembly, and turbo fan flapper retaining roll pins. This proposal is prompted by reports of loss of air pressure and non-inflation of the inflatable tubes of the slide due to problems associated with the restraint strap, regulator assembly, and turbo fan flapper retaining roll pins. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of air pressure or non-inflation of the inflatable tubes of the slide, which could impede the successful evacuation of passengers from the airplane during an emergency. DATES: Comments must be received by January 26, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;153&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from BFGoodrich Company, Aircraft Evacuation Systems, Dept. 7916, Phoenix , Arizona 85040. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, Transport Airplane Directorate, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;153&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;153&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion The FAA has received reports of various problems involving BFGoodrich stretched upper deck evacuation slides, part number (P/N) 7A1323&hyph;(␣), installed on Boeing Model 747&hyph;300 and &hyph;400 series airplanes: There have been several incidents in which the main restraint strap of the slide was ingested into one of the turbo fans. This resulted in damage to the turbo fan and loss of air pressure in one tube of the slide. There have been two occurrences of the inflation system regulator shutting down due to internal pressure differentials. These incidents resulted in non-inflation of one inflatable tube of the slide. There has been a report that, during deployment of the slide, the turbo fan flapper retaining roll pin broke, allowing the flapper to fall out. This resulted in the loss of air pressure in the inflation tube. The cause of the broken pin was determined to be the particular heat treatment used during manufacture of a certain lot of roll pins. Loss of air pressure or non-inflation of the inflation tubes of an evacuation slide, if not corrected, could impede the successful evacuation of passengers from the airplane during an emergency. The FAA has reviewed and approved BFGoodrich Service Bulletin 7A1323&hyph;25&hyph;266, Revision 1, dated September 30, 1994, which describes procedures for the following modifications:
