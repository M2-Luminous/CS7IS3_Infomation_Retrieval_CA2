The kuna, which is the national currency of neighbouring Croatia, will replace the Croatian dinar, which has so far been in circulation in Herceg-Bosnia too. Despite strong protests, the government in Zagreb has decided to reintroduce the kuna, the national currency of the Nazi puppet independent state of Croatia which existed during World War Two. The opponents of the Croatian Government's decision argue the kuna will only link Croatia with its infamous Nazi past. The Moslem government in Sarajevo has still not reacted to Herceg-Bosnia's move. After almost a year of fierce battles, Bosnian Moslems and Croats in mid-March yielded to U.S. pressure and signed a federation agreement. The constitution of their binational state in Bosnia, which should subsequently form a confederation with neighbouring Croatia, envisages a single federal currency.
