The decision points out: The implementation of a revenue-sharing system is a major decision of the party Central Committee and the State Council and is an important element of economic structural reform. The decision demands: Following the implementation a revenue- sharing system, first, it is necessary to strengthen graded budgetary management, and an additional expenditure should be borne by the relevant administrative level. The regional government will not bear expenditures which should be borne by a prefecture, city, or county, or vice versa. Second, it is necessary to strengthen management over administrative spending, to improve control over administrative expenditures, to exercise strict management over expenditure limits, and to encourage departments with the necessary conditions to increase their income. Third, it is necessary to strengthen management over the collections of administrative charges and to put them under budgetary management so as to prevent the loss of revenue. Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen management over extrabudgetary funds. The administrative departments' budgetary and extrabudgetary revenue should be put in a uniform revenue and expenditure plan. Fifth, it is necessary to forge a balance between revenue and expenditures. Under the revenue-sharing system, prefectures and cities should work out their budgets in such a way that a balance between revenue and expenditures can be maintained with some surpluses. The regional financial department is not responsible for making up prefectures' or cities' deficits; in such cases, the prefectures and cities should make efforts to resolve them. The decision stresses: The implementation of the revenue-sharing system is a major step in financial reform. All prefectural administrative offices and city governments should strengthen their leadership to ensure its smooth implementation.
