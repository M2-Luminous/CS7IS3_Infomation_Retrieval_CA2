Yeltsin is to apply to the Federal Assembly and initiate a bill on a new phase of cheque privatisation which will meet both the interests of the country and those of regions and large cities. This step by the president, in the opinion of the press secretary, develops and furthers the privatisation ideology worked out by the State Property Committee, and clearly differentates between federal, municipal and private property. Thus, the very dispute about privatisation methods at various levels will be politically settled. Tackling this problem, the president proceeds from the assumption that under privatisation conditions, it is federal property interests first of all that must be upheld. No personnel reshuffles at the State Property Committee are expected. So, Anatoliy Chubays and Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov will have nothing to argue about any longer, Kostikov said.
