The guiding principle governing the amendment of the CPPCC Constitution is to highlight the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, basic policies for China's current primary stage of socialism, and the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The amended constitution contains some important additions, which include: "the Constitution (of China) stipulates: the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system under the CPC leadership will exist and develop for a long time to come" and "the CPPCC is an important body for multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the CPC leadership." The second addition above has been incorporated into an amendment to China's Constitution adopted by the National People's Congress last year. The amended CPPCC Constitution also provides for major duties and functions of CPPCC organizations, as well as the forms and procedures of political consultation and supervision. The amendment says that the CPPCC's main functions are to engage in political consultation and exercise democratic supervision, and organize participating parties, people's organizations and persons of various nationalities and from all walks of life to participate in running and discussing state affairs. Political consultation means holding consultations on state and local policies and principles, as well as on major issues in political, economic, cultural and social life, before relevant policy decisions are made and in the course of implementing such decisions. In line with proposals by the CPC, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, governments, democratic parties and people's organizations, the CPPCC National Committee and local committees may hold meetings for such consultations to be attended by leaders of various parties and people's organizations, as well as people from all nationalities and social sectors. Democratic supervision means the exercise of supervision, by making proposals and criticisms, over the implementation of China's Constitution, laws, regulations, and major policies and principles, as well as the work of government departments and workers. The amended constitution also adds stipulations on the rights and obligations of CPPCC organizations and members. It notes that CPPCC participating units and individuals have the right to expose and investigate acts violating laws and disciplines, and may, through proposals and other forms, make proposals to and criticisms of government departments and other relevant organizations. Added to the amended CPPCC Constitution is also the phrase "Hong Kong and Macao compatriots should be encouraged to contribute to the maintenance of prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao" and to the development and reunification of the motherland. The amended CPPCC Constitution comes into force as of today.
