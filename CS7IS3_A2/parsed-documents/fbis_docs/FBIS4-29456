Thus for the first time, he expressed his belief that North Korea neither possesses nuclear arms nor has intentions to produce them. Also saying, "It may be that they do not want to appear intimidated into doing something," Hata suggested a view that the reason why North Korea is adamantly rejecting complete nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is because of pressure from the international community. As for suspicions regarding North Korea's nuclear development, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry in a news conference recently said "it is possible that they have one or two nuclear weapons." The Japanese Government has also decided to discuss sanctions through the UN Security Council in cooperation with the United States, declaring "there is strong suspicion that North Korea is in the process of developing nuclear arms" (according to Foreign Ministry sources). The basis for the prime minister denying North Korea's possession of nuclear arms as well as its intent to develop them is not clear, but it is possible that his remark will have subtle impact on the direction of the system of Japan-U.S.-ROK cooperation and on future discussions of sanctions.
