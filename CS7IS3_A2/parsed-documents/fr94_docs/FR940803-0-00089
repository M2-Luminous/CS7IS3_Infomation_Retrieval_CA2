FR940803-0-00089 FR940803-0-00032 43 CFR Public Land Order 7073 [MT&hyph;930&hyph;4210&hyph;06; MTM 41943] Partial Revocation of Secretarial Order Dated September 4, 1908; Montana AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Public Land Order. SUMMARY: This order partially revokes a Secretarial order insofar as it affects a .487 acre parcel of National Forest System land withdrawn for use as the Beardance Administrative Site. The land is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was withdrawn. The revocation is needed to accommodate a land interchange (disposal through exchange) under the Small Tracts Act of January 12, 1983, 16 U.S.C. 521(c)&hyph;521(i) (1988). This action will open the land to such forms of disposition as may by law be made of National Forest System land, including location and entry under the United States mining laws. The land has been and remains open to mineral leasing. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sandra Ward, BLM Montana State Office, P.O. Box 36800, Billings, Montana 59107, 406&hyph;255&hyph;2949. By virtue of the authority vested in the Secretary of the Interior by Section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1714 (1988), it is ordered as follows: 1. Secretarial Order dated September 4, 1908, which withdrew National Forest System land for the Beardance Administrative Site, is hereby revoked insofar as it affects the following described land: Principal Meridian, Montana Flathead National Forest T. 25 N., R. 19 W., Sec. 5, portion of lot 3. The area described contains .487 acre in Lake County. 2. At 9 a.m. on September 2, 1994, the land shall be opened to such forms of disposition as may by law be made of National Forest System land, including location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of record, and the requirements of applicable law. Appropriation of any land described in this order under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988), shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts. Dated: July 18, 1994. Bob Armstrong, Assistant Secretary of the Interior. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18808 Filed 8&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;DN&hyph;P
