Chapter III -- The Jurisdiction, Filing, and Handling of Cases Involving Violations of the Land Law Article 13. Cases involving violations of the land law refer to those that violate the land administration laws, rules, and regulations, the legal responsibility for which should be investigated and determined according to the law. Article 14. The provincial land administration department is responsible for the province's land supervision work, and it administers the following cases in this administrative area: 1. Cases involving violations of the land law which go beyond city or county administrative area; 2. Cases involving violations of the land law which happen in this administrative area and have a major impact; 3. Cases involving violations of the land law which are commissioned by the provincial people's government or the State Land Administration Bureau. Article 15.

Article 16. Township (town) people's governments are responsible for handling illegal occupations of land by residents in their administrative areas. Article 17. A higher-level land administration department has the right to handle cases involving violations of the land law which come under the jurisdiction of a lower-level land administration department. It also can turn over to a lower-level land administrative department any cases involving violations of the land law which come under its jurisdiction so that these cases can be handled. If a lower-level land administration department holds that a case under its jurisdiction involves violations of the land law which are so serious that the case should be administered by a higher-level land administration department, it may submit the case to a higher- level land administration department for handling. Article 18. In accepting and hearing a case, it is necessary to fill in an "Application To Put on Record a Case Involving Violations of the Land Law." On approval, the case will be put on file for investigation and prosecution. Conditions for accepting and hearing a case: 1. Have a definite actor; 2. Have facts on violations of the land administration laws, rules, and regulations; 3. A case that should be investigated and the responsibility determined according to the land administration laws, rules, and regulations; 4. A case over which the department has jurisdiction. With regard to a major, complex case, it is necessary to send a duplicate copy to a higher-level land administration department for the record after the case has been put on file. If, on examination, a case does not have the necessary conditions for being placed on file or does not come under the jurisdiction of this unit, it is necessary to inform the complainant in writing. Article 19. After a case involving violations of the land law is placed on file, it is necessary to determine promptly no fewer than two handlers. For major, complex cases, a case-handling team may be set up. If a case handler or relevant leader has conflicts of interest with the case or has other relationships with the interested parties and is likely to affect the fair handling of the case, he should avoid handling the case. Whether a case handler or a relevant leader responsible for a case should avoid handling the case, it is for the relevant leader responsible for the case to determine the former, and for the higher-level land administration department or people's government at the same level to determine the latter. Article 20. The land administration department should notify the actor within three days after the case is put on file, and the latter may express his view in writing within five days after receiving the notification. It will not affect the investigation and handling of the case if an actor does not express his view within the prescribed time. Article 21. In handling a case involving violations of the land law, a handler should complete his work within 30 days after the case is put on file. If, owing to special circumstances, the case cannot be wound up as scheduled, with the approval of the relevant competent leader the deadline may be extended appropriately, but it should not be more than one month. Article 22. If, through investigation, a case cannot be established as in violation of the law, it should be revoked. When a case is revoked, it is necessary to submit a report to the relevant leader for approval and to notify the actor and the complainant in writing. Article 23. If a complainant considers it wrong not to put a case on file or to revoke a case, he may apply within five days pf receiving the notification to a higher-level land administration department for a re-examination. Within 30 days of receiving the application for re-examination, the higher-level land administration department should made a re-examination decision and pass the decision to the complainant and to the land administration department which had not put the case on file or had decided to revoke the case. Article 24.

Article 25. After ending its investigation and hearing, the case handler should submit a "Report on Investigating and Hearing Case Involving Violations of the Land Law" to the land administration department, which handles the case according to different circumstances: 1. If, after investigation, the violations of the land law are proven true and should be subject to disciplinary sanctions according to the law, the land administration department is to issue a "Written Ruling on Disciplinary Sanctions Against Violations of the Land Law"; 2. If a case is established as infringing on land proprietorship or use rights, the land administration department is to issue a "Written Ruling on the Handling of Land Infringement Conduct." The written ruling should be delivered to the interested party or parties. Article 26. After completing the handling of a case, the case handler should fill in a "Report on Closing Case Involving Violations of the Land Law" which, on approval by the competent leader, should be catalogued with the documents, charts, and pictures collected in the course of handling the case, bound together, and placed on file. After a major, complex case -- or one commissioned by the higher authorities -- is completed, it is necessary to submit the following documents to the higher-level land administration department for the record: 1. A "Written Ruling on Disciplinary Sanctions Against Cases Involving Violations of the Land Law"; 2. A "Written Ruling on the Handling of Land Infringement Conduct"; 3. A "Report on Closing Case Involving Violations of the Land Law." With regard to a case reconsidered by an organ or heard by a people's court, it is necessary to attach the duplicate copy of the written ruling on reconsideration or the duplicate copy of the written ruling of the people's court. Article 27. With regard to personnel who should be given disciplinary sanctions according to the law, the land administrative department is to make a recommendation on disciplinary sanctions to the unit in which he works or to the higher-level organ and the administrative and supervision organ. A duplicate copy of the ruling on disciplinary sanctions made by the unit or the higher-level organ and the administrative supervision organ should be sent to the land administration department making the recommendation. Article 28. In the course of handling a case involving violations of the land law, if the land administration department establishes that the violations constitute a crime, it should promptly turn over the case to a judicial organ for investigation and determination of criminal responsibility. Article 29. If an interested party refuses to accept the disciplinary sanctions, he may apply for reconsideration to a higher-level land administration department within 15 days of receiving the "Written Ruling on Disciplinary Sanctions Against Cases Involving Violations of the Land Law." If the interested party refuses to accept the reconsidered ruling, he may file a suit with the people's court within 15 days of receiving the written ruling. He also may file a suit directly to the people's court within 15 days of receiving the "Written Ruling on Disciplinary Sanctions Against Cases Involving Violations of the Land Law." If, within the prescribed time, he neither applies for reconsideration, nor files a suit with the people's court, nor observes the sanctions, the land administration department, which takes the disciplinary sanctions, is to make an "Application for Forcible Implementation of Disciplinary Sanctions Against Cases Involving Violations of the Land Law" which, along with the copy of the case file, should be turned over to the people's court for forcible implementation. Article 30. If the interested party refuses to accept the ruling on land infringement conduct, he may apply for reconsideration to an organ at a higher level than the one making the ruling within 15 days of receiving the "Written Ruling on the Handling of Land Infringement Conduct." If the interested party refuses to accept the reconsidered ruling, he may file a suit with a people's court within 15 days of receiving the written ruling.

Those scoring outstanding achievements in land supervision work; 4. Those scoring marked achievements in informing against, exposing, and curbing violations of the land law. Article 32. Land supervision personnel who, in the course of investigating and handling violations of the land law, practice favoritism or fraud in violation of the law, neglect duties, or abuse power, will be given disciplinary sanctions by the competent department. If this constitutes a crime, criminal responsibility will be investigated and determined according to the law. Article 33. A person who refuses or obstructs land supervision personnel from executing their duties according to the law will be dealt with by the public security organ according to the provisions of the "PRC Security Administration Punishment Act."
