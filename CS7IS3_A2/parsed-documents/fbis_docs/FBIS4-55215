Do you think this is a formality and does this partnership have concrete significance for our country? [Klaus] I would not want to pass a strong judgment because I would unnecessarily stir the political waters both in our country and Europe. The various European integrational groupings have selected a strategy under which they would negotiate with countries like the Czech Republic, that is with postcommunist countries, in stages and steps, and not simply yes or no. They would negotiate in stages such as for semimembership, association, and the like. I respect this and accept it, since I believe that at the given time this probably cannot be otherwise for them, although this is not the case for us. I therefore accept it as it is. [Weisova] You met the command of the Czech Army in Olomouc on Friday. Do they share the Czech Government's view on the Partnership for Peace program and do you think, after this meeting, that the Czech Army is able to fulfill its obligations following from Partnership for Peace? [Klaus] I would first like to ask myself whether I think that the Czech Army is going through a transformation process of the same speed and thoroughness as the entire Czech Republic. This is the first question for me, and my answer is in the affirmative, that it is. The second question is whether the Czech Army is getting ready to fulfill its own objectives. These objectives are not, first and foremost, about Europe and Partnership for Peace; they are in the first place about the Czech Republic and its defense. It is not right to formulate the question from the wrong end. I think that the minister of defense repeated the Czech Government's basic view in the presence of all the assembled military representatives, that we proceed from our own capability and determination to defend this country. [passage omitted] All other agreements and cooperation treaties come second after this crucial starting point, on which we must not keep silent. I believe that the Czech Army is moving in this direction. I cannot say that I am an expert who has visited dozens of military units -- this is not true. However, I was favorably impressed by what I saw in Olomouc and Praslavice. The second question is whether we will be capable of taking part in the activities of the Partnership for Peace initiative. I can say that we will. I have been assured by our soldiers and commanders that the level of preparedness is very high and that their experience from various actions is always very favorable, I think. Groups of our soldiers and officers take part in various competitions, in shooting and other disciplines, and their results are very, very good. I believe that there is no need to be too modest. [Weisova] Would you comment on the outcome of the parliamentary elections in Hungary? [Klaus] I think that Hungary has been heading in this direction for a considerable time. It lacked a vigorous, radical, striking, and decisive transformation policy similar to what we have in our country. It lacked high-profile and charismatic personalities capable of uniting the Hungarian public around them in order to carry out radical social changes. As for the implications it has for us, the Czech Republic is becoming a small nonleftist island in the center of Europe. This, I think, should compel each of our voters to reflect on this fact. I think it should compel each member of our government coalition parties to treat this valuable factor with very, very great caution, indeed.
