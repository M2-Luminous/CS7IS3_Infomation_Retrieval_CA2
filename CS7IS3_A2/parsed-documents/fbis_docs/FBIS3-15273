"We will have to take great efforts" to achieve the targets envisaged by it, the premier stressed. During the discussion, some senior executives of ministries and agencies stressed the need for more spending in such spheres as housing construction, social welfare, science, environmental protection. Thus, Culture Minister Yevgeniy Sidorov said we should not "fight inflation by cutting down expenditures" for culture, which are to account for 0.3 per cent of the total budget expenditures. "With such a budget, the social sphere will be gradually dying, which is to affect, sooner or later, the economy and the entire situation in the country", he stressed. Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun noted that the draft budget did not provide for allocations of about 5 trillion roubles to back the agro-industrial complex, which were envisaged by the government decision promising support for agriculture in 1994. A speech by Labour Minister Gennadiy Melikyan was extremely emotional. He predicted that the proposed 1994 budget would be implemented for about two or three months only, and then violations are inevitable, the same as it happened to Russia's two previous federal budgets. He stressed that "the draft budget has very little to do with a real economic policy, it simply sets a tight course for stabilizing the economy by reducing budget spending". The labour minister called upon the government to work out effective measures to encourage production, including through adequate taxation. Melikyan was backed by First Deputy Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin, who described the draft budget as "politically dangerous". He also reported that the defence ministry collegium had estimated the envisaged expenditures for national security as extremely unsufficient. "It will literally ruin the country's defence capability", the collegium stressed. A shortage of state funding is to bring about "an immediate dismissal of 400,000 servicemen and to fully terminate purchases of military equipment", according to Kokoshin. The prime minister argued that all ministries and agencies demanding extra spending should take into consideration the current complicated situation in the country. "Now we are on the verge of an abyss, beyond which we will just collapse... For this reason, the draft budget is rather tight, we should determine how to overcome this crisis with the lowest losses", Chernomyrdin told the gathering. "We do not need either hyperinflation or a simmering country. And we have two levers to control this -- power and order", he emphasised. On the premier's proposal, the draft budget was approved in principle. The Finance Ministry was instructed to finalize it within ten days. In doing so, it should "by no means increase items of expenditure, otherwise we will face a catastrophe".
