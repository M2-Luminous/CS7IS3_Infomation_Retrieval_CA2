Son Sung-pil, the North Korean ambassador to Russia, spoke to deputies. [Correspondent Ivan Trefilov] North Korea will meet war with war, and the specific measures will depend on the particular sanctions that the world community takes against the republic, the North Korean diplomat said. At the same time, the DPRK is willing to come to talks at any time and to settle the nuclear problem peacefully. In this connection, North Korea has manifested some interest in the proposal by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for an international conference to be held on the nuclear problem of the Korean peninsula. However, if the conference is intended to bring pressure to bear, the DPRK will not be able to agree to this, the North Korean ambassador stressed. In the diplomat's view, there has been some progress in settling the nuclear problem since the visit to the DPRK by former U.S. President Carter. The American visitor handed over an official U.S. proposal: the abandonment of sanctions; the supply to North Korea of light water reactors; and a third round of U.S.-DPRK talks. In return for this, the DPRK must retain international monitoring at its nuclear facilities. In the view of the North Korean diplomat, this proposal could form the basis for a comprehensive settlement of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula. Ivan Trefilov, for Ekho Moskvy at the State Duma.
