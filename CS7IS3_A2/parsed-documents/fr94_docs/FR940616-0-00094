FR940616-0-00094 FR940616-0-00011 Program Accessibility: Existing Facilities (§9.150) Comment: The Department Should Consider the Impact of the Americans with Disabilities Act on Existing Facilities. Section 9.150(b) provides that HUD is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. Three commenters stated that HUD should consider the impact of the ADA on HUD programs and activities. Two commenters stated that it would be helpful both to consumers and to HUD and Justice enforcement personnel if these regulations referred to the ADA and to the ADA title II regulations and standards. Response. In developing this final rule, the Department in consultation with the DOJ and EEOC, has considered the impact of the ADA on HUD conducted programs and activities, and where appropriate, incorporated those requirements of the ADA that are applicable to these programs and activities. Comment: Section 9.150(e) Should Clarify HUD's Responsibility to Make Reasonable Modifications in Housing Sold to Buyers with Disabilities. Section 9.150(e) provides that HUD is not required to make alterations to existing facilities that are part of HUD's Property Disposition Programs, unless such alterations are necessary to meet the needs of a current or prospective tenant during the time when the Department expects to retain legal possession of the facilities and there is no alternative method to meet the needs of that tenant. Section 9.150(e) further provides that nothing in this section shall be construed to require alterations to make facilities accessible to persons with disabilities who are expected to occupy the facilities only after HUD relinquishes legal possession. One commenter stated that this section relieves HUD of all responsibility to make any modifications for buyers with disabilities who purchase housing through HUD's Property Disposition Program. The commenter stated that §9.150(e) should be revised to clarify HUD'S responsibility to make reasonable modifications in housing sold to buyers with disabilities. Another commenter stated that the part 9 final rule should be revised to provide that HUD will exert its best efforts to assist a purchaser in obtaining the funding and expertise that HUD is able to provide in making the building usable for tenants and owners with disabilities. Response. Section 9.150 requires the housing provider to demonstrate that physical alterations to make a unit accessible would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program or activity or in an undue financial and administrative burden. This section requires that where physical alterations would result in a fundamental alteration or undue financial and administrative burden, alternative action must be taken that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens, but nevertheless would ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity. In the preamble to the part 9 proposed rule, HUD explained why the traditional approach to program accessibility with respect to existing facilities is not appropriate for the Property Disposition Programs because HUD holds the properties only temporarily and for an unpredictable amount of time (56 FR 24611). Since HUD does not know how long it will be in possession of the property, the agency cannot identify a time period within which it can assess the needs of those who might wish to live there in the future. However, HUD recognizes that during the time that the agency retains possession of a housing property under this program, HUD provides a housing service to the residents and also has a section 504 obligation to those who apply for housing in the facility. Program Accessibility: Alterations of Property Disposition Program Multifamily Housing Facilities (§9.152) Section 9.152 imposes accessibility requirements on HUD when HUD undertakes alterations to multifamily housing facilities that are part of HUD's Property Disposition Program. This section would require that once HUD undertakes alterations that cost 75 percent or more of the replacement value of the building, HUD must make at least five percent of the units accessible to tenants with mobility disabilities and two percent of the units accessible to tenants with sight and hearing disabilities. Comment: Section 9.152 Should Include the Fair Housing Act Standards for New Construction. One commenter stated that HUD adopted the 75 percent figure for its section 504 federally assisted regulations, because it purposely wanted the level of alterations to ``be tantamount to new construction'' (53 FR 20224). The commenter stated that the Department is now required to meet the Fair Housing Act new construction standards when altering housing facilities. The commenter further stated that this section requires the five percent/two percent standard only in buildings with 15 or more units that are undergoing significant alteration, and that this requirement conflicts with HUD's UFAS standards for federally owned residential property which has no minimum 15 unit requirement. Response. As previously discussed, it is inappropriate for HUD to incorporate the standards and requirements of the Fair Housing Act in a regulation implementing section 504 because the purposes and goals of these two statutes are not identical. To the extent that newly constructed HUD multifamily housing is subject to the requirements of the Fair Housing Act and section 504, HUD will adhere to the standards that provide for greater accessibility. The UFAS standards were promulgated under the Barriers Act. ( See 24 CFR part 40, App. A, 4.1; 49 FR 31528; 53 FR 20228.) Because section 504 requires compliance with accessibility standards in certain circumstances, the DOJ recommended that Federal agencies provide that new construction and alterations comply with the ADAAG or the UFAS (that is, compliance with the ADAAG whenever the ADAAG provides for greater accessibility than the UFAS). Compliance with the UFAS or the ADAAG therefore is deemed to be compliance with section 504. The DOJ recommended the UFAS and the ADAAG as the applicable accessibility standards for section 504 to reduce potential conflict between standards enforced under the Barriers Act and section 504. However, the degree of accessibility required by the Barriers Act and that required by section 504 are not identical, and the regulations and standards promulgated under section 504 and the Barriers Act reflect these differences. Comment: Replacement Cost Cap of Section 9.152 Should Be Lowered from 75 percent to 50 percent. One commenter recommended lowering the replacement cost cap in §9.152 because many states and cities nationwide have a lower triggering percentage. The commenter stated that HUD projects should not be allowed to remain inaccessible until a renovation totals 75 percent of replacement cost when private buildings are subject to a more stringent standard. Response. The 75 percent replacement cost cap set forth in §9.152 is also contained in §8.23 of HUD's section 504 regulation for HUD assisted programs. The replacement cost cap issue was carefully considered by the Department during development of the final part 8 rule. The Department received 290 comments on this issue following publication of the proposed part 8 rule (53 FR 20224). In the preamble to the final part 8 rule, the Department explained in detail the reasons behind its decision to retain the 75 percent replacement cost cap. ( See 53 FR 20224.) The comment made by the commenter on this issue in the context of the part 9 rule has not persuaded the Department to revise its initial decision that the 75 percent replacement cost cap is an appropriate standard for section 504 purposes. The Department points out, however, that HUD projects in jurisdictions which impose more stringent accessibility standards, than those prescribed in HUD's section 504 regulations, must comply with the more stringent requirements. Comment: Section 9.152(b) is Unclear As to When Responsibility to Modify Existing Housing Ends. One commenter stated that paragraph (b) of §9.152 is confusing. The commenter stated that housing providers who read the regulation do not understand when their responsibility to modify existing housing ends. The commenter stated that paragraph (b) should be revised to clarify that each time a building is altered, accessibility requirements apply.
