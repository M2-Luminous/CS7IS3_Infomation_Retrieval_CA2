FBIS4-29746 "dreas119_a_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-119 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Electoral Reform Bills Submitted to Upper House Electoral Reform Bills Submitted to Upper House OW2006140494 Tokyo KYODO in English 1348 GMT 20 Jun 94 OW2006140494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Five political forces in the House of Councillors Monday [20 June] submitted a suprapartisan bill that would add four seats to each of four underrepresented constituencies while eliminating four seats from three overrepresented electorates, officials said. The five parties and parliamentary groups that tabled the bill were the Liberal Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party [Social Democratic Party of Japan], Komeito [Clean Government Party], the Shin Ryokufu Kai and the Niin Club. The Shin Ryokufu Kai groups Shinseito, the Japan New Party, the Democratic Socialist Party and the Democratic Reform Party. The parties plan to push the bill through the upper chamber's ad hoc panel on political reform Tuesday and obtain approval from the upper chamber's plenary session on Wednesday, the officials said. The bill, if legislated, would assuage the current imbalance in voter representation in upper house constituencies by obligating legislators to contest the next upper house election, slated for the summer of 1995, under the revised appropriation of seats, the officials said. The bill envisages increasing by one the number of seats in each of four underrepresented prefectures of Miyazaki, Saitama, Kanagawa and Gifu, while taking away two seats from the prefecture of Hokkaido and one seat each from the prefectures of Hyogo and Fukuoka, they said. The bill would also soften a legal requirement under which a party or parliamentary group is empowered to field candidates in the nationwide constituency of proportional representation. Under the bill, all political parties or parliamentary groups that garnered more than 2 percent of total valid votes cast nationwide in the most recent national election would be eligible to field candidates under the proportional representation formula, they said. Currently, a political party or parliamentary group must garner 4 percent of such votes to qualify.
