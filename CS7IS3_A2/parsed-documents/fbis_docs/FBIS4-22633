Kirpichnikov, under the rubric "Budget": "Draft Budget: Not Bad, but No Good: Government Not Insisting on Duma Approval"] [Text] Yesterday's hearings in the State Duma on mutual relations between the federal budget and the budgets of federation subjects were representative: participating were Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko, Deputy Economics Minister Andrey Shapovalyants, and Central Bank Deputy Chairman Tamara Paramonova, as well as the leaders of the "economic" committees of the lower chamber. The representatives of executive power emphasized that for the first time a real, as opposed to declaratory, system for a trilevel budget had been proposed--federal, territorial (federation subjects), and local. The draft budget for 1994 has three basic divisions: income, expenditures, and transfers--from the federative into local budgets. Already a large part of taxes accrued is being sent to the locales: 37 percent of the value-added tax (VAT), 63 percent of the profit tax, 100 percent of the income tax, and so on. There is nothing fundamentally new about the expenditures division: federal spending for defense, debt support, and the implementation of Russia-wide programs eats up about 75 percent of the federal budget, leaving practically nothing to share with the territories. The greatest number of innovations is in the transfers division. The creation of a financial support fund for the territories has been proposed in the amount of 22 percent of what comes in from the VAT. Three categories of territories are distinguished: those in need of help from the center, those in special need, and those not in need. Upon classifying the territories in a transfer class, the population's income and expense structure will be taken into account. Investments are planned only for unfinished sites of unusual economic or social importance. Assistance will be given to regions that have suffered from radiation, as well as areas of the North and the Kuriles, on principle. The optimistic speeches of the three deputy ministers, however, met with approval from the deputy body and guests at the hearings only in the sense that finally at least some steps were being taken to meet the regions halfway. Critics were incomparably more numerous. It was pointed out that the Duma had not been presented with a consolidated budget broken down by regions, and therefore to talk about real changes in budgetary policy and their specific consequences was impossible. It was pointed out that a financial support fund of 22 percent is relatively less than the 35 percent from the federal budget allocated for the same purpose in 1993. Attention was drawn to the fact that the division of regions into three classes had not been fully thought out, that it insults the raw-materials territories that provide the country with its main hard currency income, and that it could give rise to interregional conflicts. Numerous speakers from the floor emphasized the poverty-stricken situation with their budgets, differing in their definitions of how the necessary financial assistance should be applied, but agreeing that the draft budget as a document is incomplete and that it contradicts the Constitution. Representatives of the unions of cities complained that the role of the budgets of these points of settlement had been underassessed and insisted on the need to protect them from attempted incursions by oblast or kray authorities. Villagers expressed themselves likewise. Finally, the issue was touched on of the obligatory cancellation at the government level of the promises of indexation, loans, and other preferential outlays that the government and president had promised in resolutions and edicts but had not provided the money for, addressing those desiring local budgets. Tax rates, state guarantees, and much else was debated. In the end, the hearings showed that, in its current form, the draft budget for 1994 is not going to win Duma approval. Hearing organizers consoled deputies with the fact that the government itself does not seem likely to insist on the document's passage, being aware of its incompleteness. It all came down to the fact that there is no point in simply returning the draft to the Council of Ministers; it is essential, however, to form with government representatives a joint group to complete work on it.
