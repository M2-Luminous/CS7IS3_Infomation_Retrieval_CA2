He expressed hope that the new Japanese government, headed by Tsutomu Hata who was elected prime minister today, would pursue the same policy in this sphere. "I think Hosokawa has done very much for the development of Russian-Japanese relations," head of a department of the press service of the Russian president and specialist in Japanese studies Aleksandr Orfenov told ITAR-TASS today. In his opinion, Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo last October is proof to it. Important documents were signed during the visit. "We hope Hata will continue the political course of the previous cabinet, aimed at developing relations with the Russian Federation," the spokesman for the president's press service said. In his opinion, Hata's statements during his visit to Moscow last March give grounds for such hope. Judging by those statements, he is a sober-minded politician. According to Orfenov, it is regrettable that during Tsutomu Hata's recent visit to Moscow President Yeltsin was on leave in Sochi and could not meet him. At that time Tsutomu Hata was deputy prime minister and head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. "I think it would be useful for them both to meet and establish personal contacts," he said.
