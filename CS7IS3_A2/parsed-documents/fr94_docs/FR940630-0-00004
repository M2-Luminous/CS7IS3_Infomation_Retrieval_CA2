FR940630-0-00004 FR940630-0-00001 Background Title 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations (1 CFR Part 51) requires that an Agency seeking approval of a change to a publication that is approved for incorporation by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations publish notice of the change in the Federal Register and amend the Code of Federal Regulations. The Agency must also ensure that a copy of the amendment or revision is on file at the Office of the Federal Register and notify the Director of the Federal Register in writing that the change is being made. The 15th edition of the AOAC's ``Book of Methods'' for various kinds of chemical analyses was published in 1990. Certain sections of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations containing references to this AOAC publication refer the reader to page numbers in the previous edition. Therefore, these page numbers are not accurate for the current edition of this AOAC publication. Also, some methods included in the 15th edition are not fully set out in it, but are included only by reference to previous editions. Such methods can be found in their entirety in the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th and/or 14th editions, which are not obsolete and should not be destroyed. To make it easier for the reader to find the referenced analytical methods in past editions and the current edition of this AOAC publication, FSIS is amending its regulations to cite the chapters, rather than the page numbers, where the referenced AOAC analytical methods can be found in any edition of this AOAC publication. This publication has been previously approved for incorporation by reference. Therefore, it is found upon good cause that public participation in this rulemaking procedure is impracticable and unnecessary, and good cause is found for making the amendment effective less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 553). A copy of the 1990 edition of the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists'' is on file at the Office of the Federal Register. Copies of this publication may be purchased directly from the AOAC at the address noted below. 1 1 Association of Official Analytical Chemists, Inc., 2200 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 400, Arlington, Virginia 22201.
