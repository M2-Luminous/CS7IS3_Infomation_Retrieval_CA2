Speaking at an impromptu news conference in connection with the killing yesterday of State Duma deputy Andrey Ayzderdzis, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy announced that the LDPR faction now demanded the resignation of the entire government and not just several ministers, as it had done earlier, and that it was ready to propose its own candidates for the vacant posts. "So far we are not demanding the resignation of the president; we are offering him a compromise option," the LDPR leader added. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy poured particular scorn on State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin, who in his view was "pushing the Duma towards a crisis." The faction leader condemned "Ivan Rybkin's defeatist stance on every issue" and said the Duma would not empower him to sign the treaty on public accord. He proposed to postpone the signing of the document till 12 May to allow time to make changes in the government and to suspend privatization.
