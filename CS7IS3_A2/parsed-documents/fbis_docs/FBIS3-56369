[passage omitted] At a routine briefing today, a high-ranking White House spokesman, who asked not to be named, summed up the preliminary results of the Moscow summit. He said that President Bill Clinton had fulfilled the tasks before him: to confirm partnership relations between the United States and Russia that were established in Vancouver, to express firm support by the United States for the economic and political reforms in Russia, and also to develop ties with a wider spectrum of political forces in the country. According to the briefer, the main themes of the talks in Moscow were economic reforms in Russia, the "Partnership for Peace" program, and also disarmament. The White House spokesman said that the most important event was, perhaps, the signing this morning of a trilateral agreement between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States on eliminating nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian territory. He said also that the leaders of both countries had discussed both yesterday and today the question of the presence of Russian troops in Latvia and Estonia. "We think that progress has been made in this area and very much hope that agreements on troop withdrawal will be concluded soon between Russia and Latvia and between Russia and Estonia," the White House spokesman said.
