Details follow. A. Netherlands (i) Measures to lower the cost of R&D personnel. Authorities intend to waive payment of a percentage of the income taxes and other taxes employers normally have to pay to the state in the case of research personnel or research institutes working on an R&D project for a company on the basis of a contract. For basic industrial research or applied research and development, beneficiaries can deduct 25 percent of wage costs for salaries below ECU50,000 and 12.5 percent of wage costs for salaries of more than ECU50,000 (these percentages can vary). The maximum amount a company can retain is ECU4.6 million annually. Dutch authorities estimate that tax revenues will diminish by ECU161 million. This measure leads to a maximum intensity of 16 percent calculated on the basis of the total R&D project costs. Cumulation with other aid measures is only possible up to the allowable aid intensities. (ii) Amendment of schemes subsidizing the use of energy conservation and wind energy technologies. The amendment regarding these subsidies granted for the purchase and investment in energy saving equipment considerably lowers the aid intensity and maximum amount of grant per firm (which were quite high). B. Germany (i) Aid program in the microelectronics research and development field. With a budget of ECU31 million for 1994 to 2000, this scheme provides direct subsidies for basic industrial research by enterprises and scientific institutions. The maximum aid intensity is 50 percent with enhancements for projects carried out by SMEs [small and medium-sized companies] (+10 percent), in the ex-GDR (+10 percent) or by SMEs in the ex-GDR (+15 percent). Recipients are obliged to publish their results in specialized magazines. (ii) Amendment of schemes already authorized by the Commission concerning the environment, energy conservation and the use of renewable energy in Germany. The limit on low-interest loans for enterprises located in eastern Germany will be raised from 500,000 to ECU1 million. The intensity of 10 percent remains unchanged; the aid ceiling in eastern Germany thus rises to ECU100,000.
