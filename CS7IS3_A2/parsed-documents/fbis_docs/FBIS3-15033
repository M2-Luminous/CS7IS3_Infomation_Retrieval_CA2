In an interview with the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper, Stasiukynas said the Lithuanian refinery gets many suggestions to buy Russian oil but does not have enough money. The minister said Mazeikiai will nevertheless purchase some oil from companies which can wait for payment. Stasiukynas commented on the suspension of an oil export license issued to Lucoil. A decision to suspend the license was made by the Russian International Economic Relations Ministry Feb. 16 "to clear up the circumstances of oil trade." Lucoil is blamed for cooperation with the Baltic states, LIETUVOS RYTAS said with reference to a high-ranking Russian energy official. Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas was unable to comment on the fact during a press conference Monday [28 February]. Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius said he does not have any information about the temporary ban. Dzhevan Chalakhayants, Lucoil vice president, told the newspaper that "there were problems related to oil supplies to Mazeikiai," but, in his words, the company will be allowed to export oil again in March. Commenting on cooperation with the Lithuanian refinery, he said Lucoil never promised to supply oil to Lithuania but only refines it in Mazeikiai. Bronislovas Vainora, Mazeikiai director general, said the ban will not affect the refinery because the oil supplied by Lucoil is not regarded as export. He said Mazeikiai only refines oil and gets 20 percent of the ready production for work. Vainora noted that the refinery did not violate any agreements with Lucoil. In his view, Russian officials simply decided to check whether cooperation between Lucoil and Lithuania is efficient and whether production returns to Russia. This is not the first time that Lucoil's rivals initiate such a check-up, Vainora said. According to a contract between Mazeikiai and Lucoil, the Russian company will refine 6 million tons of oil in Lithuania by 1997. Mazeikiai refined 3 million tons of oil last year and will presumably refine as much as 6 million tons from different sources this year.
