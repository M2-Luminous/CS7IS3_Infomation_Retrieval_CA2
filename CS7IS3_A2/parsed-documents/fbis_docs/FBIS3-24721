At the second stop of his western Transvaal campaign trail, the ANC leader told a crowd at Stilfontein that his organisation had made the Afrikaner's an offer they would be foolish to refuse. Rightwingers could have their own separate election ballot to vote for a volkstaat [homeland]. But, the ultimate decision on the establishment of such a homeland would be made by the government voted into power. Mr Mandela further warned rightwingers not to do anything to plunge the country into a conflict that would leave many, both black and white, dead. "We know how to fight too," Mr Mandela said. From one packed stadium to the next, Mandela kept up a hectic schedule on Sunday. Despite being a poor community, residents at the next stop at Jouberton Township outside Klerksdorp went all out to welcome him. Here, his message of proper housing and services, education, health care and employment for the masses drew an enthusiastic response. Mr Mandela said no matter how much money and effort the ANC poured into uplifting poverty-stricken communities by creating jobs and giving children a free education, the people themselves had to work hard and be dedicated to improving their lot. He said the ANC's national public works programme would not only give people jobs, but allow the community to be part of a labour-intensive project of building facilities like homes, clinics, hospitals and roads. Mr Mandela warned, however, that changes would not be noticeable in the first few years after elections. "Do not expect to be driving a Mercedes the day after the elections. You must have patience. You might have to wait five years for results to show. But, we will immediately begin mobilising resources and implementing plans," he said. Throughout the day, Mandela appealed to people to allow the National Party to campaign freely in the townships. "We want you to give all organisations a chance to canvass support in the townships. Let them come and show they have nothing to offer you. They will only expose themselves. We will not have to bury them after elections. They are burying themselves," he said.
