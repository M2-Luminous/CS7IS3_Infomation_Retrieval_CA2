That makes a large number of people, not counting saxophone lovers, who are beginning to find the presidential tone a little thin. Perhaps too many people. And everybody is already wondering: Who will pay for the U.S. President's ulterior motives or errors of analysis? President Clinton's behavior on the Bosnian issue has not allayed these fears; quite the reverse. Despite the efforts made, particularly by France, for the United States to become involved, Bill Clinton turned a deaf ear; there is no question of Washington intervening in the crisis or encouraging the Muslims to accept the peace plan laboriously drawn up by the Europeans. All the information we have suggests the opposite: U.S. services are not refraining from secretly arming the Muslim forces which have launched a counteroffensive. The Bosnian crisis does not jeopardize American interests. The Europeans, who last year rejected the American proposals for attacking some Serbian positions and lifting the embargo on arms for Bosnia, will therefore have to extricate themselves from the mess. Although things are even less clear, the Twelve must expect more unpleasant surprises as regards the Central or East European countries, toward which they have shown far too much indifference: There will be growing American pressure to make the European Union bear more of the burden and be less reluctant to open its borders to the products of these fragile democracies. The United States will be in a good position in this sphere and will find interested listeners in Warsaw, Prague, or Budapest when it explains that the strengthening of the reemerging democracies depends more on economic development than on entry into a military alliance which might only whip up Russian hegemonistic tendencies. Neoisolationism and the defense on all fronts of American economic and commercial interests are the two axes of the foreign policy pursued by the former governor of Arkansas, who is still heeding the opinion polls that tirelessly tell him this is the desire of U.S. public opinion. One, two, or three trips to Europe will not be enough to alter this fact, unless there is a Russian disaster. Averting such a disaster was the main aim of Bill Clinton's visit. Officially, the U.S. President is working for the integration of a democratic Russia in Europe. In practice, it is as if he was prepared to make do with a democracy that is more superficial than real, and with accepting the legitimacy of a Russian sphere of influence coinciding (aside from Ukraine and the three Baltic Republics at present) with the borders of the former Soviet Union. Moreover, there is nothing to say that Boris Yeltsin, who knows his country better than the American strategists, is particularly interested in his country's hypothetical integration into Europe. On the other hand, he seems infinitely more interested in maintaining Russia's role as a nuclear superpower. Hence the importance he attaches to the agreement on the denuclearization of Ukraine, even if it has little chance of being approved by the Kiev Parliament: He will have shown his "goodwill," whereas the Ukrainian deputies will have confirmed their irresponsibility. Europe is no more certain of its destiny after Bill Clinton's visit than it was before. But it can no longer put forward false excuses or cherish illusions: It knows, because it has been told, that it can only rely on its own forces and its own will.
