Perry made his remarks at a press conference here at the end of a two-day visit to the former Soviet republic. The U.S. secretary of defence did not elaborate on this new strategic relationship, but it was reported that the two sides signed a series of agreements during Perry's stay. These included an agreement on Ukrainian participation in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and agreement on an additional 100 million U.S. dollars of U.S. aid to help Kiev dismantle its nuclear arms and convert part of its military industry to civil use. Both sides also reportedly touched on the possibility of holding joint military exercises and will set up a hot line between military authorities of the two countries. The U.S. reinterated its support for safeguarding state sovereignty in Ukraine and maintaining territorial integrity. They also expressed an understanding of Kiev's position on the issues of Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet. As for the security umbrella demanded by Ukraine, Perry said that Washington will not provide the security guarantee for Kiev after Ukraine joins the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and would only offer a kind of pledge on the issue. However, before Ukraine began dismantling its nuclear arms, Washington had repeatedly pledged to provide a security guarantee for the former Soviet republic. Perry said that the dispute over Russia's delay in compensating Ukraine for nuclear disarmament is expected to be resolved in the near future. Ukraine has threatened to reconsider the timetable for shipping nuclear warheads to Russia for dismantling because Russia has failed to compensate for the transfer. Moscow has argued that the delay was caused by Washington's failure to uphold its part of the disarmament pact.
