Lithuanian authorities planned to arrest Yegorov in his Klaipeda apartment but the suspect was reportedly warned about the operation and managed to slip away. The prosecutor's office said the failed operation was carried out by the Lithuanian National Security Service. Kestutis Betingis, head of the State Crimes Department, told the RESPUBLIKA newspaper that he will officially demand to dismiss some employees of the service. Betingis supposes that Yegorov may have been either arrested on Friday [25 February] and then released, or was informed about the operation in advance. The official said this was "an open betrayal" or simply unsuccessful work, but "somebody did this on purpose." Prosecutor General Arturas Paulauskas confirmed to RESPUBLIKA that the head of the security service, Jurgis Jurgelis, telephoned him several times before the operation and tried to convince the prosecutor not to arrest Yegorov. Jurgelis reportedly said "how will we look politically" if a former Soviet serviceman is arrested. Jurgelis is on sick-leave since Monday, his secretary said. In 1991, Colonel Yegorov headed the military-political section of the Soviet coast guard division stationed in Klaipeda. The prosecutor's office found evidence that he initiated unlawful actions of the Soviet military during the 1991 coup.
