The text of the new government regulation was promulgated on February 1. The new regulation is expected to curb "early marriages and births," and is conducive to the nation's goal of controlling its already large population, said Yang Jianchang, spokesman for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, at a press conference here today. China's marriage law stipulates that men are not allowed to marry until 22, and women until 20. Every year there are two million illegal marriages out of a total ten million marriages, the spokesman said. The illegal ones include 1.6 million so-called "early marriages." According to the new regulation, China is continuing to combat arranged and mercenary marriages, marriages between close relatives and bigamous marriages. All these are still widespread in some parts of China. The spokesman said that the new regulation will be "a forceful legal means" for the civil affairs bodies to administer the marriage registration process. The new rules stated that legally marriageable couples who simply do not go to the government marriage registration agency will be criticised and have to register within a certain period of time. Marriages based on certificates obtained through fraud and deception will be declared null and void, the certificates will be withdrawn and the couples fined up to 200 yuan (about 23 U.S. dollars), according to the text. The regulation gives couples getting married the right to bring charges against any officials or organisations trying to impose illegal fees or engaged in other corruptive practices in marriage registration. The regulation also specifies the rights and duties of people wanting to divorce. The spokesman said that divorces have been increasing annually. The latest statistics show that 310,000 couples divorced in 1992, compare with 190,000 couples in 1979. Existing regulations for marriages of Chinese people to foreigners, or to Overseas Chinese people, or to residents of Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan, are not replaced by the new decree.
