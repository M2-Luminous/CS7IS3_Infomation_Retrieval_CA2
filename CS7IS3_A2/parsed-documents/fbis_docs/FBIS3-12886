The Babil newspaper, run by President Saddam Husayn's eldest son 'Uday, said it was "desirable for the leaders of Iraq, Libya and Sudan to hold a summit meeting ... and adopt a common stance" to meet the challenges facing Arabs in the wake of the February 25 massacre, when a Jewish settler gunned down dozens of Moslem worshippers. Such an alliance was "necessary ... due to the complete inertia of the Arab League and its subservience to the wishes of traitors among the Arab leaders." Babil said "only armed struggle can lead to freedom," and called on "all those concerned about the future of Palestine to declare that the Palestinian autonomy accord died in Hebron." Arab-Israeli peace talks were suspended after the massacre. The PLO has demanded that the United Nations guarantee protection for Palestinians in the occupied territories and that Israeli settlers be disarmed. The newspaper also called on the ruling Baath party to hold a congress of Arab forces to "form an anti-colonialist and anti-Zionist front." Meanwhile, the official Iraqi news agency INA Saturday expressed the hope that contacts between Iraqi and French officials would help toward the lifting of an international embargo imposed on Baghdad after its troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990. "The Franco-Iraqi meetings in Paris, at the invitation of France, indicate that French diplomats will take steps aimed at lifting the embargo," INA said. A senior Iraqi foreign ministry official, Riyad al-Qaysi, held talks with his French counterparts in Paris Friday. The meetings were a sign of "France's willingness to resume relations with Iraq," INA said. Al-Qaysi's visit came less than a week after one by a senior official of Baghdad's oil ministry, as a guest of the French oil companies Total and Elf-Aquitaine. The companies are negotiating concessions to exploit petroleum deposits in southern Iraq once the UN embargo has been lifted. Iraqi newspapers said al-Qaysi's talks in Paris were part of a diplomatic drive to get the embargo lifted, and he would also visit China. He went to Russia on February 22. Under the 1991 Gulf war ceasefire conditions the oil embargo may be lifted once Iraq has fulfilled UN demands for the dismantling of its weapons programmes.
