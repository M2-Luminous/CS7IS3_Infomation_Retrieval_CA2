Box 16001, Reading, Pennsylvania 19640 and Pennsylvania Electric Company (``Penelec''), 1001 Broad Street, Johnstown, Pennsylvania 15907 (collectively, the ``GPU Companies''), have filed a post-effective amendment under sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act and rules 53 and 54 thereunder to their declaration previously filed under sections 6(a) and 7 and rule 50(a)(5). By order dated March 18, 1992 (HCAR No. 25493) (``Order''), the Commission authorized the GPU Companies from time to time through March 31, 1995 to: (1) Issue, sell and renew unsecured promissory notes (``Notes'') in amounts up to $150 million outstanding at any one time and maturing not more than six months from the date of issue, to certain banks under the terms of a revolving credit agreement (``Credit Agreement'') with Citibank, N.A. and Chemical Bank as co-agents and Chemical Bank as the administrative agent; (2) issue, sell and renew their unsecured promissory notes, maturing not more than nine months from the date of issue, pursuant to loan participation arrangements and informal lines of credit (``Lines of Credit'') in amounts up to the limitations on short-term indebtedness contained in their respective charters but, the case of GPU, $200 million; (3) incur other short-term unsecured debt (``Other Short-Term Debt''), from time to time, in amounts up to the limits permitted by their respective charters but, in the case of GPU, $200 million; and (4) in the case of JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec, issue and sell their respective unsecured promissory notes as commercial paper (``Commercial Paper'') in amounts up to their respective charter limits. In no event, however, would the total amount of such unsecured debt of any GPU Company outstanding at any one time exceed the limitations on such indebtedness imposed by such company's charter but, in case of GPU, $200 million. At June 30, 1994, the charter limits of JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec would have permitted them to have maximum short-term indebtedness outstanding at any one time of $275, $122 and $137 million, respectively.
