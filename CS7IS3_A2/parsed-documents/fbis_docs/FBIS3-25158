FBIS3-25158 "drafr027_c_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA KwaZulu Police Commissioner Gives Evidence Before TEC MB0802191294 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in Afrikaans 1600 GMT 8 Feb 94 MB0802191294 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network Language: Afrikaans Article Type:BFN [Text] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] today showed for the first time since its establishment that it is able to exercise its authority, when the chief of the kwaZulu Police [KZP], Lieutenant General Roy During, testified before the council after a long delay. This follows an earlier report by Justice Richard Goldstone on so-called hit squads in the KZP. This report by Ronel Van Zyl: KZP Commissioner Lt. Gen. Roy During had up till today refused to respond to requests by the TEC that he appear before them. On Friday it was agreed that he would do so, after an out-of-court agreement between the TEC and the kwaZulu minister of police. Three KZP members were suspended after the Goldstone report. In his evidence, Gen. During maintained that he was not aware of any other KZP members who were involved in hit squads. He added, however, that other allegations were being investigated by the South African Police at his request. Gen. During was pressed by questions on KZP members who had been trained by the South African Defense Force in Caprivi. It was obvious that the council wanted to determine whether there is any link between those KZP members trained in Caprivi and the hit squads. Gen. During admitted that the allegations about hit squads in the KZP had been surfacing for many years. He emphasized that he had personally initiated investigations into these allegations, with the approval of Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi. At the end of the hearing the TEC did not make any ruling, except that the investigations into the matter were far from completed. Gen. During said he was prepared to appear again before the council.
