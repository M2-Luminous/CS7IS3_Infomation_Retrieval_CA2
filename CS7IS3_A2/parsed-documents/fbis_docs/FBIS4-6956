Finance ministers and central bankers from the world's richest nations are set to begin a five-hour meeting at 12 P.M. at the historic landmark Dumbarton house to kick off a spate of international financial meetings that will continue through Tuesday. The officials said macroeconomic issues will cover only about the first hour and half of the meeting and the rest will be on aid to Russia. Three Russian representatives led by Deputy Prime Minister and Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin will join in the final hour, they said. "Coordination on macroeconomic coordination has become easier with G-7 nations showing improvements in their economies," said a top Japanese official close to the closed-door meeting. But many analysts feel differently, citing the recent gap in credit stance stemming from the diverse state of the economy. The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Another Japanese official, accompanying Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, said the G-7 session is to "review the macroeconomic developments" after the February meeting in Germany. He said the recent rise in long-term rates among G-7 nations will certainly be discussed as one such development, but he noted that Fujii recognizes the recent U.S. credit tightening as "preemptive" measures to curb inflation. On currency rates, Fujii told reporters that he intends to stress again his concerns over the yen's sharp rise that may put a damper on the economy that is starting to improve. But he said, "Exchange levels are not for us (G-7 ministers) to decide." Otherwise, the G-7 financial leaders will concentrate on new commitments to Russia, possibly agreeing on new loans and debt rescheduling, to start implementing the 43 billion dollar package agreed to last April. He said such new commitments gathered attention after the recent decision by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to disburse the remaining 1.5 billion dollars of the 3 billion dollar loans to promote systemic transformation. A statement is unlikely to be issued, they said, confirming earlier remarks by U.S. Treasury [Secretary] Lloyd Bentsen, who chairs the meeting. Fujii and Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno will hold a joint news conference after the meeting. Before the G-7 session, Fujii will meet with Bentsen at 9:30 A.M., Japanese officials said. Fujii said he will explain to Bentsen the state of the Japanese with "things progressed" since the previous Frankfurt G-7 meeting in February. "We have moved one step forward," he said, citing a policy accord newly reached Friday by the ruling coalition parties before choosing Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as their candidate to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The accord endorsed a full-fledged tax reform, including permanent tax cuts and offsetting indirect tax hikes, to be decided in June and enacted by the end of the year. Meanwhile, a Japanese source said Fujii will again decline to predict the scale or any other details of the tax reform that is to be decided by the Diet. The source also said the finance minister will ask Bentsen to see from a longer run Japan's current account surplus already "clearly falling in terms of the yen and volume." Fujii is scheduled to leave for home Sunday after the meeting, failing to join the twice-yearly gatherings of the IMF and the World Bank due to a tight domestic schedule involving formation of a new cabinet.
