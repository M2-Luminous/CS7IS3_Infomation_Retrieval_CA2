FR940921-2-00019 FR940921-2-00017 [Project No. 1494&hyph;066 Oklahoma] Grand River Dam Authority; Notice of Availability of Environmental Assessment September 15, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's regulations 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47910), the Office of Hydropower Licensing (OHL) has reviewed the application for non-project use of project lands for the Pensacola Hydroelectric Project. The application proposes dredging 740 cubic yards of material from a site located at the Monkey Island area of Grand Lake O' The Cherokees, in Delaware County, Oklahoma. The staff prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the action. In the EA, staff concludes that approval of the non-project use of project lands would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the EA are available for review in the Reference and Information Center, Room 3308, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23305 Filed 9&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
