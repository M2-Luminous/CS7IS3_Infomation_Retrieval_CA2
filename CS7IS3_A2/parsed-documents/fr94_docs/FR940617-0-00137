FR940617-0-00137 FR940617-0-00026 EPA has decided to revise its proposed production factor method for determining annual limits. As commented upon, EPA's proposed production factor analysis did not take into consideration projected emission reductions for large nonroad CI engines. EPA estimated that the emission contribution for large nonroad CI engines is approximately half of the contribution for on-highway sources. However, EPA estimates that NO X emissions from nonroad engines will decrease by approximately 37 percent by the year 2025 or when a complete fleet turnover occurs. Therefore, EPA reevaluated its production factor analysis and determined that the production factor divisor should be 16,000. EPA has decided to retain the family factor method for determining annual limits. This method was proposed to help compensate for the expected low annual production per engine family and for the possible multitude of engine families with relatively few SEAs per manufacturer to check compliance. EPA estimates that the average annual production per engine family for large nonroad CI engines, even with the expanded engine family definition, will be less than one tenth and less than one twentieth the average production of on-highway HDE and combined LDV/LDT engine families respectively. Consequently, EPA believes the family factor in combination with the production factor is necessary to assign annual limits to large nonroad CI engine manufacturers. As in the on-highway program, a goal of the nonroad SEA program is to encourage manufacturers to perform self-auditing. Some manufacturers commented that EPA should develop specific guidelines for counting self-auditing against manufacturers' annual limits. Additionally, it was suggested that EPA should count audits conducted by CARB toward annual limits. EPA recognizes the time, effort and cost manufacturers expend on self-audit testing and considers the quality, scope and effectiveness of such programs when assigning audits to a manufacturer. However, EPA's on-highway HDE SEA program has had audit failures even when a manufacturer's self-auditing showed that engines were in compliance with standards. Consequently, EPA believes that spot checks of manufacturer's self-audit programs by SEAs are necessary. The criteria governing the assignment of audits are too numerous and interconnected to make specific guidelines relating self-auditing to annual limits useful. For instance, a manufacturer with a comprehensive self-audit program who is reluctant to remedy deficiencies and fails SEAs warrants continued attention by EPA just as a manufacturer with a minimal program is likely to receive few SEAs if it routinely designs and produces engines well below emission standards. Likewise, manufacturers who set unusually low FELs in averaging programs will be subject to extra scrutiny. Substantial consideration will be given to assembly line testing required by CARB on engine families sold nationwide when the CARB test protocols (for example, sampling plan) are as stringent as EPA's. While EPA will not reduce its annual limits based on CARB audits, it will work together with CARB to exchange emission test data and consequently more efficiently assess compliance with applicable standards. Manufacturers will be notified of SEAs by means of a test order. EPA proposed that the test order would specify the engine family to be audited, or EPA could specify an engine configuration or range of configurations from a family to be audited. Manufacturers commented that, by auditing engine families, EPA could be significantly increasing the SEA burden on manufacturers. However, as indicated in the NPRM, EPA planned to consider requests by manufacturers to exclude particular engines or configurations from test samples for reasons such as urgent customer orders or to minimize test cell set-up time. EPA still plans to consider those requests. EPA proposed that imported engines could be selected at ports of entry or storage locations in the U.S. SEA engines are typically selected from the point of final engine assembly or from a storage or shipping facility. Manufacturers commented that selecting foreign-produced engines at ports should be an option but not a requirement. Comments also indicated that port selections could significantly increase the manufacturers' SEA costs. However, as indicated in the NPRM, manufacturers could designate selection locations to minimize disruption and shipping costs. EPA would not likely select engines for SEAs that are only imported installed in equipment; instead, SEAs of those engines would usually occur during foreign trips by SEA staff. The total number of engines tested in an SEA will be dictated by the number of engines required to reach the statistically acceptable pass/fail decision within the sampling plan applied. As in the on-highway program, these sampling plans were designed to meet a 40 percent Acceptable Quality Level (AQL). EPA proposed to use the same sampling plans used for the on-highway HDE SEA program with two revisions. The proposed revisions were to include a sampling plan (Plan AA) for lower production engines and to permit the use of the on-highway sampling plan A on families with projected production between 20 and 99 engines. Plan AA was proposed as an option for families with projected annual production between 20 and 50 engines and to permit an audit pass decision in as few as three tests with a maximum of 20 tests. Manufacturers requested that EPA provide further flexibility in the use of sampling plans. It was requested that EPA make each sampling plan available for manufacturers regardless of the audited engine's projected annual production. It was also requested that EPA permit the use of CARB's low-volume sampling plan which permits a pass decision in as few as two tests and has a maximum test sample of ten engines. EPA is not adopting CARB's low-volume sampling plan for the SEA program. EPA believes this sampling plan's consumer risk is too great to justify its use in a federal emission compliance program. However, EPA may consider requests by manufacturers to terminate testing early during SEAs of low production families when the audit results are significantly and consistently below each applicable standard or FEL, and selection of additional engines would be difficult or cause a delay in shipment of customer-ordered engines, or the manufacturer's test facility does not have sufficient capacity to expeditiously conclude the SEA. As proposed, failure of an SEA may result in suspension or revocation of the certificate of conformity for that engine family. To have the certificate reinstated subsequent to a suspension, or reissued subsequent to a revocation, the manufacturer must demonstrate, by showing passing data that improvements, modifications, or replacement have brought the family into compliance. The regulations include hearing provisions which allow the manufacturer to challenge EPA's suspension or revocation decision based on application of the sampling plans or the manner in which tests were conducted.
