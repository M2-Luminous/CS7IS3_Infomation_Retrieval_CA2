Military officials said the clashes overnight Friday broke out after armed opposition rebels, identified as "ninjas," attacked an army camp at Bacongo. The army used heavy weapons to repel the submachine-gun toting rebels. But opposition spokesman Laurent Mann accused the members of the national police's ministerial reserve of attacking the opposition militia and "shooting at passers-by at close range." Mann said the number of casualties was much higher and five bodies had still not been retrieved from Bacongo as no Red Cross workers had been allowed in. The worst violence ended Saturday afternoon but witnesses said shots could still be heard at Bacongo Sunday morning. At least 93 people have died since new violence erupted in the southern neighborhoods of the Congolese capital between supporters of the government and the opposition in early December, according to a hospital tally.
