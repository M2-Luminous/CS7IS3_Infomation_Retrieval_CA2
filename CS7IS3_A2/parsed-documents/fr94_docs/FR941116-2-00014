FR941116-2-00014 FR941116-2-00007 [A&hyph;570&hyph;836] Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Glycine from the People's Republic of China AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan Strumbel, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;1442. PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION: We preliminarily determine that imports of glycine from the PRC are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on July 28, 1994 (59 FR 38435), the following events have occurred. On August 15, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination in this case. On August 18, 1994, the China Chamber of Commerce for Metals, Minerals, and Chemicals (CCCMMC) was given a questionnaire presentation. At this time, the DOC requested CCCMMC to provide a list of the producers and exporters of glycine in the PRC. On September 7, 1994, the CCCMMC requested an extension of the questionnaire responses until September 23, 1994. Counsel on behalf of Sinochem Shanghai Pudong Trading Corporation (Sinochem) and Dastech Inc. (Dastech) requested a further extension until October 3, 1994. On October 3, 1994, the Department once again requested that CCCMMC identify the universe of glycine producers and exporters in the PRC. On October 5, 1994, the Department contacted counsel for Sinochem and Dastech and was informed that these companies no longer intended to participate. On October 6, 1994, counsel for the petitioners requested that the Department issue an expedited preliminary determination. On October 17, 1994, the Department sent a letter to the CCCMMC requesting confirmation of the glycine producers' and exporters' intention not to participate in this investigation. On October 18, 1994, we received a letter in response to the Department's October 3, 1994 letter, stating that ``until now nobody wanted to defend the case.'' The letter did not provide any information with regard to the universe of glycine producers and exporters in the PRC. We have received no response to our October 17, 1994, letter. Scope of Investigation The product covered by this investigation is glycine which is a free-flowing crystalline material, like salt or sugar. Glycine is produced at varying levels of purity and is used as a sweetnener/taste enhancer, a buffering agent, reabsorbable amino acid, chemical intermediate, and a metal complexing agent. Glycine is currently classified under subheading 2922.49.4020 of the Harmonized Tariff schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). The scope of this investigation includes glycine of all purity levels. Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation is February 1994, through July 1994. Best Information Available Because no producers or exporters of glycine responded to our questionnaire, we are basing our determination on best information available (BIA) pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act, which provides that the Department shall use BIA when a company identified by the Department as a respondent refuses to provide requested information. In determining what rate to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions for those respondents who did not cooperate in an investigation. According to this methodology, as outlined in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from Belgium, 58 FR 37083 (July 9, 1993), when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company the higher of 1) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or 2) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. (See Allied Signal Aerospace Co. v. United States, 996 F. 2d 1185, 1191&hyph;92 (Fed. Cir. 1993).) Because there were no cooperative respondents in this investigation, we are assigning to all exporters, as BIA, a margin of 155.89 percent, the highest margin calculated in the petition, adjusted for methodological errors as explained in the Department's initiation notice. Suspension of Liquidation In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of glycine from the PRC that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margin, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.
