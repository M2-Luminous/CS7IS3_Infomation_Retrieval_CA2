What is your information, as you have been following the situation closely? [Al-Saqqaf] I doubt that the situation can be settled quickly because there is a relative balance of forces in equipment and number of fighters. [passage omitted] [Qallab] Sanaa says that what is taking place is an internal affair and that is why it rejected the Arab League's initiative. What, in your view, is the aim? [Al-Saqqaf] Actually, the 'Imran incidents had been escalated with the intention of liquidating and destroying the southern 3d Brigade and preventing continuation of the Egyptian-United Arab Emirates mediation which had reached practical steps toward easing the military and political crisis and paving the way for a gneral national reconciliation and a peaceful solution for the entire crisis. It is not true at all that the southern 3d Brigade which was in 'Imran, 60 km from Sanaa and isolated from the southern areas, was preparing to attack the capital, as the Presidential Council chairman claimed. [passage omitted] It has been proved that the attack on the Basuhayb Brigade last Wednesday was a prelude to the bombing of Aden last Thursday (two days later). It is clear from all these developments that the war decision was made at the end of last year, in December to be specific. There are documents indicating that all this took place in agreement with Saddam Husayn. The Yemenis noticed widespread presence of Iraqis in the Yemeni capital Sanaa in recent months. We have information that there is an Iraqi military advisory center in al-Hasbah area in Sanaa, supervised by a high-ranking Iraqi officer. [Qallab] Do you mean that the Iraqis are participating directly in the current battles? [Al-Saqqaf] Yes, and we have documents proving that they supervised the installation of missiles on the Munif mountain (in al-Hajariyah mountain range). Furthermore, anyone who closely examines the situation would see that the main feature of the regime in Sanaa is modelled after the way President Saddam Husayn Husayn structured his regime.
