All this transpires before highlighting the positive effect of the agreement, which often emerges in the long run. The statement by Finance Minister Ahmed Benbitour falls within this context. Benbitou stressed that the most important thing was the speed with which the loans obtained up to date from the IMF, in accordance with the agreement, will be used. Bachir Hedibel reports: [Hedibel] During the period following the Paris Club agreement, which is the same period preceded by the transitional agreement with the IMF, the government will work to focus its efforts on reducing the budget deficit, so the latter will reach 3.2 percent next year. This is the content of the statement made by the finance minister. Benbitour hopes today for a speedy use of the loans granted to Algeria by the IMF or other financial institutions, or in accordance with the agreement with Paris Club. [passage omitted]
