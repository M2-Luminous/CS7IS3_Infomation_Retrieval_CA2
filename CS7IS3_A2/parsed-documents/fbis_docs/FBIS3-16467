He emphasized that the matter was up to the Russian and Ukrainian presidents to decide. Baltin said so in response to the last week's remarks made by Vladimir Beskorovainiy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy, who said that "Ukraine no longer raises the possibility of transferring Black Sea Fleet ships to Russia as payment for debts accrued from oil and gas supplies." Beskorovainiy believed that the document signed in Massandra was a protocol of intent, not an agreement. "The fleet has to be split half and half before the end of 1995," Beskorovainiy emphasized. Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy, commented on Beskorovainiy's remarks by saying that the Massandra document "might be a protocol of intent, but it was signed by the presidents." "If these remarks had been made by Kravchuk, this would make all the difference," Kasatonov said. As he put it, "a political decision was made which recognized the interests of the world community as well as Russia. The world views Russia as a reliable and strong partner who is acting for peace, calm and stabilization." The presidents of Ukraine and Russia Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin signed an agreement in Mukholatka, near Yalta, whereby the Black Sea Fleet was to be the core of the Russian and Ukrainian navies. Until the two navies are formed the fleet was to be jointly commanded by the two presidents. The presidents signed another agreement in Moscow on June 17, 1993, on dividing the fleet half and half. Under their latest agreement signed in Massandra, southern Crimea, on September 3, 1993 Ukraine was to transfer its part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia as payment for supplies of Russian fuel. The specifics of the compensation mechanism and the use of naval bases in the Crimea was to be agreed on later through negotiations. The procedure of evaluating the fleet's assets was to be negotiated within a month, but the talks became deadlocked.
