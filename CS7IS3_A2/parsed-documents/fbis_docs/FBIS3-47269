The state defined this sector as one of the main domains on which efforts should be concentrated in economic construction from the beginning of the year and increased investment in the metal industry. Continuous roughing processes were newly built in the Chollima steel complex and the Hwanghae iron and steel complex, and the ferro-alloy workshop of the Puryong ferro-alloy complex was reconstructed on an expansion basis. As a results, the production of steel and pig iron increased 27 percent, and that of rolled steel 33 percent last year compared with the previous year, taking the Ministry of Metal Industry as a whole. The Kim Chaek iron and steel complex, a leading iron production base, kept production on a high level by introducing many valuable technical innovation proposals. At the Hwanghae iron and steel complex technical control of the metallurgical equipment was improved and advanced work methods were introduced to markedly increase iron and steel production while reducing fuel consumption. Ferro-alloy production last year increased 55 percent above the previous year at the Puryong ferro-alloy complex. The Musan mining complex, a gigantic ore supplier, turned out 450,000 more tons of iron headings in the period than the preceding year through massive excavation, transport and processing. All the iron and steel works are effecting a greater upsurge in production from the beginning of the new year to carry out tasks advanced by the great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year address.
