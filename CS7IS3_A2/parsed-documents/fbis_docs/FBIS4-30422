A preliminary contact for a North-South summit is to be held on 28 June at Panmunjom and a third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks will be held in Geneva early next month. Although the people consider such an abrupt change in the situation fortunate, they can hardly conceal their suspicion. North Korea showed a drastic change in its attitude so as to curve around sanctions directed against it by the UN Security Council into dialogue. Nevertheless, people are becoming more concerned about whether or not the North Korean nuclear problem will be solved peacefully through such an atmosphere of dialogue. As for the issue regarding a North-South summit toward which the government was somewhat hasty, will the top leaders of the North and the South actually sit together for the first time since the nation was divided? To what degree will the summit, when realized, contribute to removing factors increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula? These are questions the people are concerned about. Since the new government came to office, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has taken the initiative of leading government policy on the North Korean nuclear problem. This reporter met with Foreign Minister Han in his office. [Reporter Hwang Chae-hong] Since former U.S. President Carter visited North Korea, the North Korean nuclear issue has made a drastic turn from a phase of sanctions to that of dialogue. Both affirmative and negative assessments about Carter's visit to North Korea are seen even in the United States. What is our government's overall evaluation of his visit? [Minister Han Sung-chu] North Korea proposed a North-South summit and revealed the will to freeze nuclear development through former U.S. President Carter. Following this, North Korea agreed on a preliminary contact for a North-South summit, and confirmed its will to freeze nuclear development through a diplomatic channel. This being the case, our government feels that Mr. Carter's visit laid the foundation for a third round of North Korea-U.S. talks and provided a chance for a solution to the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue. However, the sincerity of North Korea's will to implement what it pledged is more important. Thus, the government will watch how the situation develops with keen interest and make efforts to solve the North Korean nuclear problem. [Hwang] What is your assessment of the reasons behind North Korea's prompt acceptance of the proposal for a preliminary contact on a North-South summit after having been passive in the past? [Minister Han] It seems that North Korea wanted to turn the situation in which sanctions against itself were discussed on a full scale, to a phase of dialogue. North Korea also indicated its sincerity by confirming the message it sent through Mr. Carter. [Hwang] Can we then say that North Korea yielded because of the sanctions discussed by the UN Security Council against itself? [Minister Han] Instead of using the word, "yield," which is partly related to the implementation of sanctions, we may say that North Korea was prompted by the necessity to turn the phase of sanctions into that of dialogue. [end Minister Han] Minister Han expressed his faith that we should view North-South relations from the standpoint that what is advantageous to North Korea is not always disadvantageous to us. Thus, he stressed that the recent change in North Korean attitude should not be viewed as "yielding" in an inevitable situation. [Hwang] What is your opinion on the possibility of a North-South summit? [Minister Han] It is higher than ever before. Judging from its response to our proposal for a preliminary contact, the North Korean side's motivation for realizing a North-South summit seems to be very great. [Hwang] We believe that if a summit is held, the North Korean nuclear issue, the issue of reuniting families separated between the North and the South, expansion of exchanges between people, and a historic conclusion of the Korean war, can be discussed at the summit. Which does the government plan on giving priority? [Minister Han] The government has decided to push the summit ahead without any conditions. Therefore, we will not clearly designate any agenda items in advance. In view of the prevailing situation, elimination of tensions created by the nuclear problem, improvement of North-South relations, expansion of cooperation, and some other issues may be broadly discussed, thus seeking methods for laying a foundation for reunification in the end. Since the joint denuclearization declaration and the basic agreement were already adopted by the North and the South, the nuclear issue and improvement of relations may serve as a basis for discussion. [end Minister Han] Minister Han is deeply involved in the government's decisionmaking as a full member of the Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council. He answered questions on the North-South summit very cautiously. Concerning the prospect for success of the summit, he stressed that the meeting between the two sides itself is of epoch-making significance. Thus, the result of the talks should not be evaluated in black-and-white terms, but the meeting itself should be given significance. Thus, if the two sides agree on even general matters, such as subsequent talks, a promise to cooperate with each other in the future, and so forth, the atmosphere of dialogue will be significantly improved. [Hwang] Let us turn the topic to a third round of North Korean-U.S. talks. The United States announced that it will hold a third round of high-level talks with North Korea early next month. What are the targets that both the United States and the ROK will pursue at the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks? [Minister Han] The third round of talks will be focused on totally eliminating suspicion of North Korea's nuclear development. The ROK and U.S. position is that security and various other political and economic issues that have been previously raised by North Korea can be broadly discussed if the North Korean nuclear problem is completely solved. [Hwang] It was learned, however, that the United States has abandoned efforts to examine North Korea's past nuclear activities, and in return, has demanded that North Korea freeze its nuclear development. As a result, people now doubt that there is agreement in views between the ROK and the United States. Is this true, Mr. Minister? [Minister Han] It is the firm position of the ROK and the United States that transparency of the past, present, and future nuclear activities of North Korea should be ensured by all means for a complete solution to the North Korean nuclear problem. It is true, however, that there was a debate on whether the issue of verification of past activities should be a precondition for a third round of North Korean-U.S. talks or be discussed during the talks. From the tactical point of view, both the ROK and the United States agreed on resumption of North Korean-U.S. dialogue by making North Korea promise to freeze its nuclear development, which is urgently required, and on a thoroughgoing discussion of the issue of verifying its past nuclear activities during the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks. Thus, there is no difference in views between the two countries. [end Minister Han] Minister Han stressed that the North Korean nuclear problem, which started due to suspicion of North Korea's past nuclear activities and the UN Security Council began to discuss sanctions due to the suspicion of North Korean past nuclear activities, has not been removed. Therefore, the act of abandoning verification of the past is the same as abandoning the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty itself. This being the case, not only the ROK and the United States, but also the international community will never overlook North Korea's past nuclear activities. [Hwang] As North Korea unilaterally replaced fuel rods in the five-megawatt reactor, some people wonder if there are technical means to assure North Korea's past nuclear transparency. Do you think special inspections [tukpyol sachal] on undeclared facilities could thoroughly verify past nuclear activities? [Minister Han] Past nuclear activities could be verified if North Korea actively cooperates by accepting special inspections of the two undeclared facilities, which North Korea insists are military facilities, and by correctly reporting the quantity of extracted plutonium. We will continue to exert efforts in various ways so that North Korea shows a positive attitude in resolving this issue through the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks. [Hwang] North Korea has insisted that the nuclear issue and the improvement of North Korean-U.S. relations should be resolved in a package deal at the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks. How do you plan to respond to this? [Minister Han] North Korea's package solution proposes a simultaneous exchange of all the issues related to North Korea's nuclear suspicion. The problem with the proposal is that North Korea is bargaining its obligations as a member of the international community and obligations in North-South relations. North Korea has made it difficult to resolve the issue in a phased manner by binding the prerequisite obligations and fundamental obligations in one bundle. We will exert a wide range of efforts to resolve the issue through dialogue, including the improvement of North Korean-U.S. relations under the precondition of the resolution of the nuclear issue, while creating the circumstances for North Korea to fulfill its inspection obligations. [Hwang] The Democratic Liberal Party recently urged the government to reconsider the declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula if North Korea delays the assurance of nuclear transparency. What is the government's position regarding public opinion urging nuclear independence and the reconsideration of the declaration on the denuclearization? [Minister Han] The government has consistently adhered to the earnest implementation of the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula because the implementation of the denuclearization declaration is the basis for achieving nuclear-free peace and order on the Korean peninsula, as well as in Northeast Asia and the entire world. It is true that people are saying that the joint declaration on denuclearization is useless when suspicion of North Korea's nuclear weapons development is escalating. The government's position on the compliance of the denuclearization declaration remains unchanged. Under the principle of the parties concerned in the North and the South, North Korea should respond to our efforts to implement the denuclearization declaration, including mutual inspection [sangho sachal], before it is too late. [end Minister Han] Although the government has been criticized for alternating between hard-line and moderate policies on the North Korean nuclear issue, Minister Han has adhered to the "resolution through negotiations" theory and insisted on seeking peaceful resolutions through dialogue and negotiations since the beginning of the nuclear issue. Asked if the government's policy on the North Korean nuclear issue has not been based on national consensus, Minister Han said it is very difficult because "public opinion is distinctively divided and one policy is criticized both as hard-line and moderate." How the North Korean nuclear issue develops should depend on the result of the North-South summit talks and the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks.
