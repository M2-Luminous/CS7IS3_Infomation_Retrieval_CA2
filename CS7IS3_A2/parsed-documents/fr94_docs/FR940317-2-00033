Take notice that on March 8, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, Third Revised Sheet No. 344, proposed to be effective March 8, 1994. TGPL states that the referenced tariff sheet has been revised to reflect changes in the list of affiliated marketing companies as a result of the sale and reorganization of certain assets by Transco Energy Company as well as a change in the list of directors shared by TGPL and Transco Gas Marketing Company. TGPL states that the tariff sheet has been revised to reflect the fact that TGPL no longer shares any building or building services with any of its affiliated marketing companies. TGPL states that it has also revised its corporate code of conduct to reflect the changes outlined above. In addition, TGPL states that the requirement for the contemporaneous disclosure of gas sales and gas marketing information if such information is provided to an affiliate was eliminated from TGPL's corporate code of conduct in accordance with Order No. 497&hyph;E. TGPL states that it is serving copies of the filing on its customers, state commissions and other interested parties. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with ยง385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before March 18, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
