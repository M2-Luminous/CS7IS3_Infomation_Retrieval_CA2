"I would like to contemplate the decision (on a cabinet reshuffle) from a comprehensive point of view," Hosokawa said at a ministerial meeting. Speculation has been surfacing that Hosokawa might make changes to his cabinet following Tuesday's approval by the government of a 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 which begins April 1. Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, a key strategist in the coalition government, also supported Hosokawa's policy, saying, "It is the premier's exclusive right (to reshuffle the cabinet), so I will follow his judgment entirely." There have been increasing rumors that, if a new cabinet is formed, Hosokawa will replace Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, head of Sakigake, and six other cabinet ministers of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Takemura, along with the six SDP ministers, expressed dissatisfaction earlier this month with Hosokawa's handling of the consumption tax issue as a quick solution to offset tax shortfalls created by income tax breaks. Asked about the possibility of a cabinet reshuffle, Takemura told a regular press conference on Tuesday that "although it is the premier's prerogative it is still preferable to get people's understanding." Fearing the dismissal of their party head Takemura, Sakigake held an emergency meeting of its Diet members Tuesday morning and decided to oppose the idea of a cabinet reshuffle at this time. Sakigake officials also hinted the party might withdraw from the coalition government if Hosokawa forces the reshuffle. Late Monday, Hosokawa urged SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama to cooperate with his plan for a cabinet shakeup that he is considering for early implementation, political sources said. In his talks with Murayama, Hosokawa asked him to enter the cabinet in place of former SDP chairman Sadao Yamahana who is now in charge of political reform, the sources said. Earlier on Tuesday, Hosokawa told reporters that he was neutral on the question of reshuffling his six-month-old cabinet within the day.
