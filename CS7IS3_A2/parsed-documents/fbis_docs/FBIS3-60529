Fifty-two sick people and 54 carriers of this infection have been hospitalized. The sanitary and epidemiological station sees the cause of this terrible disease in migrational processes. Cases of diphtheria have also been registered in neighboring Kalmykia. The oblast administration has allocated approximately 50,000,000 rubles for emergency measures to combat the epidemic. Vaccinations have been given to 25 percent of the children and 80 percent of those in the high-risk group. According to the law, which specifies that each territory can draw up its own sanitary regulations, compulsory vaccinations for doctors, students, teachers, shop workers, and the staffs of public catering and motor transport enterprises have been ordered. But, in spite of all the work to provide the public with information, epidemiologists are concerned at the passive attitude of the population and the strange apathy towards their health.
