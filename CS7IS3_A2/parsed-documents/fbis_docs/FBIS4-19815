"I would be satisfied if we managed to stop unemployment this year," Kohl said on Wednesday [20 April] night at a conference sponsored by FREIE PRESSE in Chemnitz. That was all one could expect from the current developments. In his approximately one-hour lecture, Kohl emphasized that economic recovery in the new laender had started: "Although the flourishing landscapes will not come within four or five years, they are on their way," he said. Kohl said that it was a "very tough experience" to see how difficult the Germans were finding it to achieve internal unity. The chancellor said that people in both east and west obviously became more alienated than had been thought.
