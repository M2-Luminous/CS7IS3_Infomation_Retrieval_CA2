This was reflected in the ASEAN countries' economic vision at the end of the APEC finance ministers meeting at Kahala Hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii 16 to 18 March. The APEC forum was also attended by ASEAN finance ministers. Indonesian Finance Minister Mari'e Muhammad told newsmen that ASEAN member countries remain committed to strengthening their own formal regional cooperation. He said that the ASEAN finance ministers discussed not only issues concerning APEC, but also ASEAN's financial needs. However, developing countries like Indonesia had a stronger bargaining power at the limited APEC forum. According to Dr. Budiono, a member of the Indonesian delegation, Indonesia's and Malaysia's views had a strong bearing at the APEC forum, but their views are not likely to have any influence in international forums such as GATT meetings. The APEC finance ministers meeting in Honolulu, which was a follow up to the summit held in Seattle in November 1993, was actually an informal meeting for participants to exchange ideas and information. A similar ministerial-level meeting will be held in Indonesia this year. One of the causes that led to the formation of APEC several years ago was the doubt that the impasse in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations could be broken. Now that the Uruguay Round has reached a successful conclusion, APEC hopes that the agreements reached at the Uruguay Round of GATT trade talks will be observed and implemented. The APEC forum hopes that various kinds of protectionism imposed on goods will be lessened, considering that the international market is now moving towards trade liberalization in line with the agreements concluded at the GATT talks. Any form of protectionism imposed on Indonesian goods will increase their production costs and this will in turn weaken their competitiveness in the international market. Currently, almost all countries are racing to step up the competitiveness of their goods as a means of wooing foreign investment. For this, they prefer to reduce complicated bureaucratic procedures because they will turn away investors as well. Indonesia could take advantage of the APEC finance ministers forum so that the rules governing foreign investment in the country will be observed by member countries. Even though it is difficult to impose sanctions against the countries that violate the rules, those belonging to APEC are still bound to respect them. The trade dispute between the United State and Japan and their different economic interests also highlighted the APEC forum in Hawaii. It is common knowledge that the two countries contribute 80 percent of the total industrial waste found in this region, while their export products dominate more than half of the world trade. In this regard, will the continued economic dispute between the United States and Japan make APEC less significant? Indonesia could have played a mediator's role at the recent APEC forum. However, it appears that this is not going to be an easy task because the two conflicting parties are still sticking strongly to their stance on world trade and it is difficult to help them reach a consensus. It seems that we still need time before reaching regional cooperation on the basis of a need for a coalition to renew the trading system and promote multilateral economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. The term "Pacific Age" has long been mentioned in articles and reports written by academics as an attempt to show that the world center is shifting from the Atlantic to the Asia- Pacific region. However, in reality, attention to the implications of the global economy, which is marked by increasingly stiff competition and protectionism, has lessened the need to institutionalize the APEC forum. Therefore, it is better to take a more realistic approach to respecting the diversity of the region.
