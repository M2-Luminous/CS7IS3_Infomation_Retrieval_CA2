However, a state's security interest exemption cannot be broader in scope or less stringent than the security interest exemption provided for in 40 CFR part 280, subpart I. (b) A state program will be considered to be no less stringent than, and as broad in scope as, the federal program provided that the state provision: (1) Mirrors the security interest exemption provided for in 40 CFR part 280, subpart I; or (2) Achieves the same effect as provided by the following key criteria: (i) A holder, meaning a person who maintains indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest in a petroleum UST or UST system, who does not participate in the management of the UST or UST system as defined under §280.210 and who does not engage in petroleum production, refining, and marketing as defined under §280.200(a) is not: (A) An ``owner'' of a petroleum UST or UST system for purposes of compliance with 40 CFR part 280 requirements; (B) An ``operator'' of a petroleum UST or UST system for purposes of compliance with 40 CFR part 280 requirements prior to foreclosure or its equivalents, provided the holder is not in control of or does not have responsibility for the daily operation of the UST or UST system; (C) An ``operator'' of a petroleum UST or UST system for purposes of compliance with 40 CFR part 280 corrective action and financial responsibility requirements after foreclosure or its equivalents, provided the holder complies with the requirements of §280.230(b).
