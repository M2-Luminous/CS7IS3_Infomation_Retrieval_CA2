Spokesman Shen Guofang said negotiations are being held with the U.S. about resuming China's status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, although the U.S. is an important nation in GATT, it is only one of the 105 signatory countries, Shen said during the ministry's weekly news conference. Shen said that China is willing to keep friendly relations with Britain on the basis of equality and mutual respect. But he criticized the recent report released by a committee in the UK House of Commons. Shen said the report defended the "erroneous" attitudes of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten and disregarded basic facts about the HK issue. Also, he said China maintains that the crisis over inspecting possible nuclear sites in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should be settled through talks. This message has been delivered to U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, the spokesman said. In other news from the briefing, Shen said: --The government does not want the recent ship fire on Qiandao Lake, Zhejiang, that killed 24 Taiwanese and eight mainlanders to damage the cultural ties across the Taiwan Straits; --A National People's Congress (NPC) delegation headed by the Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun of the Standing Committee will leave for New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Australia on Monday.
