Addressing the 11th ministerial conference of the non-aligned countries recently held in Cairo, F.M. Cam noted that in an interdependent and constantly changeable world, regional and sub-regional cooperation was of vital importance and great practical significance. The Vietnamese chief diplomat noted: `Recently the East Sea area has witnessed some events that caused great worries to public opinion in the region and the world, particularly to us because these events happened on our country's continental shelf and exclusive economic zone. The international laws demand all countries to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity of others including their continental shelf and exclusive economic zone. We reiterate Vietnam's sovereignty as a coastal country, and the Vietnamese people's determination to protect sovereignty over their continental shelf and exclusive economic zone in accordance with the international laws, especially the 1982 Convention on Sea of United Nations. At the same time, we reaffirm Vietnam's goodwill stance to settle all differences on the above-said principles, especially the principles of the 1982 Sea Convention...' On the human right issue, Mr. Cam noted that the draft final statement of the conference highlighted the movement's fundamental viewpoints, the principles of independence, sovereignty, self-determination and freedom to choose the path of development of all nations. He stressed that the movement's official documents relating to human rights should reserve a worthy part to the right of national development as a fundamental human right. We cannot accept the use of human rights as condition for relations among countries. This, he said, does not start from the principle of respect for national sovereignty and equality among nations moreover it violates the rights of development of all nations. The Vietnamese foreign minister stressed it is the people of each country who have their rights to judge and push ahead the implementation of human rights in their own countries. During his stay in the Egyptian capital, F.M. Nguyen Manh Cam met with foreign ministers and head delegates of a number of countries including Egypt, Cuba, India, Laos, Cambodia, the ASEAN Cam met with foreign ministers and head delegates of a number of South Africa.
