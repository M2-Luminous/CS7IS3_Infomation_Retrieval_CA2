Those who died were followers of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) who were participating in a large caravan that was attacked by unidentified assailants. The dead individuals are Dr. Edgard de la Rosa, 29, and Nelson Nunez, 44. It was reported that Nunez was the bodyguard of Joaquin Sanchez, who is the PRD candidate for mayor of La Vega. The PRD accused the followers of President Joaquin Balaguer and of the ruling Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) of having opened fire on the caravan with heavy-caliber weapons. Spokesmen for the opposition party said that since the campaign began last 16 March, seven of their followers have been murdered in various places and over 100 have been injured. Today, PRD presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez urged the PRSC and President Balaguer to sign a pact to halt violence and "prevent further bloodshed after the 16 May elections." Pena Gomez also proposed that none of the parties that will participate in the elections declare victory before the Central Electoral Board (JCE) makes the official announcement. The PRD also asked the Catholic Church to mediate so that this pact be signed and "no Dominican fall victim to political violence." On 24 April, a 23-year-old woman was shot twice in the head and killed when a PRD caravan was attacked in one sector of Santo Domingo. Yesterday's incident occurred after the conclusion of a PRD regional meeting when a large number of followers were returning to La Vega. The shots were apparently made with an automatic weapon. The wounded were taken to hospitals in La Vega and Santiago. La Vega is some 160 km north of Santo Domingo.
