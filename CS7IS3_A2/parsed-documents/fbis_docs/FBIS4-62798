Our correspondent continues on the same theme. [Deykun] Starting from 1922, foreign exile became a form of punishment for crimes in the USSR. It looks as if now emigration is becoming a punishment for the state itself. Its present wave, the fourth one according to specialist, is economic emigration. According to the Labor Ministry figures, some 100,000 people leave Russia every year. Most are skilled workers, qualified specialists, and artists. The most alarming feature is the brain drain from theoretical science and the defense complex. After all, Western economies now accept only highly qualified migrants. Another alarming feature is that one migrant in three takes a child with him/her. This trend is on the increase against the backdrop of an already adverse demographic situation. Where then do former Russian citizens move to? Mostly, to Germany. In the past three years more than one half of emigre's from this country have settled there. The United States is pursuing a more cautious immigration policy. Between 1991 and 1993, some 40,000 Russian nationals settled there. Emigration to the Promised Land has dropped sharply--probably because, according to Israeli sociologists, only eight percent of emigrants from the CIS managed to integrate completely into society. Studies conducted in this country show that eight percent of Russian nationals do not rule out the possibility of leaving for good. They are mostly town-dwellers, male, aged between 25 and 29, graduates. In the past three years, according to official figures alone, 300,000 former Russian citizens have bidden farewell to their homeland. That amounts to the entire population of a city the size of Penza. [video shows street scenes, people at the airport]
