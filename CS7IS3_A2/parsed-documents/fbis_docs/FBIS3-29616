"Artificially manipulated movements are undesirable," Fujii said, adding that this would be discussed at a meeting of G-7 finance ministers and central bankers on Saturday in Germany. Speaking at a regular press briefing after a morning cabinet meeting, Fujii was referring to the yen's recent sharp advance against the dollar on speculations over U.S. comments tolerating the yen's rise. But Fujii said, "I'm not thinking at the moment" of requesting a statement over the yen's recent sharp movements. He reiterated that the G-7 ministers would discuss their earlier accord to cooperate in keeping stable currency rates reflecting economic fundamentals. Considering the tax issue, Fujii said he would try to explain again to the U.S. side that Japan is to implement a "full-fledged" tax reform by the year-end. U.S. officials have said the 6 trillion yen tax cuts limited to a single year would not be enough to prop up Japan's domestic demand to curb trade imbalance. Fujii repeated that the tax cuts were conducted as an "emergency measure" and the ruling coalition leaders have shown "a direction for full-fledged" reform by agreeing to set a "balanced tax system in income, assets and consumption" by the year-end. Meanwhile, he said that discussions are under way over boosting a 10-year program of spending 430 trillion yen in public works as one option for Japan's market-opening measures. But he stressed that financial sources must be secured, and also rejected increasing construction bonds which he noted are "better than deficit-covering bonds but are the same in terms of national debt." The Finance Ministry estimated in the fiscal 1994 budget plan that Japan's outstanding balance of government bonds would top 200 trillion yen.
