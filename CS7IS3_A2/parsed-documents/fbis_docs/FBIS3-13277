He referred to the magnificence of the Islamic revolution in Iran and its influence on world Muslims. He said: By inducig a new mood in Muslims, the Islamic revolution of Iran has brought about a great transformation in the world. He added: By creating the cancerous cell of Israel, the enemies of Islam had intended to obliterate Islam from the face of the earth, in particular from the Middle East region. However, the people of Palestine, Lebanon, and the other Islamic lands, inspired by the lofty aspirations of Iran's Islamic revolution, have made life difficult for their enemies, particularly for the regime occupying Israel. Today we clearly witness the impact of the Islamic revolution on the lifestyle of these people and on the tactics they adopt for their struggles. The Majles speaker strongly denied allegations made by the western mass media charging that the Islamic Republic of Iran is physically present in the Islamic revolutionary movements of Egypt, Palestine, Algeria, and other Islamic countries. He said: What the western mass media call Iran's intervention is in fact the presence of the Islamic revolutionary spirit of the people of Iran in the hearts and minds of the nations or in other words it is the export of the culture of Iran's Islamic revolution to these countries. Referring to the recent crime of the Zionist regime, he condemned the silence of international forums, in particular the United Nations and its Human Rights Commission, toward such an atrocity. The Majles speaker then praised the people for their extensive presence in the international Jerusalem Day rallies. He stressed: Today all the pressures exerted by arrogance with the aim of destroying Islam are chiefly directed against the Islamic Republic of Iran. However, our people once again showed today that to safeguard and defend the values of Islam and the revolution, they intend to continue their struggle and remain steadfast in the face of all problems.
