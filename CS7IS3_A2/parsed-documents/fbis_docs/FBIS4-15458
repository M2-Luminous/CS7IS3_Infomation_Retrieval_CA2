Kozyrev called for "Latvia signing as soon as possible a package of agreements with Russia so that bilateral relations could be significantly improved and Russian troops pulled out of that republic by August 31." He added, "we also expect Estonia which has serious problems with Russia to move towards the signing of agreements. The ball is now in the Estonians' court." He said that Russia "would like to resolve the Russo-Estonian border issue through cooperation but we have had no positive signals from the Estonian authorities. The Swedish foreign minister emphasized her country's view that the Russian troops had to be pulled out soon and completely from the Baltic countries. "We also welcome Russia's desire to have appropriate agreements with the Baltic countries. I hope that such agreements will be reached with both Latvia and Estonia. What is important is that it happens before August 31 which should become the final deadline for withdrawal of Russian troops." In her words, Sweden was prepared to help Russia with housing for the servicemen leaving the Baltic countries but would like specific agreements on troop withdrawal come first.
