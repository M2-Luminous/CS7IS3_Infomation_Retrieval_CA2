Reporting to the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) Thursday, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said the Ministry will expand its special recruitment program to strengthen its language ability and international economic and trade expertise. Revising the current inefficient qualification procedures of the supernumerary appointment system, Hong said the written test for English and law will be replaced by curriculum vitae screening and interviews. The Ministry may also introduce thesis testing in English and economics for the exam's second round, requiring that the economics questions be answered in English as well. In order to make the most of Korea's overseas missions, the Ministry is to set up computer linkages with the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA), the Korea Foreign Trade Association (KFTA), the Bank of Korea and other organizations with offices abroad. Noting the government's trade channels are scattered among 60 divisions in 20 agencies, the Ministry will seek to absorb all trade negotiating power to provide for consistent and effective decision- making and implementation. To raise the diplomatic force's efficiency, the government will reduce overseas missions to 130 or 135 from the current 141. It will also refrain from posting grade-three or higher officials from other government agencies than the Foreign Ministry in overseas missions to prevent abuse of manpower and budget.
