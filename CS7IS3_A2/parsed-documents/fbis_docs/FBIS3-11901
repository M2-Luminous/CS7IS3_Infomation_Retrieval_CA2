In a meeting with Vo Tran Chin, member of the Politburo of the Vietnamese Communist Party (PCU) and its first secretary in this city, Robaina said that changes being implemented in his country are carried out under strong pressures, a permanent threat, and a pitiless blockade by the United States. During the last stretch of his official tour covering eight countries of Asia and Southeast Asia, the Cuban foreign minister indicated that there are some risks that must be taken in every transformation process. "It would be much worse to engage in mistakes because we did not implement the needed changes," he added. In commenting on the impact on Cuba of a possible lifting of the U.S. economic blockade, Robaina emphasized that such a step would entail a new type of challenge "which would not be strictly related to problems of food and welfare, but to issues related to morals, values, and principles." The Cuban Communist Party [PCC] Politburo member stressed that Cuba is quite clear as to its final objective and will never back away from what it has accomplished so far. "In the economic sphere we are implementing many changes and there are still many more to be taken," he stated. In addition, we want to receive firsthand input from a brother country such as Vietnam to which we are united not only through economic ties, but as result of a historical, timely, and open relationship," he added. In expanding on the issue, Robaina commented that Cuba is about to start a process of recovery that depends on endeavor and work, without having to depend on one single commercial partner, by diversifying its economy as well as its foreign relations. "Cuba is asking from the world what it professes for the world, understanding and respect," he declared. The head of the Cuban diplomacy stressed that if there is something that gets his attention with respect to Vietnam's experiences, it is the manner in which the CPV controls and directs the renovation process. On other hand, Vo Tran Chin commented that currently there are many aspects both countries can exchange in order to overcome the prevailing situation. Before concluding his stay in this city, the Cuban delegation will meet tomorrow with leaders of the southern city and will tour sites of economic interest.
