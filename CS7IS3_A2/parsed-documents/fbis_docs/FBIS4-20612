Fabricates Large Aperture Y-Based Superconducting Thin Film Quickly, Advantageous for Industrial Applications 94FE0283E Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO in Japanese 6 Dec 93 p 4 --FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0283E Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO Japanese CSO [Text] A research group led by Professor Toyonobu Yoshida of Tokyo University's Engineering Department recently succeeded in fabricating a yttrium-base superconducting thin film on a strontium-titanium-oxygen (STO) substrate, using a heat plasma/flash vaporization technique. When this method is used, subsequent processing usually is not required to manifest superconductivity and a yttrium-base superconducting thin film of large area can be produced in an extremely short time, so it has great industrial merit as well. Research already has started on specific applications, and this research group plans to do applied research aimed at finding other uses. Professor Yoshida, et al., have succeeded in synthesizing a YBaCuO (yttrium-barium-copper-oxygen) high-temperature superconducting thin film with a plasma process known as heat plasma/flash vaporization. With this method, 10[.sup]18[/] oxygen atoms, which have higher reactivity than ECR plasma, are flashed at the rate of 1 square centimeter (cm) per second and metal film formation is carried out in a gaseous state. The research group mixed particles of an alloy of vanadium-silicon and niobium-silicon, applied 40 kilowatt heat plasma/flash vaporization, and in 15 minutes formed a superconducting thin film 1 to 2 microns thick in the shape of a cylinder 14 cm in diameter on the STO substrate. Study of the thin film confirmed that it was YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]x[/], 123 [composition ratio], and in superconductive phase. 10[.sup]6[/] A (angstroms) per square cm superconductivity was confirmed. It is said that for the substrate, magnesium oxide or zirconia also are possible instead of STO. Additionally, with this method, the after-processing that is usually essential for high-temperature superconductors is not necessary. It is thought that what demonstrates superconductivity is slow cooling in the oxygen and that the reason a large thin film can be formed in such a short time probably is that accumulation speed is faster because in radicals, cluster-like coating occurs. Some of Professor Yoshida's group has begun joint research with companies on specific uses, and it is said that prospects for development have been confirmed. High-temperature superconductivity research samples certainly do not require after-processing and this leads to cost reduction. This advantage in processing has raised expectations for expanding the uses of this superconducting thin film.
