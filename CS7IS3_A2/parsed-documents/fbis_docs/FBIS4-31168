On the right bank of the Drina River they are just a few hundred meters from the town, while on the left bank they are still within 2.5 kilometers of the center of town. The quibbling over whether these are soldiers, police, or armed civilians is more than pointless. When all is said and done uniforms have never killed anyone in this war. [passage omitted]
