Filipovich, reporting from Yekaterinburg under the heading "Meetings": "They Take Away One Life After Another" [Text] The number of murders in the oblast has increased by a factor of more than 2.5 over the past five years, and in Yekaterinburg there has been a threefold increase. This was discussed at a meeting of oblast law enforcement agencies. In 1992 the oblast reported 898 homicides (an increase of 54.6 percent over the previous year). In 1993 there were 1,097 homicides in the oblast, 319 of them in Yekaterinburg. In the oblast capital more than 30 murders were committed with firearms (rifles and sawed-off shotguns), and in 61 cases the perpetrators attempted to conceal their actions by dismembering and concealing the bodies. The circumstances under which more than 20 murders occurred indicate that they were contract killings, i.e. carried out by professionals. The oblast's murder conviction rate is on a par with the Russia-wide average, but in 1992 there were 160 unsolved murders, and 248 last year. Analysis and investigative practices connected with these personal crimes, the most serious and most threatening to society, were the focus of attention at a joint meeting of law enforcement agencies held at the oblast procuracy. Those attending included Ivan Ovcharuk, oblast court chairman, Vladislav Tuykov, oblast procurator, Vladimir Demin, head of the oblast Internal Affairs Administration, and Gennadiy Voronov, head of the oblast branch of the Federal Counterintelligence Service. The personnel issue seems to be particularly acute. There is constant turnover among investigators, with the professional core eroding away. Currently, of the 153 investigators working for the procuracy one in three has been on the job less than a year. The situation is no better among personnel in the oblast's criminal investigation division, either; there 45 percent of personnel have no training for the job they are doing. Meanwhile, the operational situation over the past two months of this year has been a difficult one, with 190 reported murder cases, or 20 more than in the same period last year. All these conclusions convincingly attest to the need to establish specialized units to investigate murder cases, and the government of the Russian Federation should adopt decisions toward that end.
