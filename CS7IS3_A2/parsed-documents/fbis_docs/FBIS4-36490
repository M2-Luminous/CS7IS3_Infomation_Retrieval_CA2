FBIS4-36490 "drnes111_m_94010" FBIS-NES-94-111 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 JORDAN Minister on Telephonic Links With Autonomous Areas Minister on Telephonic Links With Autonomous Areas JN0806094694 Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic 7 Jun 94 pp 1, 21 JN0806094694 Amman AL-RA'Y Arabic BFN [Report by 'Isam Qadamani] [Text] Minister of Communications Dr. Tariq al-Suhaymat has reiterated Jordan's willingness to fully cooperate and coordinate with the Palestinian National Authority [PNA] in the areas of post and communications. In statements to AL-RA'Y, the minister added that Jordan's Ministry of Communications has supplied the PNA with a copy of the Ministry's structural organization, as well as job descriptions of the Ministry's components, sections, and institutions at the request of PNA Minister of Post and Communications 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, who held talks with several Ministry officials in this regard. Al-Ashhab also obtained details about the Jordanian telephone system. Dr. al-Suhaymat added that the Palestinian side requested to benefit from the Jordanian expertise so that Palestinian cadres may learn from them. He noted that Jordan will provide the Palestinian self-rule authority with experts, technicians, and engineers in the field of postal services and communications. Additionally, Jordan will provide training to several PNA employees working in this field at Jordanian institutions. Al-Suhaymat indicated that the talks with al-Ashhab also touched on effecting a direct telephonic linkage between the Jordanian telephone network and the network expected to be established in Gaza and Jericho. He asserted Jordan's readiness to implement this linkage once the PNA requests this. When queried further on the issue, Dr. al-Suhaymat said that Jordan will effect a direct telephonic linkage with the Palestinian side only in Gaza and Jericho at present, and in the West Bank later. He noted that there will not be any kind of telephonic linkages with or through Israel pending the outcome of the peace talks. He added: "It is premature to speak of a linkage with Israel at present." Dr. al-Suhaymat indicated that Jordan has officially and repeatedly urged the world states not to relay telephone calls from Israel to Jordan. With respect to cooperation in the field of postal services, the minister of communications said that Jordan, in talks with the Palestinians, has expressed its full readiness to transport the mail coming from various parts of the world to the autonomous areas via the King Husayn Bridge and vice versa in accordance with the norms and methods currently in force. Dr. al-Suhaymat added that the Palestinian self-rule authority must obtain an international telephonic code for its communications so that it may gain complete independence from Israel in this regard. He went on to say that this would be less costly than using the Israeli network. The minister indicated that Jordan will witness great developments in the field of communications once peace is achieved. He added that the Communications Corporation is making enormous efforts to implement its projects over the next few months to prepare for the start of the 21st century.
