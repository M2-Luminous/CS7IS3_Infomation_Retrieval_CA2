PRD Deputy Roberto Robles Garnica rejected the possibility that the rebels, who rose up in arms in Chiapas in southeastern Mexico, will participate in the presidential elections to be held on 21 August 1994. The deputy said he was pleased that a peasant movement had arisen in Chiapas because they are expressing what peasants throughout the country have been demanding for decades. He underscored that the armed conflict has made a significant change in Mexican politics. Robles also stated that it has been said that the EZLN is only fighting for four small zones but that this is an attempt to oversimplify events, as it has been proven that their demands are the ones of all poor Indians and peasants. Despite this, he insisted, it will be difficult for the EZLN to participate in the next federal elections, "because if they become a party it would a local one." However, Robles Garnica admitted that the Zapatist rebels could support one of the presidential candidates. He said, however, that he did not care to comment on how they could go about entering politics.
