A number of easy-going Tunisian soldiers and suspicious-looking Palestinian bodyguards were scrutinizing the visitors, who, during the night, had been summoned from their hotel, where they had been waiting for the indefinite hour of the interview granted by the chairman of the Palestinian National Council. This is the name of the new authority ruling over the Gaza and Jericho autonomous territories. With my friend Bernard Regnier, we waited for a long time for the "Open sesame!" to be announced by one of 'Arafat's faithful companions. It was no longer the liberation movement leader who received me, and who, last October when we first met displayed a Lorraine cross which he is said to have worn for the past 27 years, but Palestine's new president. French Model Although his black eyes were circled with red, betraying the fatigue felt by this indomitable man, 'Arafat laughed willingly. He laughed when I quoted Max Weber: "A state is recognized when it has the monopoly of legitimate violence." If we add autonomy (that is to say, etimologically speaking, the power to decree its own laws), a territory over which a single authority now rules, and international recognition (by 127 countries, as 'Arafat himself pointed out), we have all the constituent elements that go to make a sovereign state. However, his answer was a cautious one: "I am now the president of an independent country, but only after a number of years will this state have all the attributes of its sovereignty, as well as a fully-fledged role in the United Nations Organization." Yet, the signs of sovereignty are unmistakable: There is a Parliament, which will be renewed in October, following democratic elections based on electoral constituencies, including both Palestinians in the liberated territories and Palestinians abroad, who are still not authorised to come back; a government is in the process of being formed, and will include three Christian ministers; Yasir 'Arafat showed me the "decree" which he had just signed by which a Supreme Court had been created: "The judges are already on site in Gaza, Jericho, and the West Bank." He stressed the fact that the judges, once appointed, are independent and irremovable. The division of powers is ratified by the founding chart, which he ordered be brought to him, framed and illuminated with the Palestinian flag's colors. On three specific issues which Palestine must now address -- the Constitution, human rights, and Islam's place within the state -- he gave firm, clear-cut answers. To begin with, he confirmed that the Palestinian constitution will be of the presidential type, inspired by the French model. Yasir 'Arafat handed me the draft provisional Constitution for the interim period, drawn up in Arabic, as yet unpublished, and which is to be submitted to the Palestinian Parliament as soon as the latter is constituted. He also confirmed Palestine's unreserved adherence to UN ideals, the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the 1966 agreements on civil and political rights as well as economic, social, and cultural rights: "There will be no discrimination between Muslims and non-Muslims, or between men and women, who will have equal rights... Palestine is the fatherland of all Palestinians of all comunnities." He reminded me that the 1988 declaration of independence was already based, in his view, on the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and that the National Palestinan Council considers human rights a source of inspiration for future legislation: "The ideals of justice, solidarity, consultation, and accountability of those who govern, which form part of the Arab cultural identity, are not contrary to the Western ethos on which the 1948 Declaration is based." Switching to French, 'Arafat repeatedly stressed that he would like to see the spirit of tolerance prevail over the revanchist spirit. "There is a time to convince, and a time to build." This is why he broached the question of using French, which he wishes to promote as opposed to the dominant practice of speaking English, which was the language of the [British] mandate. He indicated that President Mitterand gave him assurances that the Sorbonne, where Yasir 'Arafat's wife was a brilliant student in her youth, will sponsor a Palestinian Humanities and Sciences university. Furthermore, he warmly gave me his agreement to arrange for French law professors and the Paris bar to contribute to the development of the Palestinian judicial institutions and legislation. Unified Legal System I reminded him of the role of French jurists in drawing up Turkish, Lebanese, Syrian, and Egyptian legislation. With Nabil Sha'th [adviser to 'Arafat], we discussed the pervasive Anglo-Saxon influence on Israeli and Palestinian criminal law, and the current opposition between the legal systems based on the Napoleonic codes and those based on British Common Law. During the interim period, Jordanian law will be provisionally applied at the West Bank, and Egyptian law in the Gaza Strip, but Yasir 'Arafat is in favor of rapidly unifying the legal system. The aim is to rationalize Islamic law and to assimilate Western law without grating on Palestine's sense of identity or childishly imitating existing models. Fortunately, Yasir 'Arafat is not liable to the temptation to resolve political and economic problems through a surfeit of legislation. He confirmed that Palestine had opted for the free market and that it had rejected state-socialism and its paralysing and stifling bureaucracy. We ended our long conversation by my asking him about Islam's place in the new state. I reminded him that, out of 19 Arab states that have a constitution, 13 adopted Islam as a state religion (in Saudi Arabia, moreover, it is the sole religion), whereas five states do not establish any formal link between the state and Islam (Lebanon, Somalia, Djibuti, Libya, and Syria). On this point he referred me to the decision to be reached by the Palestinian National Council. However, he ruled out that the new state would be an Islamic state. Religious freedom and the right to practice any religion are affirmed by Article 3 of the provisional Constitution, as is the right to set up private schools within all the different communities. Christian Palestinians, who constitute an important minority, will enjoy the same rights as Muslim Palestinians. Thus the new political establishment, which professes to be democratic, liberal, and pluralistic, will be nondenominational. Nevertheless, two of the draft Constitution's articles contain the germs of potential discord with Israel, just as they may, conversely, lead to agreement. Indeed, Article 5 states that Jerusalem is Palestine's capital, even though during the transitional period the Palestinian Government's seat can be located anywhere else in the Palestinian territory. The 13 September 1993 agreements, in fact, have left unaddressed the question of Jerusalem's status. However, Article 31 suggests a rapprochement: "Jerusalem is a holy city for all three religions. Palestine, faithful to the spiritual tradition, will ensure the cohabitation of the different religions both in Jerusalem and in Palestine as a whole."
