Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today went to Belgrade to promote this initiative. Papoulias will meet Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to discuss the developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina which are at an extremely critical point. Before his departure from Ellinikon Airport, Foreign Minister Papoulias stressed: I am going to Belgrade on a very important trip, especially because it is just a few days, a few hours, before the expiration of NATO's ultimatum. These are the last intensive efforts we can make to save the peace. I believe, Papoulias added, that the talks we have will be important and productive in the direction we all want, that is, to promote the European Union's plan and the peace process. There is no other way, he said, and added: The road to peace is one way and whoever thinks that with the use of force they will manage something better than what we have achieved thus far, I think he does not evaluate the situation correctly. According to REUTER, it is possible that Papoulias will not return to Athens but will visit another capital in Europe.
