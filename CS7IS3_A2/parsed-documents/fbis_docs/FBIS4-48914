In Shanghai, the largest industrial city of China, over 5,000 workers poured into the East Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace to visit an exhibition of the heroic deeds of Bao Qifan, an inventor and one of the ten national model workers. Meanwhile, "Red-May" singing contests were held in over 30 workers' clubs. Model workers became the stars at a rally of over 50,000 people in Chongqing in southwest China's Sichuan Province to mark International Labor Day. With red flowers pinned to their chests, more than 560 model workers from various circles were praised and presented their skills at the rally. Many workers in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, stood fast at their posts, such as sites of highway construction, steel-making and airport construction. They made up their minds to make greater contributions as a celebration of their own festival on the day. Leading officials of Liaoning Province and Shenyang city joined the local people in get-togethers in the four major parks in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province. They saluted advanced workers at the provincial and city levels, who were also invited to attend the gatherings. Wang Mingliang, director of the smeltery of the No. 3 Steel Plant of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, the largest special steel producing base of China, told XINHUA that a "Red-May" labor emulation drive was launched today to celebrate International Labor Day, and all the workers are enthusiastic about taking part in the drive.
