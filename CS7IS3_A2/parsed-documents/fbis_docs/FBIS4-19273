He said: We urge Kliridhis to abandon his intention to make additions to the package of confidence-building measures. In a written statement today, Denktas replied to Glavkos Kliridhis' speech in the European Union Parliamentary Assembly. Describing the proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus as a deceptive move to undermine the Treaty of Guarantees and Turkey's right to obstruct ENOSIS [union of Cyprus and Greece] and safeguard the existence of the Turkish Cypriots, Denktas said that Kliridhis is ignoring the realities. Stressing that Kliridhis has been disrespectful toward his audience and his people by greatly exaggerating the strength of the Turkish military forces in Cyprus, Denktas noted: The Turkish troops arrived when the final blow was about to be dealt on Cyprus by the Greek Cypriot National Guard units under the command of Greek officers. They prevented the island from being turned into a Greek colony and saved the Turkish Cypriots from being destroyed. Denktas recalled that the Cyprus problem was created by the Greek Cypriot partner of the Cyprus Republic when it destroyed the partnership republic through armed force and declared itself the Cyprus Government. He said: The prolongation of the Cyprus problem until now is due to the world's failure to inform the Greek Cypriot side that it does not represent the government of all Cyprus. Criticizing Kliridhis for urging the UN Security Council to implement its resolutions on Cyprus, Denktas said: The resolutions that refer to the Cyprus Government are not valid. They cannot be implemented. A move to implement them will not contribute to the establishment of peace in Cyprus. On the contrary, it will create an unresolvable chaotic situation in the island.
