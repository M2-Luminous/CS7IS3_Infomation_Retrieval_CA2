In this connection, Mykola Okhmakevych, the president of the Ukrainian Television and Radio Company, filed a resolute protest to Yuriy Meshkov. The Krym Television and Radio Company, stresses Mr. Okhmakevych in his statement, is a constituent part of the Ukrainian Television and Radio Company. According to the currently valid resolutions of Ukraine's Council of Ministers, Ukraine's Supreme Council and the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea, decision-making on personnel issues without the involvement of the Ukrteleradio president is a gross violation. Mr. Okhmakevych suggested Yuriy Meshkov revise his decision.
