FBIS3-4639 "dreas039_q_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 AUSTRALASIA Australia Former `Spies' Warned on Public Disclosure LD2802120394 Melbourne Radio Australia in English 1100 GMT 28 Feb 94 LD2802120394 Melbourne Radio Australia Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] The Australian Government says it will take firm and prompt action against any former Australian spies who now speak out in public. The foreign minister, Gareth Evans, gave the warning when releasing the terms of reference for an inquiry into its overseas spy service, ASIS [Australian Security Intelligence Service]. The inquiry follows a television documentary last week, in which two former ASIS agents claimed the secret intelligence service had harmed Australia's interests in Asia and the Middle East. But Senator Evans said purported revelations by former ASIS officers had the potential to compromise national security. He said that now that a judicial inquiry into ASIS had been set up, further public comment by former Australian spies should cease. Senator Evans gave this response to opposition claims that he was threatening former ASIS personnel: [Begin Evans recording] Might I simply say that the government has of course very serious and onerous responsibilities in the protection of national security, the protection of the national interest in this respect. We will carry out those responsibilities with full consciousness of the gravity of the issues that are involved. And it's just really again unfortunate the opposition should choose to trivialize to score points about something which is obviously an example of the government properly exercising the various very serious responsibilities we do have.
