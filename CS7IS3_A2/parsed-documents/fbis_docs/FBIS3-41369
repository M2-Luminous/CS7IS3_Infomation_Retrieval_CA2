Nowadays, reports are being published regularly in the national press stating that the U.S. has asked Pakistan to hand over 16 narcotics smugglers who are considered by U.S. Government departments to be major figures in the narcotics smuggling business. According to reports, the Government of Pakistan has so far arrested 11 smugglers and has speeded up efforts to capture the remaining escaped smugglers. We consider the Government of Pakistan justified in refusing to hand over narcotics smugglers to the U.S. The government's action was in line with the national priorities of an independent country. Undoubtedly, narcotics smugglers do not deserve any special treatment; these individuals have inflicted the greatest injury on Pakistan where the number of addicts has now reached 2 million. The economy of the country has been undermined by the black wealth of the drug dealers; hence, we have always advocated strong action against drug smugglers. However, the manner in which the U.S. press has suddenly started a propaganda campaign against Pakistan regarding narcotics and the U.S. has begun to insist that smugglers be handed over shows clearly that interference is taking place in the affairs of an independent and free country; moreover, such actions imply that our laws and system of justice are not dependable. No country, not even a world power, has the right to issue directives or orders to another country. In regard to the U.S. demand, one should also remember that under the pretext of bringing these smugglers to justice, the U.S. could wage a propaganda campaign against Pakistan on the national and international level and thus inflict great injury on Pakistan's reputation. At any rate, if a criminal is a Pakistani, then Pakistan alone should have the right to take action against him. It would be very dangerous to allow a foreign country to take action against any criminal within Pakistan.
