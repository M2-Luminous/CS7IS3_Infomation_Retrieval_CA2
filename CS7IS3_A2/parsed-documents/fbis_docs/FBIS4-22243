The first immodest impression of the party departure is the impression of extreme respectability. The two rooms of the hotel suite (the CPRF, like other influential parliamentary parties, lives its political life in "Mir") are filled with people in well-cut suits, with expensive "diplomats" [briefcases] in their hands. There are no stretched-out sweaters, no overalls, no first meetings of the "demrosses" [Demrossiya members], no young fellows with rolled-up sleeves, the true followers of the insurgent Anpilov. The CPRF, the party of Zyuganov, has successfully come to relative power bypassing the catacomb period of the communist congresses in the village of Voronovo and sidestepping the military actions of the October days. The communists of Zyuganov look so much like the leading detachment of the "new Russians" that it is possible to avoid base parallels by only one method--by remembering that the respectable part of the "new Russians" looks very much like the communists of bygone times who reached well-known heights. In the staff headquarters itself there is a mixture of that which before was incompatible. The old and the new. Although the furnishings are rented, they may fully serve as the real symbol of the CPRF ideology. Crystal chandeliers of the "lieutenant, do not touch the candelabra" style and worn carpets--the traditional interior of socialist party apartments--are livened up by designer office furniture of a "wet asphalt" hue. This is the popular color for the expensive Mercedes and Zhiguli 99 model. On the splendid table is a stack of papers. In bold letters, the address is indicated on the top one: To the Central Committee. The signature--a group of communists. The document has an air of the calm associated with verticality of power about it. After all, if the note is directed to the Central Committee, that means it will necessarily be reviewed and discussed... Most political experts evaluate the communist party of Zyuganov as the most civilized of all the communist parties of Russia (at the present time there are five of them). It can be compromised with (the Zyuganov followers are sooner socialists than communists)--that is the approximate consensus opinion of journalists. The CPRF tried on for size the general line Deng Xiaoping--after all, they too agree to tolerate different forms of ownership. They have been compared with the party of Brazauskas in Lithuania--ultimately, the ideals of social justice are good in themselves, but when politicians of this type come to power, they suddenly remember that there are never enough sweet cakes to go around for all. Gennadiy Andreyevich Zyuganov himself does not create the impression of an exhausted man, even though his political life is extremely active and eventful. And also not devoid of problems. He was, naturally, a fervent supporter of liberation of the October political prisoners, but now he cannot help but understand that, after the amazing (from the words "to amaze") victory in the Duma, his party is once again entering a phase of quiet factional struggle. Which does not facilitate unity of the ranks. Nevertheless, Zyuganov is full of ideas and energy--a serious contrast to the political leaders of the democratic wave, who are unable to conceal their fatigue and a certain devastation. Evidently, the end of the century, which is developing a certain set of ideas without offering any new ones in their stead, has little effect on the communists. They continue to believe that they have something new to offer the people. In response to the question of what his attitude is toward power, Gennadiy Andreyevich Zyuganov said that he takes it seriously. His set of ideas--a synthesis of Khomyakov, Berdyayev, Gennadiy Zyuganov, the Sermon on the Mount and Karl Marx--seems absolutely viable to him. And here is the most interesting thing: This set of ideas really is current. And interesting--just as any medley is more interesting than a single ingredient taken alone. [Zyuganov] "Power is a totally nonsynonymous concept," says Zyuganov. "There is civil power, which is spread to the entire Western part of the world--that is the power of law. There is the power of traditions, the power of ideas, the power of the ideal, perhaps even the power of prejudice--this power is understandable and dear to our country. And he who does not sense this will not achieve much in it. There is also a new power. It is not the fourth power, as it is interpreted, but rather informational power. This is a power which has become quite enraged in Russia. Without completely understanding what it is doing, it is predetermining the outcome of an entire series of vital events taking place in the country. There is also the power of money. Both informational and monetary power, mixed in known proportions, possess a destructive force greater than that of a thermonuclear weapon. Specifically this is a weapon--an informational-financial weapon, and it has become primary in the destruction of the great geopolitical formation which was the Soviet Union." [Correspondent] For Zyuganov, as for most opposition leaders, the disintegration of the Union is the point of countdown for catastrophe. And for the civil war, which, in the opinion of Gennadiy Andreyevich, began long ago. Now his task (and certainly not the concern of the currently functioning government) is to extinguish the fire of civil war, and to turn those who set it toward compromise. Understandably, the government must also agree to compromise. And it, partially, has already set off in this direction. However, the CPRF cannot have a complete merging and civic accord with the "democrats." This is not difficult to figure out if, together with Gennadiy Andreyevich, we turn to the history of our country's shocking events. Particularly since a number of articles have been devoted to these questions in the recently published book, "Derzhava" ["Great Power"]. [G. Zyuganov] ...In fact, for the entire duration of the Soviet period of history, there were not one, but two parties in the USSR, and there was a stubborn struggle going on between them, which did not subside for even a moment... The first party may conditionally be called the party of "our country." Sholokhov and Korolev, Zhukov, Gagarin, Kurchatov and Stakhanov belonged to it. It included a large part of the leaders and party apparatchiks, who toiled unyieldingly during the country's most difficult days... However, there was also another party--the party of "that country." Numerically it did not compare in the least with the former, but its political weight and influence in the higher echelons of power were disproportionately great, and often decisive. It included those for whom "that" country and "those" people were merely an arena for realization of their own ambitions and vain aspirations. This was the party of Trotsky and Kaganovich, Beria and Mekhlis, Gorbachev and Yeltsin, Yakovlev and Shevardnadze. Its rightful heritage today is "Demrossiya," and we do not want to have anything to do with this party. (Yet just try to tell the "Demrossiya" followers that they are the successors of the CPSU--they would faint dead away..Ye. P.). By the mid-80's, such a situation was objectively formed within the party when the "change of generations"... inevitably would have brought to power politicians of the new formation, who gravitated toward national-state great power ideals. It is not difficult to imagine how such a possibility frightened our foreign and domestic ill-wishers! (And here they are--the ill-wishers--Ye. P.)... After World War II, the scientific-technical revolution brought mankind to the technological boundary which made it possible to ensure global control over its development... There is nothing remarkable about the fact that this evoked a sharp activization of the transnational, cosmopolitical forces which were striving to realize such possibilities in a concrete geopolitical form of a world super-state. This superstructure must, according to the idea of its developers, gradually swallow up the national sovereign states. Practical work on creating such a center began long ago! The developed capitalist countries readily support the idea of creating a "new world order" (NWO), within the framework of which they hope to retain and strengthen their leading position. The model of a unified world economy within the framework of the NWO presupposes different levels of consumption for its component parts. Certain regions would continue to prosper, while the development of others would be artificially frozen. Need we say what category Russia will find itself in under such a "division of labor?" [Correspondent] What awaits us in the nearest future? [Zyuganov] In principle, there are two possible variants of behavior under the conditions which have been created. The first--to accept the rules of the game which have been imposed upon us and to fight for increasing the vital "quotas" within the framework of the mondialist scheme of world development. The second variant presupposes that Russia will accept that historical challenge with which our people are faced today, will not reconcile itself to the coming enslavement and will try to recapture its former role as a great power. For this, it is first of all necessary to restore the historical continuity of Russian statehood and our country's spirituality. At the same time, we must keep in mind that the current Russian Federation is not yet fully Russia, but an amputated appendage with torn and bleeding ties. Without a rebirth of the Union on a new basis of free and voluntary choice of the peoples (yet it seems to us they have already made their choice--Ye. P.), without the reunification of the currently divided Russian people, our state will not get up off of its knees. [Correspondent] In the opinion of Gennadiy Andreyevich, the two revolutions of the 90's were also rehearsed. These were gigantic actions aimed at washing out of the government structures all persons who placed the triumph of Russian statehood above the needs and demands of the International Monetary Fund. The scenario for both operations was the same: All the politicians and honest citizens who are dissatisfied with the course of reform are accumulated around the center, which with the aid of manipulation of public opinion is declared strictly harmful (in the first case--the party, in the second--the parliament). They are specially insulted, provoked into ill-planned response moves, and then "duped." The victory of democracy is celebrated. At the same time, the conductors (Gorbachev, Yeltsin), do not fully realize that they too are being manipulated. In principle, they are interesting only as a symbol, and at the first opportunity--they are replaceable. Terrible things are happening around these symbols. [Zyuganov] ...I will not even mention the fact that the reformers have outsmarted themselves. They knowingly attracted the criminal element to break the Soviet economy. By selecting the formula, "dismantling through pilferage." But now the genie does not want to go back into the bottle. ...It has become so strong in Russia that not only has it gone out of control, but it has also become an important subject of politics--a third power which does not fit into any schemes of the IMF. Today its effect on all processes is huge, and the continuation of reforms according to the former scheme will inevitably lead to the emergence of an entirely new formation on earth--a criminal de-ideologized power with totally unlimited repressions within the country and nuclear blackmail of the entire world... The criminal revolution is taking place. The regime either does not want to or is incapable to counteracting it. And the blindness of the intelligentsia is amazing, their eyes covered over with the liberal utopia. [Correspondent] Gennadiy Andreyevich, you of course heard Yeltsin's speech (which included also the struggle with criminal structures). However... [Zyuganov] It is not even a question of the fact that, when I heard the speech, it reminded me of our materials of three years ago. You got the feeling that he had spent a long time in a lethargic sleep or had been on another planet and suddenly returned: "Good heavens, it turns out that crime is rampant." At the same time, one night 130,000 associates of state security are being dismissed (that is what it said on the dictaphone tape--Ye. P.), and the structure practically ceases to exist. This is madness! There are two major sections there--on fighting corruption, organized crime and banditism--and this work has been paralyzed throughout the entire country. It is quite understandable why this was done--there are too many documents there on those who rule. It is necessary to transfer them, the documents, to other hands and destroy them. However, there is a peculiarity in state security--materials do not disappear without a trace. [Correspondent] How would Zyuganov solve this problem if he had power? [Zyuganov] There has been ample experience of this type in our country. There is experience in mobilization of the economy, experience in the state of emergency, experience when five million soldiers were demobilized in several years and all were found employment and placed without any nervous shock. However, the current authorities are afraid to turn to this experience, because its vehicles are the leaders and members of the CPSU. [Correspondent] In response to the question: Can the communist party today present a clear-cut program which the people can understand, i.e., can it utilize the effect of Ulyanov-Zhirinovskiy, Gennadiy Andreyevich answers immediately: [Zyuganov] Today the party cannot present such simple and energetic slogans as in 1917. There are no simple solutions in today's Russia. In short: A change of course is needed. We must have a professional government. We must return Russia to its geopolitical boundaries--not by means of war, but by means of gradual restoration of all ties. In general, these are strictly all-national things. I have thought about the fact that I could become president. The leader of a large parliamentary party (and yesterday at the meeting even Shumeyko admitted that the communist party is one of the most authoritative) cannot exclude such a possibility. If the party deems it necessary and the circumstances are right--well... Although I am opposed to the institution of the presidency itself. [Correspondent] Here is Gennadiy Andreyevich's prediction in the case if the evolutionary transition from a government of radicals to a government of new wave communists does not occur: [Zyuganov] A regional stratification of Russia is going on. The severity of the crisis is being thrown into the agrarian regions and those whose products do not go for export. Russia is ever more reproducing the system of "first world--third world," with a specific enclave which is becoming ever richer--Moscow, where the commercial and bank capital and the bureaucracy are concentrated. In order to support such an explosive system, we need a roll-back not simply to the command dictate, but to the archaic forms of existence. Moscow is introducing the visa regimen, and militia guards will collect duty at the city gates from citizens wishing to visit the capital. Well, is this not the early middle ages?! [Correspondent] There has been an acute desire to restore the disintegrated connection of the times (this is one of the methods of assimilating the world, especially by any new communists). And they have restored it: Now it is night in the courtyard. It is dark, not a soul anywhere. I write... But on the desk is a new appeal: "Comrades, come to your senses. We are bringing you the true light of socialism! Leave your drunken gangs, conquer the parasites once and for all! Leave the suffocator of the popular masses, the former excise advisor Grigoryev! He is suffering from a bout of hard drinking. He is a hireling of the Entente, and has a house in Yelizavetgrad!" This is 1920, Bunin, "The Accursed Days."
