The Organization of East Turkistan has staged a comeback and has demanded the independence of Xinjiang. The United States has also made some new moves along the Chinese border. Xinjiang is tumultuous. According to a report carried by China's RENMIN GONGAN BAO on 25 January 1994, in Urumqi, Xinjiang's regional capital, public security police found many reactionary slogans from outside the border, and the main idea of them was: "No communist party, no Han people; we want only Muslims and independence." In recent years, similar anticommunist and anti-Han slogans could often be found in Xinjiang. This is a reflection of the attempts by some major powers to strengthen penetration into China's frontier regions, where ethnic minorities live, since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Since the threat from the Soviet Union disappeared, Iran, Turkey, and other big powers in Central Asia have become very ambitious; they want to use their religious and cultural influences to control the regions of Central Asia, whereas the United States also wants to use its world-class hegemonic strength to fill the political vacuum in Central Asia. The Republic of Kazakhstan, which has just become independent and possesses nuclear weapons, also wants to ask the Chinese Government to return its territories and people. Under such complicated circumstances, China's Xinjiang region is enduring both open strifes and veiled struggles among various foreign forces. Iran and Turkey Step Up Offensives Against Xinjiang The rejuvenation of Islamic fundamentalism takes place mainly in Central Asia. The disintegration of the Soviet Union enabled Islam, which was suppressed for several decades in Central Asian nations, to rapidly grow. The rejuvenation of fundamentalism in Central Asia has affected the security of China's frontier regions. China has 17 million Muslims, of whom over 6 million live in Xinjiang, which borders Central Asia. They have close historical, ethnic, and religious links to Central Asia. After the liberation of Xinjiang, the activists who had fought for Xinjiang's independence fled to Central Asia, waited for a chance to come back, and continued to carry out pro-independence activities. The rejuvenation of fundamentalism in Central Asia is inseparable from the efforts by the major Muslim countries, such as Turkey and Iran, to expand their influence in the former Soviet republics and the six countries in Central Asia. Historically, Turkey has been linguistically and culturally linked to Central Asian nations such as Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan. It preaches "Greater Turkism" in Central Asia and attempts to establish a federation spanning from Turkey to Xinjiang. Iran also has religious links to Central Asian nations such as Azerbaijan and Tajikistan, and has many Shiites. Iran thinks that since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, a vacuum has emerged in Central Asia which ought to be filled by fundamentalism. For this reason, Iran has sent government officials and religious scholars there, with their Koran, to launch diplomatic and cultural offensives against Central Asia. China's Xinjiang has naturally felt the repercussions of the Muslim offensive. East Turkey Group Once Again Becomes Active In the 1930's and 1940's, Xinjiang had a force for independence. A short-lived East Turkistan Republic was founded in 1933. At the end of the 1940's a group of Muslims who advocated Xinjiang's independence and were led by Aisha [5337 3097] attempted to grasp the political power of Xinjiang Province; they also preached Turkism. After the liberation of the whole country, the Aisha group fled to the Republic of Turkey and carried out pro-independence activities outside the border. Since the great changes in the Soviet Union and East Europe, the Aisha group has become more active in carrying out pro-independence activities. They strengthened ideological propaganda toward the Xinjiang region, established publication organs, and compiled books and magazines, which they secretly brought to Xinjiang to preach the theory of "independence" among Xinjiang youths. In west Asia and Turkey, the activists advocating Xinjiang independence also took the opportunities arising from pilgrimages, tours, and homecoming trips to enter and leave Xinjiang and support the masses in confrontation with the government, so as to "drive the Han people out." When Usupu Aisha Alpertgene [you su pu ai sha a er pa te jin 1429 4790 2528 5337 3097 7093 1422 1584 3676 6855], leader of the former East Turkistan, expounded on the Koran in Istanbul at the age of over 90, he often advocated that Xinjiang's Muslims should stand up for resistance. Shortly before he died, he handed to Turkish prime minister Ozal a banner symbolizing independence. Aisha also fostered links with activists advocating the independence of Tibet, and published articles in TIBET REVIEW, which was headed by the Dalai Lama. The articles encouraged the followers of the Dalai Lama and Aisha to unite for the cause of confronting the Han people and realizing the independence of Xinjiang and Tibet. Kazakhstan's Influence Quietly Taking Shape The Republic of Kazakhstan, a former republic in the Soviet Union, is a big country in Central Asia. After its independence, nationalism in the country has increased. Last year, in Alma Ata, its capital, a grand world meeting of representatives of Kazakhs was held to preach greater Kazakh nationalism and unity of Kazakhs. China shares 1,724 km of borders with Kazakhstan. Within China there are 1.12 million Kazakhs, among whom 99 percent live in Xinjiang, with a small number in Gansu and Qinghai. They are linguistically and culturally linked to Kazakhstan. Last year, a delegation of Chinese scholars visited Kazakhstan. Several Kazakh writers talked lavishly about greater Kazakh nationalism to the Chinese scholars. They thought that Kazakhstan may abandon territorial claims from China, but the Chinese Government must let the Kazakhs living in Xinjiang return to their mother nation of Kazakhstan. Although the Sino-Kazakh border was already fixed in the Qing dynasty, most boundary tablets have collapsed or become blurred over the years. Kazakhstan has used this as an excuse to raise several territorial claims from China, but the Chinese Government has always suspected that those claims are attempts to swallow up the areas inhabited by the Kazakhs in Xinjiang. Kazakhstan's Nuclear Weapons Pose a Threat to China In addition, the Republic of Kazakhstan's nuclear weapons also pose a threat to the security of northwest China. The Soviet Union built nuclear weapons factories in Kazakhstan. Brezhnev once threatened to use the nuclear weapons there to perform a surgery on the bases in northwest China. It cannot but make people worry that once nuclear proliferation occurs and nuclear weapons fall into the hands of the fundamentalists, China's national security will be threatened. The disintegration of the Soviet Union has caused a power vacuum in Central Asia, and this is a stimulus for the rejuvenation of Islam. The United States wants to fill the vacuum, so as to offset the influences of Iran and fundamentalism. Early last year, former U.S. Secretary of State Baker twice visited Central Asia as Iran launched a large-scale diplomatic offensive in Central Asia. He said he hoped that the nations there could establish governments after the Western model; otherwise, the United States would not establish diplomatic relations with them. The United States also carried out penetrations through the pro-U.S. moderate Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to resist Iran and restrain the swelling fundamentalism. The United States Fills Vacuum, Posing Threats to Chinese Frontier Regions The United States is stepping up efforts to fill the power vacuum in Central Asia, and in so doing, it tries to kill two birds with one stone. First, as mentioned above, to check Iran and fundamentalism; and second, in the areas north and west of China, to strengthen the mechanisms restraining China. In fact, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the most powerful ideological enemy left to the United States is China. China has become the main target of the "peaceful evolution" which is being carried out by the United States. It seems that it is not strange to see the United States launching a thorough encirclement against China's border security. Since 1987 the United States has harbored the intention to intervene in China's southwest frontier and Tibet, and the U.S. Congress has more than once deliberated a "Tibet Human Rights Bill," to support the Dalai Lama's activities for Tibetan independence. The Voice of America has newly launched a Tibetan-language broadcast, and people believe that this is to coordinate with the relevant policy of the United States. In April 1993 the U.S. and Russian sides conducted the first air exercise in Siberia since World War II. U.S. planes appeared for the first time in the areas north of China, causing concern in China. Yeltsin tried to join the NATO grouping. Will there be a scenario in which the United States and Russia join forces in the areas north of China to jointly deal with China's defense in the north? What is more important is that Mongolia has shown some signs that it is becoming an arena for competition among the major powers in the international community. Against such a background, will Xinjiang, which is under the influence of the rapid changes in the situation of Central Asia, become another "arena"?
