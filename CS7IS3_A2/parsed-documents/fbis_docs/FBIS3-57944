It stipulates the conditions under which the desire to become French will have to be expressed in the future by some children of immigrants. Another decree lays down the principle of the county courts and district courts specializing in the issue of nationality. Despite government promises, no national information campaign on this sensitive subject has been planned. How can somebody become French? Starting from 1 January 1994, the question will acquire a new angle for the tens of thousands of young people born in France of foreign parents. The start of the new year will also see the entry into force of the entire reform of the nationality laws adopted in June 1993 after bitter debates. One part of this text has been in force since last July. The decree, which has just been published following an opinion by the Council of State, was signed by the prime minister and the five other ministers concerned: the ministers of justice, of the interior, of social affairs, defense, and overseas territories and departments [DOM-TOM]. It provides for specific new channels of access to French nationality for the children of immigrants, which are decisive for their integration. What follows is the new user's guide to gaining French nationality, as laid down by the new decree. Four Places to Express One's Desire To Be French Young people born in France of two foreign parents born abroad must henceforth show their desire to acquire French nationality. This requirement only affects persons who will be 18 years old after 1 January 1994. The new procedure applies between 16 and 21 years of age. However, it is highly recommended to set things in motion between the ages of 16 and 18, the period during which no obstacle can be placed in the path of a young offender, whereas after the age of 18 certain criminal convictions will prevent the future acquisition of nationality. The procedure in question is carried out simply and without any authorization being required from the parents. The decree empowers four authorities to receive the expression of the desire to gain French nationality: civil servants in all city halls (regardless of the place of residence of the interested party); prefectorial departments (prefectures and sub-prefectures); county judges; and the commanders of gendarmerie brigades. The expression of this desire may be made freely in writing, but pre-printed application forms will be distributed in the relevant places and in schools. Educational establishments, as well as police stations, may not process applications themselves. In the event, the four types of institution designated by the decree act merely as mailboxes. Whatever the circumstances, they are bound to receive the young persons involved and give them a dated official document attesting to their application. The institutions must then pass on the document to the county judge within three days. In the event of a rejection, summary proceedings may be launched for faulty processing. Although four authorities are competent to receive expressions of the desire for French nationality, only one may rule on the matter: the specialized county court judge (of whom there are between two and four per department). This individual does not have to rule on the appropriateness of the request, but must merely verify that the conditions laid down by the law have all been met. To this end, the judge involved asks the applicants to provide the following official documents: their birth certificate as proof of their birth in France; a certificate of nonpunishment or of penalties incurred [issued by the Ministry of Justice] (only for majors), and proof of their habitual residence in France during the five years preceding the request. The latter proof may be provided in writing in any form: school certificates, receipts for rent or electricity payments, for example. The submission of these documents will be officially acknowledged by the county court judge, who will then have six months in which to submit his decision. Should the judge fail to respond within this period, then the registration of the nationality is considered to have been accepted. Once the desire for French nationality has been recorded, the young person in question may immediately obtain a certificate of nationality and have an identity card issued. In the event of a negative decision on the part of the judge, the interested party may summon the attorney general before the district court to have their French status recognized. The same party may also launch a hierarchical appeal against the judge's ruling before the minister of justice. The decree states, exceptionally, that any minor aged 16 may institute these proceedings without receiving any authorization from their parents. Limited Dual Nationality for Algerians The new law abolishes the benefit of dual nationality for the children of persons born in former French colonies. By virtue of this principle, which continued to apply until 31 December 1993, any child born in France of parents who were born in former French territories (excluding Algeria) were born French. The principle still applies if the parents were born in Algeria before that country gained its independence. However, a contested government amendment has introduced the requirement of five years of regular residence in France by the parents as at the time of the birth of their child. This provision -- which breaks politically with the theory according to which Algeria was a French department just like any other prior to 1962 -- will be the source of extreme administrative complications. In effect, it will come down to requiring all the parents concerned to provide documentary proof of five years of regular residence in France. The danger is that proof of this kind, though relatively simple to provide at the time the child is born, could be virtually impossible to verify when most of the parents concerned are actually led to consider the question of the nationality of their children at the age of adolescence, if not when they come of age. Who will be able to prove, 18 years on, that they previously resided in France on a regular basis? For this reason, parents will be well advised to initiate proceedings at the birth [of their child], demanding a certificate of nationality from the county court judge. Information in Schools and High Schools The extremely late publication of the decree has meant that hardly any serious information could be circulated as yet. Some rather unclear pamphlets have been distributed to the [relevant] administrations, but nobody seems to know for sure whether they have reached the people for whom they were intended. Whereas the law was adopted six months ago, the decree providing for an information mechanism is still not ready. When it is, it will assign educational establishments, state national insurance offices, welfare centers, and territorial authorities a "duty to provide information." It would also have to provide for the designation, in each school and high school of a "correspondent on matters of nationality" who will serve as middlemen between pupils of foreign origin and the administrations concerned. The decree will also provide for the modification of programs of civic education to include in them some notions on the acquisition of French nationality. Finally, a legal reference text should be distributed to the administrations, associations, and media. However, the "major national information campaign" promised to members of parliament by Pierre Mehaignerie and Simone Veil will doubtless never take place. The fear is that, in the absence of information, young people will not take the steps required to gain French nationality, or will allow the deadline imposed by the law to pass. Radio broadcasts and televised advertisements should attenuate this risk. So far no financing has been freed up.
