Two Bosnian Croat soldiers were shot dead on a local road northeast of Prozor on Friday, Croatian Radio on Saturday quotes U.N. sources as saying. The Moslems, on the other side, say the Croats are to blame for renewed tension between the two sides. Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo says that Bosnian Croat forces on Saturday sprayed Moslem positions in the Neretvica River valley with small arms fire. The same source reports heavy Croat troop concentrations in the area of Doljani near Jablanica, which serves as a buffer zone between the Moslem and Croat troops in northern Herzegovina. Bosnian Croats and Moslems, erstwhile allies in the war against the local Serbs, first started fighting each other in northern Herzegovina in October 1992. The conflicts escalated in full-size war in the spring of 1993. After a year of fierce fighting for territories with mixed populations in southern and central Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Moslems and Croats yielded to U.S. pressure and on March 18 signed an agreement to form a binational federation. In practice, however, the two sides have renewed hostilities and their federation agreement seems to be nothing but a dead letter.
