On 10-11 June, Yue Qifeng conducted investigation and study in Jiamusi. Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, Wang Xianmin, member of the standing committee of the provincial party committee and secretary general, and responsible comrades of provincial departments concerned accompanied him during the inspection tour. Yue Qifeng and his entourage successively inspected Jiamusi paper mill, textile plant, synthetic materials plant, combined harvester manufacturing plant, Sanjiang Foodstuff Company Limited, and other state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises; inspected the provincial state farms general administration, model villages in Jiamusi suburban areas, and village-run enterprises in (Sihe) Village; and visited (Liang Fengming), a major chicken raiser and deputy to the National People's Congress, and (Jiang Houzhi), an enterpreneur of a private enterprise. In every place the leading comrades traveled, they asked in detail about the production and operation of enterprises and the living of their workers, talked extensively with the broad masses of workers, and discussed with them major plans for economic development. During his inspection and study, Comrade Yue Qifeng offered some important views. Yue Qifeng said: Since the third plenary session of the 11th party Central Committee, like other places in China, Heilongjiang Province has made big progress in economic construction. However, we must not deny that we have lagged behind the areas with rapid economic development. It is true that our lagging behind is caused by many objective reasons. But more importantly, I think it is caused by subjective reasons. For many years, we were used to practicing the unitary mode of planned economy, ownership structure, financial sources, and work thoughts, and had many deviations in our understanding of the provincial and city situations. At present, to march towards the goal of building the socialist market economic structure, we must further emancipate the mind, change ideas, reexamine the provincial and city situations, and establish an economic development strategic thinking that complies with the reality. Yue Qifeng pointed out: Judging from the viewpoint of building a socialist theory with Chinese characteristics or from the actual situations of the past years, the old mechanisms left over during the past years are actually the mechanisms leading us to failure. This is why we must conduct reform. Reform is a painful process of thoroughly remolding ourselves, which includes casting aside some things we got familiar with in the past. For example, we concentrated our main energy for a long time on the production of raw materials which required big investments but gave small output, required strenuous efforts but earned small money, thus resulting in a very low economic efficiency. At present, we must actively readjust the industrial structure, develop precision and intensive processing industry, strive to increase the technological content and value of products, and raise economic efficiency. For another example, some comrades regarded township enterprises and individual and private economic units as an alien force of the socialist economy and discriminated against and suppressed them over a long period of time, thus making our province lag far behind the economically developed areas in this aspect. From this, we can see that we must use the socialist theory with Chinese characteristics to emancipate and arm our thinking. Only by so doing can we realistically broaden the reform pace in the course of our practical work. Yue Qifeng said: Jiamusi city is a place of economic and strategic importance and vital communications outlet on the Sanjiang Plain. It is an important central city. How to accelerate its development and give full play to its radiating role is of vital importance to the whole province's economic construction. Therefore, Jiamusi city must proceed from its own reality and from the demands of developing the socialist market economy, conscientiously conduct investigation and study, and define its main targets and development priorities. Sanjiang Plain is China's important commodity grain base. We must exert strenuous efforts to study ways to process and convert grains as well as agricultural and sideline products into other products so as to increase their value, and enable Jiamusi city to gradually trun from an agricultural production base into a foodstuff industrial base so that its products can be sold in the whole country and can enter the world market. We should regard this as an important strategic orientation and objective and be determined to attain it. In this aspect, we should broaden our thinking, free our hands, invite business, and introduce capital. In addition to keeping our eyes on overseas businessmen, we should also regard southeast coastal economically developed areas as our cooperation partners, combine our resources and industrial advantages with their funds, technology and market advantages, and seek development through cooperation. After hearing work briefings given by leading comrades of the provincial state farms general administration, Yue Qifeng pointed out: Actually, we are conducting the second development program in the Great Northern Wilderness. Comparing with the first development, the second development has much better conditions. But the tasks are more arduous and the objectives are more magnificent. It is not enough to change the Great Northern Wilderness into a big granary of northeast China. We should learn from, inherit, and promote the spirit of the people in the Great Northern Wilderness, hold aloft the banner of building an enterprise through arduous efforts, and build this place into China's commodity grain base and foodstuffs industrial base.
