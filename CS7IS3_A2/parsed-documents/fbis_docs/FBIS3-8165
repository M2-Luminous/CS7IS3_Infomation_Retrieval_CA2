Ivo Sanader, Croatian deputy minister of foreign affairs, has spoken to our reporter Sandra Posum Djurin. This is how Deputy Minister Sanader views the transitional committee's work: [Begin Sanader recording] I would describe our work so far as good. We are making progress. For the time being there are no major problems. There is a fair deal of adjusting positions. It is perhaps interesting to mention that at the moment we are working on the first item, the first set of issues, namely the constitution of the future federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina between Croats and Bosniak Muslims. I believe that today or tomorrow, perhaps tomorrow, we may finalize a draft constitution. Afterward, the preliminary confederation agreement follows between the federation and the Republic of Croatia. This is then followed by a military agreement on military organization within the federation. The fourth item includes transitional measures for speeding up the founding of the federation and the confederation; wherever it is possible, this will include state organization as well. These are the three sets of issues that remain to be resolved once we have finished working on the federation constitution. You know that for our part we have decided -- these have always been our propositions -- that the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina should seek reconciliation, that an end should be put to all their conflicts. We find continuity in our policy along these lines. The fact that the world's greatest democratic power has become heavily involved in these talks testifies in practical terms to the fact that we have always followed the right and correct path. Now this transitional committee of ours is tasked with a very difficult and responsible duty, I would even say an historic task, of outlining what Minister Granic, Prime Minister Silajdzic, and President of Herceg-Bosna Zubak signed in Washington in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State Christopher in such a way as to make both sides satisfied, first in the federation, and to find a mutual interest in the future confederation.
