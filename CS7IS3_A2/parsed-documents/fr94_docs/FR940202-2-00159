FR940202-2-00159 FR940202-2-00073 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;220), the information collection requirements have been assigned OMB Control Number 2502&hyph;0267. I. Purpose and Substantive Description A. Authority Section 801 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) amended section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959. Section 202 was also amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCD Act of 1992). The Secretary is authorized to provide assistance to private nonprofit organizations and nonprofit consumer cooperatives to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly. The assistance is provided as capital advances and contracts for project rental assistance in accordance with 24 CFR part 889. This assistance may be used to finance the construction or rehabilitation of a structure, or acquisition of a structure from the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), to be used as supportive housing for the elderly in accordance with part 889. For supportive housing for the elderly, the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994, (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124, enacted October 28, 1993, (Fiscal Year 1994 Appropriations Act) provides $1,158,000,000 for capital advances, including amendments to capital advance contracts (not procurement contracts), for housing for the elderly as authorized by section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, (as amended by the NAHA and HCD Act of 1992), and for project rental assistance, and amendments to contracts for project rental assistance, for supportive housing for the elderly under section 202(c)(2) of the Housing Act of 1959, as amended. Any unreserved balances provided in prior years for such purposes are to be merged with amounts provided in the Fiscal Year 1994 Appropriations Act. In accordance with an agreement between HUD and the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) which facilitates the coordination between the two agencies in administering their respective rental assistance programs, HUD is required to notify FmHA of applications for housing assistance it receives. The purpose of this notification is to give FmHA the opportunity to comment if it has concern about the demand for additional assisted housing and possible harm to existing projects in the same housing market area. HUD will consider the FmHA comments in its review and project selection process. B. Allocation Amounts In accordance with 24 CFR part 791, the Assistant Secretary will allocate the amounts available for capital advances for supportive housing for the elderly. The Department reserves project rental assistance funds sufficient for 20-year project rental assistance contracts in support of the units selected for capital advances, consistent with current operating cost standards. The allocation formula for section 202 funds consists of a measure of the number of one- and two-person elderly renter households with incomes at or below the very low-income limit (50 percent of area median family income, as determined by HUD, with an adjustment for household size), which have housing deficiencies. Applicants for capital advances in the area served by the Washington, DC, Field Office are hereby put on notice that the capital advance amount available to the DC Office, as stated in this NOFA, may be reduced or eliminated due to ongoing legal proceedings occurring between HUD and a prior-year applicant, and that the determination of whether to reduce or eliminate those funds is entirely within the discretion of HUD. If such action or actions are taken, a notice to that effect will be published in the Federal Register . Based on this formula, the Department has allocated the available capital advance funds as shown on the following chart:
