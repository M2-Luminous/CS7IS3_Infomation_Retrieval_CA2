Now Only Russia Will Have Them"] [Text] The full-scale withdrawal from Belorussian territory to Russia of the Strategic Rocket Forces grouping temporarily stationed in the cities of Mozyr and Lida has begun. IZVESTIYA's military correspondent learned this from well-informed sources in the Russian Defense Ministry. The Strategic Rocket Forces grouping in the Republic of Belorussia comprised two divisions (eight missile regiments) armed with the RS-12M "Topol" road-mobile missile system or, as it was called in the West, the SS-25. A total of 72 launchers. The first regiment (nine "Topols") stationed in Postavy was withdrawn to Russia back in summer 1993. The next four regiments (36 launchers) will leave the republic in 1994 in accordance with the schedule agreed by the two states' defense ministries, and the rest in 1995. By mid-1996 the Mozyr and Lida missile divisions will have totally ceased to exist, they will be disbanded in accordance with the START Treaty. At the same time the arms and combat hardware withdrawn from Belorussian territory will be deployed at Strategic Rocket Force bases and arsenals -- they are to replace missiles and launchers that have outlived their service life in those regiments on combat alert duty on Russian territory that do not come under the START-1 and START-2 Treaties. Our newspaper has already reported (No. 25, 9 February) that the modernized RS-12M system's standardized solid-fuel multiple-warhead missile is to be the basis of Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces. Moreover the ratio between fixed-site and mobile systems will be 30-40:70-60. Specialists have calculated that these systems and the delivery to target of their warhead will cost the country 3-5 times less than for the sea-based nuclear forces and 5-10 times less than for the air force, although they do not cancel out the two other components of the nuclear triad. At the same time mobile launchers' survivability is 4-5 times greater than that of fixed-site launchers. It is very hard to ascertain the location of a wheeled vehicle in a vast position area, but silo coordinates are always known. To support this idea specialists cite the example of the obsolete Iraqi Scud systems, whose launch preparations took many hours. During the Gulf War state-of-the-art U.S. reconnaissance systems, including space reconnaissance, were unable to detect them on the move and in position areas and consequently avert missile launches. This factor, as well as many others, promises the Russian "Topols" a good future. Incidentally, officers and warrant officers from the missile regiments being withdrawn from Belorussia and disbanded, along with the enlisted men and NCO's on compulsory military service and contract personnel, will not be discharged into the reserve. They will make up the strength of other Strategic Rocket Forces units experiencing today a considerable shortage of specialist missilemen of all kinds. I was assured at the Rocket Forces Main Staff that they have all been guaranteed the social rights and benefits extended to soldiers of the Russian Federation. Officers and warrant officers from the regiments being withdrawn to Russia who do not want to leave Belorussia will be discharged into the reserve. They will enjoy all the rights of the citizens of the state in which they have remained to live, they and their families will keep the apartments in which they are now living, and those who have served in the army for 20 years or more will be paid a military pension in line with current legislation. At the Strategic Rocket Forces Main Staff I was assured that there has not been a single case of infringement of the legitimate rights of the Russian troops remaining in Belorussia. Once the strategic offensive arms installations have been eliminated on Belorussian territory, the missilemen's military camps will be handed over to the republic's defense ministry and the vacated apartments to people on the military department's waiting list or to other Belorussian citizens. Once it has given up its "Topols" Belorussia will be the only post-Soviet state to have carried out its commitments to the world community without any conditions and stipulations and to have really subscribed to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a nonnuclear country.
