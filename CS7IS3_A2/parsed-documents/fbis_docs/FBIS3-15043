[Shestopalov] Ruslan Khasbulatov, readers of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA congratulate you on your return home. [Khasbulatov] Thank you! [Shestopalov] How did you spend your first day? [Khasbulatov] The first thing that I did was familiarize myself with the place again and I hope this will not seem strange but I was sort of trying to get used to it... [Shestopalov note] The telephone did not stop ringing in the apartment with people offering congratulations. Khasbulatov began receiving his first telegrams in Lefortovo on 23 February. [Shestopalov] Was there nothing from President Dudayev of Chechnya? You are fellow countrymen after all! [Khasbulatov] There was nothing from Dudayev (Khasbulatov smiles). To the best of my knowledge he helped the present regime in the struggle against the parliament. It is rumored that apart from large sums of money he intended to send a detachment of volunteers to Moscow to help the OMON special purpose militia and "Beytar." But the volunteers did not come, of course.... Otherwise they would have gone over to our side. [Shestopalov] Were you able to read SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA in Lefortovo? [Khasbulatov] I asked for it as soon as the authorities "liberated" the newspaper. I felt a need for objective information. You know what is the strangest thing to have to endure in jail?.. The "Mayak" radio station and radio "Rossiya." From morning till night you get nothing but streams of primitive lies. It is amazing where they get so much nonsense from, what kind of think tank they must have to produce those lies every hour? Lies are the most terrible form of torture! Primitive propaganda is based on elementary human forgetfulness. Take, for example, the Bosnian problem, which Yeltsin's press presents to us as an "outstanding diplomatic triumph." But where were Messrs. Kozyrev and Yeltsin 18 months ago? Remember how many sessions of the Supreme Soviet were dedicated to this most important question of Russian foreign policy. What didn't they accuse the Supreme Soviet of then -- pan-Slavism and flirting with the patriots! They have no other way out today! Can air strikes against Serbia, NATO maneuvers, and blind support for U.S. initiatives really bring the regime success? That is why they were forced to adopt the option once proposed by the Supreme Soviet.... There is much to be amazed at.... I closely studied Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly and the State Duma. I was very surprised! The message is 90 percent made up of things that I said at congresses of people's deputies beginning with the sixth congress. Thus the president's team, which prepared this material, has accepted the Supreme Soviet's assessments. There is something else that amazes me, too! These people are incapable of performing the present task because they are bent on the destruction of Russia and on waging war against their own people. Yeltsin's team has more interpreters in it than professionals... [Shestopalov] In your view, what mistakes did the Supreme Soviet leadership make in the tragic weeks of September-October? [Khasbulatov] That is hardly the way to put the question. The constitution which Yeltsin so fiercely rejected was a whole magnitude better and more democratic than his brainchild. I do not know how the present "creation" is legitimate. What is its basis? The will of the people? I doubt it very much! It was thrown at the people without discussion. And then they began insinuating: if you do not accept it there will be civil war! You can hardly suspect MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS of antipathy toward Yeltsin although even that newspaper wrote about "trickery" when the votes were counted. Remember, the president carried out a coup d'etat. What should the Supreme Soviet do? It should act in full accordance with the existing Constitution! Which is what the leadership did! We proceeded first and foremost from that very Constitution on which Yeltsin himself took the oath. We proceeded in particular from Article 121 of Point 10 ratified by Yeltsin when he was chairman of the Supreme Soviet. I was blamed for calling the Armed Forces into action. In accordance with the law on defense, the Armed Forces are subordinate to "the Supreme Soviet of Russia, the President of Russia" under Article 10. Note that the word "president" here comes second. Something else is enshrined in the Constitution... The Armed Forces are the guarantor of the Constitution, hence the call for their protection. After all, the appeal was not to use their tanks to fire on the Russian parliament but to protect it!.. We acted in full accordance with the law. We managed to convene a Congress of People's Deputies which retained the full range of power. [Shestopalov] How justified was the appointment of the new power ministers? [Khasbulatov] I make no secret of the fact that there was a different viewpoint in existence. I wanted to create a kind of Military Council using old and new ministers. But the figures of Yerin and Grachev did not have sufficient standing. In addition, there was the crisis situation in the Security Ministry at that time. There were lots of persistent voices calling for the replacement of the ministers. There were also those demanding the replacement of the government in its entirety. But it cannot be said that we acted correctly all the time! The extreme situation caused mistakes. I must mention one fact. The leaders of many of the major plants, using the threat of dismissal, banned thousands of workers from coming to the aid of those who were defending people's power at the House of the Soviets. Historians will have the task of examining all this honestly. [Shestopalov] What are your plans for the immediate future! [Khasbulatov] I am not afraid of the courts! But I do not intend going back into politics. I do not see any worthy individuals to cooperate with. I shall work at science, I shall write a book. That will mean getting involved in dozens of problems... Jail is jail. The radio station "Mayak" alone is enough to "beat" your brains out (he laughs). Khasbulatov lit a pipe. [Shestopalov] Ruslan Imranovich, where is the pipe which, it is rumored, Boris Nikolayevich broke in a rage? [Khasbulatov] I do not know which pipe he broke. I still have mine with me. As I was leaving I asked him the fundamental question -- to whom will history give the final word? [Khasbulatov] Not Yeltsin... That is for sure. He is doomed. It is he who will have to answer for Grachev for the tanks, for Yerin for the OMON, and for Luzhkov for the Beytarovtsy. Their judgment day is still to come.
