Ambassador Carlos Portales signed the document for the president of the Republic. The Chilean Government also has joined the organization supervising the treaty -- the Organization to Ban Nuclear Weapons in Latin America, OPANAL. The ceremony took place in Mexico City. Argentina joined the treaty during the same ceremony. Portales said on the occasion that Chile emphasizes its complete renunciation and repudiation of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, adding that the country will contribute with initiatives seeking to prevent the proliferation of these types of weapons. Chile ratified the Tlatelolco Treaty in October 1974, seven years after signing it. Its implementation, however, was suspended because Chile considered that all countries with nuclear programs in the region had to become an effective part of the agreement.
