THE DEMOCRAT recounts atrocities meted out Ghanaians living in Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire and, recently, Togo, and says in addition to killing Ghanaians, the Togolese have, for the first time, violated Ghana's territorial integrity. THE DEMOCRAT therefore calls on the government not to continue toeing what it calls the soft line in the face of the savage acts perpetrated against Ghanaians in Togo. It hopes this is the last time lives of Ghanaians would have been wantonly lost. On its part, THE INDEPENDENT says it believes that Ghanaians do no want to go to war with Togo. An internationally arranged meeting between Presidents Rawlings and Eyadema on a neutral ground could therefore bring about peaceful coexistence.
