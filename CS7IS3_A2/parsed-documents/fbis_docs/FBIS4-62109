The call-up was suspended due to lack of funds in the budget needed to maintain and train soldiers. Aleksandrs Doniks, head of the state service department, told the LABRIT newspaper that the call-up has been suspended until the number of soldiers on compulsory service falls and there is enough money to maintain them. According to estimates made by the Defense Ministry at the beginning of this year, the maintenance of a soldier for the duration of his service costs approximately 1,050 lats, excluding the funds needed to buy machinery, arms, and ammunition. If the call-up is suspended for a longer time, then toward the fall there will be a shortage of about 750 soldiers on the border.
