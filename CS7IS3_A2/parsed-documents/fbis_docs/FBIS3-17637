This is the first blot on the record of this leader with the reputation of being moderate and sensible, who defends himself by saying that "when you speak of democracy in central Asia, in Kazakhstan, it cannot be compared with France, Spain, or other countries. If we are speaking of European standards, it must also be said how many years it took to achieve them. It must be borne in mind that women in the United States did not have the right to vote until the beginning of this century. But these states have 200 years of history, and France, Spain, and Britain have thousands. We have only been independent for two years. We are heading for democracy and the market economy step by step. If we try to turn the democratic cart too quickly, we will be in danger of overturning it." [Serbeto] The economic reform and privatization are proving very difficult in Russia. Has Kazakhstan used the lessons of this Russian experience in order to design its own model? [Nazarbayev] After many centuries of totalitarian rule, people are accustomed to collective methods of leadership and production, and so, from the psychological viewpoint, it is very difficult suddenly to accept private ownership. But, despite everything, we are prepared to hand over part of Kazakhstan's resources to the country's population. We are conducting not a chaotic privatization but one under the regulating control of the government, which is accelerating the privatization process, since it is very difficult from the grassroots. In agriculture, we are not yet considering the total privatization of land, although this is our medium-term aim. [Serbeto] Are you in favor of the so-called "shock therapy," or of delaying radical decisions to the utmost in order to preserve social peace? [Nazarbayev] We started with "shock therapy" when we decided to liberalize all prices, but we must be very vigilant because the process could go wrong at any time. The monetarist prescriptions against inflation are not sufficient in themselves. In the West, they must realize that they reached this situation after many years of evolution. For instance, in Spain Franco left everything ready, but we had no Franco. [Serbeto] What is Kazakhstan's nuclear policy? [Nazarbayev] Kazakhstan is fulfilling its pledges for the elimination of nuclear weapons. We were the first CIS state to ratify START I and the Lisbon protocol. The only delays were due to the fact that we were trying to secure guarantees that this is our lawful property and that we will be compensated for the cost of the enriched uranium in our nuclear warheads. [Serbeto] The presence in this country of a large population group of Russian origin is viewed as a factor of instability. To what extent do you believe that this is a grave danger to coexistence? [Nazarbayev] It would be incorrect to say that this problem does not exist. Some Russian politicians wish to use this for their own ends, but we will not accept this in Kazakhstan, because the Russians of Kazakhstan are our citizens. It cannot be said that human rights are violated here, but if anybody believes this, we invite all UN delegations to check this. In my opinion, people's main concerns are a result of the disintegration of the USSR. The fall of a great empire is always painful, and so it has always been throughout history. I know that Yeltsin and Kozyrev are very experienced people, but these politicians should have thought about the Russians left outside Russia when they signed the Slav treaty which dissolved the USSR. [Serbeto] Why do you not accept the proposal for granting the Russians dual nationality? [Nazarbayev] Just imagine if the Russians, who are 32 percent of the population, had two passports in their pockets. They would have one foot in Russia and the other here. That would destabilize the situation in Kazakhstan. Why do they say nothing in Russia about the violation of the rights of the non-Russians living in Russia? A million Kazakhs live in Russia. Have they opened any Kazakh school in Russia? In Kazakhstan, 65 percent of schools operate in Russian, and last year 78 percent of the students starting high school did so in Russian. Some 75 percent of the news media are in Russian. All the state bodies use Russian, and I myself am speaking to you in Russian. Can any other CIS state say that it respects linguistic minorities as we do? We will resolve all the problems of the Russian-speaking Kazakhs, because this is an internal problem of ours -- not that of any other country. Nobody can concern themselves about the Russians better than us, and we want no assistance from Russia. [Serbeto] Russia is trying to attract other CIS states into its military and economic sphere of influence. Have you noted this trend with respect to Kazakhstan? [Nazarbayev] Nobody knows what Russia wants. They lack a policy in this respect. It would be better to ask the Russians what they want. We are a sovereign country and are not dependent on Russia for either oil, coal, or food. Since we introduced our currency, we have been living completely independently, and Russia has understood this. We have oil, gas, wolfram, gold, diamonds, and uranium. Russia's relations with Ukraine and Belarus cannot be compared with those it maintains with Kazakhstan.
