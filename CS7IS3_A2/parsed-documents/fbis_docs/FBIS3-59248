Israel will be very forthcoming in its quest for peace, but it will not compromise on its security. As chief of staff during the Six-Day War, I promised myself that I would be the last commander of the Israel Defense Forces who would have to face untenable borders... If we have security, we will also have peace." Thus, Israeli Prime Minister Mr. Rabin, addressing the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe on Wednesday [26 January]. Mr. Rabin added that he was convinced that "temporary setbacks and difficulties in our negotiations with the PLO will not stop us from reaching an agreement. We do not have any territorial designs in Lebanon and our problems with Jordan could be solved fairly easily. However, Lebanon will not budge without Syria's blessing," asserted Mr. Rabin, who noted that "our negotiations with Syria have been, since their beginning, serious and open, and progress has been made." The Prime Minister called on President al-Asad to "walk the extra mile to meet us in the middle of the road for peace." Mr. Rabin also requested Europe to "increase its involvement in the peacemaking process" because Europe's support can consolidate peace in its real dimension: open borders, free movement of goods and people, coexistence and cooperation. The prime minister nevertheless said he feels a certain "ambivalence" in the European attitude toward Israel and would like to see more understanding concerning his country's political positions, security concerns and economic needs. For years, he said, "we have heard sermons and advice" but only a small minority of European states have taken concrete steps to eliminate the Arab boycott. In his view, no one would have dreamt, after the progress achieved in recent months, that the boycott would still be used as an "illegitimate weapon against Israel." Regarding the new agreement the European Union is to negotiate with Israel, Mr. Rabin affirmed that it must take account of Israel's ability to contribute to the economic activity of Europe and said "Israel's role as a stabilizing factor and locomotive for growth in the region cannot be minimized."
