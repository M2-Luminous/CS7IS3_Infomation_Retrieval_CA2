Clarification of Japan's stance on the issue is one of three conditions presented by the U.S. in April for getting the stalled talks moving again. The other two are a pledge on macroeconomic policy measures and "objective criteria." Washington has requested that Japan promise an increase in American access to Japan's markets on a sectoral basis, said the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), who declined to be named. The original framework accord signed after the July 1993 summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton stated that the two countries would strive to enhance Japan's imports from the U.S. on an "overall basis." Japan will carry an answer to the U.S. request for a statement on the overall goals of the framework talks during the coming Washington meeting, the MITI official said.
