A reliable expert at a Russian oil company told the Oil Information Agency the decision was made at one of the recent conferences of the leaders of the Fuel and Energy Ministry (Mintopenergo). Mintopenergo argues that it has "no chance of giving those enterprises breaks or additional export quotas to pay for the services of foreign firms." The ministry has obliged the managers of oil enterprises to take measures to reduce oil well repair costs. At the same time such oil companies such as LUKoil, YUKOS and Rosneft have been asked to present their proposals for government support for oil and gas producers in paying their debts to foreign firms conducting oil and gas well repairs. So far 25 foreign companies have carried out major repairs and maintenance under 46 contracts on more than 3,300 wells, which have produced an additional 15 million tonnes of crude. To pay the foreign firms for the work done Russian oil producers exported 3.3 million tonnes of crude under additional quotas in 1993. This year three million tonnes will be exported for the same purpose under the main quotas.
