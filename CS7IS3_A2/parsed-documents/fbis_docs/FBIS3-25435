He said: "I am going to make a serious accusation." And he did. He said that the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] was not interested in elections being held this year. However, Manuel Tome, Frelimo Central Committee secretary for mobilization and propaganda, believes the accusations that have come from the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] are "baseless, unfounded, and unnecessary." What is more, they mean that Renamo gauges itself in terms of its ability to make such baseless, unfounded, and unnecessary accusations. The most important thing, though, is that the Frelimo Party is interested in participating in the elections in October. Manuel Tome noted that "there is no one, and in particular there is no official -- President Joaquim Chissano, in this instance -- interested in delaying holding elections." The Frelimo Central Committee official added that "Frelimo has been ready for elections since last year." [Santos] Is Frelimo ready for elections or is it not? [Tome] I answered that very same question at the beginning of last year. My reply was that the Frelimo Party was ready, even at that time. Now, in addition to being ready for elections, the Frelimo Party will also do everything to ensure they will be held as scheduled. Had Mr. Afonso Dhlakama read that interview, he would probably have had some reference for guidance, at least. However, when we talk about being ready, we need to note that there are various levels of preparedness. There is organizational, conceptual, and strategic preparedness for elections. At another level, there is also the involvement of militants and sympathizers, the people who will after all implement the electoral strategy devised by the party. With regard to the fundamental things, we are both organized and prepared. There are, it is true, some details about which I cannot talk because, obviously, one cannot go about broadcasting what the party's electoral strategy or organizational approach will be or, eventually, we would be helping others defeat us. [Santos] You have said that the Frelimo Party has been ready for elections since last year. Has anything changed that state of affairs? [Tome] I would not say that it has changed. We were ready at that time because, for instance, basic conditions were already in place. Since then, those conditions have become more solid. You must be aware that we started preparing ourselves with a view to elections being held last year. Obviously, there are certain things that you should only do when you are certain that elections will be held at the appointed date, or you may end up wasting money and the efforts made by party militants on work that will serve no purpose whatever. I am talking, for instance, about what is commonly referred to as the precampaign and the electoral campaign itself. That is where you put up money and use the militants' efforts. In addition to that, there is a level of involvement by the militants themselves, who are full time workers with the party. Obviously, they are involved in the party's work, but the intensity of their commitment to that work tends to grow. [Santos] So, Frelimo believes that elections will be held in October? [Tome] I believe elections will take place in October, barring last minute obstacles caused by people acting in bad faith. Frelimo wants elections held this year as scheduled, and there are many reasons for wanting to do so. You know that the movement of Mozambicans being repatriated from other countries is greatly limited by the uncertainty we currently experience. People want elections to be held so they can then start working to restore normality in the country. Economic activity will not occur at the pace or with the effectiveness we would desire, if uncertainty continues to beset this country for the next two or three years. Then, there is a third factor: psychological saturation. That means that people will no longer tolerate this whole situation and that could yet have some effect on voter turnout. Postponements make people start to lose confidence in the process and when the time for elections comes, they will say: I am not going to vote because I do not trust this process any more. Thus, it is imperative that elections be held at the appointed date and I would like to believe that, should the aforementioned obstacles appear, they will be promptly dealt with and removed, whether it be done by the Mozambican or the international community. [Santos] That would mean, then, that there is no truth to Renamo's view that Frelimo is making time to try and rid itself of its Marxist image? [Tome] I do know whether the Renamo president knows what it means to be a Marxist or whether he knows the meaning of the word Marxism. When the Frelimo Party held its Fifth Congress in 1989, it decided to withdraw Marxism as the party's official doctrine. It was not taking a stand against Marxism. That must be made clear. We have a party that is pluralist within itself, meaning that people have the freedom to think, to propose things, and to make choices, as long as those ideas do not contravene the principles and the program of the party. We have no need to clean up any image. In fact, were I to ask the journalists how many Marxists Frelimo had.... We have a very big party, with more than 850,000 members and it cannot be supposed that all those 850,000 members are Marxists. In other words, at the time, we had the party's official doctrine, which did not even correspond to the party's great mass of militants in real terms. Marxism is a philosophy and a conception of an economic system, and so forth, and I fail to see that we need to rid ourselves of it, as is often said, because nothing causes us any guilt or any other complexes. To my knowledge, there are Marxist parties to this day. What is more, there are even communist parties. There is a communist party in neighboring South Africa. There are communist parties in Portugal and Greece. Such parties do exist. There are other parties that have adapted and even changed their names, like Italy's Democratic Leftist Party, for instance. As far as I know, no one has ever been condemned for being a Marxist, though I know that many people have been condemned and continued to be condemned the world over for terrorist practices. That much I know. [Santos] Are you talking about anyone in particular? [Tome] I have not mentioned any name in particular. However, we shall soon see if the cap fits somebody in particular. [Santos] If the elections are not held at the appointed date, do you think we will be faced with a chaotic situation? [Tome] I would not say chaotic, because if there were to be chaos it would have happened during the war. During the war, there were far more reasons for chaos. Yet, we did not have chaos even then. And if we did not have chaos then, that was because the government of this country, the Frelimo government, was able to govern in a situation of war. I am not implying in any way that it was a spotless government. I do not have any such pretension, but it is true that the Frelimo government was able to run the country despite the war. To refute that is to refute factual evidence: this country is still standing and it is moving toward regaining normality. Now, chaos can be created, just as war can be created. That is what I mean, there is the need to prevent people who act or intend to act in bad faith from creating obstacles to this whole process. After all, what is it that we want with elections? We want the country to move toward a new situation, whereby all Mozambican citizens, irrespective of their political, philosophical, or religious beliefs, can participate in the life of the nation and seek to realize their individual aspirations. I would have preferred to say that elections must be held by October, instead of trying to imagine a hypothetical situation in which elections would not take place. I think that everyone -- the international community too -- is interested in seeing them go ahead. UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello has said elections must be held. The president of the Republic has said the same. We have been saying soHevery day and we reiterate it now. [Santos] One of the things Renamo has been saying is that it does not have money to participate in the elections. Does the Frelimo Party have money? [Tome] The costs involved in an electoral campaign are so massive that I do not believe there is any party that can claim to have enough funds for a campaign. I do not believe that, particularly in light of the situation the country is in, at this time. It is true that Frelimo has existed for a lot longer, it has been in existence for the better part of 32 years, so it has greater financial stability. However, greater financial stability does not mean that it has enough money. It has greater financial stability than the other parties which have surfaced lately and which are probably still organizing their financing sources. I have talked about organization which does indeed include gathering money. That is normal and it happens with any party in the world. We are doing work, ranging from small to rather mroe complex tasks, that involve studies and serious work with experts. A militant can set up some sort of gathering, he or she can invite other militants to join in and the money can be turned over to the party, or it can be a bigger thing, like a musical show, for instance. [Santos] Is Rovuma Hotel one of the Frelimo Party's sources for gathering funds? [Tome] Rovuma Hotel is one of the institutions owned by our party, but we have several sources for gathering funds. Many people think that Rovuma Hotel is a great source of revenue, but the truth is that it is not. We have in excess of 800,000 members and those members pay their fees. It is true that we must take note of the fact that many members do not pay their fees, basically because of organizational reasons. We have many militants on the ground. There are displaced people who do not even have the means to survive on, let alone to pay their dues to the party. Nonetheless, militant fees are an important source of revenue to the party. [Santos] One of the consequences of the one-party system is the following: the state is confused with the party and with the government. Does the Frelimo Party continue to use state property for its own operation? [Tome] No. What property? We use no state property at all. We can talk about that because there is nothing that has not been made public, even the party's secretary general has already talked about it. There is a small portion of our budget that is financed by the state, taking into account the fact that we are in the Assembly of the Republic. It is true that it is a one-party Assembly, but that situation is already history because we are going to have a new Assembly with other parties and they will get their share in line with the seats they get in that institution. However, we do not use state property. Reports that we use state-owned vehicles and all the rest are rather unwarranted claims. In this instance, I am talking of people, but there also certain political parties. A party's capacity, maturity, and quality cannot be measured in terms of its ability to make accusations. Those qualities must be assessed in terms of its ability to present a convincing program to the people. They are assessed in terms of the ability to adapt to the political situation and make important contributions to the country. It is true that, by definition, the opposition must oppose the ruling party. Were it not so, the opposition party would be a part of the ruling party and we would not be interested in that. In fact, I must tell you that, as a Mozambican, I would be proud if I heard people say, whether inside or outside this country, that the Mozambican parties are strong, mature, and have clear goals. You, the journalists, are here to present Renamo's accusations, most of which are unfounded, which means that Renamo assesses its own capacity in terms of its ability to make unfounded, baseless, and needless accusations against the ruling party. So, we do not need to make secret moves at that level. Such moves are for the police and other such institutions. When I say secret, I mean things that must be kept from public knowledge. The Frelimo Party will continue to adopt a serious stance in this process. We are not going to follow up each and every accusation. I think it more important for us to mobilize and train our militants so they become more knowledgeable about the situation in the country and about concepts concerning the electoral process. I think it must be made clear to all that those who accuse must produce evidence. I must not come here and say that journalists are liars, now prove that you are not. I must produce evidence to the effect that someone lied at a certain point, on a certain page, and in such and such edition. It is said that Frelimo does not want elections held this year. Who has said so? Frelimo's supreme leader has said that elections must happen this year and he continues to say so. In addition to the party work he has done, he has also made personal efforts, because he has more than just the responsibility of participating in the management of the peace process. He has the responsibility of managing the whole country. No leader -- President Joaquim Chissano included -- is interested in seeing the current situation continue.
