Ardzinba told Abkhazian television that only those Georgian refugees who have not "stained themselves with blood" may return to Abkhazia. In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Akaky Gasviani, a vice- prime minister of the Georgian government-in-exile of Abkhazia, described Ardzinba's statement as "an attempt to revise and reconsider the Geneva agreements envisaging the return to Abkhazia of refugees of all nationalities irrespective of their participation in combat activities." He said the Abkhazian leadership "is obviously not happy about the return of several dozen thousand refugees to the Gali and other districts of Abkhazia and it is trying, under various pretexts, to obstruct the process of their return." Gasviani stressed that Ardzinba's statement "is a new attempt to shift the responsibility for the activities of Abkhazian and North Caucasian militants who robbed and killed civilians in Abkhazia -- Georgians, Russians, Greeks and people of other nationalities -- in September-December 1993 to the Georgian population and Georgian authorities."
