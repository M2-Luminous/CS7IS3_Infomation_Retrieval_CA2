They would turn themselves in as soon as all the felled timber in the guerrilla-controlled areas had been dragged out by contractors. "It is expected that all logs will be removed by the end of March. Then in April they will turn themselves in," he told the NATION. "This includes three Khmer Rouge leaders and hundreds of their soldiers." He declined to name these "leaders", saying only that Ta Mok, the one-legged hard-line leader of the guerrilla forces, would not be among them. He has reportedly abandoned his bases in Anlung Veng Province and moved to new headquarters at Trapeang Kul. The source said the three had set conditions for their surrender, but declined to give details. He said the U.S. government has agreed to provide army uniforms for guerrillas who defect to the government forces. Khmer Rouge representatives in Phnom Penh were not available for comment. Defense Minister Tea Chamrat and another high-ranking member of the government were understood to be due in Bangkok this weekend to discuss the surrender.
