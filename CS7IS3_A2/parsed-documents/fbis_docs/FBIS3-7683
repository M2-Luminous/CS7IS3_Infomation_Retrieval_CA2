The source was commenting on Kantor's overnight comments in Washington that the measures, announced in Tokyo on Tuesday, do not meet U.S. concerns on bilateral trade issues ranging from auto trade to government procurement. The source also stressed that Japan expects to announce an additional market-opening package in June for presentation at the Group of Seven (G-7) summit of industrial nations set for July in Naples, Italy. He also expressed hope that the latest package will lead to a resumption of bilateral "framework" trade talks that broke down in mid-February.
