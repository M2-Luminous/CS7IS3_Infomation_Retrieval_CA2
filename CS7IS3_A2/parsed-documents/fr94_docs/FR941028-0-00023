ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) establishes new regulations to require regulatory authorities to use OSM's Applicant/Violator Computer System (AVS) and other information sources to identify ownership or control links between permit applicants and violators. The regulations establish the procedures, standards, and type of proof required to challenge ownership or control links and to disprove violations. OSM also amends a number of regulations affecting blocking of permits, abatement of notices of violation, improvidently issued permits, and permit application information. The regulations reduce the possibility of violators receiving and retaining permits in violation of the permit approval provisions of SMCRA. Finally, the rules establish enhanced due process procedures for the regulated community. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, U.S. Department of the Interior, 1951 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20240.
