He reported today that he was tortured by Peruvian Counterterrorism police who wanted him to plead guilty. Mallea announced that his attorney-at-law is studying the possibility of filing a claim for damages against the Peruvian police and state for moral and economic damage as a result of the charges that determined his confinement in the Canto Grande prison in Lima. Mallea asked the government to publicly admit its mistake "because it is for men to admit their mistakes." Mallea, who was detained on 10 July 1993, held a news conference. He recalled that on 21 July 1993 he was tortured by Counterterrorism Directorate (DINCOTE) agents. [passage omitted]
