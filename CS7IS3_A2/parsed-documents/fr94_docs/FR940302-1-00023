ACTION: Notice of Tentative Determination on Application of the State of Kansas for Final Approval, Public Comment Period. SUMMARY: The State of Kansas has applied for final approval of its underground storage tank (UST) program under subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).

Thus, EPA intends to grant final approval to Kansas to operate its program in lieu of the federal program. Kansas' application for final approval is available for public review and comment and a public hearing will be held to solicit comments on the application, if there is significant interest. DATES: The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until April 1, 1994. EPA expects to make a final decision on whether or not to approve Kansas' program by May 31, 1994 and will give notice of it in the Federal Register . Any request for a hearing and all comments on Kansas' final approval application must be received at the EPA Region 7 office by the close of business on April 1, 1994.
