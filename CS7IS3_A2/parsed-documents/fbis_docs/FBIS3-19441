In 1992, Ankara began a process to amend the Treaty and recently moved to adopt a new rule for the straits that provides for a 24 hour advance notice of the passage of ships with dangerous and polluting cargo. In connection with the amendment of the Treaty, Turkey recalls the dangers to the sea from the passage of big tankers, which mainly come through the Black Sea. The tragic accident in the Bosporus and the threat of a major ecological disaster to the area could be a first class pretext for Turkey to insist on the amendment of the Treaty of Montreux. Ankara's main goal is to control the sea route for transporting oil, a move that will primarily hurt Russia, but also all other countries with commercial interests in the Black Sea. It will also hurt Greece, which, above all else, is a cosignatory of the Treaty. Alexandros Alavanos, a Coalition of the Left and Progress European Parliament deputy, has already asked the European Union Council of Ministers to deal with an attempt by Turkey to violate the Treaty and asked that the issue be discussed at the Pan European Transport Conference in Crete.
