And I hope I will be able to depend on ministers from outside the majority too, both men and women. But for the present there are no definite names; the ones that I have seen in the newspapers are fruits of the imagination..." The only certainty is that Silvio Berlusconi, interviewed by journalists outside his house yesterday evening, is furious with Mario Segni [Pact for Italy leader], (who ironically was at that very moment issuing an official communique declaring his "close attention" to Berlusconi). He said: "That fellow says all kinds of things; nothing of what he says corresponds to the truth. Segni questions himself and provides his own answers. There have been no approaches to him, and we do not intend to make any... With regard to the Popular Party [PPI], we remain open to a dialogue... And as for De Mita, who demanded a rejection of the National Alliance, my reply is that ours is a compact alignment, and we are people who concern themselves with specifics. We have obtained the Italian people's support and we will govern. We will not have any second thoughts. Of course, I have discovered that politics has a pace of its own, which is different from what I thought." [passage omitted] Meanwhile, attorney Vittorio Dotti has gained the post of deputy speaker of the lower house; the decision was made yesterday afternoon. Berlusconi appreciates the cooperation of his allies. He feels more secure with his lawyer at the head of the lower house. And the Justice Ministry remains free... "There is time," Berlusconi said yesterday morning. "How long it takes to form the government will depend on the consultations that will be started in the next few days by the president and on his decisions. For our part, if we have responsibilities as the pole for freedom, it will take time to decide. We will not follow the principle of the spoils system. I do not think that speed is the most important thing." We will not follow the principle of the spoils system. That means that no one can yet be certain of being appointed. No one knows what hat he will wear and what role he will play. The only certainties, apart from the top positions of Berlusconi, Tatarella, and Maroni, are that Berlusconi wants Cesare Previti as his right-hand man at the Interior Ministry (or the Justice Ministry, as a second choice). That he definitely wants to find another position for Tiziana Parenti, if not in the government, then in one of the most important of the parliamentary committees (perhaps the Anti-Mafia Committee) which commands definite prestige and a prominent image. That he attaches great importance to a Family Ministry and very much hopes that his program can receive the approval of a sector of the PPI. This morning he will officially offer them a deputy speakership of the lower house and the chairmanship of important committees in the lower house and the Senate. Also today Berlusconi will meet with Marco Pannella, and will ask him directly to choose: Forza Italia can offer him a post as EC commissioner for himself and/or the chairmanship of the television watchdog committee for Mario Taradash. "There are only six of them and they want seven things..." one of the officials in charge of the negotiations commented drily. The League and the National Alliance do not want Pannella in the government (as they confirmed yesterday very clearly) and Berlusconi cannot do much to change their minds. Another obstacle being dealt with confidentially is the issue of whether the former Christian Democrats of the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] should enter the government. There are those who are not in favor of granting a prominent position to Clemente Mastella (who said: "I have no government ambitions; all I want to do is to engage in politics..." However, he added resentfully: "But it must be clearly understood that we will not accept any prejudices.") "Thoroughbred" League members will not accept on the team anyone too easily identified with previous majorities,. "but Clemente is such a nice fellow; everybody likes him..." according to Forza Italia members. However, the final decision lies with the likely prime minister. Meanwhile, it is certain that Mastella will be the CCD's lower house floor leader. When it comes to sharing one post between two, there will be problems for the Liberals, too. Some members of the majority have made two calculations: "Three Liberals have been elected -- Scognamiglio, Costa, and Biondi. We cannot have all three of them in the country's leadership..."
