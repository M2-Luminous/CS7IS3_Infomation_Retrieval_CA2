For the right-wing government coalition and the Christian Democrats it is downright devastating. The election campaign proper starts on Friday, 8 April; in the course of the campaign, there will be a moratorium on press, radio, and television interviews with the parties' electoral leaders. NARODNA OBRODA has therefore asked Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], to reply to our questions now. [Gembicky] Mr. Chairman, to what do you ascribe your position as the favorite? [Horn] After 1990, several parliamentary parties tried to isolate the Socialists. Our reply was an intensive dialogue with society. In Parliament we concentrated only on specific solutions to society's transformation. Why was this important? The fact is that we did not inherit the new social and political configuration from Rakosi's regime. Quite the contrary, Kadar's barracks were regarded even in the West as the merriest in Central and Eastern Europe. Even under Kadar's regime, there existed elements of the market economy and its management. As early as January 1988, we passed in Hungary the law on the freedom of private enterprise, which would have been inconceivable in Slovakia at that time. We ourselves enabled, by means of law, the emergence of a multiparty society and maintained open contacts with Western democracies. This distinguished us from the CSSR [Czechoslovak Socialist Republic] and the other countries of this region. Hence, there was something to build on. The new government that emerged from the elections in 1990 tried to change all kinds of things. Unfortunately, it did not focus on economic transformation but on ideological issues and the unproductive reassessment of the past. This was not all that interesting to ordinary people, who want to know how they are going to make a living. We therefore decided to deal precisely with those issues that are of interest to the broadest sections of society. That is one of the main causes of our party's popularity. We purposefully refrained from personal invectives against political adversaries In Parliament. Simply, we dealt with the down-to-earth problems of our country. And, last but not least, it needs to be said that we have a competent team of politicians and experts to translate those principles into reality. I myself was a member of Nemeth's cabinet, which had a European hallmark [punc] abroad as well as at home. [Gembicky] Even though you top the pre-election polls with between 30 and 33 percent of the vote, it could happen to you that your competitors join forces and push you into the opposition once again after the elections. With whom would you be ready to form a post-election coalition, should a coalition be necessary? [Horn] That is the most frequent question I have been asked recently. The reply? It will be given by the two-round elections. We will see then with whom we can cooperate and with whom not. [Gembicky] Mr. Horn, can even a coalition with the right-wing Liberals from Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] be considered? [Horn] I do not know what Fidesz is up to because it changes its opinions every month. But we do consider the possibility of a coalition with Liberals, particularly with the Free Democrats [Alliance of Free Democrats -- SZDSZ]. [Gembicky] A few days ago the parties making up today's government coalition pushed through in Hungarian Parliament the adoption of a screening law. An important, and perhaps sole, reason for the passage of this law was the endeavor to eliminate the most formidable competitor -- Gyula Horn. Will the law apply to you, in view of your participation in Ministry of Interior units in 1956? Do you have a chance to successfully defend yourself against this accusation and those pressures? [Horn] This law was not passed personally against me. It should affect, above all, hidden resident agents. There are no secret spots in my biography, neither in the fifties, nor in the sixties or later years. Besides, the screening law does not provide for any sanctions. Its sole aim is to make the past of Hungarian political officials more transparent. [Gembicky] What is the Hungarian Socialists' recipe for reducing tension in Slovak-Hungarian relations? [Horn] I do not think that the Hungarians and Slovaks as nations stand in opposition to one another. We want to push for historical reconciliation with neighbors and, therefore, we must not allow nationalist politicians to take the helm in any of our countries. Therefore, there is no need to deal primarily with the past, with the burden represented by historical treaties. That is of no real significance. Should we become a government party, we would want to conclude a large general agreement with the Slovak Republic that ought to be the first big step toward building up mutual trust. On the part of Hungary, this agreement must chiefly contain the element of unchangeability of current borders. At the same time, the two sides should pledge to observe the rights of ethnic minorities living on their territories. This commitment would apply to both Hungarians in Slovakia and Slovaks in Hungary. The other element should be a general activation of mutual relations because, in my opinion, little has been done in the economic sphere although both Slovakia and Hungary acutely need new markets. The clarification of neuralgic points in the past should be left to historians, instead of drawing into them politicians, who keep reviving them and highlighting their relevance as its suits their needs. That is pointless. As regards matters that introduce neurosis [neurotizuju] into our mutual relations, such as military issues, we must establish a system of mutual consultations. It is simply not true that Hungary is building up its army against Slovakia or that Slovakia is building up its army against Hungary. There are several such mutual problems that would require very intensive bilateral talks. It would be very unfortunate if the practice of relations introduced by the present Hungarian Government and the former cabinet of Vladimir Meciar were to be perpetuated. Whenever any Hungarian nationalist made any oblique remark about Slovakia, Meciar immediately reacted to it. And the view of a narrow group was presented as the official Hungarian position. Let me say one more thing in conclusion. In my opinion, Hungary must support all efforts aimed at Slovakia's integration into European structures -- naturally, under conditions as are applicable to everyone. And, as far as you are concerned, I would recommend that you leave in peace the question of bilingual city and village signposts and constitutionally guarantee the rights of ethnic minorities. We also do not consider right all your ideas about Slovakia's territorial and administrative division and the reorganization of state administration and local self-administration, because the intended arrangement does not sufficiently accommodate the demands of Hungarians living in Slovakia. [Gembicky] What significance do you attribute to cooperation among Visegrad countries from the long-term viewpoint? [Horn] Visegrad needs to be kept alive, even though, to be honest, I do not think that this cooperation has any great prospects. I prefer the enhancement of bilateral relations between the member countries of this group. [Gembicky] One bone of contention in our relations is the Gabcikovo hydroelectric project and the demand that we increase the flow of water in the old riverbed of the Danube. Do you think that you will be able to find with the provisional government, or with the government that will emerge in Slovakia after the fall parliamentary elections, common language and a compromise even in this matter? [Horn] Results can only be achieved by means of compromise. This problem, too, needs to be consistently depoliticized and its solution must be left to experts. The Hungarian side's demand that Slovakia secure sufficient flow of water is justified. Therefore, this is not a political but a practical problem for experts. Not only the present Moravcik government but also the one that will be appointed after the fall elections must be a true partner in solving this problem. [Gembicky] A broad-coalition government has taken up office in Slovakia. Is there, in your opinion, a chance, and does the political will exist, for a historic Hungarian-Slovak settlement in the near future? [Horn] I assess the first steps of the Moravcik government positively. He wants to negotiate and cooperate, which is encouraging. I therefore think that it is worthwhile to negotiate with Mr. Moravcik even in the brief period prior to the elections. [Gembicky] Mr. Horn, do you not think that the present government coalition headed by the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] might try to make up for all the missed opportunities in Slovak-Hungarian relations even before the elections, only to reverse the preferences indicated by pre-election polls? [Horn] Such a reversal cannot be party business. Even if we have some disputes with the MDF in the way we view bilateral relations, bilateral relations represent state interest and, therefore, I do not believe that the MDF could change the existing trend in bilateral relations in some radical way before the elections. The opposition parties maintain good relations with their Slovak counterparts, so that they would be capable of securing continuity in Hungarian-Slovak relations even after the elections. [Gembicky] Mr. Horn, do you think that the Hungarian nation is prepared to accept a socialist government or a socialist prime minister? [Horn] Let this be determined by the voters. We have a chance to win, we have many sympathizers, but I do not know whether this will be enough. I only know that many are ready to accept a socialist government, not only in our own country but also abroad, including large financial institutions. As the Polish example has shown, a left-wing government can manage to conclude agreements abroad that are very advantageous for the country. I do not see any problem for the Socialists to participate in a coalition government either. [Gembicky] What is the nature of your relations with the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] of Peter Weiss? Wherein do your views coincide and wherein do the views between the Hungarian Socialist Party and the SDL differ? [Horn] We have very good contacts with the SDL and with Peter Weiss personally. We also have identical views on most problems. If differences appear, it is always in connection with our views on how to deal with the position of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia. But we will be able to come to an agreement even on this issue. The SDL's policy is in conformity with European criteria and I am therefore an optimist even with regard to the Hungarian minority. I have only the best things to say about Peter Weiss. If we, but also the SDL, became government parties after the elections, it would have a positive influence on bilateral relations and their improvement. [Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 9 April on page 3, under the headline "What Has Remained in the Notebook; Mass Media and Government Propaganda," carries the following 200-word report: ["Recently we published an interview that was given by Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn to our editor Julius Gembicky. One question from that interview, which is topical in Budapest and Bratislava alike, remained in the notebook: [[Gembicky] ``During its reciprocal visit to Budapest, a delegation of the Slovak Syndicate of Journalists familiarized itself with the situation in Hungarian Radio and Television in the wake of the March personnel purges in these two most important media, which had been initiated behind the scenes by the government. What is the Hungarian Socialists' attitude toward these events, which took place shortly before the elections? [[Horn] ``We consider it unacceptable for the government to try to bring large media under its control. Regrettably, the enforced changes have already made themselves felt in programs, which are dominated by government propaganda. This is undemocratic and a gross violation of the principles of freedom of speech. After the elections in May it will be necessary to pass a big media law and establish a nonpartisan body to oversee the electronic media so that they do not depend on a single political party.'']
