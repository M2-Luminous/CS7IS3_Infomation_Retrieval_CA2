This was stated by Mines and Energy Minister I.G. Sujana during his meeting in Beijing with Shi Dazhen, China's electric power industry minister. According to Minister Sujana, the two countries have the identical problem of limited funds to meet the demand for electricity by the people and the industrial sector. As such, Minister Sujana stressed the need to seek cheap alternative sources of electricity -- such as the establishment of hydro, air, and solar electricity plants -- that could be carried out with limited funds. The objective of Mines and Energy Minister Sujana's four-day visit to Beijing, scheduled to conclude on 10 March, is to study China's achievements in the field of electrical energy.
