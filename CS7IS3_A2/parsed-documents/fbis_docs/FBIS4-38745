The decision announced by Russia's gas supplying concern Gazprom followed Moldavia's failure to pay for earlier gas supplies. Moldavian gas industry head Boris Karandyuk said that Moldavia's debt to Russia is estimated at 257 billion roubles. About 107 billion roubles of that sum is owed by the break-away Dniester republic which is seeking economic and political independence from Moldavia. About 70 per cent of the debt belongs to the Moldovenergo Association which supplies the republic with electricity and heat. Karandyuk said that Moldavia has so far paid only 40 billion roubles and is ready to send a large shipment of food and industrial products worth 16 billion roubles to pay part of the remaining sum. "We are seeking ways to pay the debt and intend to resort to foreign credits," Karandyuk said.
