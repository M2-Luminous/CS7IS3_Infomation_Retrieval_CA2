FR940712-2-00104 FR940712-2-00070 Transparency When a request for a customized FCO quote is voiced in the trading crowd, it will be displayed and all responsive quotes will also be displayed. Once a trade is consummated, it will be reported to OPRA and disseminated as an administrative text message over the OPRA system. The Exchange will not be obligated to make continuous markets in customized FCOs, even where open interest has been created. OCC will clear and settle the customized FCOs. Because quotes in these options will not be continuously updated or otherwise priced by the Exchange, OCC will generate a theoretical price based on the prices and quotes of the customized FCOs, prices of standardized series and the closing value of the underlying foreign currency. OCC will use this price to mark the FCOs daily and calculate margin requirements. Miscellaneous Corrections Because this rule filing is proposing to change language in Rules 1009 and 1033, the Exchange is also proposing to correct some inaccurate or redundant information contained in those rules. First, the Exchange believes that Commentary .01(6) of Rule 1009 is almost identical to subsection (c) of that rule and is therefore proposed to be deleted. Secondly, the contract size of the British pound and the French franc, as approved by the Commission, are 31,250 pounds 6 and 250,000 francs, 7 not 12,500 pounds and 125,000 francs as currently stated in Phlx's rules. These sizes and corresponding examples of how to calculate the premium on these FCOs are being corrected in Rule 1033. 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26088 (September 16, 1988), 53 FR 36931 (September 22, 1988). 7 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26478 (January 19, 1989), 54 FR 4362 (January 30, 1989). The Exchange believes that the foregoing rule change proposal is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and with Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and processing information, and facilitate transactions in securities, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest by providing foreign currency option market participants with strike prices more closely suited to their trading strategies. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of publication of the notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.
