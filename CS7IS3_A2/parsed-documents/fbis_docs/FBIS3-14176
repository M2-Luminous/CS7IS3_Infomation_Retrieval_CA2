Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Abu-Salih yesterday revealed that Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, will visit Sudan 31 March carrying a message from President Bill Clinton to President 'Umar al-Bashir related to the war in southern Sudan, human rights, the Sudanese peace negotiations, and the issue of democracy. At a news conference held yesterday Abu-Salih said that Albright's visit "will open the door to a Sudanese-U.S. dialogue." He added that "the United States has stressed to us that it is seeking to play a direct role in the peace process in southern Sudan." He added that his country "is now convinced that the United States is not working to topple the government or obstruct the peace steps." He pointed out that "there are differing views, and the dialogue can bring the views closer." He expressed his hope that the visit "will be positive and bring ideas for the reorganization of Sudanese-U.S. relations with a view to achieving peace." AL-HAYAH has learned from Khartoum sources that Albright's visit to Sudan will last two hours. Sudan welcomed the U.S. State Department's statement in which the United States praised the IGADD [Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development] initiative and welcomed IGADD states' commitment to finding a peaceful settlement to the problem in southern Sudan, urging the two conflicting parties "to seize this opportunity to achieve a settlement." Abu-Salih described the U.S. statement as "positive." He said that his country "welcomes any support for peace." He stressed that "a cease-fire should lead to peace and more stability, not preparation for further wars and military operations." Asked by AL-HAYAH about the diplomatic measures his ministry is going to take against the Ugandan Government after the revelation that Uganda participated in the delivery of weapons to the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, Abu-Salih declined to specify these measures. He said his government "knows the details of this operation, who purchased the weapons, and who delivered them to the rebels." He added: "Despite what Uganda did to Sudan, Sudan consents to Uganda's participation in the IGADD negotiations being held in Nairobi." On Sudan's refusal to include the Hala'ib issue on the agenda of the Arab foreign ministers meeting scheduled for Cairo 26 March, Abu-Salih said: "I hope that this will prompt the achievement of a strategic relationship in the interests of the Sudanese and Egyptian peoples and the Arab nation." He added that his country "has decided not to fall into a dispute over minor matters with the Egyptian Government." He pointed out, however, that rising above "minor matters" does not mean "that we abandon Hala'ib." He said that Khartoum will raise with the Arab League the issue of the war in southern Sudan "in order to take the right stand and secure an equation that enables the people of Sudan to live in peace." He stressed that his government "cannot negotiate on the issue of self-determination" for the south, which he described as "a malicious attept to drag the country into further infighting and fragmentation."
