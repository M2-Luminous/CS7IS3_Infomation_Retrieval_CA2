"We have decided to furnish 40 million U.S. dollars to China initially this year, taking into account the projects the money would finance and the availability of EDCF funds," the official said. The projects include a bridge construction in north China's coastal city of Tianjin, harbor expansion in the eastern province of Shandong, and railroad facilities and airport communications and control facilities in northeastern province of Heilongjiang. The official added that Seoul made the decision after a feasibility study of the projects by a fact-finding team sent to China toward the end of last year.
