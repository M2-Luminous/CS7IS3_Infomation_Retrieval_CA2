ACTION: Final special conditions; request for comments. SUMMARY: These special conditions are issued to Elliott Aviation, Des Moines, Iowa, for a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) on the Beech Models 65, A65, 65&hyph;80, 65&hyph;A80, 65&hyph;B80, 65&hyph;90, 65&hyph;A90, 70, B90, C90, C90A and E90 airplanes. These airplanes will have novel and unusual design features when compared to the state of technology envisaged in the applicable airworthiness standards. These novel and unusual design features include the installation of electronic displays for which the applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate airworthiness standards for the protection of these systems from the effects of high intensity radiated fields (HIRF). These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to the airworthiness standards applicable to these airplanes. DATES: The effective date of these special conditions is [Date of August 5, 1994.] Comments must be received on or before September 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed in duplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, ACE&hyph;7, Attention: Rules Docket Clerk, Docket No. 120CE, Room 1558, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.

All comments submitted will be available in the rules docket for examination by interested parties, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerning this rulemaking will be filed in the docket. Persons wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments, submitted in response to this request, must include a self-addressed and stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 120CE.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Background On July 10, 1994, Elliott Aviation, 2800 McKinley Avenue, Des Moines, Iowa 50321, made an application to the FAA for a supplemental type certificate (STC) for the Beech Models 65, A65, 65&hyph;80, 65&hyph;A80, 65&hyph;B80, 65&hyph;90, 65&hyph;A90, 70, B90, C90, C90A and E90 airplanes. The proposed modification incorporates a novel or unusual design feature, such as digital avionics consisting of an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), that is vulnerable to HIRF external to the airplane.
