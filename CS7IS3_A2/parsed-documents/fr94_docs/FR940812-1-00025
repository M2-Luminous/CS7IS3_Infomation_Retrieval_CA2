FR940812-1-00025 FR940812-1-00005 8. Objectives: The Commission seeks to implement changes to the Communications Act that, inter alia, provide the Commission with the authority to award licenses to use the electromagnetic spectrum through competitive bidding. 9. Legal Basis: The FNPRM is authorized under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;66, Title VI, Section 6002, and Sections 4(i), 303(r), and 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C §§154(i), 303(r), and 309(j). 10. Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements: The proposals under consideration in this FNPRM include the possibility of new reporting and recordkeeping requirements for a number of small business entities. 11. Federal Rules Which Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules: None. 12. Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved: The rule changes proposed in this FNPRM could affect small businesses if they apply for or are granted licenses in the Personal Communications Services in the 2 GHz band (broadband PCS). The FNPRM proposes that certain entities be permitted to obtain broadband PCS licenses for geographic areas that are partitioned from other broadband PCS licenses. After evaluating the comments in response to this FNPRM, the Commission will further examine the impact of any rule changes on small entities and set forth our findings in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. 13. Any Significant Alternatives Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent with the Stated Objectives: None. 14. Other Procedural Matters.
