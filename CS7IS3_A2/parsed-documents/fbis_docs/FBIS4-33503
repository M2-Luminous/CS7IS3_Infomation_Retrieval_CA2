No right-thinking Iranian had expected life to be comfortable after the guns fell silent in 1988. The common masses, who are the supporters of the Islamic Revolution and sacrificed their near and dear ones in the 8-year-old war, knew that the post-war era would be problematic. As is the case in such circumstances, the poor and middle class are always called on to make concessions. They have been ready to do their share every time and in many instances, much more than would be normally expected of them. Speaking strictly of the economic health of the majority of our people, almost six years after Iraq's military aggressions ended we can at best say the situation has been deteriorating. To say the least the government of President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani seems to have entirely put the fate of the economy in the hands of `market forces'. Our economic planners have generally been unsuccessful and this bitter reality is clearly visible in the market itself. Prices of goods and services have jumped to between 50 to 250 percent in the past few months. Chaos rules supreme in the bazaars to the extent that the business community refuses to acknowledge even the basic principles of trade not to mention the frontiers of human relations, ethics and respect for the rule of law. One lady shopper says of the retailers and shop-owners "they have full freedom to raise prices". In an area of a few hundred meters, prices differ as much as 20 to 30 percent `depending on the conscience and justice' of the seller. For years, we have heard our statesmen talk about the need to build a society on the foundation of social justice and economic morals. There is no death of seminars, conferences and gatherings where economic and social planners stick to the rhetoric of directing and sustaining our Muslim society, free from discrimination and injustice. But, whether we like it or not, the fundamental truth is that rhetoric has far outstripped reality. People with fixed incomes are doomed as their purchasing power declines every day and along with it their morale and tolerance. This week the minister of commerce announced that it is compulsory to put price tags on commodities. It's a too little and too late a move. As far as our information goes, this measures also does not carry enough weight and was reportedly not coordinated with other related institutions and ministries. The tagging is no relief at all. Experience teaches us that this move is yet another gimmick to `stabilize the market', will have the same fate as hundreds of its predecessors. Looking at the way ministries have functioned in the recent past, observers feel the government is equally to be blamed for the frightening confusion, as the middlemen and opportunists. They believe the government has exacerbated the already high inflation rate and slow economic growth--all of which have worsened the country's socio-economic problems and eroded the financial stability of the middle class. Then there is the dollar disease. Everything from pin to plane is calculated on the `$ price'. Education, housing and medical services are gradually getting out of reach for the ordinary working class, as our policymakers are increasingly forgetting that these three basics are rights and not privileges. We are always given sermons about falling revenues due to the drop in oil prices. Of course the oil argument cannot be regarded as total nonsense. No doubt that too is a factor, but let's not forget that all developing countries do not survive on oil. They select and elect the right people for key positions. Honesty, efficiency and merit are the criteria of appointments in majority of the states if not all. Thank God, most of our officials are certainly honest and God-fearing persons and some are competent too. In view of the current socio-economic problems in the country effective action should be taken to find similar people for the middle and lower ranking government positions also. Nevertheless the people would like to see what the Commerce Ministry's tagging will bring in its wake. It has become apparent that the government's influence in maintaining economic order is slight to almost non-existent.
