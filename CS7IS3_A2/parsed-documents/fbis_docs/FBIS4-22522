The reforms begun in the country (or what are reputed to be reforms) have not deprived this occupation of its criminal touch by any means. Rather, just the opposite is true. According to data of the Economic Crimes Main Administration (GUEP) of the Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs, the stratification of society by income level and the concentration of large sums in the hands of a relatively small number of entrepreneurs have led to a sharp increase in the demand for gold, silver, diamonds, and foreign currency. The vacuum formed in this market was filled first by representatives of the criminal world, which is perfectly natural. One of the specialists in this problem--GUEP staffer Aleksandr Alekseyev--believes we can now speak about the existence in Russia of a real industry in the illegal extraction, processing, and sale of gold and diamonds. Criminals are actively organizing ties with officials in the state apparatus and foreign colleagues and developing channels for the "export" of Russian valuables. A situation, especially a criminal situation, can be evaluated only conditionally by statistics, but the figures on currency crime for 1993 look really impressive. According to the GUEP data, nearly 6,000 crimes of this type were discovered last year; during the course of their investigation, more than 250 kilograms of gold, nearly 50 kilograms of platinum, over 1.8 metric tons of silver, precious stones totaling 1,877 carats, and so forth were confiscated--altogether more than 13 billion rubles [R] (in last year's prices)! It should be noted at the same time that, according to the same statistics, the illegal currency business, like the drug business, is one of the most profitable forms of crime, and according to the most optimistic estimates, a very small proportion of the "commodity" in illegal turnover is being confiscated by the authorities. According to the GUEP data citd by Aleksandr Alekseyev, the backbone of Russia's illegal currency business is made up of well-organized groups from republics in the Caucasus united by family clans. Each one of them closely monitors the gold mining regions of the country, and they are mainly the ones, in the specialists' opinion, who are practically paralyzing normal development of the entire currency market. While previously the currency traders were considered the intellectual elite of the criminal world and stood apart in it, openly criminal methods have taken root in their activities, such as armed raids on placer mines, attempts to work deposits, and so forth. The GUEP experts believe that a sizable "contribution" to this has been made by the sluggishness of the Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones [Roskomdragmet], in which the system for protecting valuables has been practically unchanged over the past 10 years. The technologies and equipment being used in the mining and processing of gold and natural diamonds is extremely obsolete, and, as a result, the precious raw material often turns out to be easily accessible. With the introduction of new, more improved capacities, the rates of gold consumption are not being reviewed in a timely manner, to put it mildly--one more source for the thieves. There are frequent cases in which persons who have not been checked out are allowed in the Roskomdragmet itself, where work associated with the extraction and processing of gold is conducted. In February 1994, during a check by the gold acceptance office for the "Chikaya" Placer Mine of the "Zabaykalzoloto" Association, nearly 30 kilograms of gold to be turned over to the state were discovered to have been concealed by employees. In Alekseyev's words, the expected economic gain was not achieved and the right to extract precious metals and precious stones granted to all juridical persons and citizens of Russia by the government decision in January 1992 was not materialized. But then, it had already become a widespread excuse for the "laundering" of illegally obtained valuables by criminal groups and one more source of enrichment. In 1993, as an example, 578 licenses were issued to physical persons in the country's 15 gold mining regions, and they turned in 167 kilograms of the metal--a ridiculous figure, in the specialists' opinion. In Magadan Oblast, the official productivity of one prospector averaged just a little over 250 grams of gold. According to the GUEP data, the principal channel for taking out the stolen gold and diamonds continues to be air transportation. But the methods of shipping it has changed somewhat in recent years, taking the situation into account. While previously the couriers preferred to conceal the precious stones on themselves or in their clothing, as a rule, now they take them out mainly in their baggage (because of the higher volume of flights) or they avoid inspection altogether with the help of corrupt airport employees. It is worth noting that politics has been mixed up in the illegal currency business lately. The experts believe that part of the precious stones being stolen in Russia through corrupt contacts in the Caucasus, the Baltic, and Central Asia are being used to support and finance extremist nationalist movements. Analysis of all these processes, according to Aleksandr Alekseyev, has led GUEP experts to the conclusion that the gold mining industry may become one of the principal levers in the near future in the struggle against criminal associations for their sphere of influence. At the same time, this sector of industry itself will be subjected to even greater widespread pressure from their side. According to GUEP estimates, crime in the currency field may increase by several times as much. But there are a few grounds for optimism with respect to control over the situation by this service, Alekseyev believes. On one hand, the sector's breakup into separate and independent enterprises (including the mines and pits) is continuing. As a consequence, the centralized system for protecting the valuables being extracted has collapsed. On the other hand, the legislation which regulates currency operations, the transfer of precious stones, and so forth continues to be extremely watered down and abstract. Article 88 of the Russian Federation UK [Criminal Code] does not contain a clear-cut description of what constitutes "an illegal currency operation." According to the law "On Currency Regulation and Currency Control," establishment of the procedure for a transaction with precious metals and the like was put in the hands of the government, the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and customs, but these questions have not been resolved to date. The numerous norms which exist are in open contradiction with each other. As an example, the illegal purchase, sale, and extraction of gold is considered a crime now, but its storage and transportation is not considered a crime. It is foolish, but this is how the law is. Of course, the criminals are aware of this and take advantage of it. It is interesting that the confusion reigning in this field, according to Aleksandr Alekseyev, has attracted the interest of Western businessmen. According to the GUEP, many industrial trading firms, mainly in the United States, South Africa, and Israel, consider the present currency situation in Russia to be very favorable for their activity. Negotiations on collaboration and the formation of various SP [joint ventures] to extract and process gold, diamonds, and so forth, are now being conducted by dozens of firms, and in most cases the Russian side does not turn out to be in the most advantageous position. But Russian commercial structures' interest in precious metals and stones is high as well. But it has a somewhat different tinge--according to certain data, businessmen are preparing and pushing through a legal basis to circumvent the state monopoly on trade in precious metals and stones.
