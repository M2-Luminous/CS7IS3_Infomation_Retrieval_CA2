The horror of the massacres and the distress of those who have escaped overwhelm even the most indifferent. It would be too simple to explain the succession of dramatic events by some "fatal African penchant" for violence. 1. Crisis Has Both Political and Ethnic Origins Let us remind ourselves of what Rwanda was before President Habyarimana's assassination. After years of ethnic tension and of struggle for political power, there was some hope: The president, the moderate Hutus and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] had accepted talks and envisioned a sharing of power, thereby renouncing the temptation of military confrontation. The Arusha accords of 4 August 1993, to which France had contributed by persuading the Rwandan head of state to open up the political system and by organizing the initial contacts between the authorities and the RPF, are proof of this. Those who, in both camps, did not want these accords, precisely because they left a chance for peace and ruled out a military solution, did everything possible to delay their implementation. Everything, including the irreparable act: The assassination of the president who had accepted the voice of moderation. Today Rwanda is confronted with a conflict which is both ethnic and political. We have to use the word genocide, as the active militia in the government zones are indeed intent on killing Tutsis -- men, women, children, the injured, and religious -- by the sole virtue of their ethnic origin. But at the same time, a merciless fight for power is being waged, in which the moderates have been the first victims of the Hutu extremists and in which the RPF's military wing has opted for total victory without concessions. 2. International Community Has Demonstrated Culpable Passivity None of this is tolerable. And everybody involved in this chaos carries his share of responsibility. France, people are quick to say, but not France alone. The policy which our governments have carried out for a number of years in Rwanda is certainly not infallible. The hundreds of thousands of victims in Rwanda for whom we weep today demonstrate the tragic limits of this. But one cannot tolerate any suspicion of the spirit in which French diplomacy worked in Rwanda. France has never supported one Rwandan tribe against another. It has not ceased to hammer home one self-evident fact: There can be no military solution in Rwanda, nor can there be a political solution which consists of one single party confiscating power from all the others. This was true for President Habyarimana's party and still applies just us much to the RPF. There will be no durable settlement outside a sharing of power. This position of principle runs counter to those who, in both camps, dream of governing alone and without dialogue. If we did indeed manage to convince President Habyarimana to accept this compromise, the extremists in his clan did not intend things to be this way and acted to prevent the president from seriously implementing the Arusha accords. But had the international community sought sufficient assurances that these accords would be implemented? I do not believe so. A year ago, France diplomacy led an intense campaign to enhance awareness, calling for the sending in of a UN force as provided for in what were to become the Arusha accords. Let us say it: International indifference toward Rwanda was at that time total. It took months for the United Nations to take up position on the Ugandan border, and then to set up the first UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda (UNAMIR) and have it leave for Kigali. Where are we today? Have the states involved (Security Council members, countries of the region) really learned the lessons of the drama which is being played out in Rwanda? I would like to believe so. The strengthened UNAMIR is not yet in the field. Let us not accuse the United Nations: This requires soldiers, and if African countries have answered courageously to the call, they have to be equipped. The French Government has released 20 million francs [Fr] for this purpose. I hope that other countries will follow suite and will act quickly. Nothing should be allowed to hold up the deployment of blue helmets, which is the one thing which will make it possible to save lives. 3. French Diplomacy Favors Political Settlement It is not enough to call for the presence of one's United Nations in order to give oneself a good conscience. One must act. France was the first country to mobilize substantial aid, which has today exceeded Fr30 million, and to get it to those to whom it is destined: air lifts, support to the Red Cross, the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees], to NGO's [non-government organizations], sending infrastructures to refugee camps, setting up an antenna of the world SAMU [Medical Emergency Ambulance Service]. No means, no channel has been neglected in order to come to the assistance of the civilian populations. But humanitarian aid without a political program is quickly limited. We have successfully presented our views on a solution to the Rwandan crisis to the Security Council. We have also spelled it out to the countries close to Rwanda, by sending Jean-Michel Marlaud, our ambassador to Rwanda, whom I had personally mandated for this essential mission, to meet with their authorities. At the OAU meeting in Tunis, France urged a meeting of the heads of those African states which are the most concerned, which finally happened. If France declared itself in favor of a rapid meeting of the heads of states neighboring on Rwanda, it is because interaction between the countries of the region and the permeability of borders are a reality which cannot be ignored and which can either play a pacifying role or which, on the contrary, can contribute to a general conflagration. Right now Tanzania and Burundi are being subjected to flows of refugees, and for these countries, the risks of destabilization are high. It would be particularly unjust if the sense of responsibility which has been demonstrated by Burundi's leaders since the outset of the crisis were to breached by contagion from extremists. With regard to Uganda and Zaire, it is essential that their leaders demonstrate the same constructive spirit and take every necessary measure to avoid the conflict being fueled from their territories. A mandatory arms embargo has been voted by the Security Council with our full support. It should be respected by everyone. 4. Rwanda's Future Requires Us To Support Moderates in All Parties What will be the future for Rwanda? A cease-fire and an end to the massacres must come before anything else. It will also be necessary to create the conditions for a return of the refugees. The United Nations will be able to make a major contribution here. Then there will be the need to pick up the political dialogue again, whatever the military situation on the ground. I hope that the desire for peace will win the day, and with it the concern for national reconciliation between Rwandans of goodwill. This naturally excludes those who have committed, encouraged, or provided cover for massacres. Above everything else, they must be identified in order to exclude them from any negotiations on the future of a country which they have contributed to destroying. France will show no good will toward the murderers or those who gave them their orders. France, which is the only Western country represented at ministerial level at the extraordinary session of the Commission for Human Rights at Geneva, demands that those responsible for these genocides be tried. France will support those moderates who, despite the persecution which they have been subjected to, have survived -- and, France is proud to say, in many cases with our help -- and are ready to play their part once the conditions have once again been created. They will not be able to achieve this on their own. It is the duty of the international community to protect them, to support them, and to make sure that their voice is heard, and that the voice of every extremist is silenced. Ours is a genuine duty to intervene in Rwanda. It is no longer enough to deplore the massacres with our arms folded, but it is time to take initiatives. The urgent need for international intervention should lead us to demonstrate imagination and courage. If the UNAMIR is slow in arriving in Rwanda, why not use a part of the 18,000 blue helmets which are still in Somalia, and which could reach Kigali quickly? I have proposed this plan to the UN secretary general, who is in favor in principle. We are working actively on getting it implemented via our permanent representative in New York. If all this proves insufficient, France is ready, along with its main European and African partners, to prepare an intervention on the ground in order to put an end to the massacres and to protect the populations threatened with extermination. No solution should be ruled out in order to bring the Rwandan tragedy to an end. France should play its full part in this effort.
