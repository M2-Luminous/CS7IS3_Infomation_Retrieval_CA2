FBIS4-27440 "dreas106__a94027" FBIS-EAS-94-106-A Daily Report 28 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Reportage on Reaction to Deregulation Measures Reportage on Reaction to Deregulation Measures Ministries Unhappy With MITI List OW2905141694 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 28 May 94 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2905141694 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Included on a "list of recommendations" for deregulation is the suggestion that if liquor sales were shifted from the current licence system to a reporting system, it would hold down the prices of liquor, increase the variety of liquor on the shelves of supermarkets, and benefit consumers. The list of recommendations is stirring controversy within the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters (headed by Prime Minister Hata) and government ministries and agencies. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has compiled the list of deregulation recommendations, taking into account trade requests from European nations and, according to a government source, many people rate the list highly as "an effective way to open the Japanese market." The list of recommendations for deregulation, however, fails to include any matters under the jurisdiction of MITI and, according to a source in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, other government ministries and agencies have therefore reacted to it, saying, "At a time when we are struggling to come up with our deregulatory measures, MITI is interfering in the affairs of other ministries and agencies and leaving its own untouched by derregulation." The battle over measures to relax bureaucratic regulations has begun to seem less like a "confrontation between government and the private sector" and more like a "confrontation between government ministries and agencies." The list of recommendations for deregulation consists of two documents -- one for the deregulation of distribution and another for the deregulation of logistic distribution [butsuryu], standards, certification, and import procedures. The list of recommendations cites problems with regulation in 16 areas, points out which areas should be deregulated and notes the effect this wi;; have. The deregulation list proposes changing the current license system for liquor to a sales reporting system. It is currently under the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry. To help importers, a similar change is proposed for perfume, a move which would follow the system widely adopted in the United States and Europe. Cosmetic sales currently fall under the authority of the Health and Welfare Ministry. The list stresses that price differentials between Japan and other nations should be narrowed, claiming that prices of goods in Japan are two times higher than in the United States and Europe. Commenting on the deregulation list, a businessman said it was a bold one and "contains some deregulatory steps that go beyond requests made by the private sector." The Hata cabinet is pressing government ministries and agencies to map out a package of deregulatory measures by the end of June, a commitment made by Japan to the United States. Ministries and agencies, though, see the Hata administration as a minority government, and they are continuing to resist pressure to relax current regulations. The same agriculture ministry source said: "The Hata cabinet believes that if it asks government ministries and agencies to shift to the reporting system, they would propose no deregulatory measures. It is, therefore, allotting a quota of deregulatory measures to each government ministry and agency saying, 'We hope your ministry will include this deregulatory step in the package'." Such action shows the Hata cabinet is taking a tough stand on the government ministries and agencies as part of its efforts to push for deregulation. The prevailing view is that MITI has secretly compiled the list of deregulation recommendations with the aim of using the current deregulation drive as an opportunity to instantly heighten the mood for deregulation in specific areas. MITI Minister Eijiro Hata said the list would play a "pivotal role in relaxing Japan's bureaucratic regulations.". The list, however, does not mention relaxation of the Large-Scale Retail Store Law nor the Provisional Law on the Import of Specific Oil Products, both of which are under MITI's jurisdiction. For that reason, other government ministries and agencies are irritated by "MITI's attempts to win high marks" as the deadline looms for drawing up the deregulation package. Officials in other government ministries are concerned that "the prime minister's official residence, which is looking for key areas for deregulation, may pick up ideas from the list of recommendations." A senior MITI official does not deny compiling the list of recommendations, stressing: "If Japan fails to work to build new industries by correcting the price differentials between it and other nations, it will lose its international competitiveness."
