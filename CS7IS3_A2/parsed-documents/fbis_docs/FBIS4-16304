Despite a government decision dated 31 August 1992, funding of the construction in Nikolayev of a technical floating dock for dismantling submarines has been suspended. And that despite the fact that the facility is more than 60 percent finished. Construction of two specialized docks for overhauling nuclear reactors at Kherson shipyards has also been put on ice. At present Russia has no docks where nuclear submarines can be dismantled and nuclear reactors removed. More than 200 submarines are waiting in the North and the Far East. The spent nuclear fuel has not even been removed yet from more than one-third of them. Despite the fact that the reactors have been shut down, they must be constantly cooled. An accident at a submarine graveyard could produce another Chernobyl. Some time ago construction of two of the urgently needed docks was started at Ukrainian shipyards. One is 30 percent ready, the other is already 65 percent ready. Contractors are owed 12 billion rubles. And yet, up to 80 percent of the appropriations set aside by the government is due to return to Russia, to the self-same contractors. Perhaps the necessary resources should now be made available not from funds for disarmament purposes, but from funds set aside for environmental protection. Otherwise expenditure may have to be incurred to deal with an emergency situation, or even a catastrophe.
