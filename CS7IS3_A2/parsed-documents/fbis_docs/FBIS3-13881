Jawad Naji, head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's (PLO) Economic Department in Amman, said there was a good response to advertisements in the past two months inviting applications from qualified candidates in the Arab World and elsewhere. More than 95 per cent of all applicants are Palestinians and the rest were both Arabs and non-Arabs, Dr. Naji said, adding that the priority of the council was to select heads of departments who will then be given leeway to set up the departments and recruit their support staff. The 13-member PECDAR was established in late 1993 as PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat as its head and Faruq Qaddumi, chief of the Political Department of the PLO, and Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, head of the Economic Department of the PLO, as his two deputies. Other members of the council are: Ahmad Quray' (director-general), Hasan Abu-Libdah and Sari Nusaybah (deputy directors-general), Sufyan al-Sultan, Ibrahim Dikkah, Nabil Qassis, Muhammad Samhuri, Khalil al-Hindi, Yusuf Sayigh, Antoine Zahlan and Nabil al-Sharif. The council is entrusted with devising a structure for economic development and administration for the occupied territories during the five-year Palestinian autonomy period envisaged in the Sept. 13 Israel-PLO accord. It will also draw up plans for development projects in the occupied territories and act as a conduit for international assistance to support Palestinian self-rule as envisaged in the autonomy accord. Dr. Naji rejected suggestions that pressure from donors, who have pledged $2 billion in aid to the Palestinians, had prompted the council to look for talent outside the PLO. Reports have suggested that the donors were insisting that the council be administered by qualified economic experts rather than political appointees. He said the council had established a good rapport will the World Bank, which is coordinating the international effort to financially support Palestinian self-rule and develop the Palestinian economy. The interviews that the council plans to conduct in Tunis, Jerusalem and elsewhere this month and next month will be with applicants for the posts of directors of treasury, budget, financial administration, internal audit, tax and customs as well as computer experts. "We have to have a stream-lined state economy with no less responsibilities and functions than those of a full government," said Dr. Naji. "As such, every aspect of a national economy has to be addressed." The council expects that it needs $400 million for running costs during the first year of Palestinian autonomy. A meeting of a steering committee supervising aid for Palestinians decided in January to allocate up to $160 million to help start autonomy. "That is their estimate, but we believe that the $400 million figure reflects more accurately our actual needs," said Dr. Naji. He said contacts were continuing between the council and the steering committee. The panel is meeting in Paris this week to review the progress of self-rule arrangements and review allocation of funds for specific projects. Some of the donors have already allocated part of their pledges to various U.N. agencies already working in the occupied territories.
