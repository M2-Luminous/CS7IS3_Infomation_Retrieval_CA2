FR941104-2-00003 FR941104-2-00001 Determination Based on its analysis of the data submitted by Calgene, a review of other scientific data, the comments received from the public, and a review of field tests of the original transformant lines pCGN3828&hyph;212/86&hyph;18 and pCGN3828&hyph;212/86&hyph;23 and other lines derived from those two transformants, APHIS has determined that the subject Laurate canola lines: (1) Exhibit no plant pathogenic properties; (2) are no more likely to become weeds than their nonengineered parental varieties; (3) are unlikely to increase the weediness potential of any other cultivated plant or native wild species with which the organisms can interbreed; (4) will not cause damage to processed agricultural commodities; and (5) are unlikely to harm other organisms, such as bees or earthworms, that are beneficial to agriculture. APHIS has also concluded that there is a reasonable certainty that new progeny varieties bred from the Laurate canola lines pCGN3828&hyph;212/86&hyph;18 and pCGN3828&hyph;212/86&hyph;23 will not exhibit new plant pest properties, i.e., properties substantially different from any observed in the field-tested Laurate canola lines, or those observed in standard canola in traditional breeding programs. The effect of this determination is that the two original transformant Laurate canola lines designated pCGN3828&hyph;212/86&hyph;18 and pCGN3828&hyph;212/86&hyph;23, and all other lines bred from those two transformants by sexual or asexual reproduction involving Mendelian inheritance, are no longer considered regulated articles under APHIS' regulations in 7 CFR part 340. Therefore, the permit and notification requirements pertaining to regulated articles under those regulations no longer apply to the field testing, importation, or interstate movement of the subject Laurate canola lines or their progeny. However, the importation of the Laurate canola lines and any Laurate canola nursery stock or seeds capable of propagation is still subject to the restrictions found in APHIS' foreign quarantine notices in 7 CFR part 319. National Environmental Policy Act An environmental assessment (EA) has been prepared to examine the potential environmental impacts associated with this determination. The EA was prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq .), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272&hyph;51274, August 31, 1979). Based on that EA, APHIS has reached a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) with regard to its determination that the Laurate canola lines designated as pCGN3828&hyph;212/86&hyph;18 and pCGN3828&hyph;212/86&hyph;23, and other lines bred from those two transformants by sexual or asexual reproduction involving Mendelian inheritance, are no longer regulated articles under its regulations in 7 CFR part 340. Copies of the EA and the FONSI are available upon request from the individual listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Done in Washington, DC, this 31st day of October, 1994. Terry L. Medley, Acting Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27405 Filed 11&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;34&hyph;P
