At the opening of the session, upon a proposal made by Senator Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu, the senators marked their regret over the persons who fell in the struggle against Communism by standing silently for a minute. Following this, they resumed discussing the draft bill on the organization and functioning of the Romanian Police. An amendment proposed by the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] parliamentary group stirred a fierce dispute among the senators. Among other things, the amendment stipulates that, quote, in the territorial-administrative units in which the ethnic minority inhabitants represent the majority as compared to the total number of the population, the newly appointed or employed personnel of the police must be able to speak the language of that ethnic minority, respectively, must come, in a sufficient number, from among the persons belonging to that ethnic minority, unquote. However, the amendment was then rejected, as merely 16 senators voted in its favor. The debate continued after a short break. The most important article that was discussed by the end of the morning session referred to the sentencing to life imprisonment of persons who kill police officers in the exercise of their duty. Our correspondent, Victor Spirache, also reports that, after discussions were suspended on that draft bill, a number of senators made statements in their own name on various issues.
