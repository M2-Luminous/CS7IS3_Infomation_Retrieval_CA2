Are a certain people at fault if they take their own side, trench, and active weapons? Our people from all walks of life and across the political spectrum took a worthy stand throughout the Mother of Battles. Our people tilted toward truth and that continues to be the case. They continue to be in truth's fighting trenches, in the battalions of the camp of justice and the faithful led by the mujahid leader President Saddam Husayn. Anyone who wants to speak on behalf of the Palestinian people must utter only that which truly represents their position and militant march on the road of freedom and the Arab character of the homeland. The Saudi Arabian regime -- mired in treason, ignominy, and subordination, and, having leased Arab territory and tradition in the Arabian Peninsula to invaders -- is not a custodian of our people. Nor is it the right party to issue certificates of good conduct and inflict punishment. Anyone who will apologize for our people's distinguished stand during the Mother of battles and their taking Iraq's side only speaks for his own ignominiousness. Such a person has no right to claim he is speaking in the name of or representing our people. Our militant people, who were unanimous in their support for Iraq in the Mother of Battles, knew then and are still convinced that the position they took was the right one. Our people will take the same position and sit in the same trench in all the Arab nation's battles and honorable pages of glory. All Saudi Arabia's money that has been withheld from our people, revolutionaries, and our valiant intifadah, and diverted to foot the bills of aggression on the Arab nation, cannot buy the consciences of the Palestinian people and their decisive, historic stands. This is because our people are too good to be bribed with ill-gotten money that has hurt and bankrolled aggression on the Arab nation. Our people will not stand for an apology. Our people will never apologize for taking their own side and trench and honorable history.
