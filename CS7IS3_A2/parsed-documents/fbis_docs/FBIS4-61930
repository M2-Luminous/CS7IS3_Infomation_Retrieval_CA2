Viktor Posuvalyuk heads the Middle East and Africa section in the Russian Foreign Ministry. We asked him to share with us his opinion about the prospect of the introduction of Palestinian self rule after the signing in Egypt of the Israeli and Palestinian agreement relating to Gaza and the town of Jericho. Here is the exclusive interview he granted us. The Russian leadership and the majority of the population are overwhelmed with the signing in Cairo of an agreement on Gaza and the town of Jericho. The agreement is already being implemented. According to the Russian diplomat, the essence of this step is that it is the beginning of a practical advance toward a final agreement in the Israeli and Palestinian negotiations direction and toward an autonomy for the Palestinians [as heard]. Simultaneously, it is an advance toward more security for the Israeli population. Now it can be said that the Palestine Liberation Organization, PLO, will have to assume control of the territories from where the Israeli troops and police are pulled out. The task here is of a multifaceted nature including the domestic needs of the population. These problems are particularly acute in Gaza. Further on, the Russian diplomat said that Russia wished that a switch to a Palestinian administration was not accompanied with any internal Palestinian confrontation or an escalation of strife. Russia will expect that on the contrary there will be an active political force in these territories that will support the Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho. We in Russia will warmly welcome it if there is a consensus and mutual understanding between the Palestinians and the leaders of the PLO, the leading officers of the Palestinian policemen, and such organization as the HAMAS [Islamic Resistance movement] and other Palestinian political figures who hold a more radical view [as heard]. This is no time for arguments or bloodshed. This is time to begin solving actual problems of the Palestinian people. It is time to move toward peace. [Words indistinct] that the agreement on Gaza and Jericho as the beginning of the implementation of the agreement signed in Washington last year, will firmly serve the aim of peacemaking, calmness, and toning town the pitch of passions inside Israel itself. Concluding his interview to Radio Moscow, Viktor Posuvalyuk said that Russia supports the Rabin government's policy directed at finding a political settlement of the issue and ensuring peace in this Middle East region. At the same time, Mr. Posuvalyuk stressed, it is necessary to mention all the other negotiations, among which we still regard the Syrian one as one of the (?pilots) in the Middle East peace efforts. I can confirm here that Russia has taken and will take in this direction a most energetic part in bringing peace to the Middle East.
