This is the opinion of private sector experts, who feel this situation cannot be sustained and that this apparent improvement is a double-edged sword. The situation is really disturbing, for the quality of jobs has deteriorated, underemployment has risen, and the decline in earnings is obvious. The president of Andi [National Association of Industrialists], Carlos Arturo Angel, said the number of people out of work has apparently declined, but in reality, while informal employment throughout Latin America averages 31 percent, in Colombia it provides 56 percent of the total number of jobs. Twenty percent are temporary jobs, and now the number of persons working for salaries below the minimum wage is very high. In 1993 employment rates in the formal sector declined 1.2 percent, and now the guerrillas are providing a labor pool. These remarks show that while euphoria is being generated by the latest unemployment figures, barely a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg of unemployment in Colombia can be seen. Unemployment in industry seems to have declined, but not as the result of any official policy. This makes the nation's stability in the next few years precarious. Jobs are being created in construction, services, and through increased government spending, but formal employment in industry, agriculture, and exports shows a steep decline. Angel said that in an open economy a development model is needed that takes the jobs strategy into account; we need to choose between moving the economy toward more of a service-based economy, or a policy of real industrial development. These remarks were made at the "Apertura" [Trade Liberalization] and Employment Forum held in Medellin, at which presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano presented his proposals for generating 1.5 million productive jobs. The goal is to achieve economic growth above 6 percent, which would allow the unemployment rate to be brought down to 5 percent by the end of this century. According to Angel, if Colombia does not grow and expand its industrial development, it will not be able to provide jobs for labor, and the "apertura" will just bring in more imports, leading to a real collapse of our exports. In the opinion of the director of Fedesarrollo [Federation for Development], Eduardo Lora, the strategy the government has used to reduce unemployment is a double-edged sword, and the improved employment rates are the result of a macroeconomic policy that needs to be corrected, as it is detrimental to the possibility of developing better and long-term jobs. In his view, basing this strategy on promoting government spending and construction is a mistake, as such a policy cannot be sustained on a macroeconomic and long-term level. The rural problem was called the worst heritage this government is leaving behind, for the agricultural worker is worse off now than in 1950, as his real earnings have declined 15 percent. The dean of the School of Economics of the University of the Andes, Eduardo Sarmiento, suggested that the "apertura" policy in agriculture needs to be revamped. Agriculture today faces the most serious crisis of the past 20 years. Only livestock, milk, and soybeans have escaped this crisis, as these products are excluded from the "apertura." He added that similar results are seen in industry, the result of the declining production of high value-added goods. Even though there has been a great expansion in construction, government services, and profit margins in the financial sector, it is unwise to sacrifice industry, agriculture, and exports for such gains. On the issue of jobs, he noted that in the past two years not a single job has been created in industry and agriculture, but jobs have been found in construction, for cabdrivers, and for Dane [National Administrative Department of Statistics] bureaucrats. Sarmiento called for a shift from the "apertura" policy of replacing limited and low wage jobs to a complementary policy in which jobs would be generated in modern sectors of the economy. In general, the persons attending this forum representing a variety of views did reach consensus on a number of matters: the importance of centering economic and social policy on jobs, because despite the present drop in unemployment to 7.8 percent, it is by no means certain that this rate can be maintained, and the unemployment rate reveals barely the tip of the iceberg. The most serious problems are underemployment and unstable and low-wage jobs. Other vital issues are the key role of the exchange rate and the need to avoid revaluation, which has thwarted the potential of the "apertura."
