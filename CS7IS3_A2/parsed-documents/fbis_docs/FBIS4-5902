Sunho shipping company, a joint venture between South Korea's Samsun Shipping Corp. and China's Xianhu business group, has chartered a 4,200-ton containership from St. Vincent and the Grenadines and will send it from Pusan to the North Korean port of Chongjin on Monday. The ship will carry 1,400 tons of construction equipment, which is to be transported again by truck from Chongjin to China. The Pusan-Chongjin-Yanji route will shorten the time needed to transport goods to seven days, compared to the previous 40-45 days on the Pusan-Dalian-Yanji route. Sunho plans to operate ships on the route once a month on a regular basis, Samsun officials said. The inter-Korean sea route became available after the Xianhu group contracted with the North Korean Government to jointly develop Chongjin port last June. Under the contract, the Chinese group has the right to use the port for 50 years. Samsun opened a sea route from Inchon through a Chinese port to the North Korean port of Nampo early last year and is operating freighters on the route twice a month. A Samsun official said, "if inter-Korean relations improve, goods transported through this direct inter-Korean sea route will also increase." Samsun carried 5,000 tons of rice from Mokpo to the North Korean port of Najin in July 1991 -- a first for a Korean shipping company.
