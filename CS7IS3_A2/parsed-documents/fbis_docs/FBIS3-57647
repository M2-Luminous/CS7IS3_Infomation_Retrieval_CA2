In an interview in the Athens newspaper TA NEA, Yannikos recalled that PRAVDA INTERNATIONAL, which he heads, possesses 55 percent of the newspaper's shares and does not intend to cooperate with Russian businessmen. The Greek Communist publisher said that the newspaper has no economic problems as he has sufficient funds to continue its publication. In the view of Yannikos, Linnik's statement does not reflect the view of the PRAVDA editorial staff, many of whom oppose the editor. In Athens it is said that the interview given by the Greek owner of PRAVDA testifies to the serious split within its management connected with the newspaper's crisis and the sharp drop in the number of copies being printed. The local press recalls in this connection the storm that blew up in 1992 when the Athens publisher, who was known to few people in the Greek capital, unexpectedly became the owner of what had once been one of the most authoritative Russian newspapers. Assumptions were voiced that the funds used for publishing PRAVDA were certainly not the personal funds of Yannikos, but rather CPSU money that had earlier been transferred abroad. He flatly denied this but was quite unable to explain where he got the millions of dollars to support this publication.
