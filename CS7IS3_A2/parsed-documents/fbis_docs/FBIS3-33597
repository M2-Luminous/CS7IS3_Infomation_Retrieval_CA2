In the brigadier's opinion, "petroleum is a strategic element, and therefore it is necessary to remain alert to the international interests that want to conquer the Brazilian petroleum reserves." According to the ESG commander, "society must not accept that Brazil be treated like a marginal country." Ferolla advocated state control on petroleum exploration during a Science Forum discussion and during a meeting with federal university directors, both of which were held at the Rio de Janeiro Federal University (UFRJ). In his assessment, society has not discussed this issue at length, and it would be too early to implement such an important change. Ferolla claimed: "If the Constituent Congress decides to break the petroleum monopoly, it will be an untimely decision." In the ESG commander's opinion, "serious issues like those of monopolies should be decided with more coldbloodedness and less emotion." The brigadier said it was necessary for society to be more conscious to discussion of the great national issues. He asked this "especially from young people, who will be carrying out the development of our country." Ferolla believes Brazil lacks a development model that takes into account the great differences existing between its regions. Ferolla noted: "We require strategic planning. This is not a job for the military but for the whole of society, because the enemy is advancing. All it takes is to notice that our country is breaking apart." In the ESG commander's opinion, this planning must not take into account the desires of the multinational companies "that are viewing the commercial side alone." He explained that this does not involve opposing the multinational companies. Ferolla concluded: "They may and must gain their money, but they must not meddle with our country's sovereignty."
