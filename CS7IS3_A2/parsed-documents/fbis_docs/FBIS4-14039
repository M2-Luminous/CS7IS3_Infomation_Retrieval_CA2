It said that "their terms and demands calling for the disarmament of the resistance reveal the extent of the enemy's anxiety about the effectiveness of that resistance, its forces, and its ability to undermine the enemy's security and presence in the occupied territories. Furthermore, such terms reflect a clear Zionist line relying on U.S. political and military support." It added that "these conditions give a very good idea of the attrition to which the enemy is subjected, resulting in policy confusion." It expressed fear that "the enemy might turn that problem around by exploiting some willingness to discuss these terms or respond to some of them, like what happened to the Hamas representatives in Jordan." It "totally" rejected these terms, and it asked: "Do recent declarations by enemy leaders call for a strong and firm reaction or does not the matter deserve any bother by some people?" It warned against the "suspect trumpets trying to give the recent confrontations and the subsequent Zionist-Lahdist aggressions the label of internal disputes and to turn the matter toward sectarian sedition and conflict." It urged "these trumpets to stop these attempts, particularly as what they say does not indicate that they see the occupation and its agents as a threat to the homeland, the people, the territory, and sovereignty."
