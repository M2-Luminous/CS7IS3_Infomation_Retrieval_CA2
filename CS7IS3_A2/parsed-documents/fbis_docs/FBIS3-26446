The main task of this enlarged plenary session was to deliberate on the work report of the autonomous regional advisory commission. Advisory commissions are transitional organizations which aim to change de facto lifelong tenure of leading cadres to a system of retirement. In accordance with the provisions of the party constitution passed by the 12th CPC National Congress, the Third Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional CPC Congress elected the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional Advisory Commission in February 1984. Since its founding 10 years ago, the autonomous regional advisory commission has continued to actively support and assist the autonomous regional party committee's work in various ways under the guidance of the autonomous regional party committee and in line with the tasks prescribed in the party constitution and with Comrade Wang Enmao's demand that the advisory commission assist and support the autonomous regional party in five areas. The autonomous regional advisory commission has taken the lead in studying and implementing the party's basic line, has maintained high political zeal and remains politically sober-minded at all times. It has vigorously participated in major decision-making discussions; enthusiastically offered ideas to the autonomous regional party committee; conscientiously accomplished the missions entrusted to it by the autonomous regional party committee; supported the audacious work of comrades at the first front; actively taken part in community activities; gone deep into realities to conduct investigations and study; strived to make itself more revolutionary; and set a good example in carrying on the party's fine traditions. The autonomous regional advisory commission has achieved fruitful results in its work over the past 10 years and has made great contributions to the social stability and economic development of the autonomous region. Chen Xifu [7115 6007 1133], vice chairman of the autonomous regional advisory commission, presided over yesterday's plenary session and delivered a work report. At the plenary session yesterday afternoon, Song Hanliang, secretary of the autonomous regional party committee, spoke highly of the autonomous regional advisory commission's great contributions to the social stability and economic development of the autonomous region since its founding 10 years ago. He pointed out: Over the past 10 years, the autonomous regional advisory commission has closely centered itself around the party's basic line; vigorously supported and assisted the autonomous regional party committee; and done a tremendous job in maintaining the party's unity and social and political stability by safeguarding the national unity, upholding the unification of the motherland, and accelerating reform, opening up, and economic development. It has made new historical contributions to the party and people of various nationalities in Xinjiang. The party, the government, and people of all nationalities in Xinjiang will never forget the historical contributions made by veteran comrades. On behalf of the autonomous regional party committee, the autonomous regional people's government, and people of all nationalities in the region, Song Hanliang conveyed their heartfelt thanks and great respect to the veteran comrades. He sincerely hoped veteran comrades would, as always, concern themselves with and support the work of the autonomous regional party committee; apply their wisdom and rich accumulated experience to reform, opening up, and modernization; continue to exert themselves; and make as many new contributions to the party and people as possible. In view of the fact that the autonomous regional advisory commission has accomplished its historical mission, the current plenary session will, in its work report, propose the abolition of the autonomous regional advisory commission and submit the report to the Sixth (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the Fourth Autonomous Regional Party Committee, which will be held on 22 January. Autonomous regional party and government leaders Song Hanliang, Abulaiti Amudurexiti, Zhang Fusen, Jin Yunhui, Wang Lequan, and Keyum Bawudun attended the (enlarged) plenary session of the autonomous region advisory commission yesterday afternoon. They joined the old and new members participating in the meeting in having a group photograph taken to mark the occasion.
