But, because the KPN suffered a defeat in the recent elections and is now perceived as a fringe party, the focus nowadays is on the PSL, a ruling party. This is not a novel assessment of the PSL because that is how it has been perceived, more or less, for the past few years. Paradoxically enough, it has always been one of the most desirable partners for, properly speaking, all of the coalition governments, starting with the Tadeusz Mazowiecki administration and ending with the cabinet of Hanna Suchocka. During that entire period, the post-Solidarity groupings followed the same tactic of badmouthing the SLD [Democratic Left Alliance] and lauding first the ZSL [United Peasant Party] and then the PSL as a party that has won credibility, broken with its past, and is now an equal partner in the new democratic order. It could even be said that the PSL had no enemies. Thus, the PSL owes its current standing to not only the economic situation and the ability of that party to flirt with every political alignment but also to its courting by many Solidarity politicians. They would say, "Without the PSL, Poland cannot be governed and the countryside modernized," and they attributed the defeat of the entire Solidarity movement to, among other factors, its evolution into a large number of parties of the still nonexistent middle class and its failure to create a political grouping attractive to any substantial segment of the rural electorate. A Painless Transformation It is even my impression that for years there existed a strange belief that the PSL could be tamed by being gradually involved in governance and, on the occasion, made docile. Accordingly, the radical and claimant comments of PSL Deputies Jacek Soska and Wlodzimierz Wiertek were viewed as mere curiosities, while substantive negotiations were under way with Aleksander Luczak, who was erroneously believed to be more representative of the dominant thinking within the PSL. In such a situation, the PSL was bound to succeed, and this success has many fathers. To this day, the difference between the SLD and the PZPR [Polish United Workers Party] persists in social awareness, whereas the transformation of the ZSL into the PSL occurred so painlessly as to surely amaze its own members. It is simply that there has always been the PSL, whereas the ZSL became just one of the episodes in the history of the peasant movement. In the course of 100 years of existence of the peasant movement, there were as many as 45 peasant parties; the parties were short-lived, but people remained attached to the populist tradition. After all, some 100 members of the former Mikolajczyk [1945] PSL and entire field branches have been incorporated in the present-day ZSL, and, as even the most deserving ZSL activists say, "This shows clearly where our roots lie." Solidarity activists, who are in the opposition nowadays, judge otherwise; they say that, if there is any political party that remained unscathed by the recent period of tumultuous changes on the political scene and has retained its nomenklatura, it is the PSL, and they point out that, even among the social democrats, the internal changes have been more extensive. The truth about the present-day PSL lies between these two extreme opinions, although it is immeasurably difficult to discover, owing to both the obvious tendency to erase the past and the greatly different ways of thinking about the future. The most that is known about the party concerns its organizational status and structure, even though, for example, its officiating Deputy Chairman Wincenty Stawarz has offered the caveat that the related figures are incomplete and that he will have more information only a few months hence because "organizational status is being determined." According to available data, the PSL has a membership of 250,000, of whom an unknown proportion pay dues of 10,000 zlotys [Z] monthly (for retirees, the dues are Z5,000). Among that quarter-million, only some 10,000 are party activists, meaning members who respond to every call and who are "experienced activists, not rabble-rousers like Lepper." It is not known how many of them used to be ZSL activists. Before 1989, the ZSL had a membership of about half a million, but on paper only, so to speak. After 1991 [its transformation into the PSL], it gained some 50,000 new members; this influx was undoubtedly due to the new proactivism among members of the former Mikolajczyk PSL, who brought in the young on their coattails. At any rate, PSL members are chiefly rural and small-town inhabitants. Farm laborers account for 10,000 and the intelligentsia, chiefly rural and small-town, for 20,000. In Warsaw, there are 3,500 members, and undoubtedly the nation's capital is a white spot on the PSL's map. The PSL's traditional strongpoints are in southern and southeastern Poland. All of these figures appear inconsistent and incompatible. No Debts There are 49 voivodship PSL boards at present, and each maintains its own office. [passage omitted] In the opinion of other political parties, the PSL is a rich party precisely because it survived as a nomenklatura grouping under the new order. However, its headquarters on Grzybowska Street [in Warsaw] has a "homespun" and far from luxurious look, and there are about 20 persons, including clerical employees, on its salaried staff. In the field, most offices are exercised on a volunteer basis, and their directors are on half-pay. The PSL prides itself on having no debts. It owes no money, but neither does it have money for publishing its own press, a dream of most of its members because many activists believe that the problems with achieving rapport with public opinion would be solved once the party publishes its own daily, that once the PSL publishes a newspaper of its own and has a press spokesman of its own, its media image would be improved. The matter is considered so important that one of the major and most heated discussions held within the PSL leadership after the elections specifically concerned appointing a press spokesman. The image of a party greedy for power and offices and lacking a program of its own other than the promotion of [peasant] interests, an image propagated by both politicians and the media, does not for the time being seem to prevent the PSL from winning social support. Without Beating About the Bush The PSL is the sole party to have gained rather than lost since the elections. That is because, to the conservative rural and small-town electorate, it matters greatly that Waldemar Pawlak [PSL] is the prime minister, like [Wincenty] Witos [a popular prewar peasant movement leader], under whose portrait the prime minister liked to be photographed. [That electorate believes that Pawlak] is a good prime minister, but the liberals from the SLD--i.e., from the former PZPR--are obstructing him. Professor Mikolaj Kozakiewicz (PSL) put it as follows, without beating about the bush: "The PSL is suspicious and mistrustful toward all other parties. It cannot stand the Democratic Union and the Liberals, and, at the same time, it finds the SLD unbearable because it feels hostile toward its previous master, and its recent experiences provide proof of dictatorial intentions on the part of the SLD." The PSL is nowadays a party that undoubtedly is aware that most actors on the political scene perceive it as wielding destructive clout, and it believes such perceptions to be unjustified and exaggerated, but, at the same time, it still is unable to bring its potential to bear. Prof. Kozakiewicz said, "That party is strong in having Pawlak as the prime minister and in counting on becoming the sole ruling party and winning the elections to local governments, which should strengthen its standing for a long time." But, what some see as strength others view as weakness. Janusz Piechocinski, who is for ideological reasons most critical of what has been happening within the party in recent times, views the PSL's drive toward political power as a sign of weakness. He said, "Since July 1992, 33 days after Pawlak became prime minister, the entire strategy of the PSL has been focused on returning to the building on Aleje Ujazdowskie. The dominant belief within the PSL is that we shall return there, and this is combined with the belief that, once we are in power, we shall be able to do something for the nation. The drive for political power has become so obsessive as to completely suppress the internal discussion, waged during 1988-91, on what kind of party the PSL should be--a broad kind of peasants' trade union or an increasingly broad-based rather than class-oriented political party." Thus, while, on the one hand, the 33 days of Pawlak's prime-ministership afforded an opportunity for the PSL in that they awakened the hope, verging on certainty, that the PSL would become the helmsman of the ship of state, on the other, they killed the hope that the PSL would become a new kind of party. This problem is perceived most acutely by Mikolaj Kozakiewicz, who believes that, since then, a kind of authoritarianism, of belief that the party's reins must be held in the firm hand of its chairman, that no internal discussions are needed, has taken root within the PSL. The ideal of the party chairman is thus that most faithful of loyalists, Michal Strak, who even waged his electoral campaign under the slogan "I did not let the party chairman down, and I won't let you down, either." Prof. Kozakiewicz pointed out that in no other present-day political party is so much power concentrated in the hands of a single person as within the PSL. Thus, Waldemar Pawlak is at the same time chairman of the PSL, chairman of the PSL's parliamentary caucus, and the prime minister of Poland. The attack against the concentration of powers failed. But this does not mean that Pawlak can say, "The party, c'est moi." Despite the evident unwillingness to engage in intraparty discussions, such discussions are under way, even if, doubtless, to a limited extent because it is clear to some PSL leaders that a road must be chosen, that it is not enough to be a ruling party when experience in governing is limited. Piechocinski pointed out, "In the 1991 elections, our slogan was `The peasants to the parliament,' deliberately, because we knew that we had a chance by appealing to our most faithful followers, the peasants. As a result of these elections, a significant number of parliamentary seats was won by the PSL, largely owing to such frontline peasant fighters as Soska and Wiertek, symbols of struggle for the peasant cause." In 1993, the electoral slogan of the PSL was, "Poland needs a boss," and the votes were garnered by Waldemar Pawlak, a capable man who mastered the political scene following the "portfolio crisis" [shifts in ministerial appointments] and who presented himself as a serious and responsible politician, critical of Solidarity governments but, at the same time, reasonable and calm. Was the change in electoral slogans followed by a change within the party? No. The PSL remains an arena for contests among various program ideas, each supported by a different faction. Jacek Soska and Roman Jagielinski support building a purely class-oriented party focusing chiefly on the defense of farm interests. In other words, they are turning back to the formula of a somewhat broader trade union of peasants. For his part, Kozakiewicz longs for a return to a leftist orientation of the PSL, but in a broadly based rather than a purely peasant edition. In his turn, Janusz Piechocinski supports a centrist, but also broadly based program, while Andrzej Micewski dreams of turning the PSL into a new Christian democratic party. But so far not one of these orientations has become predominant. However, history shows that, within both the ZSL and the PSL, a majority have always been greatly opposed to the concept of a party other than that based on a community of peasant interests, viewed to be sure in static rather than in dynamic terms. The desire to preserve the status quo in the countryside has always predominated over the desire to change that countryside and propose modernization programs for it. A Lack of Ideas Artur Balazs, who failed in his attempts to build a not so much peasant as populist party based on West European parties with populist roots and a broad social program, claimed that the only policy pursued by the PSL nowadays is to alleviate the burden of the reforms on farmers by getting them additional subsidies from the budget. "The PSL has no idea what should be done about the agrarian structure, even though it is known that some 25 percent of the farmers will not survive in the long run. A part of that 25 percent will have to be transferred to the agricultural service sector, and there is no help for it. Yet the PSL has not put forward any related institutional solutions, and it even fails to say that change is inevitable. This is simply immoral." Balazs pointed out that the only institutional solution for the countryside was put into operation during the administration of Tadeusz Mazowiecki--namely, a system of old-age pensions for farmers, which incidentally was established without the participation of the PSL. An opposition politician can always be suspected of subjectivism. But a similar critical tone is being sounded in the thinking and comments of PSL deputies, chiefly those more or less opposed to their party leader and his immediate entourage. In the interview he granted to POLITYKA, Jozef Zych admitted that the PSL's program is a collection of generalities instead of specific economic proposals. Kozakiewicz said plainly that, aside from the agricultural program, whose outline had been developed while the ZSL was still extant, the present-day PSL has no other program planks. "Pawlak as a politician reacts instead of initiating; if the ball flies toward him, he kicks it rather than pursuing innovative approaches," the professor claims. In Kozakiewicz's opinion, an exchange of ideas within the party is moribund. The party became intellectually stagnant once the periodical WIES WSPOLCZESNA, on which the ZSL's intellectual creme de la creme used to labor, ceased publication. Now the situation is further complicated by the fact that former ideologists hold high government offices, and there is no one to replace them within the PSL itself. Piechocinski is of the opinion that, precisely after those first 33 days, Pawlak had a chance to attract the young intellectuals from, say, the Agricultural Academy. At present, the PSL contains some intellectuals, but these are rather of the provincial kind, who need help in rising to higher rungs of the ladder and appealing to opinion-shaping circles, but the PSL has not availed itself of this opportunity because it is "focusing its effort on gaining political power, no matter who its partner might be." When considered altogether, the opinions on various options available to the PSL at present indicate that the party has been placing emphasis on criticizing the policies of all of the governments so far without making any substantial effort to develop constructive "third road" proposals of its own. In ideological terms, we confine ourselves to dusting off agrarian slogans, although it is hard to say to what extent this is being done with the object of developing a new identity for the PSL by harking back to old prewar roots of the peasant movement, and to what extent this mirrors the belief, especially of the older party activists, that precisely a modified agrarianism offers that third road for Poland. Quite a few participants in the related discussions believe that it is the exploration of a new identity for the PSL that is of fundamental importance. If, however, the planks of the PSL's program that are being so strongly exposed both on paper and in practice, if only in parliamentary practice, are to be characterized by a common label, that label would be principally leftist and closest to the program espoused by the Labor Union in the parliament--namely, labor first, capital second; equal opportunity; social justice; and a confusing attitude toward privatization. All of this is laced with "Christian values," treated here quite instrumentally. Besides, the attitude toward these values within the PSL is authentically pluralist and sometimes subordinated to tactics of power plays. Thus, any intent to transform the PSL into a Christian-democratic party does not appear feasible, even though this orientation will certainly be present. In all of my conversations concerning the PSL, with its activists and representatives of other parties, the same basic motif kept surfacing: The PSL nowadays is a ruling party and one still desirous of political power; this is its sole distinct image. There is room for change. There must be a sharper confrontation between the factions in favor of the PSL as a kind of peasant trade union and those in favor of a more broad-based party. Which one will be the winner? Prof. Kozakiewicz believes that, these days, practically no one within the PSL any longer believes that it can become a broad-based rather than a purely peasant party. In an interview granted to POLITYKA, Aleksander Kwasniewski said that he expects the victory of the conservative orientation within the PSL and the survival of that party as a midsized one with an electorate of some 15 percent of the total. Piechocinski is upset because the PSL is forfeiting the opportunity to offer a more broad-based program. Jozef Zych is worried because the PSL's leadership is being depleted by appointments to offices in the government. Kozakiewicz summed up, "So long as farmers believe in Pawlak, nothing will change within the PSL."
