The president addressed the audience and welcomed the representatives of the Hajjah gathering and expressed appreciation for their national sentiments and response to the events taking place in the homeland, and the current crisis. He also expressed appreciation for their concern about the great achievement, unity. He said: Your arrival in Ta'izz today confirms your faithfulness to unity and democracy. This is not strange for the struggler sons of Hajjah, who had the honor to defend the revolution and the republic, and who were among the vanguards who struggled for the sake of unity. Today, they are leading this march to meet with their brothers in the rest of the governorates in order to tell the truth and charge the leadership with the responsibility of safeguarding unity. The brother president added: We bless all that you have reached in terms of resolutions and recommendations. We promise you that we will be as you think well of us. We will not go back on your demands which are in harmony with all the demands of the Republic's governorates; Hadramawt, Ta'izz, Ibb, al-Mahwit, and al-Hudaydah. Such gatherings are also being held in all the Republic's governorates. The brother president said: For the sake of the higher national interests, I call for holding a conference to safeguard unity and democracy, to include the leaderships of all these gatherings in the Republic's governorates, whether those that have already been held or those which will be held. The president highly appreciated the ulema gathering which was concluded at the Mu'adh Bin-Jabal Mosque in the al-Janad area in Ta'izz today. He said: We hoped for our colleagues' response in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], headed by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, to the call made by the ulema in Yemen to meet and to give predominance to Yemen's interests over any other parochial party and personal interests. He said: We are fully aware of the people's suffering. We will not be like the ostrich which buries its head in the sand. We will spare no effort to make all the concessions that are dictated by the homeland's greater interests in order to safeguard unity. I hope that the conference I am calling to be held for the leaderships of the expanded gatherings in the Republic's governorates will mark the beginning of a peaceful national march from Ta'izz to the economic and commercial capital, Aden, and to be called the march of peace, security, stability, and Yemeni unity. Unity is for all the masses of the people. It is for all the honest people of farmers, peasants, intellectuals, politicians, and every citizen. It is not for one person or a group of persons in the Presidential Council. The brother president addressed the conferees, saying: You will find all of us within the political leadership speaking frankly and clearly on all national issues, be they issues that emerged before the inception of unity, during the transitional period, or during the regrettable crisis experienced by the homeland for the past five months--the worst crisis experienced by the homeland since the start of the fragmentation period. For, it never dawned upon us that national unity could experience such a fragmentation, or that such erroneous propaganda campaigns could be directed at the masses. The conferees have issued a statement, affirming that the Yemeni individual is the most precious asset. Hence, the legitimacy of any regime is contingent upon its ability to provide the population with a decent living and with the components of such a living; upon its ability to care for them; upon its ability to provide them with security, justice, and a prosperous life; and also upon its ability to treat them as equals without any discrimination. Within this context, the conferees urge all competent state organs to perform their basic duties, particularly the following: --Hastening the efforts to rid the homeland of the stifling political and economic crisis plaguing it, which has left adverse repercussions affecting citizens' lives. --Hastening the referral of all defendants charged with assassinations, explosions, and all other criminal acts of violence, sabotage, plunder, riots, thefts, and kidnappings, regardless of the motives, to public trials, and exposing culprits, as well as their masterminds. --Achieving the independence of the judiciary, and cleansing judicial authorities and the Public Prosecution of the negative aspects which could undermine their competence, such as bribery, favoritism, negligence, and procrastination. These organs must be reorganized and rehabilitated. --Taking firm measures to remove all objectionable manifestations and corruption at government organs, as well as public and mixed sector organizations. The statement urged the House of Representatives to carry out its monitoring prerogatives on the executive authority, be they the Presidential Council or the Council of Ministers. The conferees commended the role of the Yemeni Armed Forces, and urged them to always remain the homeland's protective shield and a symbol of national unity. It recommended that they be rebuilt and rehabilitated, and that they be redirected so they may occupy their proper positions outside cities and major residential neighborhoods, and so they may play their role in defending the homeland, its independence, and its territorial integrity. The conferees condemned the use of firearms, violence, intimidation, and acts of sabotage to resolve disputes; settle intellectual, political, social, or personal differences; or achieve a unilateral control of authority. The conferees warned all individuals, parties, and factions, regardless of whether or not they are members of the coalition government, against the consequences of any attempt to secure such a unilateral control of authority. The conferees also warned them against any efforts to tamper with the people's gains and resources.
