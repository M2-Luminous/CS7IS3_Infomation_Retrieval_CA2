A mass prayer of 50,000 worshipers was held in a grant mosque today. Restaurants and cafes reopened normally, families began visiting each other and men can return to diwaniyas during daytimes to smoke the hubble-bubble, drink and chat. Kuwait was permeated with an atmosphere of easiness, but not an overmuch happiness. Kuwaitis did not feel easy even when they celebrated the 33rd National Day and the third anniversary of liberation from the Iraqi occupation last month. At home and abroad, over a dozen of problems were still bothering Kuwaitis. They don't know whether they will have a bright tomorrow or a dark one. The top question for Kuwait is that about 600 Kuwaiti POWs and civilians are allegedly detained by Iraq and they are unlikely to return in the near future. So, many families of the missing have to spend the current festival with sadness. New demarcation between Kuwait and Iraq was rejected by the latter, even though it is risking serious international pressure. Iraq has also refused the compensations paid by the Kuwait Government for Iraqis who withdrew into Iraq to follow the new border demarcation rules. Iraq's strong stance has shocked Kuwaitis, and may ruin their confidence in a safe and stable future of the ever-occupied country. Relationships between Kuwait and its "opposition countries" -- some Arab states which once supported or sympathized with Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis -- remain suspended or have limited progress in the direction of reconciliation. But the Gulf anti-Iraq front has begun to break up when Kuwait got angry at Qatar that tried to establish "balanced and clear relations" with Iraq. Also a marine transportation line was reportedly to be established between Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, the trial of attempted assassination of former U.S. president George Bush was adjourned again and again. There are signs that the lawsuit which could have created a more intense tie between Iraq and its opponents may have an advantageous end for Iraq. The international embargo against Iraq could be softened if the alleged Iraq-backed plot was turned down. All these developments are really a bad news for Kuwaitis who are fearful of another invasion and occupation by a strong neighbor. At home, Kuwaitis are also confused by the economic situation which is not quite good. Foreign funds are badly needed by the government for supporting the reconstruction, while domestic funds are flowing abroad because the market is tiny and safety prospect is still uncertain. Suffering from a double financial impact, Kuwait lost hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars last year when crude oil prices slumped, while its overseas investment returns achieved a lower level. Also, the hard debt plan is expected to cost the government about 20 billion dollars. The government is forced to cut public spending by 20 percent to cope with an increasing deficit. Kuwait is likely to carry out a package of privatization steps and impose more charges on various public services. It means that the Kuwaitis will get less money owed to them and lose a lot of benefits from the welfare policies which they lived on for a long time. On the other hand, the legislature and the authorities are likely at a cross road. There are reports that the current cabinet and house will resign in order to form newer and stronger government and parliament after the fast-breaking festival. When asked about the reshuffle of the cabinet earlier, Kuwaiti crown prince and Prime Minister Sa'd al-'Abdullah al-Sabah neither denied nor confirmed. It made Kuwaitis feel that everything is possible. Another reason for Kuwaitis to consider the upcoming days as uncertain is that the country is closer to be an Islamized one. Of the 60 parliamentarians, 39 had signed a bill on amending Article Two of the Constitution to allow the implementation of the Islamic Sharia (law) in the country. If it is passed, Kuwait will be turned into "a complete Islamic state." The local citizens will find a series of limits and obstacles in their social, cultural even family lives. Some entertainment facilities such as satellite dishes will possibly be banned and the life will become dull. Those who oppose Islamization warned that the national economy may collapse in case the Islamic Sharia is established as the main source of legislation in the country. Kuwaitis are waiting for the days following the festival, in which they will experience some changes and reforms at home and abroad.
