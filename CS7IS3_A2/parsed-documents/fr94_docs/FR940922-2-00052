Take notice that on September 8, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern), P.O. Box 2563, Birmingham, Alabama 35202&hyph;2563 filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;764&hyph;000 a request pursuant to ยง157.205 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act for authorization to abandon certain regulating facilities and to change the operation of an existing delivery point, under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;406&hyph;000, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Southern states that it is currently authorized to sell and deliver natural gas to DeKalb-Cherokee Counties Gas District (DeKalb-Cherokee) at a delivery point located near Milepost 1.724 on Southern's 6-inch Hokes Bluff Line in Etowah County, Alabama. Southern indicates that it currently delivers gas to DeKalb-Cherokee at the meter station at a contract delivery pressure of 100 psig. DeKalb-Cherokee has requested, and Southern has agreed to deliver gas at mainline pressure to DaKalb-Cherokee at the meter station. According to Southern, it must abandon two 3-inch regulators and appurtenant facilities at the meter station and make certain piping modifications in order to deliver gas at mainline pressure. Southern states that the abandonment of facilities proposed in this application will not result in any termination of service, and that said changes will not result in a change in the total firm transportation demand delivered to DeKalb-Cherokee. Further, Southern states that (1) the revised delivery pressure will not cause a detriment or disadvantage to its other customers; (2) deliveries at the revised delivery pressure will have no impact on Southern's peak day and annual deliveries; and (3) the abandonment and change are not prohibited by any existing tariff of Southern. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to ยง157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefore, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the date after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act.
