"It's extremely regrettable that North Korea gave notification it will unilaterally begin changing the fuel rods at its 5mw experimental reactor," said ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho in a commentary. The spokesman supported the IAEA's dispatch of an inspection team to North Korea. "The Government of South Korea emphasizes to North Korea the importance of sampling and securing the rods as demanded by the IAEA and reminds it that the nuclear problem should not be taken to a destructive stage by North Korea's unilateral changing of the fuel rods," he said. "The Government of South Korea urges North Korea to soon engage in negotiations with the IAEA on the replacement of the rods at the nuclear reactor and to carry out its full obligations."
