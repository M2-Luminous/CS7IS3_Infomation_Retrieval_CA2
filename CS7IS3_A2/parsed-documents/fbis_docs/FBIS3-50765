Riquelme, chairman of the ANR's [National Republican Association -- Colorado Party] Executive Board took an unexpected turn on 5 January when the latter disclosed lurid details of the executive head of state's candidacy. Riquelme acknowledged that Wasmosy's candidacy had been imposed on the ANR. His verbatim remarks reveal information that could have unsuspected implications in shedding light on Wasmosy's controversial victory, first in the ANR's presidential primaries and then in the general election. Riquelme said: "[Wasmosy's] presidential candidacy was imposed on me. It was imposed on me one evening while he was present there. I cried because it was an imposition, which was not prompted by him but rather by the Colorado Party. It is a long story. He has to give me credit for that event, namely that I was obliged to accept a candidate whose acceptability on the part of my fellow party members, the people, was going to be difficult for me to obtain." He added that Colorado Party members who accepted this situation "did everything possible" so the imposed candidate would stand a chance in the elections. "We worked our fingers to the bone and we won the elections. We won the elections but he never says Riquelme helped me, but rather `he shed tears when my candidacy was imposed on him.' Wasmosy lacks the virtue of standing up for us. If I were to disclose everything that was done to win, but I would not like to discuss that," he stated. The Colorado Party chairman also warned that this "is the most serious crisis of all, and is sure not to be the most serious or the last one because others may occur." The Brother-in-Law's Affair With regard to the dismissal of his brother-in-law, Jose Luis Yanez Zelada, who was an adviser to Antelco [National Telecommunications Administration], Riquelme stated: "That is the excuse those gentlemen have got hold of to justify my annoyance. All the ministers and people close to (Wasmosy) are the ones to blame for this. They have voiced this opinion just to make their boss happy, to give him satisfaction." "This situation (of friction with the head of state) did not happen overnight," he said, adding: "It has been dragging on for a long time -- since the beginning, even since the first appointments (of ministers) that were made within the new administration, and Colorado Party members are well aware of this." Riquelme added: "The replacement of Antelco's administration had already been agreed upon in early December. I spoke to Mr. Wasmosy because I am the chairman of the Colorado Party, which props up his political stability." "I told him that he had to exercise extreme caution concerning Antelco because its managers -- and the financial statements speak for themselves -- have done a great job of administration, a very positive one, which generated a 700-percent surplus," he added. "But after many comings and goings, yesterday (4 January), I asked the president to produce some evidence that would explain why he was concerned about Antelco's management and support his contention that the company's management was an utter failure. I told him the management was not a failure, that to the contrary, it was good. Long after, when he was ready to fire that gentleman, I telephoned him at 1030 (on 4 January) and told him that I wanted to talk to him about loyalty, a loyalty I do not know whether I will continue to have to him. He told me to see him at noon, and I arrived on the dot," he said. "I told him: Mr. President, you did something I had not expected. And he answered me: But Riquelme!, you have been misinformed. It is Kishi [Colonel Eduardo Kishi, the chairman of Antelco's Board of Directors] whom I have given the sack. I have not sacked your brother-in-law," noted the Colorado Party chairman. Riquelme added: "I answered him that my problem had nothing to do with my brother-in-law but rather that it lay in a party issue, a national one, and that Antelco's managers were working in an honorable way and the problem was that Kishi was being laid off on the grounds that he was a bad manager and that was not true." "Furthermore, Wasmosy said he was going to privatize Antelco and the Colorado Party was against it. I do not oppose the privatization of deficit-ridden state enterprises, but I do not understand why we should privatize a company that is doing well, is yielding good returns, and has a good manager, for whom I would go to the stake. I challenge them to prove I am wrong," he said. Riquelme added: "Kishi is a loyal man. When Wasmosy planned to become president, Kishi was one of the people who helped him come to power." Riquelme stated: "This is why I am angry. It is not on account of my brother-in-law's dismissal. That excuse has been concocted by the gentlemen (the ministers) who do not know a thing about politics and who have climbed so high that now they are fighting tooth and nail to remain in their posts. They want to justify what is unjustifiable. They want Riquelme to leave, they want to get rid of him so the Executive Board will be at the beck and call of one person's whims, of one person's bad character (like Wasmosy's). It is precisely against this state of affairs that I am struggling." The Top Leader Says He Will Not Resign Concerning the controversy with President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, Colorado Party Chairman Blas N. Riquelme on 5 January categorically stated that he will not resign from office and asserted that he will keep battling on and "enduring whatever may happen" to defend the ideals of the party he heads. Riquelme said it is most regrettable that the president had crossed Antelco's management out with a stroke of his pen because he suspected they were dishonest. "I will have to put up with whatever happens because we are in a democracy and the president has the right to manage institutions the way he thinks fit," he said. "After all, sooner or later we will have to hold talks again in order to govern the country because I am the chairman of the party that politically buttresses and guides the government," he pointed out. "In short, I will surely continue here at the Executive Board and will continue struggling along because those people, those close to the president, who ill advise him, are seeking to make Riquelme sever his connection with the Colorado Party, but that will not happen." With regard to the latest controversy with Wasmosy, Riquelme said: "The list of things that I have publicized is something I had been putting up with for a long time because I have prostrated myself at his feet to keep him (Wasmosy) company, to plead with him, to go to his home, to greet him and offer him solidarity. And to cap it all, he fires a cannon ball at us. I do not say that he should not do these things, but he ought to tell us, Colorado Party members, so we can come to a decision by consensus." Riquelme told the executive head of state: "You are responsible for the government and, as you say, have your own fountain pen and you are the owner of your fountain pen, but don't you think you can drop your own fountain pen if the party withdraws its support?"
