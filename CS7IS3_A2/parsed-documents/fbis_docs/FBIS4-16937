Meanwhile, Russia has fully repaid these republics for similar services. The reason for one-way traffic in the settlement of accounts is that banks fail to settle the problem of so-called non-trade operations. Roubles freely flow to CIS states toward the payment for communications services, while the national currencies of CIS countries do not cross the Russian border without being exchanged for roubles at the appropriate rate. In December last, communications ministers of CIS countries met in Minsk and issued a joint statement urging heads of CIS countries to influence their central banks to speed up mutual settlement, Bulgak said. Certain progress is in the offing, but the problem has not been solved in a cardinal way and the banking mechanism has not been adjusted. Money from Uzbekistan, Ukraine and other countries, even if they have it, cannot reach Russia. "I talked on the matter with Chairman of the Russian Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko four times. There is voluminous correspondence with the bank on the matter", Bulgak said. "We tried to cope with the situation by mutual settlement, clearing, barter and other settlement, but all this does not amount to a civilised way of dealing with the problem", Bulgak said.
