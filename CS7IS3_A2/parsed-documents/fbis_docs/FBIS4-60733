[passage omitted] Comrade Sulayman Qaddah delivered a speech on the occasion in which he conveyed President Hafiz al-Asad's greetings and appreciation to the Syrian artists. [passage omitted] Comrade Qaddah then spoke about Syria's steadfastness and adherence to pan-Arab rights and firm principles to establish peace. He explained that Syria fought in honor and is negotiating in honor, and seeks the just and comprehensive peace based on the principles of the international legitimacy, the UN resolutions, and the land-for-peace formula. He said: Within this context, Syria believes Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights and return to the pre-5 June 1967 borders is a principal demand and a basic thing that cannot be avoided if peace is to be established and if security and stability are to prevail in the region. He said: Under the historic leadership of its faithful leader Hafiz al-Asad, Syria rose with the glorious Corrective Movement to build itself, resist aggression, and struggle against occupation. It sticks to the pan-Arab facts and the firm principles. It depends in its steadfastness on the wisdom and courage of its leader and on its sons' efforts, unity, and interaction with their country's concerns, as well as their enthusiasm to develop and bolster their country's prosperity and stability so that Syria will always enjoy the steadfast pan-Arab position and the pioneering national role.
