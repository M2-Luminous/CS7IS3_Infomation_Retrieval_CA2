He also denied there is any possibility of former President Daniel Ortega winning the 1996 elections, because, according to Lacayo, Ortega is politically "burned out." Lacayo refrained from expressing an opinion on the support that either of the two candidates for FSLN secretary general could have from groups participating in debates prior to the congress. He said he has tried to maintain respectful relations with the Sandinist leaders, although "most of those relations have been with Daniel Ortega and Sergio Ramirez." "We hope the FSLN will emerge united and convinced that violence belongs to the past," Lacayo said in a three-hour program broadcast by a local radio station during which he explained his views on various topics concerning the country's economic, political, and social life. Gringos Caitudos Commenting on the U.S. Congress' ultimatum to the government to resolve the property problem or face the suspension of U.S. aid, Lacayo poked fun at Somozists who are demanding properties disguised as U.S. citizens, calling them "gringos caitudos [pejorative term for some Nicaraguans who are naturalized U.S. citizens]," who are nothing more than "Nicaraguans whose properties were confiscated in 1979 as Somozists and who now return as U.S. citizens. "There are many gringos caitudos saying `I am American.' They have almost forgotten Spanish," Lacayo said, adding that those people demanding properties "will be treated as Nicaraguans, because according to international law, the nationality that matters is the one the individual had at the time his rights were affected." The Right Has a Visceral Hatred for Him After explaining his expectations for the results of the Sandinist Special Congress, Lacayo expressed his views on the subject of properties and the so-called Helms ultimatum, his optimism about Nicaragua's future, and the political possibilities he foresees for the 1996 electoral campaign. According to the presidency minister, the extreme right attacks him with a visceral hatred because he maintains a central political position and because he has not allowed a return of the Somozist system. "They hate me because they thought Dona Violeta would `not have any authority' and that they would run the government with Vice President Virgilio Godoy as leader," he stressed. "There is hatred because Dona Violeta is running the government and promoting a center project of reconciliation and national unity. They know the right doesn't stand a chance in the 1996 or 2002 elections as long as there is a political faction in the center, which makes them mad," Lacayo said. He compared the hostile treatment he receives from the rightist media to the "loving" way they treat former President Ortega. Liberal-Somozist Plan Based on Lacayo's analysis, the Nicaraguan right is trying to imitate the strategy used by the Salvadoran right in the previous elections. "They are behind a Liberal-Somozist plan hoping that Daniel Ortega will be the leftist candidate like Ruben Zamora in El Salvador and that he will receive 24 percent of the votes while the right will get 50 percent," Lacayo stressed. In his opinion, the rightists know very well that Ortega will not win if he runs for president in the next elections because "he is burned out, he confiscated properties, and he made war." In that sense, Lacayo said the right's biggest problem is "what to do with the center or with Antonio Lacayo, should he decide to be a candidate." "They are obsessed with me, but their plan will fail, because people will never vote for a rightist option as long as there is a center option," Lacayo said. For the first time he openly admitted his presidential aspirations, saying that "I will not shirk the responsibility" if a center coalition chooses him as its candidate for the 1996 elections. In Lacayo's opinion, if a Liberal-Somozist option wins in the 1996 elections, "the Sandinists will not tolerate it." On the other hand, if an option from the "hackneyed left should win, the rightist sectors will try to make things hard for them."
