According to government explanations, our purpose is "to primarily be a contributing partner," particularly as regards the training of peacekeeping troops. Our other spheres of interest are cooperation in rescue missions and conservation of the environment. In international relations a contributor typically also expects to get something in return. It is likely that Finland's aim is to gain more avenues for diplomatic contact. Partnership opens the possibility of many different types of communication and discussion, and these can be used to express one's own opinions as well as to gain useful information. It is through these means that Finns can be expected to become more familiar with the customs and modes of thinking of the Western alliance. Finland is not, on the other hand, seeking new "defense solutions". The partnership treaty does not even make such a thing possible, but the government is still doing the right thing when it emphasises this fact. The original purpose of the partnership was to offer some sort of replacement for East European nations that, after they had separated from the Warsaw Pact, were seeking, specifically, a new defense solution, to wit: NATO membership. The partnership was NATO's novel way to offer them a hand at the same time that the other hand was keeping them at arm's length. Part of the reason that the NATO countries wanted to initiate a partnership with neutral countries such as Finland and Sweden is that then the treaties would not appear to merely be a polite form of evasiveness toward East Europe. Russia was invited to join for the opposite reason: so that the partnership would not be seen as an attempt to isolate Russia and to bind its neighbors into a foreign military alliance. Up until now the effort to strike a balance has been only half successful. Finland and Sweden have agreed to join. Russia, which also agreed to join in time, has begun delaying the procedure. In Moscow irritation with NATO has been strong at times, particularly because of the events in the Balkans. Russia also has its own thoughts on what kind of relationship it wants with NATO. It feels that, in one way or another, any treaty must underscore Russia's status as one of the world's great powers. Originally the NATO offer had the attached condition that the rate and direction of developing collaboration can be determined on a case-by-case basis. In this way NATO keeps its options open while avoiding the peril that it would be required to deal with its partners as a single, united entity. Even so, NATO will have a tough time accepting Moscow's latest opinions. Were Russia to gain a decidedly privileged status, the value of the partnership for East European countries might be eroded. From Finland's standpoint it is preferable that Russia would also enter some form of a partnership treaty. This would facilitate multifaceted communication throughout Europe. Russia's decision is not actually a pivotal issue, however, for significant security decisions are unaffected by the partnership treaties. These will be dealt with in other forums. Part of the intended contents, generally, is of secondary or no interest to Finland. For example, Finland does not have to separately prove to NATO that its Armed Forces are subject to democratically chosen supervision. For Finland, the partnership means one form of multifaceted cooperation. If if is correctly implemented, it promises limited but real benefits.
