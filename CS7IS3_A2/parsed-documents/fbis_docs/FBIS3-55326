"We have not been backtracking or wavering. We have simply taken a short breather to study the results of the 12 December elections and to be sure that we have understood them correctly." Even after his appointment to the number two job at the State Department, Strobe Talbott retains his position as architect of policy on the CIS countries. Critics consider Talbott's erroneous forecast of the Russian Duma election results to have been a blunder. "What happened 12 December was something we had not expected," Talbott admits. "But I do not think many Russians expected it either.... Our policy needed clarification. This has been done." This interview took place on the eve of President Bill Clinton's departure for Europe. Certain critics have rebuked the presidential team for leaving some important tour issues unresolved until the last minute -- from the vague proposals on Bosnia to the question of whether or not representatives of pro-Communist factions in the new Russian parliament should be invited to the reception at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. But Talbott clearly hinted that the United States has already gotten over its analytical pause, has cleared up its conceptual blank spots, and is again relying on a consistent program -- "although nobody is ever 100-percent happy." Using very cautious expressions and invariably accompanying his conclusions with riders to the effect that "it is not for a U.S. official to give Russian citizens and Russian leaders directions about how they should run their economy or their policy," Strobe Talbott gives two main reasons for the pro-government blocs' election failure. "No democracy can fail to be concerned about how humane the government appears to its citizens. All U.S. presidents have to be concerned about this. Leaders may be sincerely convinced that everything they do is exclusively in people's interests. It may even be directly in people's interests. Nonetheless, leaders need public support. If a leader and his policy do not meet with society's support, they will fail. This is not such a big message, but we want to bring it to the Russian side's attention, because it is the truth about how a democracy works." The second reason for the Russian Government's difficulties, Talbott believes, lies in the means used to implement the economic reforms. "I have learned from the Russian press that a considerable number of those who voted for the Liberal Democratic Party were middle-aged people scared of losing their jobs. But this is something with which we are very familiar." Strobe Talbott said that certain observers had attached to his words "less shock, more therapy" a meaning that they did not have. Russian citizens will merely suffer if the reforms are delayed. Another reason why the "Partnership For Peace" program has undergone no changes since the 12 December elections is because the U.S. Administration interpreted Zhirinovskiy's success as a failure by the democratic government to explain its policy and as a reaction to specific mistakes in the implementation of democratic transformations -- but by no means as evidence that three-quarters of Russian citizens like Zhirinovskiy's views. There has been increased criticism of "Partnership" in the United States itself and particularly in East Europe in the wake of 12 December. The fact that the program lays down no specific timetable or conditions for new states to join NATO is seen by critics as playing up to an ever-present Russian chauvinism. Talbott considered it necessary to emphasize that the program "is an excellent prospect for Russia, which gains many advantages." The program does not exclude any European country -- either neutral countries like Austria and Sweden, or former Warsaw Pact members, or those which have emerged from the ruins of the USSR. "I met with President Clinton yesterday and we talked about the Russia trip," Talbott said in conclusion. "One of the points which struck him as very important on this long trip is to sit down in a small group with President Yeltsin and hear his view of the future."
