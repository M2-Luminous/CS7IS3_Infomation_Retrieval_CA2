Wang Qiren, who resigned earlier as deputy director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said he was touched by the massive New Year's greeting cards and letters of congratulations he received from his Hong Kong and Macao friends. He asked the correspondent to express his regards and wish them all a happy new year for him. He said: The important thing in dealing with Hong Kong and Macao compatriots is sincerity and serving them well according to relevant central policies in order to increase their sense of belonging and make them feel that we are all Chinese and Chinese government officials are their friends. He said many Hong Kong and Macao friends he came in contact with were patriotic and loved Hong Kong and Macao, which is the foundation for achieving one country, two systems, and maintaining long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao. Wang Qiren pointed out that 1997 is only three years away and there are many specific tasks to do, such as actively propagating and popularizing the Basic Law to make it known to everybody, working hard to maintain the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong's economy, despite Britain's noncooperation, and various tasks for Hong Kong's transition toward 1997. This will turn the attention of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots to the motherland and make them work in concerted effort for the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland. Only thus can we face the 5,000-year civilized Chinese race, history, and our descendants with a clear conscience. In the two-and-a-half hour interview, the former State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office deputy director said more than once that the Bank of China has a close relationship with Hong Kong and Macao; that he will continue to serve Hong Kong and Macao compatriots in his work and in his participation in the Preliminary Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
