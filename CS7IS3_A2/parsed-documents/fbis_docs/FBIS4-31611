As the UPI news agency reported, he specified that at least five projectiles were fired from multiple rocket launchers Sunday on Brcko, a Serb town in northern Bosnia. This action by Bosnian Croats surprised the U.N., said the UNPROFOR representative. According to the Bosnian Serbs' military sources, five civilians, including a child and a Serb soldier, were wounded when from the territory of neighboring Croatia 8 projectiles were fired from the multiple rocket launchers on civilian targets in Brcko. This was the eighth artillery attack on Brcko over the past month, and the fifth from the territory controlled by the forcibly seceded former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia. The attacks killed a total of seven and wounded 46 people either on the street or at home. The attack on Brcko came in spite a four-week ceasefire, concluded last Wednesday in Geneva, which came into force on Friday at noon between the Moslem-Croatian federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.).
