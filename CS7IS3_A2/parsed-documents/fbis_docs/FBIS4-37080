Our correspondent in Bonn interviewed Iranian Oil Minister Gholam Reza Aqazadeh on the outcome of the current OPEC session and its effect on international oil markets, to which we draw your attention. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, please tell us the outcome of the OPEC conference. [Aqazadeh] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. Of course, we only managed to reach a final decision on one of the issues on the session's agenda, and it was the most important item on the agenda. It was determining the production ceiling for the next six months. The announcement of the decision that OPEC will not raise its current output for the next six months was very important for the market, particularly since OPEC also announced that its next session was cancelled. It is very important for consumers to be sure that OPEC does not intend to raise its output for the rest of the year, considering the fact that it is predicted that there is demand for OPEC's oil stocks of about 26.5 million barrels for the fourth quarter of the current Christian year. Therefore, the decision made yesterday was important and had an immediate effect on the market. [Correspondent] We heard that the price of Brent oil and U.S. oil has gone up. What do you know about that? [Aqazadeh] Yes, that is right. From the start of the session, the positive attitude of the OPEC members strengthened the market. We even heard that U.S. oil had risen to $20. North Sea oil will also show a reaction today; it rose to $17 last night. [end recording]
