Presidential Press Secretary Chu Ton-sik said on Tuesday that instead of allowing a presidential interview on every anniversary of national and local press medias as now, the president will grant an exclusive interview with a media only once in three years. "In the past, President Kim Yong-sam gave all anniversary interviews requested, which means the president had to give about 40 exclusive interviews a year," said Chu, adding that when those given to the Chongwadae press corps are taken into account, the number rises to about 50. The reduced interviews will not affect President Kim's monthly meetings with the Chongwadae press corps, Chu said.
