"We have suffered too much ourselves not to do so," he told the 11th conference of NAM foreign ministers in Cairo. In a speech released in Johannesburg, he pledged to strengthen relations between South Africa and members of the NAM. South Africa's problems were very similar to those faced daily by the international community, he said, and with barriers removed it could now offer something from its experiences. "Although our democracy is still in its infancy, we have already made significant progress in overcoming the effects of ethnic and other differences and in removing totalitarianism," he said. He thanked the NAM for its work to eradicate apartheid. "Your efforts were not in vain, and today we can rejoice together at the successful establishment of a free and democratic SA." Mr Nzo said SA would also like to share its economic, scientific and technical knowledge with other countries in Africa and the rest of the world. "Our goal is to establish sa as a responsible possessor of advanced technologies." It would further like to act in concert with other members of the community of nations as a responsible world citizen, and was committed to supporting global efforts to deal with sustainable development and the environment. South Africa's efforts to relieve poverty, which reflected international efforts to combat the north-south economic divide, would contribute towards stable and good government, he said. There was a basis for close cooperation between South Africa and the NAM. "If we can serve as a bridge to bring the interests of the industrialised world and developing world closer together, we will know that our struggle has been truly worthwhile," Mr Nzo said.
