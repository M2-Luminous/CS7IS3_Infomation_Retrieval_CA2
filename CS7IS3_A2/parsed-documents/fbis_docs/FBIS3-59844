In fact, both democracy and human rights are being violated around the globe. It must be mentioned that violation of human rights is the main problem in this world. We want to portray a true picture of the oppressed nations. But before doing so, we want to say a few words regarding the statement made and the role played by President Bill Clinton of the United States, who is the champion of democracy and human rights. On the occasion of Human Rights Day, which was observed on December 10, President Clinton made a statement and said that every man has some inalienable rights. These include the right to live; the right to personal freedom and security; the right of not being detained without trial; and the right to remain free from oppression. The Declaration of Human Rights also guarantees political, religious, and cultural freedom to every individual. Under no circumstances can these rights be violated. Every individual is entitled to lead a free and respectable life. The West has no idea of how to improve the environment for making a better life for human beings. Along with President Clinton, his assistant secretary of state, John Shattuck, also stated that the United States respects the cultural and historical differences existing between different nations. He reiterated that all the people of this world are entitled to enjoy the same fundamental and basic human rights. No one should be subjected to oppression. He further said that no man was born to be jailed for expressing his views. We agree with the statements made by the president and his assistant secretary of state. Both democracy and human rights are protected in the United States. But what is happening outside the United States? If we look at the recent incidents which occurred in the areas inhabited by the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Somalia, it appears that the statements made by President Clinton and his assistant secretary of state are nothing but a satire of democracy and human rights. Is the brutal killing of several hundred thousand unarmed Muslim men and women in Bosnia by Christian Serbs not a violation of democracy and human rights? It is unfortunate that the developed nations, which advocate the cause of democracy and human rights, have never raised any protest against such incidents. The Middle East problem is the most complex issue in the world at present. But the U.S. Administration has adopted a dual policy regarding this issue. The largest human rights organization of the United States is Human Rights Watch. In its recent report, the group alleged that although President Clinton criticized various activities of Iraq, Iran, and Libya, he is not saying anything against their ally Israel. President Clinton's human rights policy regarding Israel is much weaker than that of former President Bush. The Bush administration was willing to impose economic sanctions against Israel with a view to achieve its objective. But President Clinton has adopted a very liberal policy towards Israel. Recently he gave an assurance to the Israeli prime minister, Mr. Rabin, that an amount of $3,000 million in assistance will be given to Israel every year. The Human Rights Watch report further states that Washington did not criticize Israel for the expulsion of 415 Palestinians to Lebanon. On the other hand, the U.S. secretary of state made efforts to reach a political understanding with Israel in this regard. We feel that this report by Human Rights Watch is sufficient to unmask the administration of President Clinton. Since the birth of Israel, the United States has contributed to its development by extending financial assistance. At present, the main problem in the Middle East is Israel. From the very beginning, this Jewish state has been making attempts to grab the countries of the region. For this purpose the United States has equipped Israel with arms and nuclear weapons. Some people have remarked that Israel is itself an atomic bomb in the Middle East. Realizing this fact, Iran, Iraq, and Libya have taken up an anti-Israeli stand. Their stand led to the recent outbreak of the Gulf War. It must be mentioned that economic sanctions were imposed against Libya centering a trifling issue. Two Libyan citizens were accused for the accident of a PanAm airliner. The United States, Britain, and France have demanded extradition of these two people to face trial. The United Nations imposed sanctions against Libya since it refused to comply with their demand. The Libyan citizens denied that they are involved in the mishap of the PanAm airliner. Hence, Libya has not committed any offense by refusing to hand over its citizens to face trial. For this refusal, several hundred thousand Libyan citizens have become victims of the sanctions imposed by the United Nations. Isn't this a violation of human rights being committed by the United Nations, which is influenced by the United States? Hence, the masks of those who claim that they are champions of the cause of democracy and human rights should be opened. Fresh initiatives should be taken for the establishment of real democracy and human rights in the world. For this purpose, efforts should be made to build a new world order.
