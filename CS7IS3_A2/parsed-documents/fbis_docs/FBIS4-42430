Speaking in Nottingham Mr John Major sought to focus the Tories' election campaign on the Social Chapter which he claimed would destroy jobs and damage the employment opportunities for those out of work. "If it costs more to take on staff" businesses will employ fewer people. It is all very well to think about the rights of people in work. But I care about those without work as well." Decrying plans in the Socialist manifesto for a 35hour-week and a minimum wage, he said: "We won't beat the Far East where factories are humming six days a week -- and frequently seven -- by packing our bags for a three day weekend in Skegness. We don't need to work less, we need to work harder" he said. The people who would pay the price of employment protection policies would be young apprentices looking for their first job and office cleaners who would face the sack if firms had to pay a minimum wage. In raising the spectre of unemployment, Mr Major also claimed that Europe now faced the worst crisis since the 1930s. Over the past 20 years Europe had created only 8 million jobs, while the USA had created 36 million. Mr Major was also unrepentant about his policy shift earlier this week, when he signalled that Britain could opt out of further political and economic integration in the EC. "I do not propose to change my ways," he said. "Because I want Europe to succeed I will be critical where I must, difficult if I have to be. "I would rather speak up and put the case for what I know to be right for Britain, than clink glasses in agreement with something that is wrong," he added. In a phone-in for BBC Radio Nottingham earlier in the day, Mr Major was concerned to explain the benefits of belonging to the European Union. It was vital to jobs to remain part of the trading bloc as 60 per cent of British exports were destined for the Continent, he said. He also claimed that it was vital to peace and stability.
