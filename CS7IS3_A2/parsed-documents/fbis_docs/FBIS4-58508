What did you feel on the stage when 'Arafat pulled his stunt? [Peres] I felt embarrassment and regret, which is only natural. As you know, however, when something like that happens, you do not have time to get wrapped up in how you feel; all that concerns you is how to get out of it. [Zelinger] You also looked angry. [Peres] Justifiably so. Look, after working very hard, our negotiations reached a positive conclusion, we met him halfway, and suddenly the prime minister finds out that he did not sign the maps. That was contrary to everything agreed upon. [Zelinger] Did you, at any stage, feel that his refusal to sign could make everything go up in smoke? [Peres] No, I was certain things would work out, and that is why it angered me even more. I knew that nobody, including 'Arafat, had any alternative. It was -- to use an understatement -- a very unaesthetic act before the entire world. [Zelinger] Did you also consider what effect that act would have on support for the agreement in Israel? [Peres] No, we cannot gauge the mood each and every day. In general, I believe that the Israeli public and others will judge the overall picture. I really thought that what we witnessed on television was the birth process: the labor pangs, the blood, and the baby. [Zelinger] But as Yo'el Marcus asks in today's HA'ARETZ: If that is the birth, what sort of baby will it be? It may have been born with a defect. [Peres] You have to look not only at the parents but also at the baby. The parents cannot be changed. Still, a new baby was born, a new situation was created, and what I think constantly is: Good God, why did we remain there for 27 years? For what? Why did we have to call up all those reservists, some of whom were wounded and some who even paid with their lives. A nation has to ask itself questions. The question is not how 'Arafat looks, but how we look. [Zelinger] But beyond the issue of manners and conduct -- and I assume that all those on the stage and all those who were watching shared your sense of deep embarrassment -- the question is: What other stunts does the man who signed the agreement with us have up his sleeve? Tomorrow he might renege on some other agreement. [Peres] There is also the other side of the picture. I think that what upset 'Arafat was that nobody from the territories came to the ceremony. We must look at the other side of the picture. He made the decision practically on his own, without any support. He is worried about his condition and his status. I believe, however, that the third and most important partner -- reality -- will now enter the negotiations. There are hundreds of thousands of people on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, including young, talented, and ambitious people, who did not participate in the negotiations. In fact, the negotiations were conducted by the Palestinian diaspora and not the Palestinian reality in the field. I have no doubt that they will make a decisive contribution which will completely change the character of the agreement. [Zelinger] Since we are discussing reality, the ink has not yet dried, and the PLO is already asking for a delay in the implementation. Does that not indicate something about the capability of the organization? [Peres] Yes. They are not yet a government; they are a movement in the diaspora. Do not forget that they do not have institutions like we do. On their side, everything is fragile and tenuous. They cannot operate in an organized way like us. It will take them a very long time before they become realistic and adapt themselves to the demands. [Zelinger] That, without doubt, will be the test period for the implementation of the agreement.... [Peres, interrupting] There is no test period. The dice have been tossed and the outcome is known. There is no turning back. We will not return to Gaza; Gaza will not return to us, thank God. In the name of thousands of citizens, who now feel a sense of relief, I say to you: Goodbye to Gaza. Anyway, why would we want to run their lives? Let us assume that their lives are not run as we would prefer. It is their lives and not ours; it is their way of running things, not ours. [Zelinger] Their failure to run their lives will not affect us? [Peres] They will not fail. Why should they? They will run things as they see fit. Do you think I am impressed by the way all the Arab states are run? Is that a reason for us to get involved? Anyway, the entire world is under tremendous pressure exerted by a political instrument we did not have to take into account before: television and radio. Developments occur as a result of the information flow. A communist brought down communism; an apartheid supporter brought down apartheid; a Peronist brought down Peronism. Who pressured South Africa? The media, the pictures, the information. I think this will also have an impact on the reality in the Middle East. The current political scene in the Middle East is a fog which hides the sunlight, and it will be replaced by completely new relations and rules. [Zelinger] What would you consider a failure in the implementation of the agreement? What could happen that would indicate to you the failure of the implementation of the accord? [Peres] I am not built that way. I believe in it, and I believe it will work out. What would pain me most is if there are additional casualties. There is no consolation for us or for them if that occurs. [Zelinger] Are there any circumstances under which Israel would consider intervening if terrorism continues? [Peres] Israel intervenes all the time. It is not that Israel did not try to eradicate terrorism. There is no dispute over that, and it will continue to do so in the future. The question is: Can terrorism be uprooted only through countermeasures -- clubs, orders, deportations -- or by also enlisting the other side to take positive steps that would put an end to people's motivation to commit suicide or attack and murder. [Zelinger] I asked whether circumstances could crop up -- in the Gaza Strip, for example -- under which the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] would have to intervene with massive power. [Peres] I refuse to answer that question, because if I answer it, I cast doubt on the trustworthiness of our measures. [Zelinger] What is the next stage? Should we now deal with the permanent settlement with the Palestinians or negotiations with Syria? [Peres] There are some things we have to do now with the Palestinians. We promised that in the wake of the present agreement, there would be deliberations on what is called early empowerment [last two words in English] for the Palestinian authority in the areas in Judaea and Samaria. We are referring to five fields, such as health, education, commerce, taxes, but that is still not autonomy. We promised to do that immediately, and we will do what we undertook. Of course, I would very much like to start with Syria or Jordan. For the time being, Syria's moves -- if they can be termed moves at all -- are very measured. At the same time, we will continue to examine any crack or opening in order to continue the peace process. I would also very much like to find out what the situation is in Jordan, because there has also been an incomprehensible halt or retreat there. We are not doing anybody any favor and are not serving anybody else. Peace serves us no less than we serve it. [Zelinger] The prime minister said that Syria holds the key to information about the fate of our POW's and MIA's. Will that be an inviolable condition for signing any agreement? [Peres] Prior to an agreement, we exert tremendous pressure. If you recall, a U.S. congressional delegation went to Damascus. I know that Clinton and Christopher also spoke about it with al-Asad. We will not give an inch with regard to the fate of the POW's, which is at the top of our agenda when we negotiate peace. [Zelinger] In the end, there are some Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad detainees among the Palestinian prisoners who were and are being released. Did Israel, therefore, yield on that? [Peres] Two things are at issue: First, we did not release people whose hands are stained with Jewish blood. Second, the others have to pledge to abandon war and terrorism and to commit themselves to supporting the peace process. [Zelinger] There are still some unresolved issues, such as the size of Jericho, the Palestinian policeman on the Allenby bridge, etc. The question is whether will Israel give in later in the negotiations with the Palestinians on the size of Jericho. [Peres] Let us be precise. A map of Jericho was agreed upon. The prime minister added about 6 km, which is about 10 percent of what we agreed to previously. What they asked for is to discuss it further. That is fine, but there is no commitment to give more. That is also the case with the policeman on the bridge. We responded negatively. They asked for permission to hold further talks. We cannot prevent that. [Zelinger] The question is: Will Israel give in on those points? [Peres] It does not have to. [Zelinger] What is your opinion? [Peres] In my opinion, what we signed is it, and we now have to move on to negotiate the early empowerment. [Zelinger] To conclude, can you tell us anything concrete about the issue of the Jericho synagogue, which has become a focus of confrontation between demonstrators and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]? [Peres] Yes, definitely. We said that al-Nabi Musa, a holy site for Muslims, will be under Muslim religious auspices. The synagogue will be under Jewish religious auspices. I think that in the final analysis, both sides will respect sites that are holy to the believers of both religions.
