The move was meant to increase the working capacity of the Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said Qiao. "The preliminary committee has been shouldering more and more tasks with the date for China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong drawing near," Qiao said. The 13 new members were chosen by the NPC Standing Committee on May 12, with eight from Hong Kong, five from the mainland. Qiao expected the new members, together with other members, to work in an active and steadfast way for the establishment of the preparatory committee, under the guidance of the "one country, two systems" policy, and by adhering to the basic law and relevant NPC decisions. He said the work by the preliminary committee will directly involve the smooth transition in Hong Kong in 1997. Qiao urged them to continue to solicit the opinions of Hong Kong people, pay more attention to survey and research, and enable Hong Kong people to care for and participate in preparing for China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. Qiao said that since its establishment in July 1993, the preliminary committee has been well received by the public through its hard and practical work, for which he expressed "heart-felt" thanks to its director Qian Qichen and other staff members. The preliminary committee comprises 70 members, of which 32 are from the mainland and 38 from Hong Kong. The members are mostly leading officials of relevant departments, jurists, economists, and representatives from all walks of life in Hong Kong.
