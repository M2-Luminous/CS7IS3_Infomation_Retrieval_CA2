He told journalists before he leaves Uzbekistan on Monday that if North Korea dares to push for imprudent adventure, then it will lead to nothing but self-destruction of North Korea. Kim said, "We cannot allow even half a nuclear weapon in North Korea. I will deter North Korea without fail from having a nuclear weapon. We are watching the move of North Korea 24 hours a day, and the military power of South Korea, U.S. forces in Korea and United Nations force can repress war on the Korean peninsula." But he added that there are no strange military moves now in North Korea. "I will have the national security conference according to Constitution on Wednesday at Chongwadae. I will also have a dialogue with U.S. President Bill Clinton over the telephone to discuss ways to cope with the North Korean nuclear problem as soon as I return home," he said.
