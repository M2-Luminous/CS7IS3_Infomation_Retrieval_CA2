At a meeting with the press in Kalmar yesterday Carl Bildt called on the supreme commander to find out what decisions the Riksdag has come to in this respect. "Military alliances are not on the agenda. This is a clear message to the supreme commander who should stick to the Riksdag's well founded decisions. The supreme commander is a civil servant in a sensitive field and should be aware of the Riksdag's decisions regarding military nonalignment," Carl Bildt said. Bengt Gustafsson thinks that membership of the EU [European Union] opens up possibilities of military alliances and in the long term even for cooperation between the Nordic defense forces. Gustafsson has also pointed out that the politicians "are not sufficiently mature" to pursue this discussion. According to information received by SVENSKA DAGBLADET, behind Bildt's comments there is a growing irritation in the Prime Minister's Office with Bengt Gustafsson's frankness which has not decreased as he approaches retirement. Gustafsson retires in June and is to be succeeded by General Owe Wiktorin. "The supreme commander should not push his agenda in the field of security policy," said Carl Bildt's press chief, Lars Christiansson, who on two previous occasions has been forced to rebuff the supreme commander's remarks about a Nordic defense league. Bengt Gustafsson's recurrent remarks have given rise to surprise at the Prime Minister's Office and at the Defense Ministry since the content of these initiatives is in conflict with Sweden's official security policy. A Defense Ministry official told SVENSKA DAGBLADET that "the supreme commander can be seen as unpredictable, like an unsafe antitank rifle." "The supreme commander's remarks have also given rise to recurrent questions and comments abroad where people have naturally been wondering what is happening in Sweden. It is regrettable that the supreme commander is continuing in the same vein, despite the fact that the government has corrected his statements in the past," Lars Christiansson pointed out. Gustafsson made his latest thrust last Friday in an interview with the Finnish newspaper, HELSINGIN SANOMAT. In the past the supreme commander has spoken in pretty general terms about the importance of a joint Nordic defense alliance. This time he went one step further: "We could begin, for example, with joint surveillance over the Baltic Sea and link up air surveillance systems. We would then be able to see together what was happening around us." Bengt Gustafsson went on: "Any possible new military threat would not affect only one or two countries in the Nordic area -- it would affect all of them because the Nordic area is a strategic region. We might just as well use taxpayers' money as efficiently as possible and unite our defenses." In the interview Bengt Gustafsson complained about the immaturity of politicians and their lack of interest in Nordic defense cooperation. However, in the past Bengt Gustafsson has received the support of several of the Nordic countries' generals. But Finland's General Gustav Hagglund -- Bengt Gustafsson's counterpart -- pointed out in a speech in Stockholm in December last year that a Nordic defense league would probably bring with it greater risks for Sweden, and better prospects of military assistance for Finland. At the heart of this whole problem is what future path the Nordic area should follow in respect to the defense alliances of NATO and the WEU [Western European Union]. Officially, the EU [European Union] countries will discuss defense and security policy in 1996. Only then will the countries of the Nordic area -- if they are members of the EU by then -- need to make up their minds about the question of military alliances.
