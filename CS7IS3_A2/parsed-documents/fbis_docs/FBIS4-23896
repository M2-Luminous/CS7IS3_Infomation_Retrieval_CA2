FBIS4-23896 "drafr118_a_94017" FBIS-AFR-94-118 Daily Report 18 Jun 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Zaire Comments on Militia `Activism' Comments on Militia `Activism' AB1806191094 Dakar PANA in English 1600 GMT 18 Jun 94 AB1806191094 Dakar PANA English BFN [Text] Kinshasa, 18 June (PANA) -- Rwanda's interim president, Theodore Sindikubwabo, said Friday [17 June] in Kinshasa that the current "activism" of the Rwandan militia is a "resistance movement by the youth and the whole population against foreign aggression". Sindikubwabo, who was the guest of the Press Club of the Zairian section of the International Union of French-Speaking Journalists (UIJPLF), however, acknowledged "the possibility of extortion and murders" by the youth, adding that his government has taken all precautions to "control the resistance and avoid aggression". Explaining the reason that led "the Rwandan youth to defend themselves", the Rwandan president alluded to a secret document by rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) calling for "the demolition of broad-based institutions to install the RPF, and the elimination of all republicans". For the Rwandan president, back from the 30th OAU summit in Tunis, the government he leads came in to fill the vacuum left by the death of President Habyarimana. The government, he added, is working for an end to the war. He said this would allow for a dialogue on the basis of the Arusha political compromise, humanitarian assistance and the setting up of institutions. Speaking about the situation on the ground, he expressed reservations about reports that the RPF had taken the town of Gitarama. Intense fighting is taking place in the area but there is no proof that the town has fallen to the rebels. He blamed the multiple violations of Rwanda's cease-fire on RPF elements whom, he said, are "massively supported by Uganda. The truth cannot be otherwise," he said, "given that the Tutsi are a minority and can only fight on foreign support". To questions on his relations with President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, he replied that he "just shook hands with the Ugandan head of state in Tunis". "The only time we spoke was when I asked the Ugandan president for his guarantees to the effectiveness of the cease-fire at the meeting of the committee of the 11 states of the sub-region. He replied that the cease-fire should not be subject to conditions" On a new foreign intervention to try and end the crisis in Rwanda, the president [words indistinct] "give priority to dialogue", and called for "moral and diplomatic aid". "Any intervention is welcome if it allows a cease-fire and does not punish some (Hutu) and save the Tutsi (minority)," he added.
