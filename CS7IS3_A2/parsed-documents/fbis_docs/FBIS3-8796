The participants' main attention focused, however, on the development of the domestic political situation in Slovakia. The Executive Committee approved the course of action by the SDL Presidium and the SDL Club of Deputies in the search for a way out of the political crisis. It continues to regard an agreement on calling early elections as the priority of the SDL's tactics so that the new cabinet's period of activity can be strictly defined. The Executive Committee authorized the SDL Presidium to conduct talks on the formation of a preelection coalition with the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS], the Farmers Movement of the Slovak Republic, the Association of Workers of Slovakia, the Green Party in Slovakia, and other political entities, as well as on the formation of a provisional government. The SDL is interested in the new government having the greatest possible degree of continuity with the previous one. At a meeting with reporters, SDL Chairman Peter Weiss said that he was opposed to the assumption of power by the new coalition being accompanied by politically expedient purges at various levels. As for posts in the Supreme Inspection Office [NKU] of the Slovak Republic, SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik said that the NKU was the fourth institution of constitutional power. Changes in its leadership are essential, he said, precisely because the NKU chairman (from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) and the deputy chairmen (both from the Slovak National Party) did not act independently in their posts. Responding to behind-the-scenes rumors about a lack of unity among SDL deputies to the National Council of the Slovak Republic, Peter Weiss said that their activity was determined by the president's [9 March] address to parliament and by the failure to enlist a sufficient number of deputies' votes to decide on a date for early elections before the dismissal of Prime Minister Meciar. Hence, the problem was not just to express no confidence in the prime minister, but to agree on a sequence of steps. However, the SDL Club of Deputies' decision of Friday [11 March] afternoon [to support the no-confidence vote in Meciar] was unanimous. Peter Weiss did not rule out the possibility that, apart from a broad coalition government, there could also be a cabinet formed by the SDL and the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, naturally without Vladimir Meciar. As regards representatives of the Hungarian political parties, the SDL does not count on their direct participation in the formation of a provisional government.
