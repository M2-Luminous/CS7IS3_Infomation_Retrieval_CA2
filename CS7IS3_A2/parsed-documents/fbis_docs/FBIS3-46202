The one-month-long exhibition, named "The Exhibition of Bretagne- Finisterre", introduces with pictures, models and material objects the history, culture, education, economy and folk customs of Finisterre, the westernmost department of France. It was learned that the exhibition, covering 500 sq m in the China Art Gallery, is in exchange for a Chinese exhibition, "China Yesterday and Today", which was held last December in France. Among those present at today's opening ceremony were Lu Zhixian, vice-president of the Chinese Association for Cultural Exchanges With Foreign Countries, Jean-Yves Cozan, delegate of the French National Assembly and first vice-president of the General Council of Finisterre Department, and Thierry Audric [spelling of names as received], counsellor for Cultural and Scientific Co-operation at the French Embassy in Beijing. They also cut the ribbon to open the exhibition. "China always attaches great importance to and cherishes its cultural exchanges with France," Lu told those attending the ceremony. "Now, when Sino-French ties have turned a new page, it is our common desire and responsibility to maintain and develop our good relations in terms of cultural exchanges." Cozan said that strengthening bilateral cultural exchanges can help to expand the co-operation in other fields. He said that people in his department have deepened their understanding of China through its cultural coordination with China, which started three years ago. Many people from Finisterre have come to invest and do business in China, he added. In an interview with XINHUA, Audric said that it was of great significance that the exhibition opened on the 30th anniversary of the establishment of French-Chinese ties. He said that the introduction of culture and folk customs can help the two nations understand each other more deeply and promote the development of bilateral ties. The French side hopes that a new French-Chinese cultural agreement will be reached, and a French cultural center established in Beijing, Audric said, adding that two large-scale exhibitions on French culture would be held here within the year.
