FR940114-2-00079 FR940114-2-00048 National Toxicology Program; Availability of Technical Report on Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Acetaminophen The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of acetaminophen, which is a widely consumed analgesic found in several nonprescription pharmaceuticals. Two-year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering to both sexes of rats and mice doses of 0, 600, 3,000, or 6,000 ppm acetaminophen in feed for 104 weeks. Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activityÂ§ 1 of acetaminophen in male F344/N rats that received 600, 3,000, or 6,000 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of acetaminophen in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of acetaminophen in male and female B6C3F1 mice that received 600, 3,000, or 6,000 ppm. 1 The NTP uses five categories of evidence of carcinogenic activity observed in each animal study: two categories for positive results (``clear evidence'' and ``some evidence''), one category for uncertain findings (``equivocal evidence''), one category for no observable effect (``no evidence''), and one category for studies that cannot be evaluated because of major flaws (``inadequate study''). Nonneoplastic lesions associated with exposure to acetaminophen included increased severity of nephropathy and increased incidences of renal tubule hyperplasia and parathyroid hyperplasia in male rats, increased severity of nephropathy in female rats, and increased incidences of thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia in male and female mice.
