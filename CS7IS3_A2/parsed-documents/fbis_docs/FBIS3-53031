This is in line with international norms, which stipulate informing the concerned countries first of the ambassadors appointed to them. All ministers refused to release any information on diplomatic appointments. They agreed that the Council of Ministers decided in its session yesterday to issue a decree that its decisions should be considered as secret. They clarified that the Council decided to add a paragraph to the fourth item of Decree Number 2552 issued on 1 August 1992 to make the text read: While considering the clauses of Article 17 of the decree, the Council of Ministers' agenda will be considered a secret document. And the discussions and deliberations of the Council of Ministers will also be considered secret. They cannot be published or publicized. The media referred to a turbulent start to the Council session. Minister Fattush said he believed that the request to make the discussions secret kills political life. When President al-Hirawi put the issue of adopting secrecy to a vote, the Council of Ministers approved it with a majority of 26. Three ministers objected: Sulayman Franjiyah, Nicholas Fattush, and Hasan 'Izz-al- Din.
