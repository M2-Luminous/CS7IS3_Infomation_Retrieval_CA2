This was Alarcon's first event on the official visit he began here yesterday at the invitation of the British group in the Parliamentary Union. Sources close to the visiting mission have reported that Sir Tom Arnold, a conservative deputy and treasurer of the British-Cuban group in the House of Commons, one of two houses in the British Parliament, hosted the leader of the Cuban legislative branch. The Cuban delegation received a detailed explanation of the procedures in the House of Commons and then attended a lunch hosted by legislator William Rogers, a foreign policy spokesman for the Labor Party. The Cuban delegation also visited the famous Tate Gallery, where visitors were able to see valuable paintings by British artists. Alarcon also spoke with Sir Michael Marshall, president of the British Interparliamentary Council, and later he and the rest of his delegation went to a dinner hosted by John Ward, president of the British group at the Parliamentary Union. According to sources of the Cuban Embassy in London, this first day of activities by the Cuban delegation was a clear indication of the hosts' satisfaction with the visit, especially their interest in knowing about the organization and procedures of the Cuban Parliament. Alarcon arrived in London on Sunday in the company of Dr. Osvaldo Martinez, president of the Economic Commission of the Cuban National Assembly, and Dr. Lidia Tablada, director of the National Agricultural and Livestock Health Center. The delegation also includes Dr. Ramon Crespo, secretary general of the Cuban Health Union, and Juan Alberto Gonzalez, Alarcon's assistant. This visit will strengthen relations of friendship and exchange between the two parliaments and help develop the already prosperous relations between Havana and London, Cuban sources said.
