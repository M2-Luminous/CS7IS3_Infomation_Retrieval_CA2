Speaking at a joint news conference, the Russian president said, "this serious problem impedes progress in major projects undertaken by the two states." He cited as an example the construction of a gas pipeline from the Siberian republic of Yakutiya to South Korea. Other major projects include the development of the far eastern port of Nakhodka and the construction of a trade center in Moscow. "It is important for us that the president of South Korea treats with understanding the issue of postponing debt payments," Yeltsin said, and added, "Russia has sufficient grounds for an optimistic assessment of the prospects for bilateral relations with South Korea." The Russian leader stressed, "we have on many occasions stated that we are interested in full-blooded economic relations and would like to see a growth in South Korean investment in our economy, especially in the Far East." He also expressed the belief that South Korean companies could help convert Russian defense enterprises to civilian production and noted that "considerable understanding" had been reached on issues concerning cooperation during the current Russo-South Korean summit meeting. At the news conference, Yeltsin made it clear that Moscow would not pay compensation to relatives of the victims of the KAL-007 boeing downed by the Soviet Air Force in the Far East in 1983, as the crew of the South Korean airliner was to blame for its intrusion into Soviet airspace. He stressed that the tragedy occurred during "Cold War" times and was triggered by "a combination of a number of circumstances."
