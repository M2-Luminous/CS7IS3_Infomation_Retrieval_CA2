The best-known are the elevation of Nikolay Travkin and the removal of Sergey Shakhray from a ministerial position. There have also been other, less-noticed events which are nonetheless very symptomatic. The edict on Travkin's appointment as minister without portfolio was drawn up by the Presidential Staff. But analysts agree that the Democratic Party leader's promotion to the corridors of executive power did not happen without Chernomyrdin's knowledge. It is entirely possible that the initiative even came from the premier. At any rate, observers consider it beyond dispute that Viktor Stepanovich's position is now so strong that the president can no longer afford to make any changes to the government without the consent of its leader. Why is Travkin needed? World experience shows that it is usually representatives of major political structures that are appointed minister without portfolio. And, in terms of their influence, such ministers are often equivalent to deputy premiers. But it does not seem as though Travkin was in a position to claim such a role. The faction he heads in parliament is one of the smallest -- with just 15 people. The party he created is virtually collapsing. Apropos of which, analysts believe that the Democratic Party of Russia [DPR] has no future. Its regional structures are coming apart at the seams. Thus, in early 1994 the DPR's entire Volgograd cell -- the largest political structure in the region, with no less than 2,000 members -- left to join "Russia's Choice." Judging by everything, Chernomyrdin by no means needs Travkin because he is a DPR member. The newspapers have been speculating about his possible appointment as the government's plenipotentiary representative in the Duma. Official sources are not confirming this report, but it is entirely possible that Nikolay Ilich was asked to join the government precisely to strengthen contacts with deputies. Ultimately, he may not be called an official representative, but to all intents and purposes that is what he will be. Analysts are assuming that Travkin could quite easily take on this role. First, he has a great deal of experience of political work. Second, he has the image of a sound, down-to-earth regular guy. So it may well be assumed that Travkin could be used in the Duma as Chernomyrdin's envoy above all with a view to conducting behind-the-scenes talks with representatives of factions for whom Nikolay Ilich's figurative and accessible way of setting out an argument is far more convincing than academic speeches by professors and other such know-it-alls who are "former laboratory chiefs." However, Viktor Stepanovich might also have some problems with Nikolay Ilich: Travkin is not somebody else's team player. He is a leader and highly ambitious. Although.... Chernomyrdin is said to be very good at cutting people down to size. He is not a man to be trifled with.... As for Shakhray's removal from the position of minister for nationalities affairs, this initiative most probably came direct from the president and his entourage. It is thought that the main cause of their differences was their different approach to the settlement of relations with Chechnya. This question might seem to be a separate issue, but it touches on some serious problems. Resolving it today will mean laying the last brick in the foundations of the Russian state and ending the period of its initial construction. The relieving of Shakhray of his duties should hardly be seen as weakening the premier's position. First, interethnic problems have traditionally been the prerogative of the Presidential Staff, and the premier kept away from them. Second, observers consider Shakhray's achievements in this post not to have been significant enough to result in a behind-the-scenes struggle over him between the president and the premier. But let us leave the vice premiers to one side. Over the past few weeks there have been some interesting events at deputy minister level. The chronology is as follows. Decisions were drawn up by the government apparatus for a closed session of the Cabinet of Ministers Presidium on the dismissal of Yakov Urinson, first deputy minister of economics, and Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko. But, on Premier Chernomyrdin's initiative, the question of their dismissal was not examined at the presidium session -- both received a reprimand. And the other day, by a Chernomyrdin directive, Deputy Minister Yakov Urinson was accorded status equivalent to a minister. I would note for reference purposes that Sergey Aleksashenko is a young financier. He is known as a top-ranking specialist who has liberal economic views. He is known for his independent behavior and judgments. Yakov Urinson is a career state planner. In liberal democratic circles he is known as one of the first and few apparatchiks of the old school who actively supported the idea of market reform. He is said to be particularly favored and respected by Chernomyrdin. It seems as though there have been some major clashes over these two people (above all, Urinson) between apparatus leader Vladimir Kvasov and the premier himself. The premier's desire of late to support the liberal-market wing of the government is due to a desire to preserve some balance of power within the Cabinet of Ministers. After the too-independent Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov were "forced out" of the Cabinet of Ministers, Chernomyrdin was left one-on-one with emboldened sector lobbyists whose appetite and the pressure they exert are constantly increasing and already pose a serious threat of catastrophic inflation. The drama of the situation is also increased by the fact that the leader of this camp -- Oleg Soskovets -- is number two in the government. Chernomyrdin has been forced to leave operational work to him increasingly frequently of late, because the premier himself is becoming an increasingly political figure -- he has to control relations with parliament and the presidential structure. But Soskovets, left to his own devices with the economy, seems to have been making a lot of mistakes. For instance, at the recent congress of the Association of Russian Banks he suggested that the bankers use one-third of all their banking funds to invest in production, and half of their currency-dealing profits to support the agro-industrial complex. It is hardly surprising if, after such statements, money which had hitherto remained here starts flowing out of the country. Thus, the balance in the government is being seriously upset. Analysts believe that there is a very great likelihood that Soskovets, Zaveryukha, and Co. will prove the stronger. In this situation the premier has been forced to support the camp of the liberal free-marketeers in the government in order to save the economy and his own political future. This camp, which has now been considerably weakened, is represented primarily by Aleksandr Shokhin and Sergey Dubinin. But the role of Yakov Urinson has considerably increased of late. And this is why. Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin, as insurance against the anger of dissatisfied lobbyists, is not refusing any money to anyone, but is proposing that the money be found from investment funds. And Urinson is in charge of investment. So it is not the acting finance minister but Urinson who has to tell those desperate for money that the cash is not there. It is curious that the anti-Urinson campaign in the government (along with the anti-Aleksashenko campaign) is being headed by Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the apparatus, who has clearly been staking a claim recently to the status of independent politician. It is obvious that the civil servants' leader cannot be said to wield the same clout as the premier. Observers believe that Kvasov would be out of the picture in a trice if he started really annoying Chernomyrdin. In short, Viktor Stepanovich is not currently to be envied. What he needs in the government now is another Fedorov -- only one who talked a bit less and was able to look like a subordinate when required.
