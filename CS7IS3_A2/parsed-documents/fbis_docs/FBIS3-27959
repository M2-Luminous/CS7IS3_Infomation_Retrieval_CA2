The two-day conference was held at the United Nations University in Tokyo. "Population growth is a major obstacle to the alleviation of poverty, sustained socioeconomic development, and the improvement of the status of women," said the draft text of the Tokyo declaration of the meeting of eminent persons on population and development. The meeting, also sponsored by the Foreign Ministry, was held in preparation for the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) slated for September in Cairo. "We...call upon all governments and intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations to do their utmost to make the (Cairo) conference a milestone in the global effort to eradicate poverty and socioeconomic inequality, to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development, to improve the status and role of women and to reduce population growth," it said. The United Nations has predicted the world population, now at 5.6 billion, will increase to 10 billion by 2050. The declaration urged developing countries to integrate population issues into national development planning, and developed nations to change their patterns of consumption and to curb overproduction in order to reduce the impact on the environment and on the use of resources. It also urged "the world community...to increase their financial commitment to population and related activities in developing countries in order to reach the estimated amount of approximately 13 billion dollars...by the year 2000 and approximately 17 billion dollars by the year 2015 annually." At a news conference held immediately after the meeting ended, International Planned Parenthood Federation President Fred Sai, vice chairman of the Tokyo meeting, said, "one thing which has come out here...is that...we have to start addressing population issues much more seriously." He said the other point stressed through the discussion was the importance of "partnership between the developed and developing countries." The news conference was also attended by Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N. Population Fund, U.N. University Rector Heitor Gurgulino de Souza, Egypt's National Population Council Secretary General Maher Mahran [name as received] and former Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, chairman of the gathering. The 14-member panel of the meeting debated sustainable development, family planning and the status of women in relation to population. The panel also included former World Bank President Robert McNamara, former Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado and former Kiribati President Jeremia T. Tabai.
