FR941017-0-00008 FR941017-0-00003 APHIS will take no action based on this comment because the entire country of Chile is free from FMD and, therefore, we see no reason to establish regionalization within Chile. Before recognizing Chile's FMD-free status, we observed Chile's internal monitoring system as well as border controls, and found them to be effective in preventing the introduction of FMD from neighboring countries. Many commenters criticized the APHIS-funded research project which was conducted in Argentina and which was cited in the proposal to this rule as being part of the basis for the proposed rule change. Some commenters believe that the results of the FMD study conducted in Argentina are not convincing because reliable tests for detecting FMD in llamas are lacking. We disagree with this comment. The serological tests used in the study were the virus infection associated antigen (VIAA) test and the virus neutralization (VN) test. These tests, which are internationally recognized, are the best tests available for detection of FMD antibodies in any susceptible animal species. In all cases where experimental infection of llamas or alpacas with the FMD virus has been achieved, we have been able to detect the antibody using these tests. One commenter was concerned that the Argentine study did not deal with the issue of silent carriers. An FMD carrier animal is an apparently healthy animal that has recovered from FMD infection but that continues to carry the FMD virus in its oesophageal-pharyngeal (OP) region for periods longer than 28 days, making it possible for the animal to potentially spread the disease to other animals. We stated in the proposal that a primary reason for retaining the HSTAIC quarantine requirement for llamas and alpacas from Chile and other countries listed in ยง94.1(d)(1) had been our concern about the possible existence of a carrier state in llamas and alpacas. Therefore, one of the purposes of the study in Argentina was to determine the ability of llamas and alpacas, whether infected by or exposed to livestock actively shedding FMD virus, to become FMD carriers. From the results of this study, it was concluded that llamas have a high degree of resistance to infection with the FMD virus, that FMD infected llamas will be detected using the VIAA and VN tests, and that, unlike cattle and some other livestock, infected llamas only carry the FMD virus for a short time. One commenter stated that too few llamas were infected in the Argentine study to properly evaluate their ability to be FMD carriers. In the clinical trial portion of the study, the FMD virus was isolated from only 2 of the 60 exposed llamas. The clinical trial was designed to evaluate what would occur in field conditions. Under natural conditions, an animal must become infected by way of exposure to FMD before it can be a carrier. To artificially generate a larger number of carriers (by way of injection) would not have demonstrated what can be expected to occur under natural conditions. Another commenter noted that, while all llamas examined in the field survey portion of the Argentine study tested seronegative to FMD, so did all sheep tested in the field survey. Since sheep are susceptible to FMD, the commenter felt that this result suggests the llamas on the farms selected for the study may not have been exposed to the disease. Further, the commenter states that all OP samples taken from llamas and from a few selected cattle and sheep during the field survey were negative to FMD virus, again suggesting that the llamas may not have been exposed to FMD virus. The commenter's observations are valid. However, the field survey was conducted on nine farms. Only five of these farms reported having had an outbreak of FMD in the previous 12&hyph;24 months, and only one farm reported having had a recent outbreak of FMD. The sheep that were tested were from the three remaining farms, which had no reported occurrence of FMD. Farms with documented outbreaks of FMD either did not have sheep or, if they did, the sheep from these farms were not sampled. Further, although the OP samples taken from a few selected cattle were negative to FMD, the FMD antibody was detected in the cattle using the VIAA and the VN tests. A few commenters cited the fact that the FMD virus is species adaptable and claim that this fact is not accounted for in the Argentine study. One commenter stated that, if the study had used a virus that was specifically adapted to llamas, more llamas would have become infected in the study and more llamas would have become carriers. We acknowledge that FMD viruses do tend to adapt to species. However, this tendency has not manifested itself with llamas and alpacas_there is no evidence that a llama/alpaca-adapted FMD virus exists. The use of an artificially created llama/alpaca-adapted FMD virus would not reflect actual conditions to which llamas and alpacas are exposed in the field. Some commenters referred to a study done on Plum Island concerning FMD in llamas, claiming that the study had results which conflict with those of the Argentine study. The study referred to by commenters was published in 1990 by Lubroth, et al. , and was conducted in 1987 at the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL) on Plum Island. None of the results of the FADDL study conflict with the Argentine study. In particular, the FADDL study concluded that llamas have a high degree of resistance to FMD virus. Further, researchers in the FADDL study were unable to isolate the FMD virus in infected llamas beyond either the first week after inoculation or the first week after exposure to an inoculated animal. These results are consistent with the findings from the Argentine study. One commenter also referred to an unpublished study on FMD in llamas which the commenter claims came to different conclusions than the Argentine study. The study to which this commenter refers was conducted by the Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, simultaneously with the FADDL study, also on Plum Island. The results of this study were never published because they were very similar to those of the FADDL study and because the FADDL study was more comprehensive. This study also had no results which conflict with the Argentine study. Another commenter stated that the Argentine study should not serve as the basis for our rulemaking because it was not peer reviewed and was conducted in Argentina with minimal USDA&hyph;APHIS involvement. The study in Argentina was, in fact, planned and conducted as a cooperative effort between APHIS and the National Institute of Agricultural Technology in Argentina. Although the study has not been peer reviewed, the results of the study were presented at the 1993 annual conference of the United States Animal Health Association (USAHA), and a report of the study appears in the 1993 USAHA Proceedings. Some commenters stated that APHIS should not permit increased numbers of llamas or alpacas to be imported from Chile because llama owners visiting Chile have reported a high incidence of genetic defects and a very limited supply of quality llamas available in Chile. However, the regulations in 9 CFR parts 92 and 94 are established pursuant to animal quarantine and related laws that generally provide authority to take action to prevent the introduction or dissemination of certain diseases. These laws do not provide authority to establish regulations based merely on factors related to genetics. One commenter stated that a limited supply of quality llamas in Chile would mean that most llamas imported from Chile would probably be llamas that had previously been smuggled from Bolivia into Chile. New Zealand's experience importing Chilean llamas and alpacas contradicts this conclusion. New Zealand has imported more than 2,000 llamas and alpacas from Chile since 1988. There is no evidence that the movement of llamas and alpacas to New Zealand has encouraged the smuggling of llamas and alpacas from neighboring countries into Chile for exportation to New Zealand, and New Zealand has reported no problems with the quality of Chilean llamas or alpacas. This experience, combined with our determination that Chile's border control and surveillance has been adequate to prevent smuggling from neighboring countries, leads us to conclude that the commenter's concerns are unfounded. Some commenters said that this rule should be considered a ``major rule'' (having an impact of more than $100 million annually), and stated that an initial regulatory flexibility analysis should be prepared because they believe the rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Several commenters offered scenarios resulting from this rule which would cause significant economic impact on llama breeders, most of which are small entities. For example, one commenter offered that, if there are 75,000 llamas currently in the United States, the rule crosses the impact threshold if the value of each llama is diminished on average by only $1,333. According to the commenter, adoption of this rule, with its prospect of unlimited importations of llamas and alpacas, could easily cause a drop in llama prices equivalent to an average of $1,333 per head.
