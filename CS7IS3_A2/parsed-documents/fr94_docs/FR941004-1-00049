FR941004-1-00049 FR941004-1-00015 Urbanization has destroyed one population of Allium tuolumnense. The type locality of A. tuolumnense once covered several hundred acres but has now been reduced to a total of 14 hectares (35 acres) as a result of land clearing for housing construction (CNDDB 1993). Urbanization continues to threaten this population; the 17 hectare (40 acre) Heavenly Hills subdivision is proposed for this site (CNDDB 1993). The 220 hectare (540 acre) Gardella subdivision southwest of Jamestown has been recently proposed, and would adversely affect an additional population of A. tuolumnense (Robin Wood, Tuolumne County Planning Department, in litt., 1993, Skenfield 1992; Steve Stocking, San Joaquin Delta College, in. litt., 1993). A 760 hectare (1,890 acre) proposed subdivision called Shotgun Creek Estates would adversely affect another population northwest of Jamestown (CNDDB 1993). The above three proposed subdivisions could directly affect A. tuolumnense through destruction of plants and habitat, or could indirectly affect the populations by altering the site hydrology through increased urban run-off of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers, or by lowering the water table. As mentioned above, Fresno County is predicted to grow 53 percent by the year 2005 (California Department of Finance 1991, 1992). The development and construction of proposed subdivisions in Fresno County foothills will adversely affect the two populations of Carpenteria californica that occur on private land. These populations are already under threat from development projects (CNDDB 1993). The expansion of a portion of State Highway 168 from a two- lane to four-lane freeway partially destroyed and fragmented the largest population of C. californica (Joanna Clines, Sierra National Forest, pers. comm., 1993). The proposed realignment and expansion to four lanes of an additional section of the same highway potentially threatens portions of two populations of this plant (CNDDB 1993). The University of California proposes to establish a new campus at one of three sites in the San Joaquin Valley (University of California 1993), including a site in Fresno County at the base of the foothills where Carpenteria californica occurs. The proposed new campus at the Fresno location and the attendant growth-inducing effects of 40,000 to 50,000 people are a potential threat to C. californica (Howard Latimer, California State University, Fresno, pers. comm., 1993). The type locality of Clarkia springvillensis was destroyed by mobile home development in 1983 (CNPS 1988). Historically, road widening and cattle grazing have seriously reduced populations of C. springvillensis at six sites (CNPS 1988). Ongoing residential development, road maintenance activities, and timbering operations threaten three populations of C. springvillensis on private lands (CNDDB 1993). Prior to acquisition by CDFG, a preserve containing the largest population of C. springvillensis had an access road cut into the area, a well drilled, and a knoll levelled as a pad for home construction. These activities reduced and fragmented the population of C. springvillensis at that site. No restoration has occurred. One population of Navarretia setiloba occurs in a mobile home park (CNDDB 1993). Urbanization threatens two populations of N. setiloba near Lake Isabella and one population on Grapevine Peak in Kern County (Diane Mitchell, botanist, pers. comm., 1992). The Andrews Creek population of Verbena californica, containing 25 percent of all the plants, is threatened with a proposed subdivision (CNDDB 1993, CDFG 1993; Robin Wood, in. litt., 1993). The Big Creek population of this plant, containing 40 percent of the population, is potentially threatened by residential development (Pat Stone, CNPS, pers comm., 1992). Road maintenance activities adversely affect populations of several of the 10 plants included in this rule. Firebreak construction and road maintenance have destroyed part of one population of Allium tuolumnense (CNDDB 1993). The grading of access roads along hydroelectrical powerlines and the clearing of vegetation from powerlines and towers as part of hydroelectric operations of an electrical municipality potentially threaten one population of Carpenteria californica (CNDDB 1993). Historically, road widening and cattle grazing have seriously reduced populations of C. springvillensis at six sites (CNPS 1988). Two populations of C. springvillensis are currently threatened by road and fire break maintenance activities such as mowing and spraying (CNDDB 1993). Three of the four populations of C. springvillensis in the Sequoia National Forest occur along a road right-of-way for an electric municipality and are fenced and signed for protection but emergency maintenance activities, including vegetation removal, of the power towers and powerlines remains a threat (CNDDB 1993). A firebreak bisects one population of Fritillaria striata in Kern County and a powerline access road near Kern River State Park continues to adversely affect another population (CNDDB 1993). Vehicles driven along these access roads destroy the plants that grow in the roadway. Two populations of F. striata along Rancheria Road in Kern County face threats from a proposed road widening project (Stebbins 1989). Because of this species' affinity for clay soils that are unstable during wet months, emergency slope stabilization activities, such as road widening, could negatively affect two populations of F. striata along Rancheria Road in Kern County (Stebbins 1989).
