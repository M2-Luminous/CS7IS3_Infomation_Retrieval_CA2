Natale criticized Cheek's position of "putting forth pressure, with all the means at his disposal, to effect changes in the patents law which would make it conform with the aspirations of U.S. pharmaceutical laboratories." In a press communique, the legislator says: "The ambassador is confusing an expression of his compatriots' hopes of trade interests with the implementation of pressure through blunt threats, over the possibility that Congress will not fulfill their aspirations." The PDP congressmen bloc leader noted: "An old Louisiana state law from the last century established that pressures are being exercised every time efforts are made to achieve results on a government decision by using any means other than resorting to reason." In this regard, Natale said: "This is exactly what Cheek is doing and what, within diplomatic circles, is described as the right of the recipient country [pais recipiendario] to declare the official doing this as persona non grata." Concerning the patents law, Natale indicated that we Argentines "have been governed by Law No. 111 since 1864, a law that we will change when the appropriate constitutional agencies decide to do so, and not when it coincides with the interests of foreign laboratories."
