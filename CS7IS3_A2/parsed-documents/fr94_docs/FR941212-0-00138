FR941212-0-00138 FR941212-0-00019 (d) Government contractors. Some contracts have ``cost-plus'' or reimbursement provisions which require the government to reimburse the contractor for many types of expenses. If it appears that the contract would require the government to reimburse a contractor for money recovered on an otherwise meritorious affirmative claim, the RJA will investigate the claim and forward a recommendation to USARCS, referencing the specific contract clauses involved. The RJA will assert other claims against government contractors after verifying that the contract does not contain a reimbursement provision. (e) NG organizations and members. The RJA will investigate claims arising from the tortious conduct of NG members. The RJA will assert claims against NG members and their insurers in accordance with §536.218 (b) and (c). If the NG members were acting within the scope of employment as State employees and an assertion against the NG organization's insurer appears appropriate, the RJA will forward a recommendation to USARCS. Property Claims §536.219 General. (a) Other regulations establish systems of property accountability and responsibility; and provide for the administrative collection of charges from military and civilian personnel of the United States, and other individuals and legal entities from whom collection may be made without litigation. However, when the investigation results in a preliminary indication of pecuniary liability and no other method of collection is provided, the matter will be referred for action under this subpart. Assertions may be made under this section for the loss, damage, or destruction of_ (1) Property under DA control (AR 735&hyph;5). (2) Property of the Defense Supply Agency in DA custody. (3) Property of nonappropriated fund activities of the Army (except AAFES property unless a special agreement exists). (See AR 215&hyph;1 and AR 215&hyph;2.) (4) Federal property made available to the ARNG (AR 735&hyph;5). (b) This section does not apply to_ (1) Claims for damage to property funded by civil functions appropriations. (2) Reimbursements from agencies and instrumentalities of the United States for damage to property. (3) Collection for damage to property by offset against the pay of employees of the United States, or against amounts owed by the United States to common carriers, contractors, and states. (4) Claims by the United States against carriers, warehousemen, insurers, and other third parties for amounts paid in settlement of claims by members and employees of the Army or DOD for loss, damage, or destruction of personal property while in transit or storage at Government expense (subpart K). §536.220 Repayment in kind. The RJA may accept the repair or replacement of the property in lieu of payment of the claim. The staff officer responsible for the property must certify accomplishment of the repair or replacement (such as is described for motor vehicles in AR 735&hyph;5) before a release may be executed. The authority conferred by this paragraph is not limited to incidents involving motor vehicles. §536.221 Property damage predemand procedures. (1) Identification of potential claims. The RJA will ensure that installation motor pools, housing and engineering staff sections, unit property custodians, and similar persons apprise the claims office of damage to DA property. In addition, claims personnel will review MP blotters and reports, civilian news sources, reports of survey, magistrate court proceedings, line of duty and AR 15&hyph;6 investigations, and similar reports to identify additional property damage cases. A claims office designated as the NG point of contact for a state will coordinate with NG officials to ensure that NG units appoint unit claims officers and report potential claims. (b) Transfer of responsibility. If another claims office is better situated to investigate and assert a property damage claim, the claims office will coordinate with that office. The Chief, Affirmative Claims Branch, USARCS, will resolve any disagreements. In addition, the office designated as the NG point of contact for a state will forward potential claims arising in another office's area of responsibility to that office. (c) Investigation. Claims personnel will investigate potential incidents, question witnesses to determine the facts and circumstances, and identify all available insurance coverage. Claims personnel may directly request assistance from other DOD claims offices. Claims personnel may also request an investigation of an incident by a unit claims officer for the unit or organization responsible for the damaged or destroyed property, or, when the investigation may be more practically conducted by the claims officer of some other unit or organization, by another unit claims officer. If no other report has been prepared, the unit claims officer will prepare DA Form 1208. Claims personnel will obtain a breakdown of costs from the custodian of the property. (d) Closing potential claims without assertion. If the RJA determines that there is no tort liability or that the potential recovery is too small to be worth pursuing, he or she will dispose of the notification without asserting a claim. If a potential claim file was opened, claims personnel will annotate the basis for closing the potential claim on the chronology sheet referencing the Federal Claims Collection Standards. (e) Asserting demands. If there is a legal and factual basis for the Government to recover, claims personnel should notify both the tortfeasor and the tortfeasor's insurer. The assertion letter should outline the facts and cite the Federal Claims Collection Act as the basis for recovery. The claims office may also cite local law. The claims office should assert the claim for the full costs to the Government, if known, or state that the costs are still being ascertained. Where appropriate, the assertion letter should also provide the option to repair the damaged property or to replace it in kind. Medical Care Claims §536.222 General. (a) Army claims offices assert claims against tortfeasors and insurers for medical and dental care which is furnished to a soldier, family member or retiree at Army expense to treat an injury or disease resulting from tortious conduct. In states that have modified traditional tort liability, Army claims offices also assert claims against insurers other than health benefits insurers, such as no-fault and medical payments automobile insurers, and workers' compensation funds. In doing so, claims offices coordinate their efforts with the injured party's efforts to recover other damages from tortfeasors and insurers. (b) Claims offices will forward potential claims for medical care furnished to service members, family members or retirees of Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps or Coast Guard to the nearest installation or office of that service. As an exception to this rule, however, claims offices may assert and collect claims for medical care provided to retirees of another service and their dependents if: (1) medical care was furnished at the local Army MTF; and (2) the incident giving rise to the claim occurred near the Army installation; or (3) the retiree resided near the Army installation. In these exceptional situations, the claims office must ensure that the retiree is not receiving care at another service's MTF. The claims office must also notify USARCS as well as the nearest installation or office of the retiree's service that it is handling the claim. (c) In some instances, the Army and the VA will both pay for care provided to a soldier or retiree. The VA, however, is precluded from asserting claims for ``service-connected'' injuries. Accordingly: (1) If a soldier is injured and is discharged from the service, the claims office will assert claims for the reasonable value of medical care furnished at Army expense (including care furnished in a VA facility) prior to a soldier's discharge. Claims offices will not assert for the value of medical care furnished at VA expense, but the RJA will consider future care provided by VA in determining whether to approve a waiver or compromise. (2) If a retiree is injured and receives some care paid for by the Army and other care in a VA facility, the claims office will coordinate with the nearest VA office and assert a claim for the full value of the care provided. The office will remit the amount recovered for care provided at VA expense to the VA. §536.223 Recovery Rights under the FMCRA. Pursuant to the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act the Government may pursue recovery of medical costs under any of the following tactics: (a) Subrogation. The United States is subrogated to any rights or claims held by a person to whom the Government has provided medical care against the tortfeasor who caused him or her to be injured. As subrogee, the United States can recover from the wrongdoer the reasonable value of the medical care it has furnished or will furnish the injured party. (b) Intervention. The United States can intervene in an injured party's suit against a tortfeasor or bring suit as the assignee of an injured party's right of action. (c) Independent Action. The United States can assert administratively and litigate a medical care claim in its own name.
