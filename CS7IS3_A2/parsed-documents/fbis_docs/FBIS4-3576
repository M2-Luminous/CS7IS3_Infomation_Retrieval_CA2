Divorce rates hit an estimated 19 percent last year. And one in five husbands beat up their wives, according to the Beijing Society of Research on Marriage and Family. However, home is where the heart is and more than 90 percent of married couples said they were basically happy with each other. The city-wide survey of more than 2,100 families also revealed that by and large Chinese husbands take the lead when it comes to sex and leave the household chores to their wives. Divorce rates in Beijing have climbed from 15.2 percent in 1990. They went up to 16.5 percent in 1991, 17.7 percent in 1992 and about 19 percent in 1993, according to the society. Violence in the home wasn't just limited to the male of the species. Over 15 percent of wives beat up their husbands, according to the survey, which was led by Li Yinhe of the Sociology Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. But women's leader, Shang Languo, said that male victims of domestic violence could not be compared with battered wives. "For the women it may be self defence. The wife has to fight back when being attacked by her husband," said Shang, deputy director of the Women's Rights Protection Department. "And then there's the question of physical differences, women are usually smaller than men, battered husbands will probably suffer less than abused wives," said domestic violence expert Shang, who works under the auspices of Beijing's Women's Federation. The survey revealed that 1 percent of husbands beat their wives very often. Most of the violence was reported in the homes of ill-educated, working class, young couples, according to Li Yinhe. Beijingers generally regard men and women as equals in the home, the survey said. More than 80 percent of spouses believe they enjoy equal relations with their mates. And when it comes to sex inequality, it is women who rule the roost, with almost 10 percent of husbands reporting domineering wives. The husbands still take the lead in bed, only 3.2 percent of wives initiate sex, the survey found. And actions speak louder than words, perhaps, for 88 percent of respondents said it was acceptable for female mates to ask for sex. Wives who take charge or have a say in sex are generally from the younger generation born after 1950. But, despite all the marital problems revealed by the survey, Li said that most modern marriages in the city are good. Spouses from 92 percent of homes are thoughtful and understanding towards each other, said Li, a permanent director at the family research society.
