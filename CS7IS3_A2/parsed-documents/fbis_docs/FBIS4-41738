In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Filatov said that "Nikolay Medvedev is strong in many fields, he is a serious analyst. However the preparation of a draft law on local self-government had practically failed in the last few months although the regional leaders were assured that the document would be submitted to the State Duma shortly. But real work on it is only beginning." Filatov stressed that Medvedev had failed to establish close cooperation with the presidential representatives in Russian provinces. Additionally, the removal of Bryansk Region administration head Yuriy Lodkin had developed into a conflict which could have been avoided in order not to "discredit authorities in the eyes of the population," Filatov said. He added that Medvedev's successor Aleksey Kazakov "knows the regions well owing to his work in the state property management committee."
