The program of the summit is not fully prepared yet but the Lithuanian President's Office said the meeting will start with lunch at 1 p.m. Justas Paleckis, the Lithuanian president's foreign policy adviser, told the state-run ELTA news agency that the three presidents intend to discuss priorities in the foreign policy of the Baltic states. In Paleckis' words, cooperation between the three Baltic nations, integration with Western Europe and relations with neighboring countries will be the central issues during the meeting. The presidential adviser said the Baltic states are now able to coordinate their positions much easier than a year ago. Paleckis said the only slight disagreements concern free trade agreements with the European Union [EU]. Lithuania and Latvia intend to sign the so-called asymmetrical agreements which restrict the import of some goods, while Estonia wants to completely liberalize trade with the EU.
