Votintsev: "The Unknown Troops of the Disappearing Superpower".] [Text] Missile Attack Warning System The launch of the first Soviet ballistic missile on 18 October 1947 turned out to be a complete surprise for the U.S. military-political leadership. Two years later, when the first nuclear device was created and successfully tested in the USSR, we crossed out the Americans' monopoly on these weapons. The United States set about creating nuclear missile attack warning systems at an accelerated pace. In the 1960's, it began to deploy them on and outside its own territory. The first echelon was IMEWS satellites, designed to detect missile launches and locate nuclear explosions. The experimental launch of the IMEWS-1 satellite took place in 1968, and by 1970 a space-based system of six IMEWS-2 satellites in orbits 35-40,000 km high, two each over the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans, was already deployed. This system today monitors the entire surface of our planet, ensures detection of any missile launch, determines launch time, coordinates, and flight direction, and passes the information to command posts in no more than 3-5 minutes. The second echelon--based on the BMEWS over-the-horizon radar--was created between 1960 and 1963 to cover the main directions of a likely missile attack--northeastern, northern, and northwestern (from the territory of the Soviet Union). This system includes three sites, modernized in recent years, deployed at Foilingdales-Mure (Great Britain), Thule (Greenland), and Clear (Alaska). This system uses a multifunctional PAR radar from the Safeguard ABM system. The increase in the number of our nuclear-powered submarines equipped with ballistic missiles forces the United States to create and deploy in the 1980's new powerful over-the-horizon Pave Paws radars on the east and west coasts and also on its southern borders. Operational command and control of the nuclear missile attack warning system is exercised by the NORAD command post located in Cheyenne Mountain at Colorado Springs, Colorado. Higher national command and control facilities of the United States and its armed forces are notified from this same command post. In our country, development and creation of over-the-horizon radars for missile attack warning and monitoring outer space were done at the Scientific Research Radiotechnical Institute of the USSR under the direction of Academician A.L. Minets (chief designer Yu.V. Polyak[.sup][/]). The first "Dniester" radars were deployed in Kazakhstan and Siberia. Together they formed a solid radar barrier 5,000 km long that ensured accurate detection and tracking of space objects. Simultaneously, in 1961 this same institute began developing the modernized "Dniester-M" over-the-horizon search radar and a missile attack warning system lead complex on the main northern avenue of likely missile attack (from U.S. territory) with location of these radars in the Arctic and Latvia, and a command post in the vicinity of Moscow. Work on these centers and command posts began in 1963-1964. The Chief of the directorate, Lieutenant-General M.M. Kolomiyets, directly subordinate to the Chief of the Fourth Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, Colonel-General of Aviation G.F. Baydukov, was charged with organizing military units for them. It is noteworthy that in the summer of 1967, General of the Army S.L. Sokolov[.sup]2[/], recently appointed Deputy Minister of Defense, deemed it necessary, together with G.F. Baydukov and me, to visit the centers in Latvia and the Arctic that were in the stage of installation and adjustment of the production equipment. Paying no attention to the fact that they did not "polish up" things at the centers prior to his arrival, he thoroughly, calmly, and with splendid competence looked into the state of affairs, learned what was needed, and promised to help. And he carried out the promise. In late 1968, a commission chaired by the First Deputy Chief of the Main Staff of Air Defense, Colonel-General V.V. Druzhinin, conducted state testing of the "Dniester-M" radar at the center in the Arctic. In the Far North, the radars operated in an extremely complex interference environment, caused by the constant chaotic disturbance of the ionosphere, resulting in brief blips coinciding in nature to trajectory segments of ballistic missiles. This did not preclude the generation and issuance of false warning information. In 1970, A.L. Mints said concerning my fears: "Yuriy Vsevolodovich, your concern is not without foundation. But remember: the leading designers of our institute and I will always be with the troops. We will do all that is necessary to guarantee that false warning information about a missile attack will not be issued." Indeed, the combat programs were constantly worked on as statistics were collected. Chief designers Yu.V. Polyak and V.M. Ivantsov[.sup]3[/] systematically worked at the centers, and other specialist were always there. There were not cases of false warning information being issued in the northern and northwestern avenues of likely missile attack. Already in 1976, I had occasion to test the lead complex at full strength: The radar centers in the Arctic and Latvia, and the command post near Moscow, which became the command post for the missile attack warning system. Later it was possible to technically connect the A-35 early-warning ABM system (subsequently removed from service and dismantled), Dunay-3, and Dunay-3U to the missile attack warning system command post and to finish combat programs, ensuring a mutual exchange of information about ballistic missiles and space objects. However, this was not easy. Over-the-horizon warning systems (A.L. Mints) and early-warning equipment of the ABM system (G.V. Kisunko) were created independently of one another. This resulted in the equipment operating in a different system of coordinates determining the parameters of a ballistic missile's trajectory. Various computers were also used. Mints used the 5E-73 computer of chief designer M.A. Kartsev[.sup]4[/], and Kisunko used the computer of chief designer V.S. Burtsev. The automated data transmission systems were also different. Such a lack of coordination required a significant working up of combat algorithms and computer programs at the ABM and missile attack warning system command posts, which took up about 30 percent of their memory and speed. Later on, it was precisely these circumstances that made it necessary to increase the number of computers and replace them with new-generation computers. The result was considerable additional expenditures. The various forms of self-spontaneity by the Ministry of the Radio Industry and the lack of requirements for standardization of arms have been unjustifiably costly for both the troops and taxpayers and have impeded the commissioning of new installations. This disconnection was overcome to a considerable extent in the early 1970's. V.G. Repin[.sup]5[/] was appointed Chief Designer of the Missile Attack Warning System. A draft project of an integrated missile attack warning system was developed and approved in 1972 under Repin's direction. It coordinated and distributed the requirements for characteristics of above-the-horizon, over-the-horizon, and space-based warning equipment and defined the principles of combining and mutual monitoring of their data and rules for generating and presenting output data. Later, all the work for creating the system was done in accordance with this project. Clarifications were made in the process of developing new proposals for detection assets. The first stage was the above-mentioned interfacing of radar warning center and the A-35 ABM system at a single command post, accomplished in 1973. The second stage was the creation of an updated command post and the first section of the warning system in 1976. The principles developed in the integrated system project were confirmed during the course of this work, and experience acquired in creating and commissioning super-complex information systems. The collective of chief designer V.G. Repin, his deputies, and closest assistants, doctors of technical sciences A.V. Menshikov, B.A. Golovkin, and V.P. Traubenberg, were the first, and long before the Americans, to solve the most complex tasks of complete automation of obtaining, processing, and consolidating data from various means of ballistic missile detection, generating and presenting warning information. At the same time, it was also possible to manage the problem of high-speed and high-reliability transmission of data about ballistic missiles and space objects with the aid of systems created under the direction of chief designers F.M. Lipsman, V.I. Shvartsman, and I.M. Mizin. B.A. Poluektov, a senior headquarters officer, participated directly in this work. It must be noted that despite certain complexities in relations with the chief designers of individual warning equipment, A.I. Savin[.sup]6[/], F.A. Kuzminskiy[.sup]7[/], Yu.V. Polyak, and V.M. Ivantsov, the chief designer of the system, V.G. Repin, was able to define fairly clearly the requirements for the equipment and to achieve, basically, their fulfillment. In those instances when the basic parameters of the new equipment did not correspond to the desired parameters, they managed to bring the system characteristics to the required level through skillful use of reserves and a systematic approach. Special note should be made of the role of officers of the combat algorithms and programs departments and battle task allotment officials, many of whose proposals were adopted by the chief designers of the system and equipment and helped to improve their quality. Between 1968 and 1972, a project of a solid continuous above-the-horizon detection field on the western, southwestern, and southern avenues of likely missile attack was being developed. New centers were created in the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Siberia based on the Dnieper radar. At that time A.L. Mints and V.M. Ivantsov were working on a fundamentally new "Daryal" above-the-horizon phased-array radar. An reduced model of the receiver portion of this radar was successfully tested at the center in the Arctic. In 1984-1985, centers with the "Daryal" radar began to be put on alert duty in the North and in Azerbaijan, 5-6 years later than the originally established timeframe. This occurred due to the costs of construction organizations, interruptions in deliveries of equipment by plants, and primarily due to the lack of readiness of algorithm software. Despite the repeated demands of the commander in chief of the National Air Defense Forces, the Main Contracting Directorate, and me, a computer base was not created in the design bureaus and Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of the Radio Industry. This resulted in the fact that algorithm software with the use of authorized computers had to be delayed 3-4 years. I would go against the truth if I did not tell about how the above-the-horizon radar center was created on the northeastern avenue of likely missile attack. It was supposed to ring the outer border of the USSR with a continuous radar field. According to our prognosis, it was near the U.S. west coast that American nuclear-powered submarines with Trident and then Trident-2 missiles, capable of reaching the entire territory of the Soviet Union, were to be based precisely on this axis, which was also later confirmed. According to studies and modeling of the Scientific Research Department of the Institute of the National Air Defense Troops, under the direction of Major-General of Aviation Ye.S. Sirotinin, doctor of technical sciences and professor, such a center could be placed in the vicinity of Norilsk or Yakutsk. Due to a shortage of electrical power, Yakutsk was no longer a choice. The management of the Norilsk Ore-Dressing Plant guaranteed assistance in creating the center. However, expenses increased since delivery of construction materials and equipment was by sea. The question of the location of the center was discussed several times with Chief of the General Staff N.V. Ogarkov. I knew Nikolay Vasilyevich [Ogarkov] well as a man of high culture, reasonable, and able to delve deeply into the essence of a problem and make the correct decision. Therefore, I was astonished when, supported by Deputy Minister of Defense for Construction Colonel-General of Engineers N.F. Shestopalov, he did not agree with the Norilsk variant, but demanded that the new center be created only in the vicinity of Yeniseysk. This point was mentioned in the project of the Ministry of the Radio Industry, but was immediately rejected by us due to the fact that it was a flagrant violation of provisions the 1972 ABM Treaty with the United States on limiting ABM systems, according to which over-the-horizon missile attack warning system equipment could be deployed in the immediate proximity of the state border with the antenna turned outward. Yeniseysk was located deep within the country approximately 3,000 km from our maritime border. Unfortunately, associates of the General Staff prevailed, arguing that this installation could be considered not to be a warning center but a means of satellite detection. Despite all our objections, at the next large meeting, D.F. Ustinov stated for all to hear that if someone in air defense still dared to object to Yeniseysk, he would be relieved of duty. The Americans focused their space reconnaissance assets on the progress of work on the center on a literally daily basis. When its basic structures became visible, they lodged a protest, which our government ultimately accepted. The lesson taught us by the American side proved to be quite costly, and not only in the material respect. It is natural that is also affected the country's defensive capability. Today, some of the structures already erected are being dismantled and being made into a furniture factory. We will be satisfied if only it begins to produce a product. But there was not and is not any above-the-horizon detection assets on the northeastern axis. On the other avenues of likely missile attack, Dnieper radars have been operating continuously for more than 20 years now; they are obsolete. In the mid-1980's, construction of new Daryal-U and Volga radars began at the same sites at centers in Latvia, Belorussia, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Siberia. By 1992, more than 50 percent of the allotted appropriations were acquired. Now, financing of the installations located in the `near abroad' was stopped, and work was suspended. In these republics, particularly in Ukraine, steps are being taken to privatize missile attack warning installations. The obsolete Dnieper radars will be able to operate for another 2-3 years, 5 years at most, and then the entire Commonwealth will be left without some of the most accurate means for detecting attacking missiles on their flight trajectories with identification of the launch area and the place and time until the missiles fall. In 1972, when the Missile Attack Warning System project proposed by V.G. Repin was being implemented, it became obvious that its high reliability could be achieved only by employing a complex of equipment using different physical principles. They include over-the-horizon radar and spacecraft capable of detecting missile launches and issuing information 2-3 minutes after their launch. In 1970, favorable results were obtained from an experimental model of the Duga-2 over-the-horizon radar in the Ukraine when detecting launches of domestic missiles from areas of the Far East and the water areas of the Pacific Ocean over the test range on Novaya Zemlya. This circumstance enabled the Ministry of the Radio Industry to submit the project to the Scientific Research Institute for Long-Range Communications (NIIDAR) for creating two centers in the Ukraine and the Far East (chief designer F.A. Kuzminskiy). The project asserted that these centers were able to detect the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles from bases on U.S. territory. The decision was made and the centers created, but a miscalculation was made, leading further work to an impasse. As chairman of the commission examining the project and supporting the creation of the centers, it is my fault that the effectiveness of the over-the-horizon was assessed based on results obtained from an experimental model of the radar detecting missiles in conditions of a middle-latitude path and relatively calm ionosphere. In conditions of northern-latitude paths, in the presence of the polar cap and the constant chaotic ionospheric disturbance, the probability of detecting the launch of single and small groups of missiles at these centers turned out to be quite low. And a massive missile launch from U.S. territory is reliably detected only in favorable ionospheric conditions. An important condition of an objective assessment of the effectiveness of these centers was the use of a mathematical model developed at the SNII [Special Scientific Research Institute] under the direction of Major-General of Aviation A.S. Sharakshane[.sup]8[/], doctor of technical sciences. This very complex model contained ionospheric parameters in which comprehensively took into account the 11-year cycle of solar activity during various times of the year and day. Despite the long and expensive process of tests and modifications, the centers were not accepted into service. The facility in the Ukraine essentially was returned to industry, and the Polar Program of modifying equipment and programs designed to improve substantially the detection characteristics was carried out there. Due to a plot at the Ministry of the Radio Industry, F.A. Kuzminskiy was removed at the most critical moment. The program was carried out under the direction of the new chief designer, F.F. Yevstratov[.sup]9[/]. During the course of carrying out this program and introducing a number of modifications, the NIIDAR collective under the direction of F.F. Yevstratov and G.A. Lidleyn achieved stable detection by the center in the Ukraine of launches of the U.S. Shuttle at a distance of 9,000 km. The Shuttle catastrophe on 28 January 1986 was observed in real time as a bright flash on the display screens and a stoppage of tracking the trajectory at the moment of the explosion and when the rocket engines stopped operating. I immediately reported the results of the work to Commander-in-Chief of the National Air Defense Troops A.I. Koldunov and USSR Minister of Defense D.F. Ustinov, which confirmed the report from the United States. The thrust of the Shuttle's engines considerably exceeds that of the engines of Minuteman ballistic missiles, which leads to an increase in the size of the ionized trail and, consequently, the size of the radar cross-section of the missile being launched. After examining these results, the commission agreed with the calculations on the mathematical models of the over-the-horizon radar centers for detecting group and massive launches of ballistic missiles from U.S. territory. Work on the center continued right up until the catastrophe at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The center ended up in the sequestered area and was mothballed. Somewhat earlier, in 1978, the CINC of the Air Defense Troops P.F. Batitskiy made the start of joint testing of the center in the Far East conditional on the requirement of real and reliable detection of Minuteman ballistic missile launches from the U.S. Western Range at Vandenberg to the range on Kwajalein Island in the Pacific Ocean. After repeated postponement of the launch of a Minuteman missile for technical reasons, automatic detection took place on 24 February 1980, and the commission under my direction, making a detailed inspection of the results obtained, began its work. However, further tests showed that the center was able to reliably detect ballistic missile launches from U.S. territory only under favorable geophysical conditions. After considerable modifications, the center in the Far East was placed on alert duty on 30 June 1982. It was periodically used to detect missile launches from the U.S. Western Range at Vandenberg. Now this center has also been taken off alert duty. At that time, many believed that the path I covered together with the designers of over-the-horizon radars was both unexplored and fallacious with respect to northern-latitude paths. This should be recognized. However, one must not ignore the fact that when the centers were in operation, all nine missile bases located on U.S. territory constantly felt their effect. In other words, they were under the "cap" of our electromagnetic radiation. Unfortunately, the dream of F.A. Kuzminskiy, who said "We will handcuff American imperialism," did not fully come true. Further work showed that the over-the-horizon radar in conditions of middle-latitude paths and calmer ionosphere is undoubtedly an effective means of long-range detection of missile launches, aircraft, and surface ships at distances of approximately 3,000 km. Development of a space-based system was more successful, although not without difficulties, the general designer of which was A.I. Savin. Violation of the established time periods was determined primarily by working out algorithm software and the low reliability of the first spacecraft (chief designer V.M. Kovtunenko)[.sup]10[/]. The system was placed on alert duty at reduced strength in 1978 and at full strength in 1982; however, its combat capabilities left much to be desired both in performance and operating characteristics. For example, based on information received from aboard the spacecraft, the command post of this system made a false conclusion about a massive missile launch from U.S. territory. It is not hard to imagine what kind of decision the leadership of the country and the armed forces could have faced. The cause was an unfinished combat program for conditions of heightened solar activity. Fortunately, at that time a true professional was fulfilling duties of the operations duty officer at the system command post, Lieutenant Colonel Engineer S.Ye. Petrov[.sup]11[/], deputy chief of the office of combat algorithms and programs. Instantly analyzing and evaluating the environment and situation, he did not permit false information to be issue to the command post of the missile attack warning system. By order of the Minister of Defense, a commission chaired by the First Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Colonel-General V.I. Varennikov, was appointed for this emergency. A.I. Savin and I were his deputies. I had occasion to meet fairly often with Valentin Ivanovich [Varennikov] on duty matters. In my view, he is intelligent, well-educated, firm-willed, courageous, and good-natured. He is a man of duty, honor, and conscience. He conducted the investigation objectively and competently. Commander-in-Chief of the Air Defense Troops A.I. Koldunov and I had occasion to be present during his report to D.F. Ustinov on the results received by the commission. Judging from the atmosphere of the meeting, the relations of the minister of defense with the leadership of the General Staff were strained. But despite this, Dmitriy Fedorovich [Ustinov] accepted Varennikov's report without questions, remarks, or organizational conclusions. Most likely, D.F. Ustinov knew general designers A.I. Savin and V.M. Kortunenko well and treated them with respect and trust. A.I. Savin, unquestionably a talented scientist and designer, together with the collective from the Kometa Central Scientific Research Institute undertook the task of detecting the launch of ballistic missiles from the territory of continents and ocean and sea water areas. The complexity consisted of the fact that spacecraft from orbits 35-40,000 km in altitude were to be detected with a high degree of reliability 2-3 minutes after their launch, and the information was to be passed to the space system command post. It is not worth talking about how complicated it is to identify missile launches at night from U.S. territory, literally illuminated by powerful light sources. On a daily basis the spacecraft observed literally thousands of aircraft takeoffs on afterburner. The electromagnetic disturbances in space as a result of unpredicted solar flares and also during the spacecraft's crossing of the so-called "terminator," when it leaves the space illuminated by the sun and goes into the earth's shadow, were still not fully known. Checking out the system by the method of experiments developed for the most critical situations in order to reveal and eliminate flaws in the spacecraft's detection equipment, onboard computer programs, in the equipment complex, and especially in the command post combat program. All work was analyzed in detail by A.I. Savin directly at the command post. I was struck by his self-control, intelligence, and ability to analyze his own miscalculations principally and critically. Incidentally, this was instructive for certain other general and chief designers, who during failures tried without basis to shift the blame on whomever, including the combat crew, considering themselves to be without guilt. We military people were impressed by the fact that A.I. Savin always first listened to the opinions of combat crew officials, specialists of the SNII of the National Air Defense Troops, and then his deputies and immediate assistants--K.A. Vlasko-Vlasov, V.G. Khlibko, and Ts.G. Litovchenko. He consulted M.I. Nenashev and me. He thoughtfully worked out proposals and made modifications, which were repeated checked. V.M. Kovtunenko preferred to examine the circumstances associated with the failure of the spacecraft in his own office at the Scientific Production Association imeni S.A. Lavochkin, since there was a mockup of the spacecraft there on which the situation that arose during the failure could be reproduced, and then repeatedly check the effectiveness of the modifications. It was not easy for Kovtunenko to work; he had to conduct a fierce debate with managers and designers of many design bureaus and plants manufacturing component parts for the spacecraft. Each of them believed someone other than their own firm was at fault for the failure of the spacecraft. Moreover, it was necessary to consider: the rigid requirements of the general designer of the system, A.I. Savin, who was always supported by the military--the chief of the contracting directorate M.I. Nenashev, SNII specialists, and representatives of the Main Space Systems Directorate. The question of a claim always arose; those at fault were to pay the Ministry of Defense approximately three million rubles for the spacecraft failure. I will note that for the general designers and for me, too, the unsuccessful launch or premature failure of a spacecraft was not only a tragedy but also useful experience. With an negative result after a thorough analysis, an opportunity appeared to determine the causes and take steps to increase the reliability significantly. The CINC of the National Air Defense Troops A.I. Koldunov reacted differently toward this. He had to sign the reports to the Minister of Defense, and they were naturally impartial. Many times he rudely rebuked both me and, less often, A.I. Savin. By the mid-1980's, through the efforts of A.I. Savin and the collective of the Kometa Central Scientific Research Institute, V.M. Kovtunenko, and his closest assistants A.G. Chesnokov and A.L. Rodin, the space-based system was brought to the required level of specifications and became the most reliable and effective basis in the integrated missile attack warning system. This is of special importance in connection with the serious decrease in the combat capabilities of above-the-horizon radar equipment for detection of ballistic missiles on their flight trajectories, now located in CIS countries on several avenues of likely missile attack. A most important element in the integrated Missile Attack Warning System is the several territorially separated, synchronously operating command posts. In the fully automatic mode, the command posts receive extensive information about the technical condition of the entire system, and warning information is also sent automatically to the command and control facilities of the Supreme High Command being warned and to the command authorities of the armed services on a special "Krokus" warning panel. I remember the three of us--chief designer of the Missile Attack Warning System V.G. Repin, Colonel-General V.K. Strelnikov[.sup]12[/], commander of a separate special-purpose army, and I--depicted on a sheet of paper a sketch of the front panel, in our opinion, of the "Krokus" for special briefcases of the top leadership of the country and the armed forces which contained warning information. Undoubtedly, I should talk separately about such a brilliant personality as V.K. Strelnikov. In 1967, upon graduating from the Military Academy of the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces imeni K.Ye. Voroshilov, he was appointed Commander of a Missile Attack Warning Division being organized for the first time. He commanded it for 10 years. His name is associated with the development of the large unit and the purposeful education of military collectives aimed at unconditional accomplishment of a combat mission of national importance. He set the tone in mastering new combat equipment. He was the first among line commanders to become a candidate of military sciences. And quite deservedly, he was the first commander of a separate missile attack warning army. The task of reliability and survivability of the system and its equipment was successfully accomplished. Each facility has triple redundancy of the production equipment and special technical equipment, and also several separated power supply feeds. Self-contained power sources were also created based on magneto-gas-dynamic generators. Landline and cable communications also have several lead-ins. The facilities are equipped with satellite, radio, and facsimile communications. The following made an invaluable contribution to the creation, development, and improvement of the operation of the system: M.M. Kolomiyets, V.V. Rozhkov[.sup]13[/], V.K. Strelnikov, I.A. Slukhay[.sup]14[/], V. M. Smirnov[.sup]15[/], A.V. Sokolov[.sup]16[/], V.P. Panchenko[.sup]17[/], N.V. Kislyakov[.sup]18[/], A.B. Novitskas[.sup]19[/], N.I. Rodionov, V.I. Motornyy[.sup]20[/], G.A. Vylegzhanin[.sup]21[/], A.K. Mikhaylov, N.G. Zavaliy[.sup]22[/], A.P. Blinov, V.M. Shumilin, and many others. In the creation and particularly in the testing and operation of the ABM and missile attack warning systems, one should make note of the collective of the SNII created in the 1960's, which I have already mentioned. At that time it was headed by I.M. Penchukov[.sup]23[/] and his deputy for scientific work, N.P. Buslenko[.sup]24[/]. In subsequent years, the institute was led by Yu.G. Yerokhin[.sup]25[/] and today by G.S. Batyr[.sup]26[/]. The deputy for scientific research work is M.D. Kislik[.sup]27[/]. This institute was the scientific headquarters when commissions headed by me examined a number of preliminary projects. Favorable conditions were created for carrying out the tasks entrusted to the commissions. I talk about this with great satisfaction--after all, I was associated with this remarkable collective for many years. More than 20 doctors and about 100 candidates of sciences labored productively at the SNII. The institute's leading scientists were: for the ABM system--G.I. Butko[.sup]28[/]; for the Missile Attack Warning System--G.V. Kononenko, B.S. Srebushevskiy, G.S. Suvorov, V.V. Ognev, and A.M. Tseytlenok. The institute was the first in the Ministry of Defense to successfully solve the problem of evaluating the combat effectiveness of complex, essentially unique, and completely automated complexes and weapons systems. The task was accomplished both according to results of full-scale testing and by mathematical modeling. Scientific method foundations of testing and commissioning these complexes and systems were developed. What is more, the institute's specialists, working constantly directly at the facilities, carefully analyzed the experience of operation and drew up the corresponding recommendations for the troops and the requirements for the designers. It is hard to overestimate the productive labor of the institute's scientists and specialists. Running ahead, I will note that the leading scientists were awarded two State Prizes and several Leninist Komsomol Prizes for the research performed and implemented in the troops. There is something I would like to say in conclusion. A great deal of labor and maximum use of intellectual and economic potentials of the Soviet state created an integrated missile attack warning system... It was, is, and, I hope, will be a decisive deterrent factor in unleashing a nuclear missile war. For any aggressor will always receive a guaranteed, devastating, retaliatory strike. We cannot and do not have the right to close our eyes to the fact that the great Soviet Union is no more. The Missile Attack Warning System, particularly its above-the-horizon detection and position finding equipment, has been weakened significantly by the ambitions of politicians who have received sovereignty. Urgent measures are needed for restoration of the system and its improvement under the direction and control of the government and the armed forces of Russia. After all, all components of the nuclear missile strike warning system are being improved continuously in the United States. Footnotes 1.
