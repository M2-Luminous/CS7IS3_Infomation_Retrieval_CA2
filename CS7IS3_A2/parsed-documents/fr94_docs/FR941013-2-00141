Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle. Overview: Proposals must be for projects which encourage the growth of democratic institutions and political and economic pluralism. Listed in order of priority are the areas in which USIA is interested in receiving proposals: (1) local government/public administration, (2) independent media development, and (3) business administration. Projects should lay the groundwork for new and continuing links between American and Central/Eastern European professionals organizations. Projects may include: study tours in the U.S. for small groups; short-term non-technical workshops conducted in Central/Eastern Europe; and four- to ten-week internships in the U.S.; consultations in Central/Eastern Europe. All proposals should demonstrate: (1) In-depth, substantive knowledge of the issues of concern to these countries; (2) Established connections with the partner institutions; (3) The capacity to organize and conduct the program, including appropriate orientation activities for the participants; detailed work plan for all phases of the project; tentative agendas for study tours, workshops, and internships; letters of commitment from internship hosts; and selection procedures.

Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate partner relationships by providing copies of correspondence or other materials as appendices to the proposals. The CEE partner institutions are encouraged to provide cost-sharing or significant in-kind contributions such as local housing, transportation, interpreting, translating, and other local currency costs and to assist with the organization of projects. Local Government USIA is interested in proposals for training programs which will foster effective administration of local and regional governments. Programs might examine and seek to improve relationships among local executive, legislative, and judicial elements, or they might address the knowledge and skills necessary to administer one or more of these branches of local government. Program topics might include one or more of the following: judicial administration, budget development, financial management, tax policies and mechanisms, election practices, management of municipal services, privatization of government property, consumer protection, business regulation (as opposed to control), licensing, and environmental protection. Programs might further the development of information and library systems relevant to local government, improve committee and staff structures, research capability, legislation drafting capability, structural and procedural needs of local governments. Training should be conducted mostly in local centers, preferably situated outside the capital cities.
