Having received the money, the terrorists released four more hostages but they are still insisting that the sum of $10 million be delivered to them. The four terrorists spent last night in the bus with tightly closed doors on the territory of the Mineralnyye Vody airport. They are holding 14 people hostage. It is thought that early in the morning the terrorists took turns taking naps while keepng a close eye on the hostages and making sure that no one could approach the bus.
