This comment was made by Aninat after meeting with President Eduardo Frei at La Moneda at noon today. Aninat, who arrived back in Chile early this morning, met with President Frei to brief him on the results of his trip. In Washington Aninat met with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor, and the two agreed to start preliminary negotiations on 25 May, prior to beginning formal negotiations on a free trade agreement. [Begin Aninat recording] We will not sign just any pact. We will sign a pact that is very rational, very coherent, in line with our economic policy, and suitable for Chile. In addition, before signing a pact we would discuss it with the political parties and, of course, with Congress. [end recording] Aninat said that Chile has not yet decided whether to negotiate a bilateral agreement with the United States or to join NAFTA, which is also made up of Mexico and Canada. The importance of a free trade agreement with the United States lies in the fact that one-third of Chile's international trade is currently with the United States.
