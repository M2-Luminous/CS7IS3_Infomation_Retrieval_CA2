This will happen at an international conference that will seek the European Union's blessing for the initiative, according to a statement made yesterday by Kiriakos Domadzoglu [name as transliterated], a member of the conference's organizing committee. The conference will be held from 29 June to 3 July in the town of Drama and will cost almost 9 million leva, at the exchange rate fixed by the Bulgarian National Bank. The sponsors include Siemens and Philips Greece. The poster advertising the conference showed a boiler shaped like Bulgaria that belched out smoke, turning the sun into a black sphere. The idea of holding the conference has reportedly received support from the Greek Ministry of National Economy, the Secretariat General of Makedonia-Thraki, and the councils of the eight largest towns in the province. Ecological movements in Greece have reportedly asked that the European Union close down the Bulgarian nuclear plant. The conference will deliver an ultimatum to the cabinet in Athens to raise the matter with the Berov government. "Kozloduy is a potential threat to the Balkans," Mr. Domadzoglu said, but admitted that he is not familiar with the official report of the International Atomic Energy Agency on Kozloduy, which is complimentary about the nuclear plant's condition. However, the Greeks are reported to be in a state of stress over Kozloduy. At a meeting, a special group of Greek parliamentarians is reported to have invited Bulgarian Environment Minister Valentin Bosevski to support the conference. However, our ecologists protested against the title of the conference -- "International Conference on Kozloduy," so there will be no official participants from Bulgaria. Nevertheless, some Bulgarian scientists are said to have responded to the invitations, and they will present three papers in Drama. One of them, by Ivan Uzunov, a genetics professor, is entitled "No Prospects Exist in Bulgaria for Nuclear Energy Development." "If Greece has rejected nuclear power plants," this does not entitle it to make us follow their example, said Nikita Shervashidze, chairman of the Committee on Power Supply. "In the long run, we will teach them what kind of olive trees to plant."
