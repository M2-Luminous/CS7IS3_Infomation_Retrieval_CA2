The MKDH is the coalition partner of the Egyutteles [Coexistence] Movement; both movements jointly represent the Hungarian minority in the Slovak Parliament. [Zizka] Do you think that today's assembly might exacerbate relations between Hungarians and Slovaks? [Bugar] For a whole month, someone has been persuading Slovak citizens that what we are doing is anti-constitutional and that we are about to proclaim territorial autonomy. Naturally, this is not true. How can an assembly of citizens, irrespective of their nationality, exacerbate the situation? We are not adopting any memorandum "against someone" but "for something." The situation, in my opinion, will not come to a head. [Zizka] What was your movement's share in this undertaking? [Bugar] The organizer is the Association of Zitny Ostrov [Rye Island, Hungarian-inhabited area in southern Slovakia] Towns and Villages. The MKDH and Egyutteles are actually only "allies." We joined the initiators and tried to help them organizationally. The assembly has been addressed by mayors and representatives of self-administration bodies, not by political parties. [Zizka] The view exists that, outwardly, you dissociate yourselves from this undertaking somewhat, while in reality you are the spiritual fathers of this assembly. [Bugar] We definitely do not dissociate ourselves from it; we only point out that this is not a rally of political parties. [Zizka] Is the idea of territorial self-administration realistic at this time, in your opinion? [Bugar] The terms territorial autonomy or province are not even mentioned in the statements adopted by this assembly. Quite the contrary, it is repeatedly stated in them that all problems must be addressed within the framework of the territory of the Slovak Republic. The new territorial arrangement should result in exactly the same powers [for local self-administration bodies] in the south of Slovakia as in purely Slovak regions. However, the citizens of Hungarian nationality should not be dissipated [rozdrobeni] as provided for by the government's current project. I think that in pointing this out, we are only making use of our constitutional right. [Zizka] So how do explain that in the assessment of your steps, the view also keeps cropping up that you are demanding an independent province? [Bugar] A mistake occurred in that in the first appeal issued by the organizers of the assembly, the word "tartomany" was used, which can also be translated as province. (Tartomany can be translated as province or area -- editor's note.) We often explained this, but the explanation never appeared in the newspapers. To this day, Slovak constitutional officials have not accepted that the organizers are not after a province or territorial autonomy, let alone secession from Slovakia.
