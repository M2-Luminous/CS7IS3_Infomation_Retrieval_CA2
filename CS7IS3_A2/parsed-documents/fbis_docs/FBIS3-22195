The council's ecological security commission has asked the government for 473.5 billion roubles to protect the coast of the Caspian Sea which was recognized an ecological disaster zone. The water level in the Caspian Sea has been rising by an average 15 centimeters a year since 1978. On the Russian coast 3,220 thousand hectares of valuable land has been swamped, causing economic damage estimated at 4.3 billion roubles (in the 1991 prices). The cities of Makhachkala, Derbent and Kaspiisk, as well as more than 30 smaller residential centers in Daghestan, the Republic of Kalmykia (Khalm-Tangch) and the Astrakhan region, are already feeling the impact. The water rim is moving inland at a speed of 1-2 kilometers a year. The waves reach up to 20 kilometers inland, the sanitary situation is deteriorating and toxic substances threaten epidemics of plague, cholera and skin diseases. The commission worked out more than ten other specific recommendations for dealing with the situation caused by the continuing rise of the water level in the sea, which is threatening the existence of many coastal cities in Russia and neighboring countries, as well as off-shore oilwells and platforms belonging to Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Turkey.
