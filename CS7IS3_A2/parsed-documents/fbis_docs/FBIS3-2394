The installed capacity of urban telephones has reached more than 200,000 lines, eight times that of 1988, when setting up the province, as well as designating it as the largest special economic zone in China, was approved by the State Council. The capital city of Haikou now has 27 telephones for every 100 people, ranking among the top of China's provincial capital cities. At present, automatic telephone service has been put into operation at or above the country town level. The province is thus on line with more than 1,400 cities at home and 195 countries and regions in the world. Various advanced communications facilities related to digital micro-wave, optical fiber, satellite, program-control, mobile and paging functions are in service in the province. During the six-year period, the capacity of switchboards in the province's rural areas increased by 90 percent.
