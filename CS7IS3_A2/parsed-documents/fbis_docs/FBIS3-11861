Nevertheless, there are indications this issue could be downgraded in the next hemispheric summit convened by U.S. President William Clinton, which, according to him, must review inter-American relations in the post-Cold War era. Despite the fact that the summit is filled with injustice from the start because of the deliberate exclusion of Cuba, U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, during his quick tour of Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil, took time to hold an equally quick meeting with several of the likely participants at the hemispheric summit to issue propaganda about the forum. Most likely, poverty will be one topic discussed at the summit. What cannot be certain, however, is whether participants will find the formula to eradicate this distressing problem because most of the region's presidents are unrelentingly applying neoliberal economic programs imposed on them by international banks, which have been a main creator of poverty, deprivation, and violence. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli has said poverty represents a new scourge within society, because it poses security threats that cannot be fought with armies. He stressed poverty is connected with hunger, terrorism, drug trafficking, violence, and deprivation. Aside from other personalities who have called attention to poverty, such as the current OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, everyone is fully aware that there is a close relationship between poverty and social violence. Nevertheless, no one seems ready to tackle the problem. Meanwhile, there are many bright individuals in Latin America who have not only realized that poverty is a national security risk but who have called attention to the need for the region to set up a new economic, political, and cultural integration system as the only means of salvation in the face of an increasingly competitive and isolationist world. Gradually, strong integration programs, such as Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the Andean Pact, and other treaties involving Latin American and Caribbean nations, are being implemented. These pacts are aimed at devising strategies to offset the ominous effects of structural adjustment programs. When the connection between poverty and violence is discussed, the danger this poses to the stability of democratic governments is also mentioned. This is particularly true when one understands that 50 percent of the 200 million youngsters under the age of 18 in Latin America are excluded from adequate social, economic, and cultural benefits. In turn, this undermines social equality and justice, which form the groundwork of democracy. Therefore, the only way to avoid allowing poverty to cause social catastrophe in Latin America is by expediting integration, cooperation, and solidarity among our peoples. The results may not be immediate, but in time they will resolve the problems faced by the majority.
