"Candidates must certify their honesty." "The truth is that there was no more money. And that is why the Clean Hands investigation could uncover the Bribe City scandals." Francesco Saverio Borrelli, chief district attorney of Milan, is speaking. He is speaking about "how everything started." That is, about one of the crucial points in the judicial affair that is changing the face of the country. But he is also speaking about the future, about possible solutions. And he issued a warning to politicians who intend to confront the new elections as protagonists: "If you have any skeletons in your closet, hurry up and take them out. Or we will get them out for you." Francesco Saverio Borrelli is speaking. He does it by giving a long interview to the Viennese daily DER STANDARD. And by appearing before the microphone of Paolo Garimberti, head of Television News Channel 2. Borrelli explained to the Austrian daily why his prosecuting attorney's office had "better luck," with respect to others, in the investigations into bribes. The chief district attorney said "As long as there was plenty of money, the deals could be paid. But when the profit margins narrowed and the individual company's struggle for survival became more severe, the burden became unbearable. And that is just how it happened. But there was another important reason: The prospect of the European Single Market and the need to stand up to competition with foreign companies convinced Italian business men that the system imposed by politics (a hidden system and parallel to that of the state) could not and should not be maintained. Business men thus helped bring about its collapse." Instead, at Paolo Garimberti's microphone for Television News Channel 2 yesterday evening, Borrelli even spoke of the future. He said, "Our work will not slow down in connection with the forthcoming political deadlines." In brief, there will be no electoral-type slowing down. On the contrary. "Personalities stepping into the political limelight are the first to know whether there are episodes in their past that might compromise their image. We shall not stop our investigations even during the elections. Therefore, I advise these persons to provide a certain self-certification concerning the transparency of their past to the political forces that are backing them." About the Cusani trial, Borelli denied the existence of an "oligarchy" at the summit of Bribe City. "There is no cupola, in the Mafia sense of the term. Instead, there is a progressive slipping and decline in political morals and ethics. Not only concerning the leading class but, I should say, on the part of the Italian population in general." Borrelli did not express optimism about the timing and the possible closing of this dark page of the First Republic. "A submerged and potentially limitless universe has been discovered over these two years. I do not know whether the new Parliament intends to put a political type of end to the matter. Nor do I know whether Italians would be pleased with such a choice. What I do hope is that all the trials will be held. The investigations could meet with obstacles only if the political situation regressed to the levels of two years ago. And perhaps one would not stop even in such a case. But, in my opinion, the danger is something different; namely, that a future parliament, stronger and sounder thanks to the uninominal system, might give in to the temptation to reduce judicial power." And then there could no longer be any revelations of possible new Bribe Cities.
