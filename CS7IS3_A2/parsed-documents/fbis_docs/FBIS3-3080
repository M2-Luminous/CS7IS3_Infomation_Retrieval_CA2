C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, March 15 (CNA) -- Both government officials and entrepreneurs on Tuesday [15 march] expressed their concern about the negative influence Taiwan's joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) might have on domestic industries. They did, however, agree that Taiwan's gaining entry into the Geneva-based world trade regulating body was "a must." The points of view were expressed in a symposium organized to discuss the impact GATT membership will have on Taiwan and countermeasures Taiwan can take to protect itself from the opening of its market to foreign competition. Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992, is expected to become a full member by the end of this year. The meeting was cosponsored by Chinatrust Commercial Bank and the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research. Jeffrey Koo, the chairman of both the bank and the institute, urged the government to make cautious assessments before substantially opening the domestic financial sector to foreigners. "The government must take into account the scope of the domestic market and the financial sector's adjustment problems," he said. Hsueh Chi, vice chairman of the cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), noted that financial liberalization has paved the way for Taiwan's economic development. Between 2000 and 2005, he forecast, Taiwan's GATT membership would help push up annual foreign trade by 15 to 20 percent and annual growth of the gross national product by 1 to 2 percent. Taiwan's foreign trade totaled about US$160 billion last year, while the GNP was NT [New Taiwan] $5.61 trillion (US$212 billion). Hsueh, however, conceded that the gains would inevitably be at the expense of certain industries. Liu Kuo-chao, president of the Taiwan Electric Appliance Manufacturers Association, pointed out that the electric appliance sector will certainly be affected by the change of rules in government procurement caused by Taiwan's accession to GATT. As a large part of demand for engineering, computers, and telecommunications comes from the government's major construction projects, the three sectors will be adversely affected, Liu explained. To cope with the possible impact on the domestic food industry, Huang Nan-tu, president of the Wei Chuan Group, called for coordinated efforts among domestic manufacturers. "We should work together in a new effort to tap foreign markets, thereby ushering in a new era," he said. Chen Sheng-tien, chairman of the Shampo Group, suggested that the government take a step-by-step approach to lower tariffs in order to minimize the negative impact GATT would have on domestic industries.
