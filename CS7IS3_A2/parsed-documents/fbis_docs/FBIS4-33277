A resolution to promote the integration of Cuba, Suriname, and the Dominican Republic into the association of Caribbean states, scheduled to meet in Barbados in July, was also made. The 27 nations that make up SELA stated unanimously that free trade contributes to the economic development and well-being of the people. They also stressed the convenience of strengthening commercial relations in the hemisphere. They reject the implementation of unilateral measures that could affect international free trade and urge that the economic, commercial, and financial blockade of Cuba be lifted and manifest their support of the U.N. resolution on the issue. This is the first time since its creation in 1975 that SELA adopts an energetic attitude against the United States' hostile policy toward Cuba.
