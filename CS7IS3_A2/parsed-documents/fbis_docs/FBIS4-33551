For example, one day Eloy and I discussed whether or not Cuban soil could feed the Cuban people. We discussed the basic cooperative production units and criticized some things in the agriculture sector on other occasions. Today, I suggest we examine the new formulas for the agriculture sector, how they can influence Cuban life and how and to what extent they can solve the food problem. Luis, I propose that you begin the debate because I see you are eager to begin a lengthy dissertation. [Sexto] No, let me tell you that you have put me in a tight spot. I respect Eloy a lot because I believe he is a good journalist and because the issue of agriculture has been one of his constant campaigns. I also know that he is a specialist, an agricultural technician. He does not know it, but I know that he studied in an agronomy school way back in his youth. In fact, I recognize his authority due to his dedication to the topic as a journalist and due to his knowledge about the agronomy sector. That is why you have put me in a tight spot. [Rodriguez] Alright. You must begin as the youngest man. [Sexto] Alright. I accept if you put it that way. Agriculture is a very critical issue. It is very critical because it has a direct influence on the population, it is part of the people's livelihood. In fact, we currently see that our agricultural sector is not fulfilling the people's nutrition needs. I might ask: What happens? Is it true that our agricultural sector is as inefficient as the empty marketplaces show us? Is it true that it has always been that inefficient over the last 35 years? We must ask that question. There is another question we must ask: Why has there been another organization? We have answered this question, but it would not be a waste of time to discuss the issue again. I endorse the view that agriculture has not always been a failure. I think Cuban agriculture has gone through various phases. I think the last 5-year phase has not been the happiest. It has not been the happiest because our agriculture suffered an overwhelming blow. It was a highly technical agriculture; it was an agriculture that relied on machinery, fuel, and chemical products, and it practically lost its suppliers of machinery, fuel, and chemical products. In Cuban slang, it was an agriculture that found itself naked all of a sudden. Therefore, right now, at this point, we cannot demand miracles from our agriculture, which is striving, seeking solutions, seeking solutions and even asking the people to go that extra mile to overcome this depressive phase. [Rodriguez] What does Eloy Concepcion think about this? [Concepcion] It is like Luis Sexto says. Now then, there is an essential element that I always like to bring up when I talk about everything. Our country is dutybound to do what is part of the most sacred and beautiful thing that the revolution has, meaning the pledge to provide for 11 million people on an equal basis. Any analysis must bear this in mind. If we do not make that analysis, we will not find the truth. If we did not have equal distribution, the analyses would be different and production would be easier because we would opt for the so-called market economy and the policy of every man for himself. Those 11 million people sometimes multiply because we have hospitals, schools, the so-called social consumption, and the workers' cafeterias, which charge prices that fail to cover the costs of the products being offered, etc. etc. Those issues must be considered. [Rodriguez] Cuban agriculture and its new formulas: That is the issue Luis Sexto, of BOHEMIA magazine, and Eloy Concepcion, of TRABAJADORES newspaper, and myself -- Osvaldo Rodriguez, of BOHEMIA magazine -- are reviewing in "Straight Talk." Luis Sexto is requesting the floor as if we were in a meeting. [Sexto] Osvaldo, we are in a meeting. I want to say that many myths have existed regarding Cuban agriculture, above all, myths that are curently being used in certain enemy propaganda and in certain views within the country because they cannot understand what happens in Cuba, what were the basic causes that propitiated this situation. That is why they are resorting to myths. I want to talk about the myth concerning prerevolutionary Cuban agriculture, meaning Cuban agriculture prior to the revolution. In fact, it is said... [pauses] A scheme of the enemy propaganda states Cuban agriculture produced everything for everyone before the revoluution. I believe one-third of the Cuban population was not born yesterday; two-thirds were born after 1959. That says a lot about the Cuban revolution. One-third was born before 1959. I am part of that third, and I have a memory. In addition to having a memory, I have eyes to read and delve into my country's files. I spend a lot of time delving into my country's files. I want to remind those over there -- and some over here -- that Cuban agriculture prior to 1959 did not produce everything for everyone. I want to state that there was practically no Cuban agriculture. I do not think you can talk about agriculture in a country that had 9,000 tractors in 1959, a country whose soil had almost no chemical fertilizers, a country in which irrigation was almost unheard of. I do not think we can talk about agriculture. What agriculture are we talking about? Let me give you some figures: A country which imported 63 percent of its grain could not have agriculture. In other words, what do they mean when they claim everything was produced for everyone prior to 1959? I also want to add: In 1957, a Catholic university group comprised of professionals and students who had nothing to do with communism, who had nothing to do with the left -- because many of them now live in Miami -- published a poll they had conducted in our countryside. They proved with figures resulting from careful research that only 2 percent of the peasants who comprised the rural population in Cuba -- 3 million people at the time, 34 percent of the population -- ate meat, only 4 percent ate eggs, and only 1 percent ate fish. In other words, what agriculture do they claim existed in the past? Granted, there was the sugar industry. The country also had 100,000 caballerias of idle land waiting for the time the U.S. mills needed them to sow sugarcane. Of course, there was a developed sugarcane agriculture with giant companies and 100,000 caballerias of idle land, whereas 46 percent of the rural population was unemployed, all this in 1958. [Concepcion] The sugarcane industry was developed, but the sugarcane was cut by hand. [Sexto] Yes, that is right. That was a relative development. [Concepcion] Now more than 80 percent is mechanized. [Sexto] Obviously. That development was relative. That is what I was talking about. [Rodriguez] I think that is very important. It is appropriate to mention those things. I have discussed this issue many times. I believe, however, we must return to the topic we mentioned at the beginning of the program and talk about today's agriculture. Like you said earlier, you believe this agriculture has not always been a failure. I do not believe it has been a failure, either. I do not think Cuban agriculture today is a failure even. I think plans have failed, I think branches of agriculture have failed, and I think other branches of agriculture have set a tremendous example. I always use the national poultry enterprise and the development achieved in the cattle sector, which suffered a setback at a given moment but achieved great progress in the genetic and milk production sectors, nevertheless, as examples. We are talking about Cuban agriculture and its new formulas. Let us talk about the new formulas. [Concepcion] This is what happens, Osvaldo. Many people are not aware our agriculture -- edible roots and vegetables -- is not only a state enterprise. Many people do not know there are 105,000 individual peasants who own land in Cuba. Many people do not know there are 1,180 agricultural-livestock cooperatives [CPA] comprised of peasants who gave their land. Many people do not know that the basic cooperative production units have been created in the last 6 months. The government has granted the workers permanent usufruct of the land, and it has sold them the means for production. Also, many people do not know that 92 percent of the garlic produced in the country is produced by private landowners rather than the state. A total of 58 percent of the tomatoes is also produced by the CPAs and individual farmers. The same goes for 46 percent of the yucca, 54 percent of the sweet potato, and 91 percent of the carrot. In other words, those are abysmal figures. Many times we hear people talk about agriculture, and they put all the blame on the state. Well, the state is also to blame; logically, it must bear most of the blame because the state has been unable to provide enough fertilizer and fuel throughout these years. All this sensibly affects the agriculture in a tropical country. From what I said at the beginning and with the abrupt suspension of supplies from six socialist countries -- on top of the blockade, which continues to have a decisive effect on our economy -- it would be foolish or evil to think we can solve the agrarian products' supply problem overnight or by the grace of God. [Sexto] Of course, the creation of the basic cooperative production units is the result of the audacious decision adopted by the party and the government because they are trying to seek formulas which encourage work under these conditions. Our country has practically been compelled to render part of its 80,000 tractors useless. [Rodriguez] Luis Sexto, now that you talk about encouragement there is an interesting thing: You know that at least 1 million workers will join the basic cooperative production units. If you multiply this by four, which is the average Cuban family, you get 4 million persons. These persons would be directly involved in and enjoy the benefits of the basic cooperative production units. Also, they would be encouraged by the new production formula... [pauses] There is a lot of talk about incentives, and I believe there are extraordinary incentives. Many of those basic cooperative production units have already solved their self-supply problem and have sold edible roots and beans to those workers and their families. [Sexto] The measure is very intelligent. The measure will yield expected results in the medium or long term. Now then, I want to state that our state agriculture, when it had all those fuel and fertilizer supplies, meaning the state agriculture which some people have always termed as a failure -- I say it has not always been a failure -- once produced more milk and eggs than a capitalist country. It once produced 50 percent of the rice consumed in Cuba, and once it produced citrus as has never been done in a capitalist country. [Rodriguez] Undeniably, the topic is far from over. I invite you, my friends, to continue this in another "Straight Talk" program. Thank you, Luis Sexto of BOHEMIA magazine and Eloy Concepcion of TRABAJADORES newspaper for your straight talk about Cuban agriculture and its new formulas.
