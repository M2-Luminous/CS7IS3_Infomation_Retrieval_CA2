He said: The party Central Committee and State Council have decided that a bumper agricultural harvest is the major task for achieving economic and national stability this year. China's agriculture, grain production in particular, is by no means a local issue, but a cardinal issue having a bearing on the overall situation; it is not an economic issue in general, but an economic as well as political issue of strategic importance. Therefore, it is necessary to unify thinking, take concerted action, and make a determined effort to develop and support agriculture. At present, the shortage of chemical fertilizers remains acute. Farm work is seasonal, so racing against time to produce and supply more chemical fertilizers to ensure demand has become an urgent task in production, as well as an important matter having a bearing on this year's harvest. He said: Chemical industrial departments and chemical fertilizer enterprises should strengthen confidence to overcome difficulties and go full steam ahead to produce more chemical fertilizers. Despite a good momentum in chemical fertilizer production and marketing since the beginning of this year, the supply of chemical fertilizers has fallen short of demand. Therefore, chemical industrial departments and chemical fertilizer enterprises should summarize experiences, and master and keep abreast of the law governing demand to guide production and supply. Meanwhile, operation of the nearly 600 enterprises whose production has been suspended should resume, and enterprises not operating at full capacity should put into high gear to produce more chemical fertilizers. Major enterprises that are tasked with the production of chemical fertilizers under unified state distribution should make a determined effort to fulfill and strive to overfulfill the task. Although chemical fertilizer enterprises are facing difficulties and problems in production, the shortage of market supply has provided enterprises with a good opportunity. Hence, all productive enterprises must strengthen confidence and exert every muscle to overcome difficulties and create production conditions. All enterprises must strengthen management, strive to improve quality and lower consumption and production costs, and mobilize workers to launch campaigns to increase production and practice economy, and to stop deficits and increase revenue. Chemical industrial departments and chemical fertilizer enterprises should do everything they can to mobilize and rely on cadres and workers to fulfill this year's production and marketing plans. They should take strong measures to strictly control and stabilize chemical fertilizer prices to satisfy the needs of agricultural production and farmers. In his speech, Zou Jiahua also urged governments at all levels and all relevant departments to take the initiative to create a favorable external environment for chemical fertilizer production. He said: In order to win a bumper agricultural harvest this year, we must ensure the delivery of quality chemical fertilizers in full amounts to farmers. To this end, relevant government departments should take immediate action to comply with this requirement, taking the initiative to create a favorable external environment for chemical fertilizer production and to help enterprises solve problems caused by external factors. Energy, railways, transportation, commerce, and banking departments should coordinate efforts to help enterprises overcome difficulties in energy, transportation, and, in particular, funds. Industrial and commercial banks should expedite the processing of funds approved by the State Council meeting for storing chemical fertilizers and pesticides in winter and for resuming the operation of small chemical fertilizer enterprises. Departments concerned should ensure priority supply of coal, electricity, natural gas, and heavy oil needed for production. Railways and transportation departments should prioritize the delivery of chemical fertilizers and their raw materials for production. To support the production of chemical fertilizer, the state has decided to continue the present preferential fare for transporting chemical fertilizers and preferential charges for electricity used by small and medium chemical fertilizer plants in their production. All provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional governments should actively support chemical fertilizer enterprises in terms of funds, raw and semi-finished materials, electricity supply, and transportation, continuing to implement the provisions of relevant State Council documents, adopting preferential measures in prices, taxes, and loans, and helping enterprises solve production problems. He emphasized: All localities should earnestly implement the policy toward prices of agricultural capital goods and guard against big fluctuations in market prices. Commodity price departments should strengthen supervision and inspection, resolutely checking unauthorized price rises and duly punishing indiscriminate price hikes in violation of the price policy. He said: At present, departments in charge of agricultural capital goods should lose no time in trying every possible way to find new sources of goods, to link production with transportation and marketing, and to ensure timely supply of chemical fertilizers. They should serve as the main channels for not only procuring and supplying chemical fertilizers and pesticides during the peak season but also procuring them in good time during the off season so as to ensure normal production of chemical fertilizer and pesticide enterprises. Enterprises may directly supply chemical fertilizers not under unified state distribution to grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives or farm households through direct sales or joint and commissioned sales with grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives of agricultural capital goods. Gu Xiulian, minister of chemical industry, announced specific plans for chemical fertilizer production to ensure demand during the spring farming season.
