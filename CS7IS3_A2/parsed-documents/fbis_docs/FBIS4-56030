Trade With Former USSR"] [Text]Over the next years, Russia will keep reducing its imports more and more because of the burden of paying back interest rates on foreign credits. So a program of expansion based on an exchange of oil and natural gas (which are strategically important to us) in return for food surpluses, should be put aside and instead, one must seriously think over strategies for regaining Eastern markets. Hopes expressed by left-wing politicians for rebuilding trade with Russia may come to nothing. All the signs are that Russia -- which is entangled in its own political and economic problems -- has practically no interest in expanding its trade with Poland. It is not known whether the "breakthrough" visit by Prime Minister Aleksandr Chernomyrdin [as published] to Warsaw -- which was announced for May -- will take place in June. There is more and more talk of July, but that will also depend on Russia's internal situation which keeps changing radically daily. Zbigniew Okonski, deputy foreign economic cooperation minister, who was subjected to a "confession" before the Sejm Foreign Economic Relations Commission on 25 May, admitted that Chernomyrdin's visit would not be a step further in resolving the most important issues for both sides, that is, mutual debt levels, and a modern system for payments in trade. Mounting Discrepancies For now, all documents which are strategically important to us, are still subject to negotiation. The treaty on economic cooperation, which was signed in August 1993, and supposed to reverse the trend in mutual relations, has not even been ratified by Moscow. There is still no trade protocol for 1994. The Russians refuse to agree to use the method of barter applied in the past: Their natural gas in return for our food products. There is still no agreement -- which was announced by the two prime ministers in Moscow in April -- concerning mutual supply of strategic merchandise in the 1994-2000 period. The Russian concept of reexports does not allow for signing an agreement on military and technical cooperation. It is the same case with a protocol on mutual supplies of special equipment: We submitted orders for $25 million worth of merchandise, while the Russians are offering merchandise for just $4 million. There is no news concerning a speedy settlement of mutual debts. The Polish and Russian commissions are said to be working on this very hard, but the issue will definitely not be resolved soon. The Polish Finance Ministry is not eager to be hasty, anyway. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which was willing to financially coparticipate in reconstructing the system of Polish-Russian mutual payments, finally gave up since it was not able to find reliable partners among Russian banks. Negotiations are still going on concerning the presence of our fishing boats in the Sea of Okhotsk. It has been agreed that part of them will leave, but the Russians do not feel fully satisfied yet. Bad Memories Many companies seem to think that Russia will gladly exchange its natural resources for our canned meat or pickled cucumbers. But past experience contradicts that. The famous "natural gas for food" transaction, implemented in 1992, may be a warning in that regard. In return for food and agricultural products from Poland, we were supposed to receive 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas, with a possibility of increasing supply to 2 billion. Due to misunderstandings on both sides, just 0.5 billion cubic meters of gas (worth $44.5 million) was supplied. On our part, the following was shipped East: 65,500 tonnes of apples, 93,500 tonnes of potatoes, 500 tonnes of garlic, 2,500 tonnes of pickled cucumbers, and 1,000 tonnes of canned food products. By the way, the last item mentioned did not come directly from Poland. "There could be have been much more of the food" -- Deputy Minister Okonski argued. According to the Foreign Economic Cooperation Ministry [MWGzZ], the "natural gas for food" contract backfired because the Russians wanted to receive foreign-made merchandise in addition to Polish products, but "they were not treated with understanding." Hope About Credits Both MWGzZ and exporters have high hopes about a draft law which was just approved by the government, concerning insurance on export contracts. This year, the government intends to spend 25 trillion zlotys (about $1 billion) on the guarantees, but it is not known whether -- due to quite a high risk factor -- Russia will be on the list of countries to which exports will be insured by the Corporation for Export Credit Insurance [KUKE]. Fortunately, there is still Belarus, the Baltic countries, and the Asian post-Soviet republics. For example, an agreement has already been initialled in the Finance Ministry concerning a $30 million credit for exports of our merchandise to Kazakhstan. Poland will definitely not be able to tie up substantial means in credits and insuring trade with the East. Germany could afford to "sink" 18 billion German Marks in Russia (this is how much unpaid bills are worth -- GAZETA WYBORCZA's note). Our KUKE will never be the German Hermes whose Russian liabilities reach 5 billion German Marks.
