Reliable UN sources told CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] that from the contacts held after [UN Secretary General's special representative on Cyprus] Joe Clark's departure from Cyprus there was no evidence or developments that justify an extension to the process. The same sources also noted that in view of this situation, there is no plan to call a meeting in New York between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas. Attention is now focused on the preparation and presentation of the UN secretary general's report to the Security Council in which the events will be reported objectively. Furthermore, the same UN source rejected Denktas' accusations and the British side's views that there were changes in the original package of the confidence-building measures. The UN sources clarified that the package of measures refers to the outline, whereas the 21 March document refers to the ways to implement the measures. They also noted that the 21 March document includes serious improvements which are almost all to the Turkish Cypriots' benefit.
