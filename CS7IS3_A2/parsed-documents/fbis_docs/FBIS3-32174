This action resulted in the approval of the constitutional reforms, thereby laying the foundations for purging Congress and the Supreme Court. The CAN leadership concluded by stating: "Although we are immersed in a sea of uncertainty and indecision, the people's will as expressed in the referendum compels us to demand the immediate purge of state institutions. As a direct consequence, elections must be held immediately in order not to frustrate the aspirations of the Guatemalan people, who for several months have been demanding the election of a new congress.
