Speaking after Saturday's [19 February] 90-minute meeting in London with Mr. Major, the Taoiseach [prime minister] warned the IRA and Sinn Fein they would not have a better opportunity to enter the political process. He denied setting a deadline of March 17 for a Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street peace declaration. Both he and Mr. Major had made it clear the door to peace would not be closed, said Mr. Reynolds. "We are not closing the door to peace, we are not going to lock that door and throw away the key." But he added: "I do not think the overwhelming support of the Irish people can be ignored. This is a new opportunity, there is never going to be a better offer on the table and I cannot see what justification there would be for the continuation of violence or the taking of one more innocent life." During their meeting at Downing Street on Saturday both leaders agreed to resume the three-strand Northern Ireland talks process. Mr. Reynolds told Irish radio the talks would be based on the principles enshrined in the declaration. "The new starting point will be the peace declaration. That has not been clear up to now, we finally agreed it on Saturday. We also agreed that it is a three-stranded process and not an internal settlement as some people were suggesting." Mr. Reynolds said it was helpful that Mr. Major had reaffirmed his commitment to the declaration. "It was important that the British prime minister said it because I think there were people who were suspecting that maybe the British Government in some way or another were not behind the declaration." Mr. Reynolds quashed hopes that the Sinn Fein annual conference next weekend would deliver a response to the Downing St. declaration, saying: "I never expected that forum to be the forum at which the response would be put together." But he hoped sufficient people would recognise that the road to peace was "a better road to choose to pursue their political objectives rather than the road to violence which in the last 25 years has been carried on by paramilitaries on both sides. There will be no military victories." Mr. Reynolds said: "We want people to sit back, study exactly where they have come from, where they are at and which road has the best chance of advancing the cause of nationalism. We believe the peace process is the only road." Earlier, Mr. Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that progress was likely within a month. "Saturday's meeting cleared the air and we have now agreed on the basis for the new talks, which is that the peace declaration will form the basis for the resumption of talks. That will be the new starting point," he said. And Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew told the same programme that no party, including the Rev. Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionists, could be allowed to veto progress of the peace talks. Meanwhile, Irish Deputy Premier Dick Spring called on the IRA and Sinn Fein to show "leadership and courage" and accept the Downing Street peace declaration. But speaking on BBC1's Breakfast With Frost programme he conceded that the IRA and Sinn Fein might never respond to the peace initiative. John Hume, the SDLP [Social Democratic Labor Party] leader, said he did not agree with the view that the Declaration was unacceptable to Sinn Fein. He told the London Weekend Television Walden programme: "My reading is that they are still giving it detailed study, which is what I expected, given the nature of that organisation. "Their immediate reaction is suspicion and that is what I expect. But they have not rejected the Declaration. They have asked for clarification." Mr. Hume said that peace in Ireland was above party politics. "I am putting it above party politics myself in the dialogue that I have been engaged in, so I would feel that what the British Government should do now is to directly clarify to them whatever they want clarified."
