Participating in the meeting are representatives from the 16 Asia-Pacific port countries and regions who signed the Asia-Pacific Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (AP-MOU), as well as representatives from six international agencies and maritime authorities, who have been invited as observers of the meeting. The AP-MOU, signed in December 1993 in Tokyo, is a regional agreement for cooperation among Asia-Pacific coastal countries and regions to ensure maritime safety and prevent ocean pollution caused by ships. It's the third regional cooperative mou on port control in the world, following the paris and latin American mous in this field. So far 16 countries and regions have signed the AP-MOU, namely, China, Japan, Canada, Australia, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Solomon Islands, Thailand and Vanuatu. Authorities of these signatory nations will use the AP-MOU to survey and inspect foreign-flagged ships which anchor in their ports, in accordance with related international maritime safety and pollution-prevention conventions. This aims to control and gradually eliminate low-standard ships from merchandise transport so as to ensure maritime safety and oceanic environmental protection. Sources from the Chinese Ministry of Communications, which is in charge of the country's maritime affairs, said that as early as 1987 the bureau of harbor superintendency of China began to carry out demonstrations on port control affairs, and to date the work has been extended to 12 ports.
