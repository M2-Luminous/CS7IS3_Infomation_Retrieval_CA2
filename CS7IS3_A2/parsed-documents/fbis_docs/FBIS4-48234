There are some excellent appointments; some truly appalling; and many that are just mediocre. That makes it better than any cabinet this country has seen before, but leaves us disappointed that Nelson Mandela has not made the fullest and best use of the large amount of talent available to him. And there are some choices that are horrifyingly inappropriate. The real shock must be the absence of Cyril Ramaphosa. Mandela has blundered badly by not finding or creating the right post to make full use of Ramaphosa's talents and experience in the cabinet. Notable cabinet selections are: -- Dullah Omar, justice: A sensible choice, he has extensive court experience as both a lawyer and attorney. He will now be in charge of those judges that refused to release him from detention without trial in a notorious 1980s test case. -- Joe Slovo, housing: An inspired use of a practical man with the radical credibility to deal with the huge demands this ministry will face. -- Dr Nkosozana Zuma, health: A sound decision. Health workers say she has experience and a good grasp of health policy, even though her public image is poor. -- Joe Modise, defence: The SADF generals may be happy to have a hawk with a tarnished reputation (for his failure to stop torture in exile camps), but anyone associated with Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] when he led it will tell you how poor a choice he is. -- Sidney Mufamadi, safety and security: An interesting choice, he has been groomed for the post. -- Dr Sibusiso Bhengu, education: An unexpected minister. He has had no involvement in any of the extensive policy and planning work in this field. As rector of Fort Hare, he had to leave after falling foul of an internal student conflict. Mandela probably had in mind that as a Zulu and a former IFP general secretary, he would help balance the cabinet. -- Alfred Nzo in foreign affairs is a surprise. There cannot be a less appropriate choice for such a critical post as this dour and ineffectual man who was ousted as ANC general secretary. -- Pallo Jordan, posts, telecommunications and broadcasting: The natural choice. -- Mac Maharaj, transport: Has been given a surprisingly junior post, but at least his talents are in the cabinet. -- Roelf Meyer, a Nat [National Party] that Mandela can trust, is a brilliant choice for provincial and constitutional affairs. -- Derek Hanekom, land: Will be a relief to anyone concerned with this issue. He has earned respect for his involvement in it in recent years, but will face a tough task in his forced partnership with Kraai van Niekerk, who holds the post of agricultural minister. -- Stella Sigcau can only have been chosen for public enterprises because she is a traditional leader and one of the few women with cabinet experience, albeit in a homeland where she was ousted amid corruption charges by Bantu Holomisa, now a deputy minister. -- Derek Keys is a wise compromise in finance, particularly as he is fenced in by the formidable trio of Trevor Manuel in trade and industry, Jay Naidoo in reconstruction and Alec Erwin as deputy finance minister. -- Steve Tshwete was a natural choice for sport. -- If Mangosuthu Buthelezi had to have a senior post, home affairs is fairly neutral, though it means he will run future elections. It is extraordinary that so important a reconstruction portfolio as welfare should be in the hands of a Nat with a dubious reputation, Abe Williams. -- Artists must be horrified at falling into the combined hands of the IFP's Ben Ngubane, minister of arts, culture, science and technology, and deputy minister Winnie Mandela. They will find themselves caught between a Zulu nationalist and a woman still under investigation for alleged corruption in the ANC department of welfare. What a disappointment in the very week when the president inauguration celebrations, a brilliant choreographed display of all- inclusive multiculturism, showed us the power of cultures as a benign, unifying national force. Some of the more controversial appointments are off-set by strong deputy ministerships, such as Valli Moosa in provincial affairs, Aziz Pahad in foreign affairs, and Penuell Manduna in home affairs. Others -- such as education and welfare -- will depend on strong appointments to the key posts of directors-general. Mandela did reasonably well in negotiating a political, racial, and geographic balance, but made little attempt to achieve a gender balance. He has assembled a team with some strengths, but too many weaknesses. The pity is that it could have been a dream team.
