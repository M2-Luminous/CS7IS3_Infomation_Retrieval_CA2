FR940318-2-00196 FR940318-2-00115 I. Settlement Conference As indicated above, the Postal Service has stated its intention to pursue a settlement in this case and has moved for a settlement conference pursuant to rule 29 of the Commission's rules of practice and procedure (39 CFR 3001.29). 3 A copy of this motion and a draft copy of the proposed Stipulation and Agreement have been mailed to every party who participated in the last general rate case (Docket No. R90&hyph;1). In support of its motion, the Service cites the relatively limited nature of this filing compared to previous requests; widespread expressions of interest in a settlement; and the potential for simplifying and expediting the case and saving significant expense. Statement and Motion at 2. In the interests of expedition, the Service suggests that the Commission allow the settlement to proceed on a parallel track with normal rate case procedures. 3 This was contained in a separate but related document entitled ``United States Postal Service Statement of Intention to Pursue Settlement and Motion for Settlement Conference'' which was filed along with the Service's Request on March 8, 1994. The Service asks the Commission to take several steps in furtherance of the proposed settlement proceedings. These encompass logistics and scheduling matters (including a relatively early date for the first conference); expedited public notice of the conference and of information on obtaining the Service's proposed Stipulation and Agreement; and appointment of the Postal Service as coordinator. Ruling on the Settlement Motion Given the Service's representations about the degree of interest in a settlement, and the feasibility of proceeding on parallel tracks, the Commission grants the Service's motion for early scheduling of an off-the-record initial settlement conference. The conference will be held on March 24, 1994 in the Commission's hearing room at 1333 H Street NW., Washington, DC 20268&hyph;0001 beginning at 9:30 a.m. We also grant the Postal Service's request that it serve as settlement coordinator. The coordinator will be expected to provide a meaningful opportunity for all interested participants to take part in the settlement proceedings. The Postal Service and other potential signatories should be aware that intervention will be allowed through April 6, 1994, and that all intervenors will be given an adequate opportunity to provide comments concerning any proposed settlement. As the Service indicates, announcing the settlement conference in this Notice will foreclose those who have not already intervened from an opportunity to respond to the instant motion. Although we are reluctant to forgo the possibility of hearing from a full spectrum of the mailing public, the factors cited by the Postal Service lead us to agree that an expedited decision on the Service's motion is in the best interests of the general public. These factors include the limited nature of this rate filing, the potential savings in time and expense, and the likelihood that immediately scheduling a settlement conference on the terms outlined above will facilitate careful review of the proposal without delaying or otherwise limiting participants' ability to respond to the Postal Service's request should settlement not be effectuated. II. Procedural Aspects of Docket No. R94&hyph;1 As indicated above, initiation of settlement negotiations does not foreclose the Commission from planning procedural aspects of the ``rate case track''. The following material addresses certain procedural matters and alerts interested parties to a proposed procedural schedule (reproduced as Attachment B.) The latter is published with the understanding that settlement negotiations may overtake some of the deadlines and/or actions listed. Intervention: Full, Limited and Commenter Status In line with its obligations under 39 U.S.C. 3624, the Commission intends to hold hearings on the Service's proposal to the extent required by law and consistent with its rules of practice. Any person wishing to be heard in this matter or to participate as a party in the hearings should file a written notice of intervention with the Secretary of the Commission on or before April 6, 1994. Notices must conform to §3001.20 of the Commission's rules of practice (39 CFR 3001.20). The Commission directs specific attention to §3001.20(b) which provides that notices of intervention shall affirmatively indicate whether the intervenor intends to participate actively in the hearings. Persons interested in limited participation who do not wish to become full intervenors may, on or before April 6, 1994 file a written notice of intervention as a limited participator pursuant to §3001.20a of the Commission's rules of practice (39 CFR 3001.20a). In addition, persons wishing to express their views informally, in a capacity other than a party or limited participant, may file comments pursuant to §3001.20b of the Commission's rules (39 CFR 3001.20b). Informal comments may be filed at any time. Active participation in settlement negotiations is conditioned on intervention as either a full or limited participant. Representation of the General Public The Commission designates W. Gail Willette, Acting Director of the Commission's Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA), as the representative of the general public in this proceeding, including authorized settlement negotiations. Ms. Willette will direct the activities of Commission personnel assigned to assist her and, at an appropriate time, will provide the names of these employees for the record. Neither she nor the assigned personnel will participate in or advise as to any Commission decision in this proceeding. 4 4 See 39 CFR 3001.8. Service on the OCA Parties shall serve the OCA separately with three copies of all filings in addition to, and simultaneously with, service on the Commission of the original and 24 copies required by 10(c) of the rules of practice (39 CFR 3001.10(c)). Discovery The Commission directs participants' attention to the provisions of §§3001.25, 3001.26, 3001.27 and 3001.28 of the rules of practice concerning discovery requests (39 CFR 3001.25, 3001.26, 3001.27 and 3001.28). The discovery process is an aspect of this proceeding the Commission is especially interested in expediting. In this regard, we point out that under rules of practice, interested parties may immediately obtain active status in this proceeding by filing a notice of intervention. Accordingly, all parties filing a notice may immediately engage in discovery of the Postal Service's direct case without any additional action by the Commission. In accord with the Commission's interest in expediting this case, parties are actively encouraged to begin discovery as soon as possible. To facilitate development of an orderly record, discovery requests should be addressed to a specific party and witness and numbered sequentially. For example, the Postal Service's sixteenth question concerning the testimony of the OCA's first witness should be identified as USPS/OCA&hyph;T1&hyph;16. Participants should identify filings as informatively as possible, including an indication of relief sought or the issue being addressed. Prehearing Conference An initial prehearing conference will be held on April 7, 1994. In accordance with the Commission's goal of expeditious consideration, the Commission will conduct all prehearing conferences and hearings en banc (39 CFR 3001.30(b)). Additional prehearing conferences will be scheduled if needed. Unless otherwise indicated, all conferences and hearings will begin at 9:30 a.m. in the Postal Rate Commission's hearing room, 1333 H Street NW., suite 300, Washington, DC 20268&hyph;0001. Hearings will be conducted on the record and transcribed by an official reporter, except where the presiding officer determines otherwise.
