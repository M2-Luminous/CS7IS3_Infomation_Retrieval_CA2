He said Friday's NATO ultimatum was a stepping up of pressure on the Serbs to abandon their war attempts and to allow the situation to be settled by diplomatic negotiation. A new element in the ultimatum, he said, was that it no longer referred to a single war area but was extended to all the other areas mentioned in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Another of the main themes of his talks was the role of Russia in contemporary Europe, Baudys said. The Czech Republic had to be interested in the question, because Russia was still a military superpower. They had talked about several features of Russian military doctrine, and Leotard had told him about his recent talks with Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev. None of the information recently spread in the Czech media that the smallpox virus had been stored in the Czech Republic had been shown to be correct, Baudys said. However, he admitted that a small quantity of the variola minor virus had been stored. Variola minor causes an illness which is very close to smallpox (variola maior), but which can have an easier course. Baudys said that the spreading of such information, which was not based on the truth and yet concerned the credibility of the state or created the impression of high insecurity was not proper.
