And the spectrum of opinions covers everything from advocating a complete deregulation of this activity, eliminating all controls and restraints, to a fear of any flexibility, and a rejection of even the most modest variants of self-employment. The wisest course of action is to look at the phenomenon in balanced terms. At a time of serious economic contraction, it is a palliative for employment difficulties; it can assure the population of goods and services and resolve myriad daily problems by using everyone's initiative. Furthermore, it represents an opportunity to relieve the state of some burdens. But we must not limit its raison d'etre to temporary problems alone. This type of employment is a new element that is being incorporated into the Cuban labor system, a feasible alternative that is part of the qualitative changes taking place in our economy. It is natural that Decree-Law 141, promulgated by the Council of State just five months ago to authorize self-employment, has raised many questions, and that its implementation has been a matter of trial and error, with many ups and downs. It is the course of events that dictates what procedures are to be followed and what changes need to be made. Because a decree, in and of itself, cannot account for reality. More than 137,000 Cubans are already working for themselves in more than 100 occupations, ranging from plasterer to musical instrument tuner, from palm tree trimmer to potter. It is an inescapable reality that brings new questions: How can this movement, which is elbowing its way into the Cuban economy, be guided correctly? How far will it go? What are its vulnerable sides? How does it fit into the collectivist, socializing approach that has predominated in our society? The first thing we must do is convince ourselves that, economically, politically, and socially speaking, this labor variant is by no means alien to our socialist formula, and can in fact enrich it with a breath of fresh air that will not represent a course change. There is no reason to fear self-employment, and there is every reason to accept its advantages and challenges. Otherwise, we would have to give up and turn our backs on it, because it is easier to say no to something we are unable to accept. The question is how to accept it. The spirit of Decree-Law 141 comes through loud and clear when it describes the active role the territorial governments and the neighborhood structures known as popular councils are to play in the control and monitoring of this activity to make sure it does not go bad or become corrupt. Moral rectitude and social discipline should be premises of this decentralizing phenomenon. But we cannot remain focused on the mere purpose of the law. The initial experiences have shown us that it is in the places where this task has been undertaken with enthusiasm and conviction that the fewest distortions and abuses have occurred, and that the decree has been implemented with the fewest problems. It is essential that we distinguish the true self-employed worker, that man who, through his individual effort and striving, aspires to earn more than the average income, provided that he earns it by honest effort and clean business practices. He has nothing to do with the man who has stolen state property and, through tricks and dodges, thumbs his nose at the people's needs and shortages and displays his flashy greed, sometimes even refusing to accept the institutionalization of his status. This type of person generally does not register his business. We must vindicate the many honorable self-employed workers who are lumped together with unscrupulous speculators and wheeler-dealers. There is no denying that some self-employed workers have also gotten involved in shady deals. It is undeniable that at a time of severe shortages, when it is impossible for the state to guarantee the availability of raw materials and supplies, not everyone can resist the temptation to get hold of materials through dubious channels; but that is no excuse for people to blame the respectable occupation of self-employment. Throwing out the baby with the bath water is never a good idea. A decree is being considered that would levy fines for irregularities in the implementation of Decree-Law 141. A rigorous inspection system would be set up. The popular council is supposed to establish a monitoring system to accomplish this task, and to exert control over this activity. And naturally, we must put this phenomenon in perspective. Neither self-employment nor any of the other measures that are being taken are mere band-aids; and to the extent that our economy shows signs of recovery and production picks up, the state can gradually assume its role as balancer or supplier. Another regulating mechanism would be taxation and the control of self-employed workers' income. The tax that has been levied on their income is minuscule, but it is subject to increases as their income grows, just as it is everywhere else in the world. Income tax returns are one way of discovering malfeasance. But to be fair, it is not healthy to blame self-employment for the diversion of resources, although it can occur there, just as well as in any other segment of society. Theft must be neutralized at the time and place where it occurs; every problem must be solved wherever it arises. The self-employed should be subject to the same scrutiny as state workers, officials, or peasants. The only way this type of employment will smoothly fit into our economic environment is if it is born healthy, under the watchful eye of popular control and the discipline that the state must enforce. In this way alone will we be able to guarantee the right of honest people to make their living through self-employment.
