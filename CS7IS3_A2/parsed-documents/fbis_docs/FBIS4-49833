Provincial leaders Tian Fengshan, Ma Guoliang, Cong Fukui, and Yang Zhihai attended the meeting and made speeches. Pertinent departments of the provincial party committee and the provincial government have done a lot of painstaking work as quickly as possible and assigned, through rapid arrangement and research, the tasks of implementing the problems resolved by the state for the province. Tian Fengshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed out at the meeting: The whole province should reach a common understanding in regarding Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's major instructions and the problems resolved by him during this inspection tour of Heilongjiang as a major transition and opportunity for the province's reform, opening up, and economic development. Since the beginning of this year, leaders of the party and the state have listened to the reports on the province's reform and development situation delivered by the provincial party committee and the provincial government. Entrusted by comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji personally led responsible comrades of pertinent ministries and commissions of the state Heilongjiang Province to conduct investigations and help the province tackle a series of difficulties and problems. From the inspection tour itself and from the problems resolved by central leaders for the province, we can catch sight of the great concern over Heilongjiang by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, which will produce great influence on the province's production and development. Therefore, successfully implementing the important instructions given by Zhu Rongji and other central leading comrades and the major problems resolved by them for the province is by no means an ordinary work, but is really a great event of the province as a whole. These instructions will provide the province with an opportunity to accelerate development and will effect a major transition in our work. Tian Fengshan said: In implementing the important instructions given by central leading comrades and the problems resolved by them, the most important thing is to bring the province's work into line with the general pattern of the whole country and to accelerate the development of Heilongjiang in the course of continuously making contributions to the country. In doing research for the province's agricultural development, Comrade Zhu Rongji pointed out: "Heilongjiang is the largest grain base and a grain reserve base of a strategic significance in China. To feed Chinese people, we should depend on Heilongjiang." "There are at least 50 million mu of undeveloped land that can be reclaimed and 80 million mu of low-yield farmland that can be transformed." "If we invest 10 billion yuan in Heilongjiang, we can take 200,000 tonnes of soybean and several hundred thousand tonnes of corn every year, equal to an output value of some 10 billion yuan. With this, we can tackle eating problems for our descendants." All these aspirations and demands have been set forth from a strategic high plane of overall interest. Comrade Zhu Rongji also talked about the issues concerning the development of Daqing, concerning the rapid renovation of old industrial bases and the invigoration of large and medium-sized enterprises, concerning the expansion of opening up, foreign trade, and economic and technological cooperation, and concerning vigorous development of township and town enterprises. All these aspirations and demands have been set forth from the high plane of the overall interest and from the general economic pattern of the whole country. We should attend to these issues by proceeding from the overall situation of the country. In particular, it is a huge project to reclaim the 50 million mu of undeveloped land and to transform the 80 million mu of low-yield farmland. We should exert great efforts in this project and conscientiously plan, appraise, and carry it out. Achieving success in this project, we will not only make contributions to the state but also develop ourselves through the contributions. So is the case in other fields. Tian Fengshan pointed out: The most fundamental work for implementing the guidelines of the instructions on Heilongjiang's work given by Zhu Rongji and other central leading comrades and the important issues they have resolved is to further clarify our ideas for reform, development, and stability. On many occasions, Zhu Rongji talked about the "desire to probe more ideas for addressing the issues on Heilongjiang's development, reform, and stability." He also said: "It will not work for us to come here to spend a lot of money. Spending money cannot solve problems. We should explore an idea and unify thinking to solve problems." Concluding his inspection tour, he said that Heilongjiang should unify understanding of four issues. This actually indicated the direction of our future work. We should acquire a profound understanding of it and study and implement it in line with reality. Tian Fengshan pointed out: The most crucial point in implementing the guidelines of the instructions on Heilongjiang's work given by Zhu Rongji and other central leading comrades and the important issues they have resolved is to base ourselves and focus on our specific conditions. The party Central Committee and the State Council have attached great importance to Heilongjiang's development, understood our difficulties, and helped us address specific issues. They resolved not only extremely urgent issues but also issues on long-term development; resolved not only the key issues on industries but also issues on trades; and not only resolved issues on funds and projects but also provided policies. This will not only help us overcome the current difficulties and maintain provincewide economic and social stability but also help promote Heilongjiang's development. More importantly, it will play an important role in heightening our spirit and in helping us overcome difficulties, unify thinking, enhance our confidence, unite as one, and make Heilongjiang's work successful. It should be noted that the central authorities have indeed helped Heilongjiang address many issues, but it is our own efforts we should rely on to ultimately solve problems and achieve development. We must enhance the sense of urgency and responsibility and seize the favorable opportunity provided by Vice Premier Zhu's inspection in our province to conscientiously work to promote Heilongjiang's economic and social development. Tian Fengshan emphasized: We should establish and institute the strict responsibility system characterized by division of work among leaders, pay close attention to implementation of the responsibilities, and achieve real good results. After several days of work, we have sorted out our problems and roughly divided them into three categories. In the first category are the issues the state have explicitly agreed to resolve totally or partly or those it has the intention to resolve. Whether these issues can be resolved is the key to whether we can seize the opportunity and achieve the greatest results. Particularly regarding the issues toward which principles and attitude have been provided but specific and clear guidance is still lacking, we should exert efforts to make these issued resolved to the maximum. In the second category are issues that the state agreed to further study and coordinate efforts to resolve or those which cannot be resolved for the time being due to lack of necessary conditions and should be considered in the future. Regarding these issues, we should submit reports to strive for their resolution. Our reports should be based on reason and just grounds and should be accurate, and we should do this work faster and include these issues in the issues to be resolved by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji so as to make our work easier. In the third category are the opinions and demands we put forward which the various ministries and commissions of the state did not agree or toward which they have yet to take a stand. If, in this category, there are issues conducive to Heilongjiang's development and also not harmful to the overall interests, we should strive for state assistance to resolve them. In particular, we must never give up the issues which the ministries and commissions said would decide depending on the situation in the second half of this year or in the future. We should foster confidence, approach from a long-term point of view, and do solid work to enjoy the support of the state. Although some of the problems have not been mentioned in our reports except for the problems of these three categories, the departments concerned should pay full attention to the petroleum, coal, grain, war, forest industries' problems in deepening reform, reducing the staff, improving efficiency, and developing the tertiary industry as well as the problems relating to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupation, and fishery, as set forth by Vice Premier Zhu and the state ministry and committee leaders; and strive to make achievements in solving these problems through investigations and study, coordination, and proof. Tian Fengshan pointed out: It is necessary to persist in the principle that whoever is in charge should assume responsibility. The leading cadres at various levels must personally organize forces to engage in the work assigned to them, personally "run around to departments," and specifically and meticulously fulfill their work. On no account must the activities of not putting the work in place, not assuming responsibility, shifting responsibility onto others, and even practicing bureaucracy bring about losses to work. We should concentrate time and energy and go all out to grasp our work. We should be sure to create conditions if there are no conditions and to be good at using conditions if there are any. Work must not, in the slightest degree, be put off. All fronts should make concerted efforts and positively work in coordination with one another. As for the problems relating to two or more departments , all departments should exchange views with one another and go into action in a coordinate manner. Provincial-level leaders and responsible comrades of relevant departments should take command in solving the problems if the situation needs. What we should particularly stress is that no departments are allowed to substitute the departmental interests for the interests of the whole or to shift responsibilities onto others. We should carry out the work perseveringly through to the end; strive to make achievements; ensure that there must be assured sources, results, and echoes of handling problems; and not give up halfway. In regard to the province's tasks in 1994, Tian Fengshan stressed: Persistently focusing the overall economic work on increasing economic results is not only an urgent ask at present but also a long-term strategic task. We must rely on not only the improvement of the macroeconomic environment but also the enterprises' efforts to strengthen the microeconomy. Therefore, persistently on the basis of the existing effective methods, the province as a whole should adopt all realistic measures to improve economic results. At the beginning of the year, the province made arrangements for industrial production. We should continue to grasp the implementation of the arrangements. So far, two aspects must be stressed. One is to create external environments for enterprises and to give them more assistance. The other is to positively guide the enterprises to turn their eyes inward, build up their internal strength, and concentrate more energy on reform, transformation, and management. In regard to agriculture, we should comprehensively grasp agriculture and the rural work in line with the idea of large- scale agriculture and lay particular stress on tightening up fists to grasp spring sowing. The most realistic measure for increasing production is to do farm work in the right season. The most important task at present is to grasp spring sowing. We will gain the initiative in doing the work of the whole year when we win a victory in this battle. Therefore, the people from higher levels downward, particularly relevant departments and all prefectures, counties, and townships, should concentrate this period of time to grasp spring sowing and go to the forefront of spring sowing to conduct investigations and study, grasp the situation, and solve problems. Of course, the arrangements and distributions of the leadership forces and work forces should be scientific and reasonable. In particular, we should make a unified arrangement for developing town and township enterprises and the county-level economy and positively promote their development. Although greater achievements have been made in the past years, we are still confronted with big difficulties. We should exert efforts to grasp the study of countermeasures and explore new cooperation forms and cooperation spheres. A prominent issue at present is to concentrate efforts on making well prepared for the fifth Harbin border trade and local economic talks. The province as a whole should regard the talks as a motive force in improving the foreign economic and trade work to a new level. In commodity circulation, we should organize the sources of goods in a down-to-earth manner; ensure goods supply for festive periods; stabilize the markets; make things convenient for the mass; and make the economy prosperous. Efforts should be made to accelerate and push forward the reform in the circulation field. It is particularly necessary to continuously concentrate efforts on having state-owned commercial and service enterprises, enterprises owned by the state but run by individuals, and wholesale enterprises change their track and style so as to enable the circulation field to further become brisk. As for security and fire prevention work, various localities and departments should attach great importance on them; strictly enforce the responsibility system; implement the measures of being on guard; and realistically do a good job in preventing fires among forest zones, urban areas, and coal mines as well as in stressing safe production chiefly among construction and installation enterprises. Tian Fengshan emphatically pointed out in concluding his speech: A good job should be further done in the work of keeping stable. Maintaining the stability represents an important content of creating a whole situation in the work undertaken by the entire party this year. Without political stability and social peace, we are in no position to carry out reform, opening up, and development. First, we should emphatically do a good job in dealing with the hot problems for which the masses have shown concern. In line with the demand set by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, we should make unified arrangement in the anticorruption struggle; continuously and successfully grasp the struggle; and score marked results in the struggle so as to win the people's trust. We should adopt an earnest attitude toward the problems of markets and commodity prices. Relaxing the restriction on the marketing prices of many commodities does not mean to cancel the macro control over prices. In particular, we should resolutely bring under control the prices of the people's necessities, such as grains, vegetables, and nonstaple foodstuffs. Efforts should be made to realistically enhance the comprehensive management of public security and to deal heavy blows in a timely manner at serious crimes. Second, a good job should be realistically done in dealing with the problems of production and livelihood of staff members and workers, which have encountered by enterprises that are in the state of production suspension or semi suspension. We should enhance the work of handling the petition letters from the mass and receiving the petition visits paid by the people and realistically assume the responsibility in the work. This represents the important work of maintaining the stability and the concrete expression of the party in fulfilling its purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. Third, a good job should be done in stabilizing the work undertaken by higher educational institutions. While enhancing the positive education, attention should be paid to adopting multiple forms suitable to the youth characteristics so as to lead youths to concentrate their efforts on showing concern for reform, modernizations, and studies. Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered a speech at the meeting, in which he pointed out: Efforts should be made to seize the historical opportunity and to broaden the opening up. Units from top to bottom across the province should unify their thinking, heighten their spirit, and be reliant or become strong independently. To turn the factors that are restricting the province's development into strong points, cadres at all levels should train hard in their professional skills; truly grasp study and do practical deeds for their work; and carry forward the spirit of making all-out efforts. They should fulfill the target harbored by them, turn the concerns shown by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council into motive forces, and be worthy of the great trust the 36 million people place in them. In line with the demand of seizing the opportunity, various departments should vigorously grasp the implementation of tasks; broaden the achievements; make a breakthrough in key areas; and achieve overall progress. Cadres at all levels should improve their work style, be vigorously willing to go down to grass-roots level units, and commonly make efforts with these units to improve the work as soon as possible. Vice Governor Cong Fukui also delivered a speech at the meeting, in which he pointed out: Various localities should do a good job in relaying and implementing the work arrangements recently made by the provincial party committee and the provincial people's government. They should actively make concerted efforts in relaying and implementing the arrangements and start the implementation of these arrangements as soon as possible so as to enable every work arrangement to be in place at an early date.
