Their departure marked a temporary close to the efforts dealing with the aftermath of the accident. On 31 March, a fire broke out on the "Hairui" pleasure boat in Chunan County, Zhejiang Province. All 32 people aboard the boat -- 24 Taiwan tourists, two guides, and six crew members -- were killed. Over the past few days, officials of Hangzhou city, Zhejiang Province, in charge of dealing with the aftermath had several discussions with relatives of the Taiwan victims on the cremation of the bodies. Taking into account the wishes of the victims' relatives and the customs of Taiwan, the departments concerned did their best in making the most appropriate arrangements. On the afternoon of 6 April, all the bodies of the dead Taiwan compatriots were placed in coffins, and the 24 coffins were immediately shipped to a funeral parlor in Tonglu County. The remains of the dead Taiwan compatriots were cremated yesterday morning. At about 0900, some 50 relatives of the victims held a memorial service in Tonglu for the deceased. Afterward, they bowed to the employees of the funeral parlor and to the personnel in charge of handling the aftermath to express their gratitude. Possessions left behind by the deceased which had been recovered so far were claimed by the victims' relatives. Lin Weiyang, deputy manager of Taiwan's Changfeng Tourist Agency and who took part in the handling of the remains from beginning to end, said that he was satisfied with the assistance offered to the victims' relatives by the relevant provincial and city authorities. He told reporters: "The mainland authorities in charge of dealing with the aftermath have done what they could. We all did our best, and the rest remains in the hands of God. May the deceased soon rest in peace." Zhejiang Vice Governor Liu Xirong made two special trips -- on the day of the Qingming Festival [5 April] and today before the relatives' departure -- to meet the victims' relatives and to express his condolences. On behalf of the provincial and city governments, he expressed profound condolences and heartfelt sympathy to the victims' relatives. He said: "We all are people of Chinese descent. The sorrow of Taiwan compatriots is our sorrow, and their consolation is our consolation. Please convey my regards to the other relatives back in Taiwan."
