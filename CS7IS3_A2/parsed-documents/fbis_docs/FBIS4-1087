He was welcomed at the airport by Governor Paulo Jorge, members of the provincial government, and traditional and religious leaders. Moco spoke to newsmen at the airport about the aim of his visit, noting that peace could be achieved soon. [passage omitted] [Begin Moco recording] The aim of our visit is of utmost importance. I could even say that we are going to make Benguela the capital of central and southern Angola. I intend to meet the governors of Benguela, Cuanza Sul, Huambo, Huila, and Bie Provinces to discuss the consequences of the war waged against the Angolan people throughout the country. The war has had a significant impact on this part of the country. At a meeting I held with his excellency the president of the Republic we assessed a number of issues that were raised at the recent meetings he held with traditional authorities. We realize that there are serious problems affecting war-displaced persons, and the transport sector. Although most districts are in government hands, bandit action prevents free movement to the various regions, causing terrible suffering for the people. So, that is one of the issues we will discuss. We have brought some suggestions. [passage omitted] My visit will serve to convey an important message for the residents of Benguela, and obviously for all Angolan people. That is, it is possible that we are on the threshold of peace. But we, Angolans, have already learned a lot. We ought to prepare the ground so that peace will not turn its back on the Angolan people again, as is the case right now. Every structure, ministries, and provincial organs... [pauses] Although it has been reported that ministerial portfolios and provinces will be given to UNITA representatives, that should not mean a return to confusion, insubordination, disregard for human rights as we saw before the elections. But we should not be too theoretical. We need to create the necessary conditions. During my visit we will discuss this aspect at length with officials and even with the people. So, we ought to create mechanisms so that peace will never turn its back on the Angolan people who have suffered dearly from actions by those who are not interested in true peace. Those are the aims of my visit to Benguela. [end recording] [passage omitted]
