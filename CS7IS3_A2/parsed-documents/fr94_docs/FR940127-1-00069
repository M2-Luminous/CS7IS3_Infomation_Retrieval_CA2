FR940127-1-00069 FR940127-1-00018 In 1992, the agency received 105,945 ADR reports. The majority of the reports (88 percent) were sent by manufacturers, while the remaining 12 percent were sent directly to FDA by health professionals or consumers. Of all the ADR reports received by the agency, 22,704 were considered serious. FDA believes that these figures represent only a fraction of the serious adverse events encountered by health care providers. A recent review article found that between 3 and 11 percent of hospital admissions could be attributed to adverse drug reactions (Ref. 1). Only about 1 percent of serious events are reported to FDA, according to one study (Ref. 2). Another study states that reporting rates in the United States are apparently lower than those in some other countries (Ref. 3). The majority of studies that have investigated the occurrence of adverse drug events in hospitalized patients estimate that from 10 to 20 percent of all patients will experience an adverse drug event while hospitalized (Ref. 4). Upon receipt of the ADR report, the agency enters the information into its computerized data base of all ADR reports, the spontaneous reporting system (SRS). Every report of a serious adverse reaction is evaluated for its potential significance. The agency determines whether similar incidences were reported in the SRS, the temporal relationship between the administration of the drug and the reaction, possible confounding factors, and other information related to the adverse event. In many cases, follow-up information is requested from the reporter or the manufacturer. Because of resource constraints, the agency often relies on the manufacturer to screen the ADR reports and conduct any necessary follow-up by contacting the reporter. For this reason, similar or identical reports of adverse drug events will be in the possession of both FDA and individual drug manufacturers. Information provided by voluntary reports from health professionals alerted FDA that the recently approved antibiotic temafloxacin (Omniflox) was associated with a serious type of anemia. Because of the severity of the risk associated with this drug, which became apparent only after the product was approved and used in larger numbers of patients, it was removed from the market. ADR reporting from health professionals also prompted FDA to undertake research that showed that a fatal reaction could occur when the antihistamine terfenadine (Seldane) is taken in combination with the antifungal ketoconazole (Nizoral) or with the antibiotic erythromycin. Drug interactions also reflect the fact that individual variability in drug metabolism can account for significant differences in patient response. Such response differences make well-designed postmarketing studies and health care provider observations and reports especially important. Other examples of FDA actions prompted by ADR reports include: The alert that serious liver damage may be associated with labetalol, a drug for high blood pressure; the recall of the nonnarcotic pain relieving drug zomepirac (Zomax), after reports that it may cause a severe allergic reaction that can result in death; the alert that the use of the antibiotics in the fluoroquinolone class and the anticoagulant warfarin may result in increased blood clotting time, which can lead to hemorrhage; and the recent boxed warning and alert to health professionals regarding the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. 2. Devices Postmarketing surveillance of the safety of devices depends on the success of both required and voluntary systems of reporting. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94&hyph;295) (the 1976 amendments) (21 U.S.C. 360i) and the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;629) (the SMDA) (21 U.S.C. 360i(e)), and regulations thereunder, require manufacturers and distributors of devices to submit reports to FDA, within a specific timeframe, of deaths and serious injuries related to certain devices and of malfunctions. The SMDA also requires device user facilities, such as hospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient treatment centers, to report to FDA and the manufacturer, within a certain timeframe, information that reasonably suggests that a device has or may have caused a death. Device user facilities also are required to report to the manufacturer, or to FDA if the manufacturer is unknown, information that reasonably suggests that a device has caused, or may have caused, or may have contributed to a serious illness or serious injury. Since 1973, the agency has maintained a voluntary device problem reporting program. Last year, about 4,500 reports were voluntarily submitted to this program, in addition to the statutorily required reports from manufacturers, distributors, and user facilities. Both the voluntary and the statutorily required reporting systems for devices, as with those for drugs, ultimately depend on the willingness of the individual health care professionals to submit reports. In 1991, voluntary reporting led the agency to alert health professionals to a potentially fatal hypersensitivity to latex products. In addition, through the voluntary reporting system, FDA learned of increased numbers of deaths associated with physical patient restraints, often used by hospitals and nursing homes to restrain patients. Based on these reports and other information, FDA has restricted patient restraint devices to prescription use only and has taken steps to ensure proper labeling to prevent deaths and injuries. After receiving a report by a physician about two patients who experienced blindness after the physician's use of an ophthalmic device during eye surgery, FDA investigated the manufacturer and initiated a recall to remove these devices from the market. In some areas, however, inadequate reporting has fostered delays in detecting problems. One example is silicone breast implants. Although these devices had been on the market for over 30 years, only in recent years had evidence begun to accumulate about their possible association with autoimmune-like disorders. Had the agency received reports from health care providers when they initially observed these disorders in patients with breast implants, the agency could have assessed this possible association at an earlier date.
