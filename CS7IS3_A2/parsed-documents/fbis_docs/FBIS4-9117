In an official statement -- TANJUG received a copy of the text -- Karadzic said that "the Serbian side is ready for talks, but only on the basis of equality." "This means that the international community must make a step forward in connection with the sanctions, imposed on the entire Serbian nation, before any talks could start," stressed Karadzic. He specified that the international community must ensure that this time the Muslims negotiate with good intentions. The Muslim military offensives will no longer be tolerated and the Serbs will respond to them with resolve. In this context Karadzic reiterated that the Muslims caused the latest clashes by launching an offensive from Gorazde a month ago and that "they remembered Gorazde was a safe area only when they suffered a setback in their offensive." The international community should have inquired what a Muslim army division in full combat gear was doing in a safe area, said Karadzic. In order for an "agreement to be likely," as suggested by Hurd, the international community ought to "stop playing the Muslim game of war and peace" and it must oppose the Muslim right to veto every peace plan which had already been agreed with the European Union and the United Nations. "The international community ought to make it quite clear to the Muslims that their impossible ambition to control the entire Bosnia, as a method of sabotaging peace, will not longer be tolerated," said Karadzic. "Peace will come to Bosnia only when the international community accepts the obvious truth that the Serbs have the right to self-determination just like the other ethnic communities," said Karadzic, concluding that "immoral and totally counterproductive sanctions and threats of force cannot conceal this obvious truth."
