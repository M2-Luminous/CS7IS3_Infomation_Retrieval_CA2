The orders received in industry, the expectations of the entrepreneurs, and gradually also the production activity have improved. In the first quarter, building trade developed clearly more positively than expected, above all because of high growth rates in housing construction. These were the results of the latest economic inquiry by the Economic Research Institute (WIFO). However, the economic development, which has been good, as compared with Austria's most important trade partners, resulted in major increases in imports. As compared with European countries, particularly the most important trading partners, the economic development was relatively favorable in the first quarter of 1994, the WIFO report says. Industrial production picked up and increased by 2.9 percent, as compared with the same quarter last year. In the first quarter, all exports increased by 5.4 percent in nominal terms, as compared with last year, while imports increased by a total of 9.5 percent. The interviews of entrepreneurs as part of the economic inquiry provided an optimistic picture. The assessment of the orders on hand has clearly improved. The number of enterprises with free capacities is continuously decreasing. An increasing number of enterprises expects a further stimulation in the second quarter. According to WIFO, the trend of a slow decrease in the inflation rate is continuing. The consumer price index in April increased by 3 percent. The cost of housing and the services sector continue to force an increase in prices.
