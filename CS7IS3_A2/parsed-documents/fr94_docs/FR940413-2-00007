ACTION: Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review. SUMMARY: On December 3, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on sweaters wholly or in chief weight of man-made fiber from Korea. The review covers 69 manufacturers/exporters and the period April 27, 1990 through August 31, 1991. We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on our preliminary results. Based on our analysis of the comments received we have changed the results from those presented in the preliminary results of review. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elisabeth Urfer, G. Leon McNeill, or Maureen Flannery, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;4733. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On September 24, 1990, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (55 FR 39036) the antidumping duty order on sweaters wholly or in chief weight of man-made fiber (MMF sweaters) from Korea. On September 30, 1991, the petitioner, the National Knitwear & Sportswear Association (NKSA), requested that we conduct an administrative review, in accordance with section 353.22(a) of the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.22(a)). We published the notice of initiation of the antidumping duty administrative review on October 18, 1991 (56 FR 52254), covering the period April 27, 1990 through August 31, 1991. On December 3, 1993 the Department published the preliminary results in the Federal Register (58 FR 63920). The initiation notice named 69 companies. Of these 69 companies, the following six companies were selected to be analyzed, using sampling techniques: Chunji Industrial Company, Ltd. (Chunji), Kee Ryung Industrial Company, Ltd. (Kee Ryung), Suhcheon Company, Ltd. (Suhcheon), Tae Kwang Industrial Company, Ltd. (Tae Kwang), Young Woo & Company, Ltd. (Young Woo), and Yurim Company, Ltd. (Yurim). The other companies included in the sample pool have received a rate which is the simple average of the margins of these six companies. The Department has now conducted the review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). Scope of the Review Imports covered by this review are shipments of MMF sweaters from Korea. MMF sweaters are defined as garments for outerwear that are knitted or crocheted, in a variety of forms including jacket, vest, cardigan with button or zipper front, or pullover, usually having ribbing around the neck, bottom, and cuffs on the sleeves (if any), encompassing garments of various lengths, wholly or in chief weight of man-made fiber. The term ``in chief weight of man-made fiber'' includes sweaters where the man-made fiber material predominates by weight over each other single textile material. This excludes sweaters 23 percent or more by weight of wool. It includes men's, women's, boys', or girls' sweaters, as defined above, but does not include sweaters for infants 24 months of age or younger. It includes all sweaters as defined above, regardless of the number of stitches per centimeter, provided that, with regard to sweaters having more than nine stitches per two linear centimeters horizontally, it includes only those with a knit-on rib at the bottom.
