While meeting with National People's Congress deputies from Hainan, Gansu and Henan Provinces, Jiang emphasized the importance of proceeding from specific local conditions and accelerating China's economic growth in a "down-to-earth" manner. "China has a huge population, vast territories and uneven economic development between different regions," said Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee. He said that the state will take effective measures to narrow the economic gap between the coastal areas and the central and western regions. While the state increases assistance for central and western regions, developed areas should try to help underdeveloped regions, he noted. The leader called on officials and people in central and western regions to catch up with developed regions through self-reliance. "Our goal is to achieve common development and prosperity," he said. He also emphasized the importance of paying close attention to unity in areas inhabited by people of various minority nationalities. He called on people of all nationalities to hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism and work hard for the prosperity of the Chinese nation.
