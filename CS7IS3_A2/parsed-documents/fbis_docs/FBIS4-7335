Vassalo Anthony Joseph, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Malta, in a letter to the president of the UN General Assembly April 3 urged him to show deep interest in the resumption of DPRK-USA talks and pay due attention to the challenging act of the United States in unilaterally foiling the third round of DPRK-USA talks. The letter strongly urged that the United States should withdraw all its military hardware including nuclear weapons and troops from South Korea and stop any manner of interference in the internal affairs of Korea including military action. Amaral Matos, first secretary of the Maputo City Committee of the Mozambique Liberation Front Party, in a statement April 11 said the United States could never frighten Korea although it was putting unreasonable pressure on it in conspiracy with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The statement warned that if the United States continue to resort to pressure on Korea with an anachronistic daydream, it would sustain a more ignominious defeat and meet with condemnations from the world people. The Polish League of Communists "Proletariat" in a statement April 9 denounced the United States' hostile Korea policy aimed at isolating and stifling the DPRK and expressed full support to the recent steps taken by the DPRK with regard to the "nuclear issue" and to its stand manifested in them.
