Diplomats Express Views on Caucasian Topics"] [Text] Yerevan -- The ambassadors of Russia, the United States, and Iran accredited to Yerevan have expressed their views on events in the Transcaucasus in the parliamentary newspaper RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA under the headline "Bermuda Triangle or Scope for Accord?" Vladimir Stupishin, leader of Russia's diplomatic mission, states: "All the new foreign countries, and not just the Transcaucasus, are an area of priority attention for Russia. The Transcaucasus as a whole, and Armenia in particular, occupy their own historically determined place in the new community (CIS), where Russia is not the older brother, let alone the imperial center, but is a partner on an equal footing and even an ally in military-political questions. All Russia's actions and efforts here can only be of a purely peaceful political nature." In the opinion of U.S. Ambassador Harry Gilmore, his country "upholds the independence and territorial integrity of every Caucasian state. In this regard the United States is opposed to the influence of any country on another independent country." While his Iranian counterpart Ahmad Sobhani considers that "It must be borne in mind that the Caucasus should not become a platform for launching an attack on others. All countries should support the independence of the Caucasus and respect the opinion of the peoples of the region." Asked how he perceives the resolution of the ethnic and territorial conflicts in the former Union, the Russian ambassador replied: "They need to be tackled on the basis of the generally accepted principles and norms of international law and, as far as possible, through our own means within the framework of the CIS mechanism and on a bilateral basis." Russia is ready to assume "a mediating role." Furthermore, "practice shows that no one, apart from Russia, is ready today to shoulder the peacemaking burden in the area of the former USSR." For his part, Ambassador Gilmore considers that confrontation "must be peacefully resolved by the governments of those states on the basis of the criteria adopted by the United Nations and the CSCE and international laws." And the opinion of the Iranian ambassador in Armenia is that "When disagreements emerge it is the actual parties who should first and foremost seek way of conciliation. When conflicts deepen, surrounding countries are naturally bound to show disquiet. The potential of mediators should also be taken into account." The diplomats' answers to a question about Armenia's likely foreign policy priorities are very interesting. Vladimir Stupishin: "Objectively, historical development has been such that Russia and Armenia have many common interests in all spheres of life concerning the state and the people, and spiritual kinship, common cultural values, and a joint history exist between our peoples." Harry Gilmore: "I think that the three peoples of the Caucasus form a bridge between Europe and Asia. I personally hope that Armenia's gaze will turn in every direction." Ahmad Sobhani: "The Caucasus should establish constructive relations and seek sources of cooperation everywhere."
