There were some prominent contradictions in industrial operations, however. For example, growth of state-owned enterprises only accounted for 6.6 percent of the national industrial production growth, while 93.4 percent of the growth was made by non-state-owned enterprises (including collective enterprises in urban and rural areas, private enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises). The state-owned enterprises, which produced 50 percent of the mainland's output value, almost lost their role as the locomotive of the economy, and this was certainly a major problem for China's economy. The declining economic efficiency of state-owned industrial enterprises was primarily reflected in the facts of declining profits, increasing losses, the shortage of funds, and the accumulation of debts. According to official statistics, in the first two months of this year, 370,000 industrial enterprises at and above the township level incurred losses totaling 17.6 billion yuan, an increase of 5 percent over that in the same period of last year, and 40.7 percent of the state-owned enterprises incurred losses, twice as much as those among non-state-owned enterprises. Triangular debts that the enterprises owe the banks and each other exceeded 300 billion yuan. There are currently more than 14,000 large state-owned enterprises in China, and they account for only 3.9 percent of the total number of industrial enterprises; however, their assets account for 46 percent of the industry in the mainland, and the profits they handed over to the state account for approximately 67 percent. They have always constituted the main force of the mainland's economy, the backbone of the national economy, and the primary source of the state's financial revenue. Therefore, the state-owned enterprises hold a decisively important position. At present, however, some 40 percent of the large and medium state-owned enterprises on the Chinese mainland are running in the red, and the situation is rather serious. In Liaoning Province, the country's major heavy industrial base with a large number of state- owned enterprises, in recent years, nearly half (46.2 percent) of the state-owned enterprises have been running in the red, and nearly 700,000 workers could not receive their wages on time. The situation of Heilongjiang Province, another major heavy industrial base, was even worse. The large and medium enterprises in Harbin have failed to pay a total of 1.3 billion yuan of debts that are due, and still owe debts totalling 6.3 billion yuan. Some enterprises have been mired in a state of suspended or semi- suspended operation. In the authorities of the mainland, there are different opinions on how to carry out reform in those state-owned enterprises that have lost their vigor. Some people maintain that financial input to such enterprises should be increased appropriately in order to support the state's basic industries and the high and new technology industries; otherwise, some trouble may occur. Other people maintain that increasing investment and financial subsidies to enterprises which have been running in the red for a long time would only be a waste of resources and would achieve no result in creating new productive forces; moreover, it would increase the government's financial deficit and become a major burden on the government. The problems with the state-owned enterprises, which have not adopted the market mechanism, cannot be solved by increasing financial input; instead, the problems must be solved through enterprise reform and through the establishment of the social insurance system, the property right transaction system, the debt settlement system, and the mechanism for keeping the good and eliminating the bad. Therefore, many experts proposed that the enterprises running in the red be auctioned through property rights transactions, that mergers be allowed between enterprises and individuals within the mainland, and that foreign investors be allowed to buy and run such enterprises. At the same time, it is necessary to set up the debt settlement system and the system for laying off workers and to allow enterprises running in the red to apply for bankruptcy; thus, the state-owned enterprises can actually play the role of the locomotive of industrial production after those that have lost vigor are eliminated. It is said that Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of the financial and economic work, agreed to adopt measures to "resurrect" the loss-incurring enterprises and called this "rising again like a phoenix from the ashes." He said: Going bankrupt does not mean that the workers will not be taken care of. In the course of reorganizing the property rights of the enterprises after bankruptcy, workers will live on social insurance, and part of the money from the auctions will be used to help the workers. After the enterprises are reinvigorated, the banks can also recover the money. Bankruptcy cannot proceed too quickly, however, because this may cause social unrest. At least one enterprise may go bankrupt in one county. This mechanism may be adopted on a trial basis so that all factory directors will be under pressure and will not dare spend public money on sightseeing trips. They will have to discharge their responsibilities as factory directors or they could lose their jobs! At the same time, Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, said that, over a period of three to five years, the large and medium state-owned enterprises will be pushed to the market in groups so that they will be tested by market forces, with the good being kept and the bad being eliminated. Chen said that 30 percent of the present state-owned enterprises were vigorous and dynamic in their operation and would be able to survive in the market, and 20 percent of the enterprises would fail and would have to be closed down, suspended, merged, shifted to production in other fields, or leased, contracted, auctioned, or taken over by foreign investors. The remaining 50 percent of the enterprises will find a way out only through transforming the operational mechanism and adjusting the structure.
