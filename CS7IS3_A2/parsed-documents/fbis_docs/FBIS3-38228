Markets and economic activities are becoming more global at an increasingly fast rate. "Our national economic policies must be adjusted to these realities," said Jean-Pascal Delamuraz Thursday evening [27 January] at the opening of the 24th Davos Forum, in the company of Helmut Kohl and Nestle President Helmut Maucher. The [Swiss] Federal Council member felt that the current globalization is "the most striking" development of the late 20th century. The drawing together of human groups is, however, nothing new. "In fact it goes all the way back to man's discovery of flint," Mr. Delamuraz said. However, the pace at which the phenomenon is accelerating is unprecedented. "And we were not prepared for it," continued the head of the Federal Department of the Public Economy (DFEP). A firm or a market both tend to be attached to a given country. "Our economic policies are still largely geared toward this national perception." Rapid European Integration German Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed for a "quick paced" pursuit of European integration, five months before Germany takes over the EC presidency. He agreed with Mr. Delamuraz in stressing the need for increasing the convergence of the European states' national policies. "Only in this way will we obtain all the fruits of economic and monetary union," said Mr. Kohl, who was also in favor of increased openness in world trade. Support for the new democracies of East Europe must be renewed, continued the chancellor. The failure of the reforms would be catastrophic, whereas success would offer the only chance for peaceful coexistence in Europe. Bilateral Meetings A number of figures combined their trip to Switzerland for the Davos Forum with meetings with Swiss officials. Swiss President Otto Stich was to meet Thursday evening with Uzbek President Islam Karimov at the Lohn residence. Flavio Cotti, the head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE), met Thursday in Bern with Madagascar Prime Minister Francisque Ravony and in Kloten with Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen. 'Arafat in Bern On Thursday, the DFAE stressed the importance of the first meeting ever between Yasir 'Arafat, Otto Stich, and Flavio Cotti planned for Monday in Bern. In doing so, Switzerland is demonstrating its desire to continue making a contribution to an "irreversible" peace process. In the meantime, Flavio Cotti is to meet on Friday in Bern with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Mussa, and in Davos with his Israeli counterpart, Shim'on Peres. Mr. Peres and Mr. 'Arafat will hold talks in Davos, which will be the most awaited moment of the Forum. Mr. Delamuraz is to hold talks on Saturday in Davos with Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and European Commission Vice President Leon Brittan, and on Sunday with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Number of Participants Reaches Maximum Some 1,200 figures from politics, economics, the arts, and the sciences from more than 70 countries signed up for the 24th Forum on the world economy in Davos. They will be able to participate in some 500 sessions. The number of participants was limited and the number of journalists was restricted to 200. Among the figures expected to attend, Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who is not well, had to cancel her visit to Davos.
