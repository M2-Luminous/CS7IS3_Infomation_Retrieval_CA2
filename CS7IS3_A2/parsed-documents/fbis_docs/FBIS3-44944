Organized by local governments, many farmers living in the impoverished mountainous areas have left their homes and settled down in some fertile areas. Northern Guangdong is the poorest area in the province since it lies in karst areas where most land is dry and not arable. In sharp contrast with the province's coastal area, which is seeing brisk economic progress, about 200,000 people living in the north still did not have enough food and clothing in 1993. Since the beginning of 1993, the provincial government has started a large-scale migration in many villages and towns in the north, where the natural conditions are bad. "I'm glad to move," said Ye Shuisheng, a migrant farmer from a village in the north. "My home was two or three hours' walk from highways. It is even hard for bicycles to reach," Ye said. He said his village had no electricity and little arable land. His family had only 0.15 ha of dry land, which at most produced some 500 kg of sweet potatoes and 400 kg of grain a year. "We had no money to send our children to school," he said. Ye has moved to another town with over 60 other households from his village. The provincial government estimates that, by 1995, a total of 100,000 people in 45 towns in karst areas will voluntarily migrate to other, more fertile land. Local governments will provide migrant farmers with subsidies and arrange for residences and farmland for them. Up to now, the well-organized migration has achieved marked results. Half a year ago, 131 households moved into migration zones in Shantang town, Qingxin County. With 600 yuan (70 U.S. dollars) per capita in subsidy, they built houses and planted 50 ha of land. By the end of last year, they had reaped 250,000 kg of paddy, which equalled three years' harvest in their previous home places. Many farmers secured enough food within half a year. Now, several migration zones are being built in Qingxin County. Another successful example is Qingyuan city, which has built up 56 resident zones and will accommodate 90,000 migrant farmers by 1995. Besides settling farmers in towns around the city, the city government also encourages farmers to work in the urban area. Now, many farmers are engaging in manufacturing and service trades, not only improving their own living standards, but also promoting the local economy. Due to considerate arrangement by the local government, the migration is going smoothly. Some 35,000 people have moved out of the karst areas in the north of the province, among whom are more than 4,000 people of Yao nationality. Urban residents have given full support to the migration. In Qingyuan city, people have donated 2.6 million yuan (300,000 U.S. dollars) and 20,000 clothes items. In addition, many overseas Chinese are also offering aid to this project, among whom is Tsang Hin Chi, chairman of Goldlion Holdings Limited, who has donated three million yuan (350,000 U.S. dollars).
