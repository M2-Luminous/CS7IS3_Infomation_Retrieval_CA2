There, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee; Gu Erxiong, vice governor of the province; and responsible comrades of pertinent provincial-level departments were discussing with some 40 peasant households in Dongluobao and Datian villages the major event of making this year's cotton production a success and bringing about an upswing in cotton production, which has a bearing on the overall stability of the province. Cheng Weigao said straightly: "Hebei is a major cotton growing province. Cotton output declined in the past two years. This year, we are determined to bring about an upswing in cotton production. This year's cotton sowing is about to begin. So, I made a special trip here to see how you are prepared and what demands and problems you have." "Our village has grown cotton for many years. Last year, we planted more than 1,000 mu, and per-mu yield was about 60 kg. This year, we will again grow 1,000 mu of cotton," said Shi Juncheng, an old farmer. Gu Erxiong asked: "Last year, how much cotton did you grow, and how much did you earn?" Shi answered: "I planted two mu of cotton and gained some 1,300 yuan. After deducting the cost of seeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticide, the actual income is some 400 yuan." Cheng Weigao frankly chipped in: "Realistically speaking, what do you think about cotton growing on earth, and what other opinions and demands do you have?" Shi answered: "We communists do not tell a lie. So far as economic income is concerned, growing cotton is not as good as growing grain, still less good as growing other cash crops. In growing grain, we need less manpower but can gain 400 yuan from per mu. However, in growing cotton, we need 40 laborers but only gain 200 yuan." Gu Erxiong again asked farmers with great concern: "How much cotton has your county procured this year, and what is the market situation?" A comrade of the county supply and marketing cooperative replied: This year, our county has already procured 300 tonnes of cotton at both parity prices and negotiated prices. Because outside places and enterprises directly came here to purchase our cotton, about half of our cotton has been sold to other places. [passage omitted] After the discussion, Cheng Weigao said with feeling: Your counties have grown cotton for many years and most of your cotton has been sold to the state. You have done a very good job. We hope that you will have a clear sight of our province's overall situation and comprehend the concern of the CPC Central Committee and the state to cotton growers. In the past two years, Hebei Province witnessed a consecutive decline in cotton production. There have been not only natural factors, such as consecutive years of drought, but also policy factors, such as the low prices of cotton, and work factors, such as poor service. This year, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have made up their mind to bring about an upswing in cotton production. We should try our best to beef up cotton production. Party committees and governments at all levels should also mobilize peasants to grow cotton in full amount and in good quality in order to make contributions to the state and ensure the normal production of the province's textile industry. With regard to cotton sowing at present, Cheng Weigao stressed the necessity of ensuring cotton growing acreage, growing cotton on irrigated fields, expanding the acreage of cotton grown with plastic sheets, growing more transplanted cotton, choosing good seeds, and strengthening management in a bid to lay a good foundation for the high yield of cotton this year. Cheng Weigao said in conclusion: Dingxing County is only 90 km from Beijing and the transportation condition is good. However, the per capita income of the county was only 700 yuan last year, lower than the average level of the province. To fulfill the goal of making the people better-off in 1997, you are faced with a very arduous task. You should not only grow cotton well, but also accelerate the readjustment of rural industrial structure and the agricultural growing structure and vigorously develop township and town enterprises in a bid to increase peasants' income by a big margin. Cheng Weigao seriously said to Yan Zengnian, secretary of the party committee of Zhengding County, and Zheng Kaijun, head of the county: If you do a good job and attain the goal of making the people better-off in 1997, you will be commended; otherwise, you will be dismissed. County leaders expressed right away that they will certainly do a solid job to ensure the fulfillment of the goal. The firmness of county leaders and the concern of provincial leaders aroused warm applause then and there.
