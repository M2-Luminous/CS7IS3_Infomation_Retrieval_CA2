FBIS4-47990 "drafr089_c_94012" FBIS-AFR-94-089 Daily Report 8 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA NP Said `Fuming' Over Announcement of ANC Cabinet Ministers NP Said `Fuming' Over Announcement of ANC Cabinet Ministers MB0905072594 Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans 8 May 94 p 2 MB0905072594 Johannesburg RAPPORT Afrikaans BFN [Report by Karin Brynard] [Text] Mr. de Klerk's National Party [NP] is fuming at the manner in which the ANC announced its members for the new cabinet on Friday [6 May] afternoon. The new cabinet is also going to be the government of national unity. But the names of the ANC members and their portfolios was issued by the organization's department of information while ANC leader Mr. Nelson Mandela and De Klerk were locked in discussions on how the new cabinet should look. One senior NP spokesman now says that this unilateral gesture leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, and besides, Mr. Mandela has broken his word. He said that Mr. Mandela had indicated in an earlier discussion with Mr. de Klerk that one of the posts -- namely, that of minister of police services, would, for the sake of continuity, order and stability, be given to the NP. Now the ANC's Mr. Sydney Mufamadi has been given the post. Dignified Way The Nationalists said they were under the impression that Mr. Mandela, after his discussions regarding cabinet portfolios with Mr. de Klerk, as well as with Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom Party, would announce in a dignified fashion how the government of national unity would look. They believe that perhaps there was a breakdown in communications between the ANC leader and the organization's information department. Meanwhile, Mr. Mandela has said that the portfolios could always be reshuffled and that consultations between him and Mr. de Klerk were still in progress. As to who the NP members of the new cabinet are, speculation in this regard is still rife. It is virtually certain that Mr. Derek Keys will remain as minister of finance, this after the ANC had been considering -- until last week -- to appoint the first new deputy president, Mr. Thabo Mbeki, in this position. The Nationalists were annoyed, however, when the ANC indicated that Mr. Keys should stay on. They say it makes it appear as though he is an ANC man and not the NP's choice. The NP can appoint six members in the cabinet. Alongside Mr. Keys are the names of current Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer, who could be retained in the post; Dr. Dawie de Villiers; Mr. Kobie Coetsee; Mr. Leon Wessels, and Mr. Abe Williams. The NP will be able to appoint three deputy ministers and among the names mentioned are Chris Fismer and Tobie Meyer. Pik's Future Regarding Mr. Pik Botha's future, there has also been a lot of speculation. He said he was not intending to step out of politics even if he is not included in the new cabinet. RAPPORT was told that it is unlikely that he will be appointed minister. He also does not seem interested in a foreign post or a senior post such as chairman of the senate. It has been speculated for a while now that perhaps he intends spending just two more years in politics. It is expected that the full cabinet will be announced today or tomorrow. Senate Posts Meanwhile, there is a big scramble for senators' posts in NP ranks. The senate will have 90 seats -- 10 from each province. These are allocated proportionately according to the support of the parties, and a party must get at least 10 percent support in a province before it can appoint a senator. For the NP it means that it can appoint five in the Western Cape, four in the Northern Cape, one in KwaZulu/Natal, one in the Orange Free State and probably three on the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]. The stiffest competition is on the PWV where there are 29 suitable candidates. The biggest competition there is possibly between Dr. Rina Venter, the outgoing minister of national health; the former minister of trade and industry, Dr. Org Marais; and party officials such as Transvaal Secretary Dr. Gerhard Koornhof and Mr. Kobus du Plessis.
