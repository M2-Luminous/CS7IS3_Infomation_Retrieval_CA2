When readers read this newspaper, UN troops and NATO commanders should have made the final military assessment and decided whether or not Serbian troops have met the demands set by the ultimatum and whether or not NATO warplanes will bomb positions held by Serbian troops. Two new situations have arisen at the 11th hour before making a decision: The first is Russia's diplomatic and military intervention and the Serbs' intended troop withdrawal, and the second is that the withdrawal of Serbian troops is hindered by heavy snow, and it is unlikely that the withdrawal can be completed on time. It is understandable that heavy snow creates difficulties which make it impossible for the Serbs to complete the withdrawal within two or three days, and it will be even more difficult for UN and NATO authorities to examine whether or not Serbian troops have met the demands. Moreover, the fact that heavy snow has sealed mountain passes makes it easier for Serbian troops to stay in concealment. It is hard enough for NATO warplanes to find targets over boundless mountain forest, but now it is even more difficult to do so. NATO and Clinton asserted that the ultimatum would not be extended, but it is another matter whether or not air strikes will be launched immediately following the expiration of the ultimatum. Russia's intervention helped Serbian troops back down, but also complicated the problem, which may bring about U.S.-Russian antagonism. U.S. President Clinton sets his diplomatic focus at keeping Russia on the "reform" course of leaning toward the West, particularly keeping Yeltsin's position since he has assumed office. Hence, Clinton met Yeltsin three times over the past year. However, nationalism is gaining ground and the balance of political forces has changed in Russia under the difficult situation. Therefore, Yeltsin has to take a high profile towards the Serbs, but dares not follow the West. In this way, if NATO and the United States wantonly take punitive actions against the Serbs, U.S.-Russian relations will definitely deteriorate and the political and economic situation of Russia will certainly be affected, thus impacting the overall international situation. The Clinton administration has always wavered in dealing with the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina since it took power. In his presidential campaign, Clinton criticized Bush as weak and incompetent, saying that he would dispatch a shock brigade to march to the Sarajevo Airport. However, faced with the complicated situation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as acting under the constraints of allied powers and the U.S. people, all Clinton could do after assuming office was to air-drop food to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now, in assuming airs of launching air strikes at whatever cost, Clinton has two things in mind: The first one is to coerce the Muslims to accept a political settlement package which will be even more unfavorable to them than the previous ones, and the second one is to seize the opportunity to increase U.S. influence in the Balkans. Although it fails to control the worsening situation of former Yugoslavia, the United States has secretly penetrated its influence there. Last year, the United States successfully sought the approval of Albania in renting a naval base and stationing two spy aircraft there, and then dispatched 300 troops, while flaunting the banner of UN forces, to Macedonia where conflicts would break out. It was reported that every week over the past few months, there has been a U.S. four-star general coming to Macedonia for inspection. Foreign journalists stated that these moves were certainly not as simple as inspiring troops' morale. Hence, this explains why Yeltsin must make a quick response to the developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. NATO is assuming a strong posture and it seems that air strikes are imminent. However, viewed from the latest situation, the worst-case scenario can be averted. As the Serbs are "so wise as to suffer short-term losses" and are willing to cooperate with NATO, it is believed that the West is also willing to "back down after making small gains" in order to avoid armed clashes. If the armed clashes do break out, the negative impact is obvious. First, bombs will lead to retaliation, the security of UN forces will be severely threatened, and humanitarian aid will have to be suspended again. Consequently, there will be greater casualties and more civilians will suffer. Second, the Serbs may intensify their retaliatory attacks against other towns and areas after giving up their tactic of besieging Sarajevo, and the war may spread to Kosovo, a region mainly populated by Albanians, and to Macedonia. In this way the civil war of Bosnia-Herzegovina will develop into an international conflict, and Albania and Greece will be dragged into it. Furthermore, even when air strikes helped rescue Sarajevo from the siege or put down the conflict between the Muslims and the Serbs, it does not imply that the civil war will be over. As a matter of fact, the war between the Muslims and the Croats is no less violent than that between the Muslims and the Serbs. Are NATO and the United States ready to intervene further? It seems that the positive results of air strikes are limited, but the negative impact cannot be underestimated. NATO and the United States must deploy massive numbers of ground forces if they want to rely on armed strength to settle this civil war which has been fought for nearly two years. Are they ready to fight a "Desert Storm-type" large-scale war? Now, various countries in the West do not think so. In any case, if NATO really launches air strikes today, it does not imply the immediate ending of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina but rather the beginning of another round of more violent and complicated conflicts.
