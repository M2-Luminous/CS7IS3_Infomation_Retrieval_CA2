This Saturday is the first one for years for urban people in China to take as a rest-day. It results from the country's new working-hours system: from March 1 workers and government employees work five and half days a week (44 hours) rather than six days (48 hours). For many employees it means that every second weekend they get two days off, and in the intervening week just the Sunday -- in other words, an 11-day fortnight. "I often could not sleep well as I had to take care of my baby and did the housework as well," said nurse Xiao. "But since I can rest for two continuous days now, I feel my burden eased. I can put off some things to do until tomorrow." Lin Yi, who works in a print company in Beijing, summoned her boyfriend early this morning. She said they were going to spend this day in Beijing Botanic Garden and Beijing Zoo. "It was really not easy for me to get a date with my boyfriend since I am usually very busy," she said. Many people chose to spend today in stores and parks. Managers of major stores in Xidan Shopping Center and staff at the Summer Palace reported more people coming than usual. They said the new system provided a new business opportunity for them. "The new working-hour system will be good for our business," said an executive of the Summer Palace. "We were thinking of new ways to attract more people. And now the opportunity has come." In Nanjing, capital of East China's Jiangsu Province, tens of thousand people, four to five times the usual number, flocked to see plums on a hill in an eastern suburb of the city. The number of visitors to many other scenic spots in the city evidently increased and department stores were overfilled. "I seldom have a chance to tour the city," said Cao Rong, who works in Dachang town, about two hours from urban Nanjing. "Although I had been to the plum mountain before, I feel more relaxed today." The new system also provides a chance for some people to take a second job. Chen Yong, a computer operator in a Beijing hotel, opened his own company. He used to worry because he could not find enough time for his private business, but today he went to his own company early in the morning. However, not all urban residents spent today as a rest day. In Nanjing University, Zhang Rong and his colleagues were still doing their scientific research on semi-conductors. "It does not mean much for us who engage in scientific research although the rest days increased," said a teacher, who identified herself only as Gao, at the Beijing Polytechnical University. "The real rest day is after our success (in our research)." In Beijing, hospitals, public bus companies and stores still operate as normally. Officials said it was guaranteed that workers of these businesses will work only 44 hours a week and take their rest-time by changing working shifts.
