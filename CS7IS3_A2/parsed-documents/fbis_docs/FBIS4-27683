"This visit is aimed at strengthening the friendly ties between the two armies and the two peoples," spokeswoman Ho The Lan said at a press briefing. Diplomatic sources here said though Hanoi has been approached by western countries to intercede in the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington. The ministry spokeswoman did not give the dates of the visit. But according to the Japanese press, the general, who ranks fifth in the politburo of the Vietnamese Communist Party, will visit Pyongyang from June 16. Khue's visit is the first by a Vietnamese defense minister to North Korea since the Vietnam War, and official visits to Stalinist North Korea have been infrequent over the past few years. Bilateral relations were frozen after Vietnam and South Korea normalized ties in 1992.
