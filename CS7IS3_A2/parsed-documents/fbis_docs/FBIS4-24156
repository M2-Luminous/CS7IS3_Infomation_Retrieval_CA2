FBIS4-24156 "drafr122_c_94019" FBIS-AFR-94-122 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 24 Jun South African Press Review for 24 Jun MB2406155194 MB2406155194 BFN [Editorial Report] WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN Rattling the Keys -- "The good news in the Budget is that there is little really bad news," notes an editorial in Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English on 24-30 June on page 28. "This budget is designed to please the 'golden triangle' of business, labour and the state." "In balancing the need for social spending against the demand for fiscal discipline" Keys has "set solid standards for the future." "If there is nothing dramatically stimulatory in the Budget, there is nothing particularly dampening either. By lowering the basic corporation tax rate while doing nothing to alleviate the tax burden of individuals" it "favors investment at the expense of consumption." "Some more details on how Budget planning fits in with the RDP [Research and Development Program] would have been helpful, not only to hesitant foreign investors but to those who are monitoring the programme to see if it will really deliver on its promises." NEW NATION New Budget -- There is no doubt that the Budget will be assessed on its "commitment to the priorities identified in the Reconstruction and Development Programme" as the RDP is the "flagship of the new government," notes an editorial in Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 24 June on page 8. However, "it needs to be said from the outset that the budget was disappointing in the extreme, in that it did not go far enough in addressing the plight of the country's estimated 16-million poor citizens." VAT [value added tax] was not mentioned, nor were basic foodstuffs "zero-rated," which means "millions of unemployed" pay the "same VAT as the affluent suburban elite." And the lower corporate taxation "should not be allowed to benefit the corporate sector alone" and "we hope that the government's decision to lower company taxation is interpreted" as a "desire to see greater job creation in the business sector." "We see no logic" in the decision to allocate "at least 13 percent more to defense expenditure" as "we are committed to moving into a reconciliation mode" when "spending on safety and security has increased only 6.5 percent." And the "deficiencies in the tax collection system" must be addressed and overhauled with "urgency." BUSINESS DAY Budget To Test Keys' Credibility -- "The Budget has met with widespread approval and a great deal of relief," begins the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 24 June in a page-12 editorial. "But Finance Minister Derek Keys knows that the new government is on trial. The real judgment on its performance will come next March, when Keys tells Parliament how close he came to fulfilling the expectations he raised." "Keys showed with his first Budget that the intends to keep his promises. If he can do the same with his second under far more difficult circumstances, he will have laid the basis for the economic transformation he seeks. It will not be easy. Keys has a roomful of Cabinet colleagues all itching to spend more than they have been allocated." In conclusion the BUSINESS DAY writes that "Keys has exceptional credibility for a politician, but he is about to be tested. If the new government is to be believed in the years ahead, by the businessmen and investors on whom depend the growth, jobs and tax revenues essential for prosperity and peace, he must ensure the whole Cabinet keeps his promises." SOWETAN Budget Balances Needs of Haves/Have-nots -- "Finance Minister Mr Derek Keys had to satisfy three major constituencies in his Budget and he has done just that," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 24 June in a page-12 editorial. "Keys has carefully balanced the needs of the have-nots, of investors and the fears of many white South Africans." The money set aside for the Reconstruction and Development Program's "special projects" "does not seem to be much. But the truth is the Government has paid some attention to the needs of the underdog. The test the Government must face now is how efficiently it can deliver the promises of the RDP to the people who put them in power."
