A spokesman of the Vienna-based organisation said the IAEA was "waiting for one of the two sides to get in touch with us." Contacts between North Korea and the IAEA have been suspended since Pyongyang, which is suspected of working to develop nuclear weapons, refused to let IAEA inspectors into all its nuclear facilities. In December, the IAEA rejected a North Korean offer to allow partial inspection of its facilities. The IAEA said it had insisted on being allowed to see all North Korea's nuclear facilities and was "ready to resume its inspections at any time." Pyongyang said it was willing to let IAEA inspectors view five of its seven nuclear facilities. But at the two others, a nuclear reactor and a uranium reprocessing plant, both at Yongbyon, North Korea said IAEA inspectors would only be allowed to put new film in the cameras already installed to monitor work at the facilities. It was a request to visit these two sites, which Pyongyang says are military facilities with no nuclear role, which sparked North Korea's decision in February to suspend inspections of existing sites and threaten to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
