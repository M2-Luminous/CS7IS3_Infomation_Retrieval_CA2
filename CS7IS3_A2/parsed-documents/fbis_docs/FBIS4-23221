So far, 175 people have already been killed. Today, more than 50 people died and 80 others were wounded. UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebels have fired more than 500 shells at the city of Cuito since dawn today. The few houses that had been left standing during the nine-month war have been flattened to the ground. UNITA snipers continue to shoot at everything that moves on the streets. The last food stocks at World Food Program warehouses have been distributed to the starving residents. That means that as of now the situation will be like during the nine-month war when people starved to death at just about every corner. Meanwhile, movements by Jonas Savimbi's troops have been reported in the outlaying areas of the city of Luena, Moxico Province, in the past few days. Government forces say UNITA will not succeed in its plans. In Lubango, the military situation is not good. UNITA troops have stepped up their operations in the Southern Military Front since 2 May, particularly in the Front's northeastern strip. UNITA raided the capital of Quilengues District. Southern Military Front commander General Pereira Furtado told our correspondent that the Angolan Armed Forces have not lost any positions and the situation is under their control. He said government forces have not yet gone on the offensive.
