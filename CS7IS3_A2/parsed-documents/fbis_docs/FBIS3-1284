Mr Ramodike claimed on Tuesday that matters had worsened since the Department of Regional and Land Affairs had assumed control of the territory. In a statement on Wednesday, Minister of Regional and Land Affairs Andre Fourie said he had the "fullest confidence" in the task team controlling Lebowa's finances. "This is proved by the fact that the task team has already evaluated the files of all Lebowa public servants, except some cases related to the Lebowa Department of Health, and has forwarded its recommendations to the Lebowa Public Service Commission. Of course, this makes a mockery of the chief minister's statement," said Mr Fourie.
