In almost all local Caucasian conflicts (Ossetia, Chechnya, Abkhazia, Adzharia, Imeretia, Lezgistan, Karabakh etc.), Turkey supported one side with money and weapons, and Russia the other. In the latter half of the 1990's Iran (the third regional great power) was too preoccupied with its war in southern Iraq and with support of Shi-ite factions of Islamic mujahadin fundamentalists opposing mujahadin Suni-ites in former Soviet Central Asia, and it had neither the resources nor the political will to participate seriously in the Caucasian wars. In addition, Iran still depended on Russia for its supply of modern weapons, which forced Iran to direct military-political expansion more southward, into the Persian Gulf region, and further in the direction of Israel, in order to avoid serious collision of interests with Russia. By the year 2000 the peacemaking enthusiasm of the early 1990's died away in Western Europe and the USA as a result of a number of extremely unsuccessful long-distance military expeditions. Following the ignominious evacuation from Mogadishu and the heavy Anglo-French losses in the appalling cauldron of Sarajevo (the new Dien Bien Phu), in 1994 France, Great Britain and Germany reduced military expenditures and armed forces even more. In accordance with the Maastricht agreements a Unified European Army was created, intended for demonstration of European unity but totally unsuited to the real war in the hostile environment of the Caucasus Mountains. The slump and inflation in the country and foreign policy failures (Somali, Bosnia, Ukraine, Estonia, the Caucasus) led to the dominance of American society by isolationist sentiments almost as deep as those of the 1920's. In 1996, Ross Perot was elected U.S. president under the slogan "America First." The time of active intervention of the UN Security Council in regional conflicts (1990-1994) was over. In the Caucasus, Turkey and Russia opposed one another, and there wasn't a third force that could serve as a serious referee and somehow stabilize the unstable bipolar confrontation. In 1993-1995 the Armenian Army became ever stronger. It kept Nagornyy Karabakh and contiguous regions of Azerbaijan under dependable control. The government in Baku changed frequently, and every government was weaker than the one preceding it. An Armenian-Azeri peace treaty was signed in 1993, and demilitarized zones under the supervision of the European Community Security Council were established. The peace endured through all of 1994 without serious violations. In fall 1994 Lezgistan partisans intensified their combat activities on the Azeri-Russian border. Rail communication between Azerbaijan and Russia became totally unreliable. The weak central government was incapable of safeguarding cargo and maintaining at least some kind of order in other regions of Azerbaijan. In Georgia, the central government controlled only the Tbilisi vicinity. Armenia found itself in a blockade of worse proportions than in 1992. In the unexpectedly cold winter of 1994-1995 people in Yerevan died not so much from outright starvation (international humanitarian aid was delivered via an air bridge) as from cold. In spring 1995 tens of thousands of irate demonstrators led by activists from the Dashnak Party seized the parliament building. The parliament deposed President Ter-Petrosyan in the face of assault rifle muzzles, after which it announced its own self-dissolution. The victorious opposition formed a new government. The Armenian Army began a decisive offensive to break the blockade and to establish a friendly regime in Baku, with which a peace could be signed. It became clear in Ankara that in a few days Azerbaijan was going to become an Armenian-Russian protectorate. Turkey demanded immediate cessation of Armenian aggression, but the ultimatum was ignored in Yerevan, where it was declared that "the combat activities are being pursued not by the Armenian Army but by self-defense forces of the independent Karabakh Republic." Then occurred the inevitable--the Turkish Army intervened directly into the war. At first, subunits of the Turkish forces were transferred to the Nakhichevan enclave. And then, in May 1995, tanks of the IX Army Corps of the 3d Field Army began an offensive from the vicinity of Kars with the support of combat aviation. P. Felgengauer's War With Turkey (1995-2000) Almost immediately Russian motorized rifle and armored forces located at the Turkish-Armenian border in the vicinity of Gyumri entered into combat, but they had almost no air cover, because the nearest Russian air bases were hundreds of kilometers away in the Northern Caucasus. Turkish aviation dominated the skies over the battlefield. Joint defense by the Armenians and Russians was hacked to pieces in 48 hours. Russian forces withdrew to the north, to the Georgian border, while Turkish tanks turned to the south, toward Yerevan. Armenian forces offered fierce resistance, but it was clear that the city would be taken in a few days. At this time mobile formations of the Russian Army were participating in peacemaking operations in Central Asia, in northeastern Estonia, in some oblasts of eastern Ukraine, in the Crimea, and in the Northern Caucasus. The Russian Army had no reserves to draw from to stop the Turkish offensive. But Moscow couldn't cede the Transcaucasus to Turkey, because this would have destabilized the Northern Caucasus totally. It was believed in Moscow that a victory in Armenia would result in further penetration by Turks into Turkic-language Central Asia, and that it would fortify the positions of extreme nationalists in Ukraine. Moscow felt a mortal threat, and decided upon extreme measures. Russian frontal Su-24 Fencer bombers made a number of bomb strikes on bases and airfields of the Turkish 3d Army, but they suffered losses. Russian strategic bombers flying over the Black Sea launched several dozen cruise missiles carrying conventional warheads against a number of objectives in the vicinity of Bosporus, as well as in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. Eighty percent of the missiles struck their targets precisely, but the Turkish invasion of Armenia continued. In addition, Turkey closed the Strait of Bosporus to Russian merchant vessels. The Russian Supreme Military Council announced an ultimatum to Turkey: To cease the offensive in 24 hours and begin an immediate troop withdrawal, or "Russia would use all means at its disposal to stop the aggression." Turkey said that it would not yield to nuclear blackmail, obviously figuring that Russia would never opt for nuclear weapons against a nonnuclear power that was also member of NATO. In the meantime, Turkish tanks had encircled Yerevan and were fighting in the southern suburbs. Then President General ***, chairman of the Russian Supreme Military Council, decided to make a preemptory demonstrative nuclear strike on Turkey. A radar station in the vicinity of Kars was targeted. The 100 kiloton air burst, after which there was no noticeable radioactive fallout, destroyed the station. The civilian population practically didn't suffer. Of course, three American servicemen observing the course of the conflict were located at the station at the moment of the nuclear strike. However, Washington's reaction was sluggish. No one wanted to begin a world nuclear war because of some half-destroyed villages in the Caucasus Mountains. And especially the weak and unpopular Clinton administration. The world community as a whole did not react to the war in the Transcaucasus in any serious way. That is, there were many midnight emergency meetings in New York, Brussels, Washington, Paris and London, but no real actions were taken either during the Armenian offensive or during the Turkish offensive, or after the first nuclear strike since 1945. Only pro-Turkish and anti-Turkish demonstrations in Germany led to new outbreaks of violence: Dormitories were torched, and stores were looted. The Russian president general announced that another, more powerful nuclear strike would be made on Turkey in 24 hours. But as a result of many hours of negotiations via the "hot line," a joint Russian-American settlement was developed that Turkey would have to accept. The Armenian forces were once again withdrawn from Azeri territory, while Turkish forces drew back from Armenian territory. However, Karabakh remained under Armenian control, and Nakhichevan under Turkish control. With Russia's help Armenia soon replenished its losses in armaments, and continued to build up its military potential, gradually transforming into an enclave armed to the teeth--a "new Israel," with which the Armenians like to compare their tiny war-ready country. Azerbaijan and Georgia disintegrated into zones controlled by different local field commanders, some of whom were pro-Turkey, while others were pro-Moscow. (By the way, most simply plundered everything that others hadn't yet managed to take). In Turkey, the "National Unity" government, allied with Muslim fundamentalists and extreme nationalists, came into power. Turkey drifted ever further away from the West, all the more so because its entry into the European Community was blocked insurmountably by Greece. Using pro-Turkish field commanders in Azerbaijan and Georgia, Ankara supported anti-Russian partisan actions by mujahadin in the Islamic Mountain Republic in the Northern Caucasus. But by the year 2000 the situation began to change fundamentally. Russia and its army were clearly emerging from the crisis. Elite mobile brigades and regiments of helicopter gunships were transferred to the Caucasus. The last centers of organized resistance in Chechnya were suppressed. It was becoming increasingly more obvious that the Russian peacemaking army was preparing, as in 1921, to conduct a lightning campaign in the Transcaucasus, and to annex republics exhausted by a 10-year war to the "Union"--the Unified Russian Federation. All the more so because by this time 80 percent of the territory of the former USSR was already pacified, and the Transcaucasus was the last major center of instability. In 2000 the main problem absorbing the analysts was whether Turkey would be satisfied with the annexation of Nakhichevan, and would recognize all of the rest of the former Soviet Transcaucasus to be a zone of Russian interests, or decide upon a new war the moment mobile forces of the Federation landed in Baku. In the meantime, secret negotiations were proceeding between Moscow and Ankara. In the year 2000 Russia was clearly stronger than in 1995. It was hoped in Moscow that this time Turkey would be more sensible. Of course after the humiliation of 1995 the national fundamentalist government of Turkey embarked upon accelerated creation of its own nuclear weapons, but in the year 2000 the Muslim bomb was not yet ready. The Caucasian War did prove one thing, by the way: Local wars were going to be local nuclear wars more often in the 21st century.
