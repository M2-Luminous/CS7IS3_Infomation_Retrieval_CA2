FR940216-1-00004 FR940216-1-00002 Paperwork Reduction Act: The collections of information provided for in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on the collections of information should be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Act Project (1501&hyph;0121), Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Office of International Investment at the address noted above. The collection of information provided for in this proposed rule is in section 800.402. Thus far, the regulations have requested parties filing a notification under section 721 to provide 10 copies of the notification. However, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has been expanded by Executive Order 12860 of September 3, 1993, to include three additional members: the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The regulations have accordingly been amended to request that three additional copies of the notifications be provided by parties making a filing under section 721, for a total of 13 copies. The regulations have also been amended to request more information pertaining to foreign government control to assist the Committee in implementing the amendment to section 721 pertaining to mandatory investigations of certain acquisitions involving such control. The information collected pursuant to these regulations is required by the Committee to assist it in determining whether to investigate mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers of persons involved in interstate commerce in the United States by or with foreign persons for possible threats to the national security, as required by section 721 of the Defense Production Act. This information will be used to determine the extent and nature of foreign control, as well as the national security implications of the transactions at issue. The likely respondents are individuals and businesses. Estimated Total Annual Reporting Burden: 6000 hours Estimated Average Annual Burden per Respondent: This varies, depending on individual circumstances, with an average of 60 hours Estimated Number of Respondents: 100 Estimated Annual Frequency of Responses: 1 Regulatory Flexibility Act: These regulations implement amendments to section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. App. 2170) (``DPA''). Section 709 of the DPA (50 U.S.C. App. 2159) provides that the regulations issued under it are not subject to the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). Notwithstanding this exemption, section 709 of the DPA was amended by section 136 of the Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 (P.L. 102&hyph;558) to require any regulation issued under the DPA to be published in the Federal Register for at least thirty days to provide for public comment. This requirement subjects this proposed rule to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). The impact of this proposed rule on small entities is expected to be insignificant. This proposed regulation imposes additional informational requirements on entities controlled by foreign governments. Most businesses affected by this rule will likely be large businesses, because these are the most likely to be controlled by a foreign government. Accordingly, it is certified that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Discussion of the Proposed Rule Section 837(a) of the Defense Authorization Act creates for the first time a mandatory investigation provision under Exon-Florio. There are three points worth noting about this provision. First, this provision is limited in application to certain types of acquisitions. Specifically, the acquirer in question must be a foreign government controlled entity, or an entity acting on behalf of a foreign government. Furthermore, the acquisition must be one which ``could result in control of a person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States that could affect the national security of the United States '' (emphasis added). Thus, even where the other specified criteria are met, this provision does not mandate an investigation for cases that could not ``affect the national security of the United States.'' Second, for purposes of determining whether the acquisition results in foreign government control, CFIUS is applying the same functional test for control as provided in section 800.204.
