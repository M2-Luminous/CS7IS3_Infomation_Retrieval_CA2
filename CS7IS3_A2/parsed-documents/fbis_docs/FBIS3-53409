And that it also made a number of criticisms of the [Lebanese] government, especially with regard to the attitude of state institutions, which have begun to act as part of the private sector. The prominent leader told AL-HAYAH that a major part of the talks held by the Hizballah delegation in the Syrian capital over three days was devoted to the upcoming Syrian-U.S. summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton and the situation in the south and western al-Biqa'. He quoted senior Syrian officials as saying that the al-Asad-Clinton summit represents an important and fundamental opportunity to emphasize Syrian constants and principles, which refuse in any way to abandon a single inch of the Golan, the south, and western al-Biqa', and which support the fateful link between the Lebanese and Syrian files. Namely, on the basis of rejecting separate solutions and refusing to allow this or that party to monopolize the situation, as was the case with the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The leader stressed that the Lebanese and Syrian tracks are now like one track, and that Damascus does not accept priority being given to one track over the other, because it believes that the solution has to be comprehensive. On the situation in the south, the leader emphasized that there is a common reading between Damascus and Hizballah of the aims behind the continued Israeli aggression. "Tel Aviv is seeking to include the security question at the top of the Syrian-U.S. summit agenda, so that this issue will dominate the other major issues." It was agreed to seize the escalation card from Israel's hand in order to deny it the opportunity, so that the security question will not dominate the political file to be discussed between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. The leader stressed that Israel "has begun again to shell civilians in the south and western al-Biqa' before the the Syrian-U.S. summit. The aim is to drag us into the game of haphazard bombardment. But we will not be dragged into this trap, at least for the time being, lest we achieve for Israel what it is seeking to achieve. However, we can reply later, that is after the Geneva summit proceedings have ended." He added that "Hizballah still has all the options that allow it to reply to the Israeli escalation. But it reserves the right to choose the timing and method it deems suitable. It can from now pursue a policy of self-restraint until the summit concludes, while choosing a method capable of exerting pressure to halt the Israeli aggression on civilians." The leader noted that the Hizballah delegation raised a number of issues during its talks with Khaddam. They included the following: "-- Hizballah's concerns over the move by some circles close to [Lebanese] Prime Minister Rafiz al-Hariri to normalize relations with Israel. This was reflected through participation in the water conference held in Ankara recently, and also through articles published by a Lebanese newspaper and signed by figures dealing with financial and economic matters. "-- The attitude of some official institutions and departments, which have begun to act as though they are private companies. This prompts us to ask about the fate of the brotherhood, cooperation, and coordination treaty between Lebanon and Syria, which will be difficult to translate into something that can achieve cooperation in view of the absence of public establishments in Lebanon. "-- The fate of the investigation the government pledged to the Chamber of Deputies to conduct into the `airport bridge massacre' which took place on 13 September last year, as a result of which 50 people were killed or wounded. The investigation has still not been completed, as though some people are trying to keep this file open to prevent those directly responsible from being punished for what happened. We will not keep silent about procrastination and will continue to demand that the investigation be completed until those responsible are identified. "-- Hizballah's view that the government has been negligent in many spheres, contrary to what it promised to achieve in the ministerial statement, even though we were harmonious when we decided to withdraw confidence from it." [sentence as published] On the Syrian position on the remarks made by the Hizballah delegation, the prominent leader said that the party was given a promise that these issues will be raised at the Lebanese-Syrian summit to be held between Presidents Ilyas al-Hirawi and Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus after the conclusion of the Syrian-U.S. summit and in the presence of Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. It is understood that Damascus is still calling for calm in Lebanon and for further cooperation and dialogue among all parties, saying that regional and international conditions do not allow any shocks that are difficult to control. It understands some of the remarks and the motives for them. However, it believes they can be overcome without reducing the role played by the government. If there are criticisms, they should be raised in order to strengthen the arena and effect action. Damascus did not raise with the Hizballah delegation the question of resuming dialogue between it and the prime minister. This was confirmed to AL-HAYAH by the prominent leader. However, a ministerial source did not rule out the possibility of resuming contacts between the two sides, but at a later stage. That is, after Syria explores the U.S. position and the extent of President Clinton's willingness to fulfill what he promised to do, namely to reactivate the peace talks and extricate them from the present deadlock. On the mission for which the U.S. Congress delegation visited Damascus and its tour of a number of west al-Biqa' villages which were the scene of ferocious fighting during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982 -- the tour which coincided with the Hizballah delegation's visit to Damascus -- the prominent leader pointed out that "there is no link between our visit and the presence of U.S. Congress members." He reiterated that the presence of Hizballah's delegation and U.S. Congress members in Damascus at the same time was not an attempt to arrange a meeting under Syrian auspices or to prepare the atmosphere for negotiations by correspondence. The leader denied that the U.S. Congress delegation's mission was discussed on the periphery of Hizballah's talks with Khaddam. He said that Hizballah "is adhering to its position and is refusing to hold any meetings or exchange any correspondence with the Americans, because they lack the characteristics that qualify them to play the role of a broker, on the grounds that they are a concerned party." The leader cited what Hizballah had told representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and humanitarian organizations, namely that all those captured by Israel -- Lebanese and Palestinians -- on Lebanese territory must be released as a condition for handing over the bodies of Israeli soldiers Hizballah has. He denied that Israeli pilot Ron Arad is in Hizballah's custody. He pointed out that Hizballah has no information about the possibility of the Red Cross or UN humanitarian organizations making a new attempt. He stressed that Hizballah's position is clear, "and our condition is the release of all prisoners and detainees."
