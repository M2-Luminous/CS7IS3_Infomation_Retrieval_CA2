But more especially because some of these newcomers will be bringing to the PWC the expertise and experience hitherto lacking in its ranks. The presence of Guo Fengmin, chief negotiator in the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), will be a boon, given that the PWC has to look into areas which must be resolved within the JLG. Mr Guo might understand better the feelings of Hong Kong members about the need to speed up and complete JLG work on matters such as the localisation of laws and ratification of international treaties for the post-1997 period. Hong Kong members, on the other hand, might get to know and understand at first hand, the progress or otherwise of various JLG items. Perhaps, even help to give the Chinese side a push towards settlement of some of the outstanding issues. The addition of Hong Kong academics, a former member of the bench and a civil servant will enlarge PWC horizons. All these individuals are ideally placed to give the mainland members insights into areas of vital importance if confidence in the future Special Administrative Region Administration is to be built up. Arthur Garcia, former civil servant, ex-High Court judge and newly-retired ombudsman, is most certainly in a position to give the mainland members a historical perspective of many of the existing laws vital to understanding the need to maintain or modify them for the post-colonial period. Since its formation the PWC has been grossly misrepresented and misreported. It has not been helped by thoughtless remarks by some of its members. The result has been a general misunderstanding of its work and its role in the current, embittered situation arising from the failure of China and Britain to come to terms on political reforms for Hong Kong. It has also been handicapped by lack of resources and shortage of expertise in some areas. The appointment of new members will not greatly help its image problem but it may at least lighten the burden of the few local members who are working unstintingly for Hong Kong's future. But when all is said and done, the PWC must still win the confidence of Hong Kong people. This it has signally failed to do. Mainly because its approach to dealing with both the media and Hong Kong people is unbelievably antediluvian. This has to change. The PWC must strike out in new directions to instil confidence in the public at large. If the addition of new members helps it would be a plus.
