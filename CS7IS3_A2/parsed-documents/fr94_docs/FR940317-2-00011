FR940317-2-00011 FR940317-2-00008 International Trade Administration [C&hyph;122&hyph;816] Court Decision and Suspension of Liquidation on Certain Softwood Lumber Products From Canada AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of court decision and suspension of liquidation. SUMMARY: On March 7, 1994, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) binational panel (the Panel) affirmed the U.S. Department of Commerce's (the Department) determination on remand that no subsidies were provided on U.S. imports of softwood lumber products from Canada. Article 1904.13 of the FTA provides that a government may request a review of a Panel decision by an Extraordinary Challenge Committee (ECC). The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has announced that it will file for an ECC review of the Panel's decision. The Department will implement the decision of the ECC. In accordance with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) decision in Timken Company v. United this proceeding. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joe Kaesshaefer or Kelly Parkhill, Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th & Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On May 28, 1992, the Department determined that U.S. imports of Canadian softwood lumber products are subsidized (57 FR 22570). The Commerce decision was appealed under Chapter 19 of the FTA. The Panel issued an adverse decision on May 6, 1993, finding that the Department had not demonstrated that countervailable subsidies existed, and remanded the case to the Department for further deliberations. The Department completed a redetermination and on December 17, 1993, the Panel issued a second adverse decision, finding that the Department still had not supported its determination that countervailable subsidies existed. It ordered a second remand, requiring the Department to find that there were no subsidies. The Department complied with this order, and filed its second redetermination, on January 6, 1994. The Panel affirmed this redetermination on February 23, 1994 and issued a Notice of Final Panel Action on March 7, 1994. USTR has until April 6, 1994 to file a request for an ECC review. Suspension of Liquidation In accordance with the Timken decision, the Department must publish notice of a decision of the Panel which is not ``in harmony'' with the Department's final determination. The Panel's March 7, 1994 decision constitutes a decision not in harmony with the Department's affirmative subsidy determination. Accordingly, the Department is publishing this notice. The Timken decision also held that the Department must suspend liquidation pending a ``conclusive'' court decision in the action. Therefore, the Department will continue the suspension of liquidation of the subject merchandise until the ECC issues a conclusive decision in this action. The Department will implement the decision of the ECC. Dated: March 15, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
