Poltov] [Text] Vladivostok, 17 Apr -- While attention is being focused on the Russian Pacific Fleet in connection with the dumping of radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan, at least four of its decommissioned nuclear submarines are tied to their moorings while being in quite a dangerous condition, because it is difficult to extract their nuclear fuel due to explosions or problems they suffered while they were in service. This was learned by a TOKYO SHIMBUN investigation on 17 April. In giving warning, a high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer stated, "The failure to deal with nuclear submarines that have previously suffered accidents is a more serious problem to safety in the Sea of Japan than is the dumping of radioactive waste into the sea." These nuclear submarines that have suffered accidents or difficulties are three E-II class cruise missile submarines which have been moored at the Pabrovsk [name as published] base near Vladivostok, and one V-I class attack submarine which has been moored at the Kamchatskaya base. Between 1979 and 1985, all of them suffered difficulties with or explosions of their nuclear reactors due to malfunctions of their cooling systems. In August 1985, one of them suffered an explosion in its nuclear reactor, which killed 10 of its crew, due to a sudden rise in the temperature of its cooling water. Decommissioned nuclear submarines usually are scrapped after they have been dismantled. However, these four submarines have been moored at their bases because it is difficult to remove their nuclear fuel because of the fear of large-scale radioactive leaks from their nuclear reactors. Although an institute of the Russian Defense Ministry is currently studying technology for the safe dismantling of nuclear submarines that have suffered accidents, the development of this technology has been greatly delayed due to the recent financial difficulties. Therefore, the outlook for dismantling these nuclear submarines is uncertain. The high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer stressed: "Because the radioactive waste that is the focal point in the dumping issue is very low-level radiation, it causes no actual problems to human beings. However, troubles with nuclear submarines that have suffered accidents may cause serious problems affecting humans." Also, he added, "If we cannot speed up the development of new technology for dismantling them through assistance from Japan and other nations, this will have serious consequences."
