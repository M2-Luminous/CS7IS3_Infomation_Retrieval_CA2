The DSK vice-chairman told a press conference that "identity of stands between the DSK and Albania" was reaffirmed on Thursday during the talk between DSK Chairman Ibrahim Rugova and Albanian President Sali Berisha. Agani said that "consultations and coordination of DSK activities with Albania were one of the major results of the political movement of the Albanians in Kosovo-Metohija." Agani admitted that Albania's "strong support" was the major factor of success of the struggle for the fulfillment of DSK demands. The Albanian separatists have been trying for decades to secede Kosovo-Metohija from Serbia, i.e. the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.), using conventional terrorist methods and attacking members of the police and the army. The F.R.Y.'s attempts to develop good-neighbourly relations with neighbouring Republic of Albania remain unsuccessful because Tirana is persistently and openly supporting the separatist movement in Kosmet, thus meddling with the F.R.Y.'s internal affairs.
