The national government is apparently drafting a document in which President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's administration will state its viewpoint and refute information it deems incorrect. The government thus inaugurates a new stage in Paraguayan foreign relations, abandoning its passive posture and acting more independently before other countries. Proof of this is the stance regarding the U.S. Government's request to send troops to our country to build six schools and eight water wells in San Pedro Department without the participation of the Paraguayan Army. Before accepting this "social aid", the government sent the U.S. Embassy a lengthy note requesting more details about the mission and the funds that each party will have to invest in the joint exercise, and proposing the participation of the Paraguayan Armed Forces. The Paraguayan Foreign Ministry note to the U.S. Government conditions the development of the operation to the participation of Paraguayan sappers, a detailed list of the tasks the U.S. troops will carry out, and an account of what the operation will cost each country, among other requirements. The U.S. State Department has issued a report on the situation of human rights in Paraguay that was released by the U.S. Embassy in Asuncion. Contradictory reactions -- for and against -- to the negative aspects of the report flew as soon as it was disclosed. U.S. Ambassador Jon Glassman was summoned by Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner, who informed the ambassador of the government's unrest over the U.S. State Department report. He was told that the Paraguayan Government would rectify and clarify some points of the report. That same day German Ambassador Joachin Kausch was also summoned by Foreign Minister Ramirez Boettner to explain his statement to the media regarding the absence of Paraguayan guarantees for foreign investors. After a long interview, the German ambassador said the media had misinterpreted what he had said, that he never described Paraguay as an unsafe country for foreign investments. Asked about a lack of guarantees for investors, President Wasmosy said that there seems to be an orchestrated campaign to distort the country's image abroad, although he did not say who is responsible.
