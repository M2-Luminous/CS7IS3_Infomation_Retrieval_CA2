As seen by EPICentre's analysts, Russia's reforms have passed through three stages: Stage I: January-May 1992, "Advance" Stage II: June-December 1992, "Retreat" Stage III: 1993, "Redeployment and New Advance" Changes in the economic policy commenced at the close of 1992 and took final shape by the spring of 1993. December 1992 witnessed the formation of a government headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin. It was not so closeknit as the government of the second stage, but proved more capable of pursuing a purposeful economic policy. In January it was announced that struggle against inflation was the key priority of the government's policy, its purpose being to lower the rate of inflation to 5 percent a month by the end of the year. For a number of reasons it became impossible to reach this aim despite a slowdown in the rate of inflation by the close of 1993. From the beginning of the year payments from the budget were carried out with delays, which in the conditions of high inflation was tantamount to their reduction in real terms. In the third quarter, as declared by (Minister of Finance) Boris Fedorov, the deficit of the budget stood at 8.6 trillion rubles. For the results of the first nine months the total deficit of the budget almost reached a size approved by the president for the year. In this situation a budgetary war broke out between the Ministry of Finance and the parliament which passed a law establishing the deficit at the level of 22.4 trillion rubles (15 percent of the GNP). The president returned it to parliament with a proposal to cut it to 13.5 trillion (9 percent of the GNP). The parliament accepted those amendments which did not lead to a sharp reduction of expenditures, so the president said that he would not sign this kind of budget. The situation kept "hanging" in this state until September 21. Official data on the Central Bank's credits to commercial banks vary, yet the tendency is clear: in the course of nine months the government and the Central Bank of Russia managed to secure a persistent and appreciable (on an average monthly basis) deceleration in the growth rates of centralized credit emission. Moreover, noninflationary sources for financing the deficit of the budget, above all foreign credits, were found and put to successful use. There were two reasons explaining why in the pursuit of this policy it became impossible to check the growth of the money mass: the reduction of the surplus cash reserves of the economic subjects and the acceleration of money circulation. The credit emission of commercial banks, which compensated the reduction of centralized credits, markedly intensified in 1993. Moreover, in the structure of the money mass in 1992-1993 there was a sharp growth in its most liquid part -- the funds on the bank accounts of enterprises and ready money (which, among other things, bears witness to a strengthening in the positions of the economy's shadow sector evading taxes and not mirrored in statistics). Serious changes have occurred in Russia's foreign trade. In 1993 the volume of export nearly doubled that of import. However, a positive balance was reached on account of the fact that there was a considerable reduction of import attended by a slight growth of export. Moreover, the increase in the physical volumes of export takes place in the conditions of a fall in the production of export goods inside the country. During the first seven months of 1993 the funds of enterprises on foreign currency accounts in Russia increased by a mere 0.8 billion dollars (to reach 7.5 billion dollars by the end of August) whereas the funds legally lodged on short-term deposits in commercial banks abroad increased by ten billion dollars and by the end of the year (as estimated) had to reach the sum of about 20 billion. During two years -- from October 29, 1991, to October 29, 1993 -- the real rate of the dollar in Russia (related to the index of consumer prices) fell 16.4-fold. "Dollar inflation" became strongly pronounced especially beginning with July 1993 in connection with the artificial stabilization of the nominal rate of the dollar to the ruble. As a result many Russian sectors have proved to be noncompetitive on the domestic market (motor-car construction, radioelectronics), and the government has recourse of protection measures relative to the tariff regulation of the import of similar goods. On the other hand, the importers' earnings are being depreciated. Russia has got caught in serious dependence on credits from international financial organizations on whose account this rate is being maintained. Russia is a country of unfinished system reforms. In industry there has been a virtual collectivization of property at enterprises in the past two years whereas in agriculture the movement of private peasant farmers has not yet risen to its feet. In these two past years industrial output has fallen by a third, yet the slump was not structural but general in character. The toughening of the monetary policy has taken place on account of depressing the demand for investments. Labor productivity keeps sharply falling in connection with the impossibility of dismissing workers (a consequence of collective ownership). This generated additional pressure from the inflation of costs and amounts to a corollary of the government's formal approach towards reforms.
