The Japanese authorities recently launched a probe into a trading firm of Japan "suspected of violating the regulations of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom)" and are conducting a despicable anti-DPRK campaign, connecting the case with the innocent DPRK in a far-fetched way. The vice-chairman branded this as an utterly groundless fabrication to impair the dignity and prestige of the DPRK and another shameless political intrigue, which shows the true colour of the Japanese authorities who resort to hostile propaganda, reversing black and white. He said: "At a time when the DPRK and the United States are moving toward a package solution of the problems for a fundamental settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula thanks to the self-determined and aboveboard diplomatic policy of the DPRK, the Japanese authorities have launched a new smear campaign against the DPRK. This is an unpardonable challenge to throw a wet blanket over the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks and isolate and blockade the DPRK. This is also an anachronistic act against the world public that wish the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations through dialogue and negotiation. "With no pressure and plot can the international reactionaries and the Japanese authorities undermine the international prestige of the DPRK or block the advance of the Korean people. "The Japanese authorities must look straight at the trend of the times and immediately stop the smear campaign and hostile acts against the DPRK."
