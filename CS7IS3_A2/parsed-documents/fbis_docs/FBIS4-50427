"Exports did not slide as in the corresponding period last year, and imports did not spin out of control," said Wu Yi, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) . Exports grew by 18.7 per cent over the first quarter last year and imports grew by 18.2 per cent, according to Customs figures. Wu stressed that China plans to achieve a virtual balance between its imports and exports by the end of this year, with total foreign trade standing at around $200 billion. China suffered a deficit of $12.2 billion last year, partly because of a booming domestic market that drew resources away from exports. Wu said the unification of the two-tier foreign exchange rate system presents China with an unprecedented opportunity to develop exports. However, higher export costs threaten to offset almost all the benefits brought by the foreign exchange reform. Exports prices are being driven up by rising costs, especially of raw materials, as foreign countries lower their purchasing prices for imports in the wake of the renminbi's devaluation. The standardized exchange rate now is 8.7 yuan per dollar, compared with 5.7 yuan before. The prices of raw materials have risen in part because of the unexpected growth in investment in fixed assets. This has made it difficult for the central bank, the People's Bank of China, to keep a cap on capital spending. Analysts said that the recent move by the State Council to cancel some of the country's futures trading markets would also help slow the price spiral. In particular, the steel futures trading market was stopped to prevent the price of steel, the most sought-after product in the investment expansion, from soaring. Economists maintain that unchecked speculation by futures traders has unjustifiably forced up the country's overall price level. The new Import and Export Bank will also benefit Chinese exporters of value-added machinery and electronics. "It seems that China's exports are facing a bundle of lurking problems, but they are progressing steadily," said a senior government economist. Another major threat to exports is unchecked competition among domestic exporters, who tend to slash their prices to win foreign market share but at the expense of national interests. Wu Yi said China is intensifying its efforts to bring order to exports.
