On the one hand, in the "tide of rural labor" one wave overtopped another wave, but through correct "dredging" the flow became orderly; on the other hand, a "reversion" phenomenon also appeared. Of course, it is normal for a tide to rise and fall, to go out and come back in, but as the "phenomenon of the regression of an adverse tide" it has a fairly deep connotation. The peasants who went outside their native places widened their horizons, changed their ideas, increased their knowledge, and learned skills. When they returned to their native places they became the backbone in developing the economy. This point can help people to recognize the positive aspect of the "tide of rural labor." Furthermore, this information proves that the base for the broad masses of peasants to become well-off is not the city but rather the rural areas. Tai: Tai Dewen (secretary of the Fuyang Prefecture CPC Committee) Gao: Gao Lu (staff reporter) Gao: In recent years the "tide of rural labor" has became a big part of the landscape of China's economic and social life. The various issues initiated by this tide have drawn widespread attention in all circles of society. Your report on the investigation and study of the question of the transfer of the surplus labor force in the rural areas of Fuyang prefecture made a deep impression on us. Tai: Making an investigation in this aspect was necessitated by reality and work. Fuyang Prefecture is a large-population region with 1 percent of China's population and a large region for traditional agriculture. Following the deepening of rural reform, the development of the market economy, and the raising of the degree of agricultural mechanization, the rural surplus labor force has become larger and larger. There are now about 3 million members of the rural surplus labor force in Fuyang Prefecture. This a superiority of our prefecture's economic development. In 1992 our prefecture exported 1 million members of the labor force. We cannot but consider the question of "where the million-strong army is heading." Gao: Of the two investigation reports you provided, I feel that the investigation of the phenomenon of "reverse flow" in the "tide of rural labor" was most enlightening. Tai: In the process of investigating the question of the transfer of rural surplus labor, we discovered that over the past two years a phenomenon of the "regression of an adverse tide" has appeared in exported labor. Workers, making use of the skills they learned on the outside, have returned to their native places and set up and run a large number of township-town enterprises. Gao: In what numbers and on what scale? Tai: According to the initial investigation, there are in the prefecture more than 700 enterprises of this type, and they have a certain influence and are on a considerable scale; some of them have become the backbone of township-town enterprises on the two levels of county and township. The township-town enterprises set up and run by workers who were formerly exported and who have returned to their native places are becoming a new "growing point" in our prefecture's development of township-town enterprises. Gao: According to our investigations, in the provinces of Anhui, Sichuan, Hubei, and Hebei, in some prefectures in which there fairly many rural workers who were in the outward flow, there has appeared in the past two years this phenomenon of the "regression of an adverse tide." Of the more than 2,000 peasants of Jinniu Town in Dazhi County, Hubei Province who engaged in trade or worked outside the town, more than 700 of them have returned to the town. It's too bad that the meaning of this phenomenon of "regression" has not yet drawn sufficient attention from the people. Tai: Looking at it from the angle of the future, we see that the development and use of this returning labor force is more important than the current export of labor. Returnees: Putting Their Ability to Good Use in the Family Gao: In your investigation of typical examples, were any patterns discovered? Tai: In our investigation of typical examples, we selected throughout the prefecture 50 persons who were part of the "regression of an adverse tide" and who set up and are running township-town enterprises. The results of the investigation were: 1) by age, 23 percent were in the 20-30 age bracket, 71 percent were in the 30-40 age bracket, and 6 percent were in the over 40 age bracket; 2) by education, 35 percent had a senior middle school education, 46 percent had a junior middle school education, 10 percent had an elementary school education, and 9 percent were illiterate or semiliterate; 3) by time worked outside their native places, in general this was five to 10 years; and 4) by skill level, these people have basically mastered and even become proficient in one or more skills, about 60 percent of them when outside being the skilled backbone elements of the units they worked in, and about 20 percent of them when outside being both skilled backbone elements and middle-level managerial personnel. Gao: That is to say, among these pioneers who "regressed" to their native places, the great majority are young and middle-aged (more than 90 percent being in the 20-40 age bracket), their educational level is fairly high (more than 80 percent having a junior middle school or senior middle school education), their time outside was fairly long, and they have mastered skills. Tai: Shui Xinyou [3055 2450 0645], a peasant from Aiting Town in Linquan County, in 1987 went to work in a leather shoe factory in Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province. By his practice there he gained consumate skill, and the uppers and soles of the shoes that he stripped could bear a strength of as much as 18 kilograms, far exceeding the ministry-issued standard; they were given a good appraisal at a national comparison and appraisal meeting. After staying outside his native place for six or seven years, he returned in 1993 and set up the Aiting Leather Shoe Factory, after which the supply of its products could not meet the demand. Gao: There are surely not a few such examples. In starting an undertaking, for these "regressors" it is indispensable to have an eye and head for business. Tai: For the most part, they possess a keen insight into markets, an insight that was nurtured when they were working on the outside. For the most part, the rural labor of our prefecture that flowed outside went to the coastal regions, where the market economy is fairly developed. From the time that they began to leave their families, these people placed themselves in the crests and troughts of the waves of the market economy. Gao: In an environment full of competition and risk, it is fairly easy to learn by experience what the role of market mechanisms is, thereby forming a consciousness of competition and an insight into markets. Tai: A peasant from Ningxiao Village, Wangdian Town, Fuyang City in 1989 went to Dongyuan [a county in Guangdong Province] to work in a furniture factory. When he returned to his native place he discovered through a market survey that the factory's products, in his province and neighboring provinces, had a good market, so he set up his own furniture factory. The supply of its products could not meet the demand for them. After being in business for over nine months, the factory achieved an output value of more than 520,000 yuan and obtained a net profit of 120,000 yuan. Niu Wei [3662 0251], a peasant from Guantang town, Haozhou city, went to the Northeast to work at an agrotechnical popularization center, where he learned the skill of duplicating and mixing agricultural chemicals. When he learned that his native place lacked this kind of product, he became aware that there was a big market for it that was worth developing. He returned to his native place and set up a chemical plant that produced many new agricultural chemical products. The plant achieved an annual output value of 740,000 yuan and a profits tax of 60,000 yuan. Gao: The "regressors" who start undertakings in their native places are bound to form economic radiating circles with them as the core, thereby spurring the development of the township-town enterprises there and the entire economy there, raising the income of peasants there, and spurring the adjustment of the rural industrial structure there. Tai: These radiating radii are at the least one or several villages and at the most a dozen kilometers. Zhang Dezhi [1728 1795 5347], a peasant from Taihe County, in 1987 returned to his native place and set up a silk mill, which now is a product base of considerable size. More than 1,000 peasants in the county engage in sales promotion work for the mill's products, and the sales promotion contingent has spread to several provinces and autonomous regions. These peasant sales-promoters have an annual net income of at the least between 3,000 and 4,000 yuan and at the most over 10,000 yuan. Examples of this kind are innumerable. There is now gradually being formed a new pattern in the village and district economy that has the "regressor" pioneers at its core and that breaks through regional boundaries. Reasons for Return: Unlimited Analysis Gao: Of the peasants who went outside their native places to engage in trade or work and who then "regressed" to their native places and started undertakings, some either returned to the "yellow earth," which is a follow-up phenomenon that is bound to accompany the "tide of rural labor." What is needed is to investigate and study many questions. First of all, the exciting cause of their reverse flow or "regression" must be made clear, and then action can be adroitly guided according to circumstances. Tai: In our investigation we discovered that the exciting cause of the "regression" was many-sided. Thinking of one's parents with affection, being reluctant to be away from home, and loving one's native place are one of the subjective reasons. Deng Min [6772 2404], a peasant from Gongdian Town, Lixing County, and more than 10 other young women from neighboring villages together went to Wenling in Zhejiang Province to work, but because their feelings of affection for their parents became stronger each passing day, one by one they returned home. Unwilling to return home and still be poor, Deng Min returned to her native place in 1993 and facilitated the setting up of a handicraft knitwear mill as a joint venture between the local government and Zhejiang Province, with herself as mill director. The mill has now achieved an output value of many ten thousands of yuan and a profit tax of over 80,000 yuan. Zhang Qi [1728 3825] and Zhang Fangli [1728 7685 0448], peasant sisters from Yangchao Town, Yungshang Province, went to Changshu County in Jiangsu Province to work at knitting gloves. Their incomes were sizable, but they also thought of their parents with affection, so they returned home and, raising money by all possible means, led their seven sisters to set up a household glove factory. In the bodies of Chinese peasants are imbedded strong genes for feelings for their relationships and for feelings for their native land. "Every happy festival time I double my thoughts of affection for my parents," "I feel like going back to my native place, just as the stranger bird thinks of his native forest," "Lifting my head I gaze at the bright moon; lowering my head I long for my native place"--These lines of poetry reveal this set of circumstances. Gao: When encountering setbacks or rough spots in human relationships, work, hardships, or other aspects, the language barrier and the difference in living habits will, because of the inhibition of the spirit, intensify the thoughts of affection for one's parents and the love of one's home. This is man's natural reaction or his reaction under certain circumstances. Tai: Next, the raising of the level of demand is also one of the exciting causes of this "regression." Following their increase in income, for those who work outside their native place the pressure of the requirement for survival lessens day by day, and the pressure of safety requirement, emotional requirement, social requirement, and requirement for realization of self-worth becomes stronger day by day. They become dissatisfied with the lifestyle of drifting all over the country; and they hope to get greater respect, hope to get for their worth fuller realization and social recognition. Returning home and starting an undertaking become the optimum choice for satisfying these requirements.
