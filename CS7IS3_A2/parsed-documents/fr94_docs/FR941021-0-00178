FR941021-0-00178 FR941021-0-00022 170. Motorola's proposed system includes intersatellite transmission links in the 23.18&hyph;23.38 GHz band. This proposal falls within the intersatellite service allocation at 22.55&hyph;23.55 GHz. The Committee concluded that Motorola's use of this band would be compatible with other operations in the band, which include operations by NASA, the radio astronomy service, and fixed-terrestrial services. The Committee noted, however, that NASA has indicated it would prefer that any future MSS intersatellite links operate in the 24.45&hyph;24.75 GHz band, which recently was allocated internationally and domestically for intersatellite links. Nevertheless, the Committee, which included a representative of NASA, proposed that we adopt a rule indicating that the 22.55&hyph;23.00 GHz, 23.00&hyph;23.55 GHz, 24.45&hyph;24.65 GHz, and 24.65&hyph;24.75 GHz frequencies are available for use by the intersatellite service. In the Notice, we proposed to adopt the Committee's recommended rule regarding intersatellite service frequencies, coordination with government agencies, and sharing criteria. We adopt the rule as proposed with several minor changes and clarifications suggested by Motorola. E. Service Rules 1. Regulatory Treatment 171. In the Notice, we asked parties to comment on our tentative conclusion that Big LEO MSS service may be offered as a commercial mobile radio service (CMRS). We further sought comment on whether we should exercise our discretion under Section 332(c)(5) 216 to determine that Big LEO space station licensees making satellite capacity available to CMRS providers shall be required to operate as common carriers. In the alternative, we asked parties to comment on how we should regulate Big LEO space station operators if they are not offering CMRS. We noted that when making determinations regarding common carriage obligations in the past, the Commission has examined individual service proposals in light of the criteria delineated in National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners v. FCC, 525 F.2d 630, 642 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 999 (1976) ( NARUC I ). 217 Referencing the two-pronged test in NARUC I, in the Notice, we requested comment regarding (1) the likelihood that space station capacity in this service will be offered indifferently to the public, and (2) if there is no such likelihood, whether there should be a legal compulsion for space segment providers to serve the public indifferently. 218 We also asked for comment on the impact of requiring common carrier operation on the amount of foreign investment and the international coordination of these satellites, given the requirements of Section 310(b) of the Act. 219 216 Section 332(c)(5) reads as follows: ``SPACE SEGMENT CAPACITY. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission from continuing to determine whether the provision of space segment capacity by satellite systems to providers of commercial mobile services shall be treated as common carriage.'' 47 U.S.C. 332(c)(5). 217 Notice, note 2, supra, at para. 80. 218 Id. at paras. 80&hyph;81. 219 Id. at para. 81. 172. In a recent rulemaking, we determined the classification and regulatory treatment of providers of CMRS. 220 Regarding satellite services, we held that, to the extent that a space station licensee provides a service that meets the elements of the CMRS definition, 221 we will generally regulate the provision of that service on a common carrier basis. 222 We concluded, however, that so long as the service provider is not providing service directly to end users, the Commission retains the authority under section 332(c)(5) to continue to employ its existing procedures to determine whether the provision of space segment capacity by satellite licensees to CMRS providers will be offered on a common carrier or private carrier basis. 223 We also determined that the Commission has the discretion to extend this treatment to any entity that sells or leases space segment capacity, to the extent that the entity is not providing CMRS directly to end users. 224 220 Implementation of Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, 9 FCC Rcd 1411 (1994) (CMRS Second Report and Order), recon. pending. 221 Id. at 1457&hyph;58. A commercial mobile radio service is defined as ``any mobile service (as defined in section 3(n)) that is provided for profit and makes interconnected service available (A) to the public or (B) to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public, as specified by regulation by the Commission.'' 47 U.S.C. 332(d)(1). A private mobile radio service is defined as ``any mobile service (as defined in section 3(n)) that is not a commercial mobile service or the functional equivalent of a commercial mobile service, as specified by regulation by the Commission.'' 47 U.S.C. 332(d)(3). 222 It should be noted, however, that we have chosen to forbear (pursuant to Section 332(c)(1)(A)) from the application of certain provisions of Title II of the Act with regard to CMRS providers. As such, for example, CMRS providers are not permitted to file tariffs for their services. See CMRS Second Report and Order, note 220, supra, at 1478&hyph;80. 223 Id. at 1457&hyph;58. 224 Id. at 1457.
