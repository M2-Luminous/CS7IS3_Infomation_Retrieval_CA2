Vladislav Kozyakov examines these two events and he writes: It can safely be predicted that the talks between the presidents of Russia and the United States, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, will be influenced to a very large extent by what happens in the two preceding days in the Belgian capital. Russia is worried about information that Western leaders are looking into requests by a number of East European countries for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On Wednesday, an official reaction to this issue was made known by the publication of a statement by a presidential press secretary. The Russian president warned that an expansion of NATO might lead to a military-political destabilization in key regions of the world. True, Washington says it does not intend at present to support the admission of new members into the alliance. At this stage, in place of full membership, America is offering the concept of Partnership for Peace to the newly independent states of Eastern Europe. However, this American concept needs further clarification. It has not been fine-tuned, so to speak, and details have not been agreed between NATO's members. The temporary character of the Partnership for Peace also deserves some attention. After a period, according to this American concept, all countries wishing to join NATO will be admitted. It's paradoxical that in the changing cirsumstances of the present world, it's precisely NATO that is involved in generating a feeling of apprehension in Europe. In its time the establishment of this military bloc drew a corresponding response and led to the establishment of the Warsaw Pact. Then followed decades of confrontation. Now at the end of the Cold War, when NATO has no Warsaw Pact to contend with, it's causing anxiety with its prospects of an expansion of its membership and drawing closer to the Russian borders. The question arises, Why should the stereotypes of bloc mentality be kept alive in Europe. If Partnership for Peace intends to establish a system of security in Europe, Russia including, then why must this system be based on a military organization of Western Europe. This question becomes more relevant as a new actual system is already in existence. It's the Council for North Atlantic Cooperation, in whose ranks are NATO members as well as countries in the former Warsaw Pact. Why should not the Partnership for Peace see as its final objective not admission of new members into NATO but the creation of an all-embracing collective security in Europe and in the space from Vancouver to Vladivostok, developing for this project the North Atlantic Cooperation Council? This would be quite in the spirit of the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe. In Moscow there is support for the American concept of Partnership for Peace. However, this idea must not be a prisoner of the bloc mentality. It must take into account the security interests of all governments without exception. Partnership for Peace should orientate itself to the creation of a new mechanism for the provision of security for Europe and the world. The new time and the new situation in Europe demands a fresh untried approach to the problem of cementing peace and the development of cooperation. To act from a bloc position in this new era would be at least unrealistic.
