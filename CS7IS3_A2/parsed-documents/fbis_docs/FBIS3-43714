A teenage boy was killed when police opened fire on the crowd which they say had stoned officers. The PAC had called for a joint inquiry into police behavior during the raid, but reports say police have sent a message to the organization's lawyer saying no legal provision exists for a joint investigation. The SAP says only peace officers can obtain statements, and that other factors such as privilege and sub judice rule have to be considered.
