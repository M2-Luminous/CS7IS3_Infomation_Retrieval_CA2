I heard about you long ago, but we met only this winter, bitter and formidable, when I came to Siberia, to your native Krasnoyarsk. The center of Siberian industry was dying, like a beached whale. And only your plant--it is hard to call it a plant, it is a small civilization, a city within a city--was continuing to live, struggle, breathe, and fight. We exchanged our values, our ideology, for the first time then. You are a technocrat. This is a rarity, a find, for the patriotic movement. Members of the opposition are liberal arts figures, philologists, legal scholars, and historians, as a rule. You, though, are the bearer of immense production engineering knowledge and organizational experience. You are linked with modernity, with industry, with the idea of technotronic development. Your activity in the Russian National Assembly and proximity to the top opposition leaders have created for you a firm reputation as a state absolutist and Russian patriot. You became a politician. You became a member of this hastily formed institution of power--the Federation Council. You essentially won the fight with Shumeyko for in order to forestall you he had to accumulate all the influence of the president and the prime minister backing him. What do you, a Siberian, a plant director, an industrialist, feel, having found yourself in this cauldron of new Moscow politics? Your feelings from interaction with this environment? [Romanov] I never previously felt myself to be a politician. This is now the most dangerous period of my life. Military pilots say: "Watch out for them winging you during takeoff." They did not. Figuratively speaking, I am as yet gaining cruising speed. Then it will be time for the plans which I brought with me here and which I would like to embody via the Federation Council. Decent people have been elected. I will contribute to their philosophy the spirit of the military-industrial complex. When, prior to the vote on the candidates for the position of chairman of the Federation Council, I was asked whether I had any experience of parliamentary business, I replied honestly that I did not. I have now built up some such experience. It is negative: The political forces with which I have come into contact and the institutions I have entered are not all that disposed to work for national unification. I mean by this the mutual understanding and interaction of all who wish to survive in Russia and make it great. Political persons and the conflicts connected with them are ultimately transient. How many there have been.... And if the country stands, has not crumbled, state instincts are still, consequently, alive. It is simply that they just cannot become policy and ideology. Unification is occurring as yet merely within institutions and parties and groups of politicians. Even recently the patriots were sharply criticizing the State Duma for amorphousness and conciliation. But the Duma, without even touching on the subject of the amnesty, has shown that the most diverse politicians are disposed to act together in strategic areas. Were this unification to go beyond the framework of parties and institutions, I would feel better in Moscow politics. As far as my technocratic experience, as you put it, is concerned, I met with many plant outfits in Krasnoyarsk and heard one and the same thing everywhere: "We have to work." The plants are buckling under the arrears, and wages have not been paid for months--and people are working, they want to work. This cannot be said of Moscow politicians. A Russian engineer, I was forced to become a politician. [Prokhanov] You speak about unification, the composition of the efforts of the parties, the composition of the tendencies of politicians, each of whom has his own vector, his own political pace, his own experience of catastrophe or victory. I, and not only myself, am tormented by one question. For three or four years we patriots have been attempting to compose a party of national interests, a patriotic party based on the national idea. It cannot be said that these attempts appear absolutely barren. Small political formations: the Russian Revival Party, the Russian Party of Mikhail Korchagin, have been formed. The Slav Assembly has been created. Among the most dynamic is Russian National Unity. There was the attempt to create the Russian National Assembly, in which you actively participated. The National Salvation Front was squashed. All other attempts are coming to naught. Everything is confined to a conference, a congress, at which declarations are made, then organizational apathy sets in, all movements come to a halt.... Why are we unsuccessful here? Is it not because unduly blurred, unduly archaic political formulas such as "Orthodoxy-autocracy-national character" or "Russian solidarity" are made the basis of them, these parties and their ideology? Today's Russia is a multidimensional pulsating structure, in which each region has its own version of the Russian idea. In addition, the present Russia does not have a traditional look. It is oriented toward the future. Perhaps none of these pariahs has a future image, all their values are too tied to the past, and they are unable to adapt tradition to history and actual policy? [Romanov] But in just the same way it has not been possible to create a "presidential" party either. Comminution is a feature of Russian politics. The communists are fragmented, like the democrats also. What significance have all these Moscow parties for the ordinary man? Go to the periphery, as they say in Moscow, call in at a shop or a cowshed, and ask if only: "What is the Constitutional Court, who is on it?" It is not known. Even less is anything known about patriotic politicians. I see as the solution for the patriots the creation of a supra-party bloc based on the center parties with a negligible tilt to the left, but under no circumstances to the right. The leaders of parties and movements should step beyond party ambitions, sit down at the table, and come to some agreement. This supra-party bloc of politicians should go to the people with an intelligible program of national salvation. I do not believe that its success would depend on how far it operated with outmoded ideologies and how it modernized the "Orthodoxy-autocracy-national character" principle. It would depend on whom it persuaded: the Moscow "mass meeting" or those who have their hands on the levers of the economy and power. Such a program is a latent need of both the opposition and the authorities. I heard and read the president's speech in the Federal Assembly. Even he, having become, according to the new constitution, the head of state, is now uttering words inconceivable from his mouth three or four months ago. He has willy-nilly been forced to size up the situation in the country and to construct his--albeit deficient, hypocritical--program in conformity with it. The president spoke in sufficient detail about what needs to be done. But everyone knows this, as it is, I believe. Were an opposition supra-party bloc to explain how it should be done, it would have a chance to win. The politicians who are a part of the bloc must necessarily identify stages and arrange landmarks en route to the goal--promise-landmarks. After all, Khrushchev's "the present generation of Soviet people will live under communism" was not fortuitous. It showed that these authorities understood the importance of the possession, in your definition, Aleksandr Andreyevich, of a future image, albeit "incorrect." They, the politicians, must not be afraid to take on themselves--to the extent of their influence--economic assignments also. Set them six months ahead, say, providing them with resources.... [Prokhanov] I listened to the president's speech with a double feeling, catching in his vocabulary all the words and ideas that we patriots have over three years formulated and offered society and for which we have acquired the title of "conservatives" and "red-browns." He outlined distinctly, in party and oblast party committee fashion, the contours of the catastrophe that has struck Russia. He omitted just one thing: who created the catastrophe. Or was it these "red-browns" who brought the country to disintegration, the stoppage of the plants, the exorbitant prices? Each day on my way to work I pass the Frunzenskaya Embankment, I see daily the enormous Buran--the Russian spacecraft--reminiscent of a once beautiful, but now dead, creature. I was at Baykonur when Buran, having accomplished an unmanned space circuit, landed on the scorching pad. I remember the exultant face of Oleg Baklanov, I remember my own exultation: my state ruled in near-Earth space.... And now Buran has been trotted out posthumously as a laughing-stock. What will be made from it: a bordello, a restaurant, a public restroom? It is like spoils taken on the field of battle from the vanquished USSR. So let us be told who the author of this catastrophe is. Let us be told that it was wrought by Gaydar and Yeltsin, Fedorov and Shumeyko. Two symptomatic blabbings have been agitating minds as of late. On the eve of Clinton's visit the following political formula appeared in the American press and was relayed to Russia by CNN: "America will have to choose between the shock therapy of Gaydar, which, of course, would weaken Russia to the United States' advantage, and a new, more moderate policy, which would preserve Russian potential to some extent, but would protect Russia against a social explosion which could sweep away the supporters of reforms." And recently Gavriil Popov, the superdemocrat, published a program perceived as an attempt to crawl from beneath the rubble of the present political period. He acknowledges in this program that Gaydar's shock therapy was thought up by the Americans to destroy Russia's military-industrial complex. This was said when our submarines stand fast at the piers, when the missile and tank plants are at a standstill, and when the test ranges are dying, military supertechnology is disintegrating, and young intellectuals are going into commerce and pimping. This was said by Popov, whose contribution to the collapse was immense. So why do you members of parliament not name publicly the culprits of the catastrophe before embarking on the restoration of Russia? [Romanov] Why are we not delivering angry philippics against the "regime"? Well, we ourselves, the corps of directors, are to blame for what has happened. And now we face the prospect of a shutdown of production--not random, not partial, but total. This would signify the collapse of the economy and statehood and national catastrophe. Yes, Gaydar and Fedorov have gone. Were we to shout curses after them, we would have to back them up with action also. Stop the plants? Trigger a directors' strike? What's the use.... Our real fault is that we are today, now, not saying, not venturing to tell Chernomyrdin, Soskovets, and Gerashchenko: "Stop. Let's take a look. We acknowledge that on account of a number of Russia's geographical and geopolitical circumstances a market economy may be created even theoretically only in European Russia, along the Trans-Siberian Railroad, at that. We acknowledge that we need a transitional period, that we will not crawl out of the present pit without emergency economic measures. And for this reason the present inflationary drift, when only the idle are not managing to shake money loose from the cabinet, is intolerable. A realistic program of salvation and reconstruction of the dying economy is needed." [Prokhanov] I know that you, Petr Vasilyevich, are working on a multitude of program documents. Could you not briefly give us the essence of this transitional period and these emergency measures and the methodology with which it is possible to halt the catastrophe and undertake the plastic transformation of our tormented economy into a new quality connected with development. [Romanov] Russia has two paths, in my view. The first is to "pupate," to go into isolation, and to tackle all problems, technological and structural modernization included, thanks only to our own internal resources, becoming a strong national state. Russia should imbibe, figuratively speaking, the umbilical cords, protruding from its body, of the defunct empire, lines of communication, and infrastructure that linked it only recently with the former Soviet republics. But this would take, considering the scale of the present collapse, 60-70 years. The second is to accept the role of "raw material" state being imposed by the "world community," making in this sense a temporary concession. Russia would export raw material and import technology and would one day once again become a strong, but not isolated, national state, slowly once again assembling the empire. Unless a benign political miracle occurs, the actual development of Russia will choose a path between these two not all that optimistic options. What emergency measures are possible in these contours? Regardless of the forms of property, it is necessary to administer in centralized fashion in conjunction with the territories all the extractive sectors, power engineering, transport, and foreign economic activity. It is essential to introduce strict price control of the economy via a lowering of outlays in the production sectors and differentiated tax rates for brokerage, commercial, financial, and banking services. A consolidated government contract by sector is needed simultaneously. We would in this way immediately be giving the Russian manufacturer priority. He would henceforward know precisely what profit he would make in production, and what, in commerce, and how much he would lose in taxes. All investment funds, banks, and other similar financial institutions should be adroitly oriented toward investment in efficient works with a necessary government guarantee in the event of a failure to achieve the contemplated efficiency. It does not need to be said that the activity of the State Property Committee and the Antitrust Committee of the Russian Federation would be suspended for the period of the emergency measures. It is essential to sharply limit, to "suppress," imports of consumer goods, primarily durables, if, of course, these prohibitions do not entail the danger of starvation. Each bottle of Italian mineral water on the Krasnoyarsk shelves means a dollar not invested in the Russian economy. And investments have declined in Russia by a factor of six or seven since 1991 as it is. This, incidentally, is a special problem barely soluble within the framework of emergency measures alone. It is necessary also to establish sectoral wage differentiation, movement beyond the framework of which should entail severe penalties. Finally, for the Russians coming to us from the near abroad we need to create jobs in the agro-industrial zones which are promising from the viewpoint of the market economy. The move should, of course, be undertaken in planned fashion, with the simultaneous closure of works that have no future. [Prokhanov] This is akin to a plan for the restoration of the national economy after a war. It creates an ideological field, toward which the people are predisposed. The people must understand that they have been bombed to destruction. And that we will have to restore the devastated cities and lines of communication and also human relations by way of the injection in the restoration of the surplus quantity of our own calories. [Romanov] Yes, belt-tightening once again, for the umpteenth time.... Agrarian problems were discussed recently in a committee of the upper house of parliament. I said that no government financial injections would in themselves save the situation. We need a program of salvation of the agrarian complex--as specific as possible, for a year or 18 months to two years. And for the sake of it, this program, we would tighten our belts. And the people would understand were there at least some changes for the better in two years. [Prokhanov] You have spoken about the creation of a national political alliance, a congress of politicians, and have drawn its boundaries, in which tremendous political potential is condensed. It means, most likely, not only politicians and their parties and allies but also vast social groups and classes. The working class, peasantry, technical and liberal arts intelligentsia, and even the new bourgeoisie to some extent. On what kind of base do you conceive of the creation of this alliance? On the basis of the State Duma or in the garb of a new political super-organization? [Romanov] We need to think sooner about ideology than about organization and to find comprehensible, plastic slogans explaining reality and outlining--once again I avail myself of your term, Aleksandr Andreyevich--a future image, an image of the near future. After all, whatever one's attitude toward the Bolsheviks, it has to be admitted that ideologically they operated very dexterously in 1917. They did not say that they had appointed Russia "to set alight the fire of world revolution." They said: "Peace to the peoples, the land to the peasants, the plants and factories to the workers!" We should be understood by all: from the nationally oriented "bourgeois" to the retirees who are living by begging. The "bourgeois" need to be told that if they begin to build national industry, they will be exempted from taxes. And they do not need to be told what this means. If, however, they start simply to "turn over money," the financial inspector will have them in his clutches. And only this way, not the other way about. We will offer retirees selective social programs. And so forth. So if such a program is taken up, I am prepared on my responsibility to formulate and put into practice what my city and my sector need. Not debate, it is necessary, I repeat, to do something and to know how to do it. [Prokhanov] You are a general director. You should lead a technocratic train into this political bloc. You have the authority of a man and the subtle internal laws and tendencies of the corps of directors. I have, I confess, long ceased to understand what is happening in it.... [Romanov] The same as in the country. [Prokhanov] In the good old days I knew this very stratum of directors. I saw their tragedy, the smashing of the corps of directors in Gorbachev's times. At first they came to elect them, the directors, gave them over to be torn to pieces by the mob.... [Romanov] Remember how Gorbachev on many occasions said in public: Let's fall on the bureaucracy together, we, from above, you, the people, from below? [Prokhanov] Yes, this was the first blow at the base stratum of the Soviet state. The directors then came to be persecuted, and they were declared the "principal conservatives" and the exponents of the "communist conspiracy." They were defamed as, virtually, the "second structure after the KGB impeding perestroyka." While having sustained heavy losses, the corps of directors withstood these two blows, nonetheless. Subsequently, against their wishes, the directors awoke one day as multi-millionaires, virtually. The oblast property committees appointed for them super-high salaries, and they were permitted via easily obtainable licenses to engage in the commercial exportation of products overseas. [Romanov] But, despite this, the directors held the work force together and prevented it disintegrating. Nor do they all have such super-high salaries--in my circle, at least. [Prokhanov] But as of late many of the directors whom I know have had the constant feeling that this "small social world" at the enterprises is on the verge of disintegration. The directors are cringing beneath the sullen looks of the workers.... [Romanov] They are right to have this feeling, possibly. After all, for the past eight years the authorities have done everything to keep the directors out of politics and to ensure that they not perceive their responsibility for the enterprise on the scale of the association, the main administration, the sector, or the economy as a whole and that they get used to feeling that they are "on their own." I remember Kremlin meetings under Gorbachev and Silayev. Even then we directors were speaking at the top of our voices about the crisis, about how to get out of it. There was a great deal of talk, but nothing was done. Subsequently various forces on a multitude of occasions attempted to place the directors beneath the most diverse political banners. Ultimately they threw up their hands and concentrated on the problems of their own enterprises. And it was at this moment that they ceased to be for the workers representatives of the state at their enterprise, and they have not yet become regular capitalist bosses. Nonetheless, you are right: The corps of directors is still a real force incorporating also an organized structure, possession of the keys to technology, and a social infrastructure. And for this reason the struggle for it will continue. [Prokhanov] Volskiy's attempt to capture the affections of the corps of directors, accumulate it in the Party of Industrialists, and create a political battering-ram from the directors is the best known. Against the background of Tizyakov's aborted attempt, it appeared successful for some time. Tizyakov was dislodged from politics after August 1991. Volskiy evaporated in October 1993. Quite recently Skokov held in your parts, Krasnoyarsk, a congress of the Federation of Commodity Producers of Russia. I saw him after this. He is a strong politician and a connoisseur of the corps of directors, but he is by no means certain of the success of his mission--the national consolidation of the technocrats. Is it possible, in your view, to consolidate the directors politically and teach them to uphold the political interests of their corporation, not only of the economic lobbies? And who could do this? The directors have been rejecting one leader after another.... [Romanov] Permit me to disagree: First of all, it is not a question of leaders but of ideology. Only ideology drives the army, only thanks to ideology do the lines of communication run, only it consolidates the classes. But the directors cannot have their own, "directors'" ideology. But there is formally no official ideology either. It is not known whether statehood itself exists or not. It seems to me that we need only say the word, the main word. Pose the problems on whose resolution the corps of directors, sober-minded government officers administering territories and fearing a social explosion, and national entrepreneurs could consolidate. A mobilization plan is needed for the salvation of Russia. And it is in it, in this plan, that an "informal" official ideology, an official instinct, should be manifested. And I am afraid that if in the coming weeks what I have attempted to formulate is not stated publicly, this initiative will have been intercepted.
