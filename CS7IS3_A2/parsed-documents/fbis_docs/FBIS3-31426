Now, the Hungarian prime minister has referred to a five- or six-year period for joining the European Union (EU), but Community sources continue to speak of a longer delay. Could this stance create a critical attitude to the EU in Hungary? [Goncz] I believe that the criticism must be placed in the background; first comes necessity. I agree with the prime minister -- namely, with the five- or six-year period for joining the EU -- but no one could say that what we have received is little. We never expected subsidies; rather, assistance to modernize our economy, and, in return, we offer the West a market. Unfortunately, because of the economic recession, this process is slower than expected. [Batalla] Do you trust in the Spanish Government's support to join the EU? [Goncz] It is absolutely essential. I am going to raise the matter (on the visit to Spain), but I am aware that I am knocking at an open door, because over the past two years there have been Spanish statements in favor of our stance. The reservations which may exist in Spain stem from agricultural issues, but the apprehensions seem to have diminished. [Batalla] But while Hungary is seeking to open the EU's doors, those of NATO have been closed to it. How do you interpret the Partnership for Peace? Do you believe that it is a new Yalta, another division of Europe? [Goncz] To put it in those terms is rather exaggerated. I do not believe that they wish to exclude us from NATO. There is a certain feeling of anxiety in NATO because it has not yet defined its role in the new European system, and I believe that it has become somewhat alarmed at the responsibility of coping with the security of so vast an area. Therefore the Partnership for Peace is a very important step to guarantee European security. [Batalla] But do you believe that the aim announced by President Clinton of preventing another wall from being erected in Europe will be achieved in this way? [Goncz] I hope so. [Batalla] That is, you do not interpret the Partnership for Peace as a concession to Russia. [Goncz] Obviously there are signs that, following the change which has occurred in Russia, the Western powers are trying not to provoke Moscow, and so the Russian attitude also influences NATO's decisons. It must not be forgotten that this part of Europe is an intermediate area between Germany and Russia, and if I say that Russia is neither Asia nor Europe but Russia, we have the responsibility of trying to attract Russia as close as possible to Europe, but in view of the internal situation in Russia, the central European countries' entry (into NATO) could be necessary at any time. [Batalla] So do you fear Russian nationalism? [Goncz] I do not fear nationalism, but I observe it with concern. However, I do not believe that it could stimulate Hungarian nationalism either on the right or on the left. I trust that the Russian process of change will continue. [Batalla] But in Budapest there are those who believe that the Partnership for Peace is -- like 1938 (Munich), 1956 (Budapest), and 1968 (Prague) -- further proof that the West is not prepared to die for central Europe. Do you agree with this opinion? [Goncz] Thank God, now it (the West) does not have to die for these countries. And let me say that this criticism is made more frequently in the Western press than in the Hungarian press. [Batalla] Then how do you explain Hungary's change of attitude to Serbia? Why has Budapest softened its attitude to Belgrade, as is clear from a visit by the Hungarian foreign minister, in return for guarantees concerning the Hungarian community of Voivodina? [Goncz] The economic embargo against Serbia is costing Hungary a very great deal, and we have strictly observed the international sanctions. So far we have received over 70,000 refugees -- many of them of Hungarian origin -- from Bosnia and Serbia. And from the practical viewpoint, we would not be opposed to easing sanctions, if the UN demands are accepted, because what they are doing is to increase the misery -- not resolving the military conflict. Nor must it be forgotten that around 400,000 Hungarians and around 200,000 Serbian refugees live in Voivodina (an autonomous region of Serbia). I believe that it could be of great assistance to Europe that the representative of the Hungarian minority in Voivodina negotiated with Serbian President Milosevic two weeks ago. And so I would not say that we are being softer but that we are in favor of talking. We will not act unilaterally as far as reviewing sanctions is concerned, but -- I emphasize -- this atttitude is a sign of change not only on Hungary's part but also on Serbia's part. [Batalla] How could the Yugoslav conflict affect the issue of the Hungarian minorities outside Hungary? Do you deem possible a conflict with the neighboring countries in which Hungarian minorities live? [Goncz] If by conflict you mean war, I do not believe so, but if you are asking whether we are concerned about the fate of these Hungarian minorities, we will indeed be concerned until an international agreement laying down each side's responsibilities is reached. [Batalla] Does Budapest have any territorial claim to the regions with Hungarian minorities? [Goncz] The history of Transylvania (Romania) or Slovakia cannot be understood without the Hungarians, who have lived there for 900 years. We do not wish to change the borders, but we want these minorities to be able to preserve their identities. Any minority is always a part of two systems -- the motherland and the country in which it lives. If we decide that Catalonia is a constituent element of Spain, Catalonia is obliged to have two kinds of loyalty -- to Spain and to Catalonia. As far as irredentism is concerned, 6 million Romanians and 2.5 million Hungarians live in Transylvania. Nobody can believe that we would want to have 6 million Romanians within our borders. [Batalla] Hungary has experienced a major transformation since 1990. But, with a view to the elections on 8 May, polls indicate a strong advance by the Socialist Party (formerly communist). Do you believe that the social discontent of part of the electorate with the pace of change could benefit the former communists, as has happened in Lithuania and Poland? [Goncz] We are talking about the Socialist Party, which was originally created by ex-communists who support reform, which currently identifies itself with social democracy, and which has for the last four years been working in parliament as a democratic party. But in any case, I believe that two possibilities could arise from the elections: either a conservative-liberal coalition or a socialist-liberal coalition. One thing is clear, and I can guarantee it: Hungary's positions on the economy and on foreign policy are not going to change in either case.
