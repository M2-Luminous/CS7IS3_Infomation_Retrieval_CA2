Wishing It and Ourselves Success"] [Text] Not long before the memorable 21 September, at the old parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, I was shown the schedule for the preparation of draft laws in 1993-1994. More than 30 of them directly affected the Armed Forces. I would not presume to judge how far all these drafts truly reflected the vital problems of the Army, servicemen, and their families, but certainly the schedule itself indicated the existence of a comprehensive program of legal provision for the life and activities of the Armed Forces. Suffice it to say that the draft Fundamentals of Legislation on Veterans had already passed its first reading and was close to becoming law. I recall this today only because I would like the new parliament's deputies and us to remember the purpose of the lofty assembly -- not only to resolve Federation Council and State Duma property questions, not only to enable factions to get down to brass tacks, make political statements and debate with the government and the president, but also to carry out meticulous work on Russian legislation. Particularly as it turns out that our legislation is far from perfect and has big gaps in it, like a ship on the stocks. But this is just one area in which legislators apply their efforts. One of many. And servicemen, of course, are one stratum of the population that is waiting impatiently for the rule-of-law state to take their interests into account. If one is talking about laws that have already been adopted, they represent merely a kind of foundation stone -- there is no end of work to be done to provider the superstructure and work out the details. Both chambers of the Federal Assembly start work today, 11 January. Having found their workplaces, not without difficulty (and scandal), our elected representatives have to solve a mass of organizational questions -- who is to head the chambers, who is to head the committees and commissions, what the standing orders should be, what to pay attention to first and foremost, and so on. At the stage of consultations the parliamentary forces did not make much progress toward accord. But let us hope that the very atmosphere of parliamentary business will attune the deputies to cooperation. As for various threatening statements by the leaders of factions in the State Duma, let us put them down to the obligatory rhetoric on such occasions. Of course, it would be naive to hope that the new parliamentarians will focus exclusively on legislative activity. The obligatory backcloth, as in any parliament, will be political struggle. The question is to what extent will this struggle preoccupy deputies' minds and will there be any room left for actual legislation. We are all faced with an example of the tragic denouement of the conflict between the two branches of authority. Will this lofty assembly be the bulwark of a rule-of-law state or will it turn into another source of political tension in the country, embroiling the broadest strata of the population in an internecine struggle? Unfortunately, there are few grounds for optimistic forecasts at the moment. On the one hand, the energy of election rivalry is not yet spent and is still making an impact, on the other hand, the new parliamentarians' ambitions are beginning to take shape. Naturally, the interplay of these ambitions is hotting up the atmosphere of the Federal Assembly, which was not exactly cool to begin with. What can one hope for in such a situation? The common sense of the majority of parliamentarians, that is all. Presumably, only a few of them will not be aware that what is being decided today is the fate not of individual statesmen and politicians who see themselves as irreplaceable, but the fate of the reforms, and, ultimately, the fate of Russia. In fact, it is all clear and simple: If this parliament turns into an arena of intransigence, with squabbles and feuds as its main attractions, we will all have to forget about our dreams of a civilized, rule-of-law state for a long time. So a new chapter of Russian parliamentarianism is beginning. It is hard to imagine any Russian citizen not wishing the Federal Assembly success. In the end, any other outcome would result in irrevocable losses for society and the forfeiture of civil peace. But, as the say, let us wait and see.
