FR940513-0-00148 FR940513-0-00034 There was general agreement among these comments that the fact that lumens will vary between base-up and base-down applications should be addressed in the disclosure requirements. Most comments also agreed that, if there were more than a five percent difference between base-up and base-down lumens, manufacturers should be required to disclose each separately, disclosing base-down lumens to the best of their ability. 139 The Commission agrees that, to the extent the base-up/base-down positioning of compact fluorescent lamps affects the light output of the lamps significantly, those differences in light output should be disclosed. The Commission finds that a difference of more than five percent in lumen output is significant, and has determined that the labeling rules shall require disclosure of light output in lumens for both base-up and base-down positions when the manufacturer has reason to believe that the difference between the two disclosures would be more than five percent. Therefore, if the manufacturer has reason to believe the light output at a base-down position would be more than 5% different, the label also must disclose the light output at the base-down position or, if no test data for the base-down position exist, that the light output for a base-down position might be more than 5% less. See ยง305.11(e)(1)(E) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 139 LRC (Tr.), 235; ACEEE (Tr.), 239, (Supp.), GG&hyph;21, 3 (would prefer that a test procedure for base-down lumens be developed but supports disclosure based on multiplier in interim); NEMA (Tr.), 272; Philips (Supp.), G&hyph;12, 1. c. CRI and CCT. Some comments suggested that the Commission require the disclosure of the color rendering index (``CRI'') and the correlated color temperature (``CCT'') for compact fluorescent lamps. 140 These two measurements are used by the industry to describe the color of the light that compact fluorescent lamps produce. The record on whether these factors should be disclosed is insufficient for the Commission to prescribe labeling requirements. Although these are useful disclosures for commercial consumers and for some knowledgeable residential consumers, they are not necessary for them or other purchasers to select the most energy efficient lamps to fill their lighting needs. Additionally, it would be difficult to explain the meaning and use of these items in concise and simple terms on the limited space available on lamp packaging. To the extent such information is important, it is likely that manufacturers, utility companies and other interested parties voluntarily will provide that information on packaging or by other means. If they do not and consumers are dissatisfied with the performance of compact fluorescent lamps, they will not make repeat purchases of compact fluorescent lamps. Consequently, the Commission is not requiring the disclosure of CRI or CCT for compact fluorescent lamps. 140 WA SEO, GG&hyph;18, 3; MA AG, GG&hyph;8, 3, (Supp.), GG&hyph;24, 1&hyph;2; OR DOE, GG&hyph;13, 5&hyph;7, 7&hyph;8; ORSU, GG&hyph;14, 2&hyph;3. EPCA defines these two terms as follows: The term ``color rendering index'' or ``CRI'' means the measure of the degree of color shift objects undergo when illuminated by a light source as compared with the color of those same objects when illuminated by a reference source of comparable color temperature. 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(J) (West Supp. 1993). The term ``correlated color temperature'' means the absolute temperature of a blackbody whose chromaticity most nearly resembles that of the light source. 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(K) (West Supp. 1993). The NPR proposed including these definitions of CRI and CCT in the Rule because they are terms that will often be used in connection with the marketing of fluorescent lamp products and because DOE may include them in its standards or test procedure rules. d. Operating temperature. OR DOE recommended that the Commission require disclosure of the effect of operating temperature on compact fluorescent lamps. OR DOE stated that many fluorescent products do not start or operate well at very low temperatures, such as in outdoor lighting in cold temperatures, and do not provide full light output at very low or very high temperatures. 141 The record does not contain sufficient specific information for the Commission to conclude how significant and extensive the effects of temperature are on compact fluorescent lamps in actual practice and to determine what specific disclosures are needed. Moreover, it appears that manufacturers already disclose the temperature factor in some instances on compact fluorescent lamp packages. To keep the required disclosures simple and concise, therefore, while fulfilling the statutory mandate concerning the important information the labeling rules should provide, the Commission has determined not to require disclosures concerning the operation of compact fluorescent lamps under these operating conditions. 141 OR DOE, GG&hyph;13, 5&hyph;6. OR DOE's comment directed this concern to all fluorescent lamp products. Because general service fluorescent lamps are purchased overwhelmingly for commercial use, and most commercial purchasers are more knowledgeable about the factors affecting performance of those lamp products, the Commission is addressing this issue primarily as it concerns compact fluorescent lamps purchased by residential consumers.
