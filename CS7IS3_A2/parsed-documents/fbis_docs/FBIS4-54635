The defenders on the Bihac section of the front, the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, and the Bosanska Krupa and Buzim areas are constantly being attacked with anti-aircraft weapons and heavy machine guns. They shelled indiscriminately the front lines of defense and civilian targets with 82-mm and 120-mm mortars several times during the night. Members of the Kladusa paramilitary army did not keep still either. Their artillery in Golubovici was particularly active. They shelled farmers working in the fields. They inflicted substantial damage and killed a large number of cattle in the villages around Todorovo and Varoska Rijeka. They also carried out mortar and gun attacks and tried to provoke infantry attacks on other lines of separation. The increasing rift in Abdic's private army is illustrated by the fact that they have recently been carrying out mobilizations in Velika Kladusa, particularly for the police force. Out of 800 people invited to join the force, only two reported.
