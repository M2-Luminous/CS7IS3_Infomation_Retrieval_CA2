He added that the emergence of the DRY does not at all mean abandoning unity. He pointed out that the Pledge and Accord Document categorically emphasizes adherence to Yemeni unity and the importance of restoring unity on democratic and sound basis." In reply to questions by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT about Sanaa's interest in holding dialogues with what it called the moderates in the YSP in pursuit of peaceful solutions that would bring about a cease-fire and put an end to the current crisis, Yahya said: "That interest in a dialogue with the moderates is not without sinister motives, but despite that, the YSP would welcome such a dialogue and is willing to provide negotiators who place the higher interests of the people and the homeland above all other considerations. He stressed the importance of stopping that destructive war and the need for the attacking forces -- a clear reference to the northern forces -- to return to their pre-May 22, 1990 positions. Yahya said that the call for an end to the war was a public and just demand. He added that to ensure that and prevent more bloodshed and destruction, the northern forces must return to their previous positions. Once that is done, he said, a call could be made for an immediate start of the negotiations without prior conditions, and all issues could be raised at the negotiating table and addressed with open minds. [Yemeni Planning Minister] Dr. 'Abd-al-karim al-Iryani said the day before yesterday that the initiative presented by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jafri, deputy chairman of the (southern) Presidential Council, and Anis Hasan Yahya was "another form of secession," and that "al-Jafri has no authority or legitimacy," but Yahya reaffirmed the need to stop this war. He said: "What is happening in our country is no longer an internal Yemeni affair. It is an Arab affair because the effects of the war will extend to the region and undermine its security and stability." He called for Arab League participation in such open and unconditional negotiations. He said that Arab League states' recognition of the DRY is the natural and expected thing but requires the efforts of all the Arab brothers to understand the background and dimensions of the declaration of the new republic. He added that "such recognition would put a final end to the current war in Yemen for which the Yemeni people are paying a high price and in which the Yemeni people are the only loser."
