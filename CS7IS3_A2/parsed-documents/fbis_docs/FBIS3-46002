It was learned from the authoritative state departments that, in 1993, total wages of workers amounted to some 477 billion yuan, up by 83.1 billion yuan or 21.1 percent. The average worker's wage was 3,236 yuan, up by 525 yuan or 19.4 percent over the previous year. By reviewing the basic trend of wages last year, we found the basic characteristic of "one high, one even" in wage increases last year. Reasons for "One High, One Even" "One high" refers to the high rate of increase for wages compared with previous years. Compared with 1992 and 1991, wage increases in 1993 were 3.5 and 10.1 percentage points higher respectively. The comparatively high rate of increase was mainly caused by economic growth and price increases. In 1993, the national economy continued to grow at a rather high speed, and a lot of enterprises issued more bonuses to workers or raised wages. In addition, the general price level, especially for goods closely related to people's daily lives, rose substantially. In order to ensure that the people's living conditions would not be worsened, many localities increased price subsidies. According to calculations, economic growth contributed to over 50 percent of the additional wages, and price increases contributed to over 30 percent of the additional wages. "One even" refers to the even monthly rate of wage increases. From the beginning of the year to the end, the rate of increase of workers' total wages always stood at around 20 percent, and there was little variation from one month to the other. The difference between the highest rate of increase, which was in November, and the rate in December was only 2.9 percentage points. These stable and even rates of increase over the whole year have rarely been seen in recent years. This situation was caused, first, by the fact that economic development during the "off season" in 1993 did not slow down, and a rather high growth rate was maintained from the beginning of the year. Second, self-control mechanisms for wage increases in enterprises are being built up gradually, and many institutions paid attention to reserve certain funds when business is good to meet their needs in periods when business is less satisfactory. This prevents wage increases from being affected by seasonal changes in business results. Analysis of the Results of Wage Changes By analyzing the results of the wage changes in 1993, we may find the following facts: --As compared with the economic growth situation, wage increases remained in a normal condition. With the price factor deducted, total actual wages increased by 4.8 percent in 1993, and this was lower than the growth rate in domestic production, which was 13 percent (according to comparable prices); meanwhile, the average rate of increase in real wage income was 3.4 percent, and this was lower than the increase in social productivity, which was 10.9 percent. --The gap between the wage income of workers in different types of economic entities widened. The average wage of workers in state- owned economic units was 3,441 yuan, an increase of 19.6 percent; for workers in urban collective units it was 2,436 yuan, an increase of 15.5 percent; and for workers in other types of economic units it was 5,215 yuan, an increase of 31.5 percent. Among various types of economic units, wage income in collective units increased at the lowest rate, wages in various types of the mixed economy increased fastest, and those in state-owned units were in the middle. The ratio of average wages in collective units to state-owned units to all types of joint ventures widened from 1:1.37:1.88 in 1992 to 1:1.41:2.14 in 1993. --The average wage income of workers in production enterprises increased faster than in nonprofit-making social institutions and administrative institutions. According to statistics, the average wage income of workers in enterprises was close to 3,566 yuan, and increased by 21.7 percent over 1992; the average wage income of workers in nonprofit-making social institutions was 3,173 yuan, and increased by 15.6 percent; and the average wage income of workers in administrative institutions was 3,092 yuan, and increased by only 11.1 percent. The rate of increase in wage income in enterprises was respectively 6.1 percentage points and 10.6 percentage points higher than in nonprofit-making social institutions and administrative institutions. Income gaps between workers in these three types of institutions widened further. Substantial differences also existed in the wage incomes of enterprise workers in different trades and localities as the economic results of the enterprises varied greatly. In particular, the wage income of workers in enterprises which were forced to partly or fully suspend operations was even lower. --There were substantial differences in rates of wage increases in different areas. As economic development in the southeastern coastal area was fast and attained a high level, the rate of increase in wages there was much higher than in the interior areas. According to November's statistics, total wages in the coastal areas mostly increased at a rate above 25 percent; in particular, rates of increase in Jiangsu and Guangdong were above 30 percent. However, almost all of the interior provinces recorded growth rates of less than 20 percent, and the rate in Shaanxi was only 10.9 percent. Because there are a large number of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in the three northeastern provinces, the rate of wage increases was rather low there, and they were all below 20 percent, and the rate in Heilongjiang was only 9.1 percent. In areas where the economy grew fast and wages also increased fast, substantial differences also existed in the actual rate of wage income increases from one district to another. Main Problems With Current Wage Changes As the self-control mechanism in enterprises to adjust wage increases was not perfect enough, the economic efficiency of wage expenditure is not high enough at present, and this is the most prominent problem in the current situation in wage changes. It is known that many enterprises continue to issue bonuses while operating in the red. Some enterprises even continue to promote workers to higher grades when their operations have been suspended partly or completely and when they find it hard to issue wages normally. In many enterprises, the purpose of adopting a universal labor contract system and post-and-skill-related wage system is to increase wages. Most enterprises hope that they can pay more wages to their workers but few people care about the economic efficiency of wage expenditure. Some experts in this field hope that the state authorities will relax controls over total wage expenditure in enterprises in an orderly way and will allow market forces to adjust wage increases in enterprises. Through the "wage--costs--prices--demand" mechanism, the issuance of wages will be linked with the survival of enterprises, and the problem will thus be better resolved.
