The purpose of the forum was to study ways to improve the management of journals in conjunction with the implementation of the national propaganda and ideological work conference guidelines, to bring into full play the press' role in correct guidance of public opinion, and to prompt the media to more effectively carry out the task of "guiding the people with correct public opinion." The forum was attended by officials from RENMIN RIBAO'S XINWEN ZHANXIAN [JOURNALISTIC FRONT], XINHUA NEWS AGENCY's ZHONGGUO JIZHE [CHINESE JOURNALISTS], and the Central Television Station's JIANSHI YANJIU [TELEVISION STUDY]; as well as from 15 central and local journalistic periodicals and research institutes in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang. Xu Xinhua, director of the Information Bureau, chaired and spoke at the forum. Along with the rapid development of the journalistic undertaking since reform and opening up, the number of journalistic periodicals in publication has increased to more than 30, forming an important component of the journalistic undertaking. They have played a significant role and achieved fruitful results in promoting theoretical research of journalism, pressing for journalistic reform, and enhancing journalists' political and professional qualities. In the light of the realities of management, the forum's participants analyzed in depth the current condition of journalistic periodicals, exchanged experiences in managing the journals under new circumstances, and further clarified the orientation in management. They believed that along with the progress in reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive, it is necessary for the journals to bring into full play their role in correct guidance by studying journalistic theories, summarizing journalist work experiences, identifying practical problems, and enhancing the overall quality of journalists. The forum participants deemed the strengthening of guidance with ideology and theory as the core issue of the role of journals in correctly guiding public opinion. How should the media guide people with correct public opinion in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics? How should the media cope with the requirements for developing a socialist market economy in the course of establishing such a structure? How should the media keep abreast of the demand for building socialist spiritual civilization? To find the answers to these questions, journalistic periodicals should persist in taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide and adhere to the party's basic line in actively guiding journalists to study new circumstances, to summarize new experiences, and to solve new problems. They should uphold the principle of party spirit and the party's basic principles in going all out to conduct the study of journalistic theories, promoting journalistic reform, and improving the quality of press publicity. They should enhance their sense of responsibility and awareness of the overall interests, of reform and opening up, and of investigations and study to ensure good reviewing and guidance work through press publicity. Efforts should be made to publish journals having more theoretical, salient, relevant, and creative features. The forum participants deemed the enhancement of the overall quality of journalists as one of the journals' major tasks. Efforts should be made to improve journalists' ethical standards; and to encourage them to mingle with the masses, to go deep into reality, to work hard, honestly, and with self-discipline, and to conscientiously resist "compensated journalism" and other unhealthy practices. It is necessary to encourage the journalistic circles to turn out outstanding works and train talented personnel for producing special columns, reporters, editors, and commentators well known among readers. It is also necessary to bring into play the journals' functions as the "mobile schools of journalism" in helping journalists improve their political and professional qualities and update their knowledge and concepts. The forum participants urged journalistic periodicals to adhere to their publication objective, and work hard to publish journals with distinctive features. While improving operations and management, they should persist in putting social benefits first, and strive to win support from journalists and to combine social with economic benefits. Leaders of the relevant departments and journalistic units should regard improved management of journals as an important measure for strengthening theoretical study of journalism and for improving journalists' quality, and should attach importance to and support journals' work. The forum participants also reached a common understanding on increasing contacts and coordination to pool the efforts of all.
