The agreement on gradual division of the Black Sea Fleet signed by the Russian and Ukrainian presidents on April 15, 1994, was too general. It voiced the Ukrainian holding of ten-fifteen per cent of warships and auxiliary vessels, and separate basing of the Russian and Ukrainian fleets. The document also instructed ministries and departments to coordinate conditions and procedure of the division. A reason for failure of the Black Sea Fleet talks between the Russian and Ukrainian defence ministers in April was their different understanding of the infrastructure notion, said Vice-Admiral of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff Vladimir Kryazhev.
