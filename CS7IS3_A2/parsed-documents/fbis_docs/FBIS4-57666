Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De Leon, the presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, says he is willing to meet with the Zapatist National Liberation Front, EZLN, if that will help the peace process in Chiapas. He is worried that the situation is being used for propaganda purposes by the Party of the Democratic Revolution, PRD. In Manzanillo Municipality, Colima Department, when asked if he would be willing to form an alliance as suggested by other parties, he replied that this only demonstrates that these parties are unsure of winning the upcoming elections and demonstrates the incapacity of their leaders to govern the country. He added the PRI is not divided internally and will enter the election in full strength. Regarding the many changes that have taken place in the government, Zedillo said government officials who do not follow the president's directives should be removed.

The meeting was attended by representatives of all ethnic groups in the country. Santiago Caceres, an Indian leader from Guerrero, says Indians have been treated like children, not adults. Ernesto Zedillo admitted development has not reached the Indian communities. Zedillo said the support given to these communities should respect their customs, without paternalism. The Indian communities need genuine, participative, and determined support so that their conditions as equals, as established in the Constitution, can be demonstrated by their overcoming their needs.

On the other hand, Francisco Ortiz Mendoza, press secretary for the Popular Socialist Party, says the party opposes the presence of foreign observers because it is the Mexicans who must vote and oversee the results of the election. He added that the anomalies that have been observed in the electoral lists are no reason for them to be disqualified or invalidated. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 19 May 94)
