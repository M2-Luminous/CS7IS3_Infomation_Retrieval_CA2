The party's rules and programme were published in Sunday's newspapers. The programme's strategic goal was named as being "the union of all Tajikistan citizens, regardless of their nationality, native language, political beliefs, and professional and ethno-cultural orientation, for the sake of building a law-based, democratic, secular state." Further, the programme called for Tajikistan's "active participation in a civilized transition to a market economy with the maintenance of state-provided education, health care, cultural programmes, social security for the underprivileged, and other social programmes." In their statements, the party's founders do not try to hide their desire to come to power by nominating their representatives to posts in state and governmental structures and by receiving a majority of deputy mandates in the new parliament. However, they categorically condemn any attempts to achieve such goals through violence. At the same time, note independent observers, the new party does not need to win power, since the idea of organising the new political structure originated in the highest governmental structures themselves. Chairman of the new party's organisational committee is First Deputy Chairman of Tajikistan's Supreme Soviet Abdumadzhi Dostyev. The social make-up of the new party is likewise easy to foresee. Many heads of local councils and administrations, as well as a majority of the Republic's industrial managers' corps, have already declared their intention of joining the new party.
