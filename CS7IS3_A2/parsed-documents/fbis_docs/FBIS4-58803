In an interview to AL-JUMHURIYAH daily of Baghdad during his stay in Baghdad he said the political crisis in Yemen was a perilous action but not of the volume leading to a bloody military confrontation. He made it clear that what the media hostile to Yemen unity were mentioning in that what was going on in Yemen as fighting between the north and the south or conflict between the conference and the Socialist parties was groundless. What is true, the Yemeni political official said, is that confirmed by the tangible reality affirming that the conflict is now beteen the unionists and their enemies and between legitimacy and illegitimacy. The proof is that all the national forces believing in the issue of unity and democracy of various political affiliations throughout Yemen are now standing abreast to encounter the rebellion in defense of the people's will that emerged in the elections of April 27, 1993 and clearly appeared on May 22, 1990, the day when the unity was declared. He has added that one of the more significant of the constants on which the unity has been built is democracy, political plurality and peaceful exchange of power. On the strength of these invariables the Yemeni people have gone to ballot boxes to choose the pursuit it accepts. And prior to the day of balloting all the political parties and organisations publicly announced that they would abide by outcomes of the elections, Mr al-Khamisi added. He elaborated that following a short period there emerged on the surface indicators denoting that some of those who abided by the nation arbitration were not sincere in their commitment. And hence the crisis has begun and which in the beginning was putting on the mask of modernisation and reform. But this mask has fallen down in Amman after the conclusion of the document of pledge and agreement and then the world realised who was sincere and who was hesitant. The Yemeni official maintained that the secessionist intentions were disclosed and the political and military events speeded up till they have reached the current painful military confrontation. Mr 'Abd-al Karim al-Khamisi has further pointed out that those who backed up the tyrannous conspiracy on Iraq were the same today standing behind the militay mutiny against the legitimacy in Yemen. He asked all the Arab unionists to resolutely stand against any conspiring on the Yemen unity. It is considered, he further added, a prominent pan-Arab accomplishment in our contemporary age because setback of the unity constitutes a painful blow to the Arab dream aspiring for a prosperous Arab future. Mr al-Khamisi also called upon all Arab countries to defend the Yemen unity against any conspiracy.
