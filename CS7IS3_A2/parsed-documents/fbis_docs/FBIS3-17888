Our observer Vladislav Kozyakov has some details on this subject: A spokesman for the information and press department made a statement from the Defense Ministry. He told ITAR-TASS that Russia is neither developing nor producing biological weapons. The statement was causing a sensation but absolutely groundless reports were made these days by some Western newspapers. For example, the SUNDAY TIMES published by the London-based TIMES produced a horrible picture alleging Russia has at its disposal some super plague powder which can destroy half a million people if 440 (?tonnes) of it were air dropped. What is more, the newspaper reported that the West has no antidote for this agent. It goes without saying that the report provided no evidence to prove this sensation. It couldn't be otherwise, since there is no such agent whatsoever. The author of the article, sent from Washington, Mr. James Adams, refers to the testimonies which had allegedly been made by three Russian defectors. One of them gave some information to the CIA, the other two did so to the British secret service. The names of these persons remain of course unidentified -- as a result nobody can verify whether these people really exist. The developments remind one of the practices utilized by special services during the Cold War period, when the East and the West were competing for who is better at darkening its potential enemy. It was just at that time when the fabrications were spread all over the world about the AIDS virus having been released from the Pentagon laboratories to spread around the globe. One can only wonder why even now the mass media is giving reports with misleading information capable of sowing distrust in international relations, the more so that the current pattern of relations between Russia, the United States, and Britain allows these countries to resolve their own problems -- especially those involved in mass destruction weapons -- proceeding from mutual frankness. It was a tripartite Russian-American-British agreement to achieve this concluded as early as 1992. [sentence as heard] The document of the agreement clearly stipulates all the sides concerned can inspect the facilities which had been used for the production of biological weapons. The main question is: Why did this hoax about Russian biological weapons come into being just now? One of the possible answers to it can be found in the SUNDAY TIMES itself. This is evidence that some people are trying to create suspicion among Russian leadership. Could it be for this very reason that the conclusion can be drawn some Defense Ministry officials could ostensibly be deceiving the president in this respect? However, another possibility is also quite plausible. In Washington and London there appear again some groups which would like to damage the prestige of Russia as a great democratic and peace-loving power. At the same time they are eager to put a fly into the ointment of the current process when constructive partnership among Washington, Moscow, and London is now gaining strength.
