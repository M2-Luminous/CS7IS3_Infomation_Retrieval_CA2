It is fresh in our minds that in his autobiography entitled Suharto: Pikiran, Ucapan dan Tindakan Saya (Suharto: My Thoughts, Sayings and Deeds), published in 1988, the then 67-year-old President said that he believed he was in his final term as President. He said that by the time he accomplished his term in 1993 he would be 72 and "more than old enough" for the job. He said that his children shared the same opinion. In the same context, Suharto was clearly free from any feelings of hurt or affront when he said, "it is not exaggerating when one says that my installation as president on March 11, 1988, was the last one for me." To many people here -- or perhaps abroad as well -- the statement was more convincing than surprising. They became even more convinced of the President's intentions when, three years later, Suharto, who was then in his fifth term, said that he would not try to persuade the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) to elect him for another term. Speaking in a meeting with a delegation of the KNPI National Youth Committee, the President then mirthfully introduced his own acronym, in saying that "It is true I am becoming a `top' man." But he said the meaning of `top' here was the Indonesian acronym TOPP -- T for tua (old), O for ompong (toothless), P for peot (hollow cheeked) and P for pikun (senile). However, aside from those humble remarks, the President has always also said that he would be ready to serve another term if the people asked him to do so. Then, for quite a long time we did not hear such remarks from the head of state, who is now serving his sixth five-year term. But suddenly, last week, Suharto's American biographer, Donald W. Wilson, quoted him as saying that he would step down in due time. What made the statement different from the previous ones was that this time he added that "I am not a president for life." The statement is noteworthy because in so saying the President seemed to have in mind President Sukarno's failure to reject his nomination as "president for life" by the Provisional MPR, whose members were handpicked by him. History has taught us that in accepting the nomination, Sukarno led the nation towards bankruptcy, both political and economic. President Suharto's statement to Dr. Wilson could also mean that some day he may feel the need to decline the people's request for him to accept another term in office. However, the question of when that time will come still constitutes a national puzzle that the current ongoing public debate prompted by the statement has failed to address satisfactorily. This situation is quite understandable because it concerns the right time for Suharto to decide to retire, so that he will not enter history as the country's second president for life. Alamsyah Ratuperwiranegara, the former coordinating minister of social welfare and a staunch Suharto supporter, said recently that he took the President's statement, as quoted by the biographer, as a strong indication that Suharto would not be willing to be nominated for another term in office. The view aired by Alamsyah, a shrewd politician who played an important role in the birth of the New Order government almost three decades ago, is apparently based not only on the conviction that the President was sincere in his remark, but also that Suharto will be 77 years old when his current term ends in 1998. Although Suharto's health has been better than that of the average Indonesian during the last 30 years, at 77 he might well feel that he is too old for the job of leading a nation of almost 200 million people. A wise leader is one who knows when he has to step down. If Suharto makes the right decision, he will no doubt be remembered as a great leader who has always had at heart the interests of all of his people, the poor included. In fact, nothing is certain in politics but the good judgment of a wise leader.
