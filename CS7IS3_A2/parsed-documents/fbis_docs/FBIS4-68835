This is, of course, the question of questions for Russia today. While our native political scientists are attempting to gather their thoughts, Russia's journalists have been attempting to answer it as quickly as possible. The very next morning following the ceremony in the Kremlin, IZVESTIYA introduced to the political vocabulary the terms "signatory" and "nonsignatory," which is, in fact, what is most important in the situation that has been created around the latest exercise of the president, who is an acknowledged expert at creating difficult situations, from which subsequently all of society begins to emerge with clatter, noise, and losses. IZVESTIYA recalled the "moral and political responsibility" which would undoubtedly ensue from a violation of the articles of this treaty. Otto Latsis, a member of the editorial board, no longer recalls, it would seem, in presenting material on this topic the country's recent past, when any "moral and political responsibility" seamlessly flowed over into criminal responsibility and there came to be added in parallel with a criminal investigation the skillfully organized public persecution of individual citizens who at the due moment either had not signed something or had suddenly been taken ill or had failed to put in an appearance somewhere or had simply remained silent at a plenum, congress, presidium session.... IZVESTIYA quotes Gennadiy Zyuganov, a "nonsignatory," to the effect that "there is no need for any special agreement, it is necessary merely to observe the constitution of Russia." Say what you will, the words of the principal communist of present-day Russia appear perfectly justified, whereas the "barbs" of the principal political observer of a respected mass-circulation newspaper are sincerely distressing. This is what O. Latsis writes, arguing with G. Zyuganov: "...observing the constitution formally, sociopolitical tension--by, included, demands for a review and revision, perfectly legitimate in form, of this constitution and various sociopolitical demands, which are so easy to make at a time of crisis--could be incited." It is worth recalling that this is that same Latsis who just a few months ago was assuring society in that same paper of the acute need, without delay, for the adoption of Yeltsin's draft constitution inasmuch as it, the draft, was, at least, good. Deliberately brushing aside the "nonsignatory" and, hence, antipresidential, which sounds for it almost like an anti-Russian, thought movement, IZVESTIYA inveighs also, for example, against the demands of the Political Council of the Russian Democratic Reform Movement in respect to the possibility of the signing of the treaty: "Such demands reek of populism." The word "reeks" is, you will agree, painfully familiar to Soviet hearing. In addition, it has to be recalled that it is none other than Yeltsin himself who is the recognized leader of modern Russian populism, and if anyone is to be accused of anti-Yeltsin sentiments, the subject of "populism" should not even be broached here--this is a loser for the president. The position of another "nonsignatory"--the Agrarian Party--is pilloried by IZVESTIYA as a "self-interested approach." The entire self-interest amounts to the fact that the agrarians are refusing to sign the treaty on the grounds that it omits the sectoral demands of the agro-industrial lobby. But on what other grounds could they, in fact, reach accord or not? But the newspaper writes: "Hardly anyone could fail to understand this, and if he does understand it and still insists on getting his own way, we should take a close look at the motives of such actions." Let us scrutinize what are, in our opinion, the key words of the sentence--"should take a close look." These began also many frightening government and newspaper campaigns of the USSR against the individual, did they not? As we know, in time society and the publications had great moral difficulties "washing off" the involvement in these campaigns. How much did that same IZVESTIYA have to confess its restructuring to Solzhenitsyn and to Rostropovich and to Sakharov and to other citizens of our fatherland who were innocent sufferers. O. Latsis concludes his article entirely in the spirit of the Brezhnevite editorials: "The fact of nonsigning is just as eloquent as the fact of signing." But should everything begin in the country so expressly from scratch? The position of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY differs from that of IZVESTIYA, but the difference is merely that ARGUMENTY I FAKTY produces a real tear-jerker. In the opinion of Vladimir Savichev, "What is that thing held in common for the sake of which the president is calling for accord? Primarily the interests of Russia and its people, strong authority and a strong economy. It is those who do nothing and who are responsible for nothing who do not want to `reach accord' today." And the author goes on to use altogether impossible, even disgraceful words, it would seem: "V. Zhirinovskiy, leader of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], may be viewed variously, but he cannot, in any event, be denied one thing--he speaks clearly and pleasingly (!?--author's comment) for the hearing of ordinary people." It is significant that many newspapers representing the interests of various political currents and movements, while not coming to terms, have expressed themselves in the spirit of G. Zyuganov, the leader of the communists, looking, perhaps, the most respectable of all in the current situation. And this is very indicative inasmuch as the further we go, the clearer it appears that the only thing we will derive from the present stage is the communists in the saddle once again and profound disenchantment with the democrats in power. NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (correspondent Yelena Afanasyeva) writes about this disenchantment: "I happened to hear at the Kremlin entrance a discussion of the preparations (not so much for the signing as for the banquet) by two officers of the security service: `Plenty of vodka. They'll sign on!'" Was that really how things were THERE! The information concerning these "retainers'" maxims, which are of considerable importance for an understanding of Kremlin psychodynamics, is borne out fully by the newspaper SEGODNYA--the vodka is explained there by a "senior guard to a junior guard," and the whole action takes places at the Tsar Bell. And, further: "Social accord is even a very remarkable thing, particularly if it is more or less clear to society whom the contracting parties represent. The chosen line of political behavior is very reminiscent of the rash Soviet `ostrich' principle--ignoring the large-scale phenomena of life going beyond the framework of the ideologically acceptable picture. Ostrich-like instincts are understandable in human terms, but historical experience testifies that when the head is buried in the sand, it is very difficult to observe reality." All this clearly shows the exclusively theatrical nature of the action, which we might, of course, have guessed, but it is better to know, this having been permitted us by the reporters admitted to the scene of the event. PRAVDA, as an exclusively opposition spokesman, was even more definite on this score: "The immense number of signatories creates the illusion of the unity of political forces in the country. This is not in fact the case. This should force the president to wonder: Why? So with whom was the treaty signed? Between the president and the people or his own entourage? The outcome of a survey reveals an interesting newspaper breakdown: On the one hand, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA, IZVESTIYA, TRUD, ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, and many other publications which unconditionally supported the presidential side. On the other, NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA, SEGODNYA, KURANTY, PRAVDA, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, KOMMERSANT-DAILY.... All newspapers were united only on one point, perhaps--for the first time they made forecasts concerning the future of the treaty. The most interesting were published, in our view, in KOMMERSANT-DAILY. The author of the first is the well-known wit Maksim Sokolov, and this is what he writes: "From the cynical viewpoint, the process of the redivision of power and property in Russia is approaching completion--evidence of which is the constantly declining level of inflation--and the result of the revision is peace." The author of the second is the paper's policy department: "There is no reason to suppose that Boris Yeltsin, who is persistently molding the image of `father of the nation,' will himself now constantly be pointing the finger in the direction of the nonsignatories, attempting to make of them his adversaries, and publicly dividing society into `good fellows' and `bad fellows'. But it cannot be ruled out that the `radicals' in his entourage--the politicians that obtained offices in the Kremlin on the wave of opposition to Mikhail Gorbachev or the Supreme Soviet--will not involve themselves in this. At least, they would acquire in the person of the nonsignatories actual opponents, attacks on whom would not, most likely, evoke their boss's displeasure. The treaty is simply the latest product of the official ideological machinery, which, probably, needs somehow to justify its existence. It may be assumed with every confidence here that it will hardly prove more effective than the previous food programs and antialcohol campaigns." MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS' forecast is definite and tragic: "None of the signatories believes that the treaty will prevent any trade union boss striking in the near future or regional forces becoming fixated with unbridled separatism..." (Yuriy Zaynashev, author). KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA adds fuel to the same fire: "The probability of the treaty soon being forgotten cannot be ruled out. Much now will depend on the press. The president is entrusting to it the duty of keeping an eye on compliance with the terms. Well, we are used to this sort of thing. And we have survived" (Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin, author). Let us sum up: Despite the multitude of words uttered by everyone, the treaty is still more the outward appearance of a process than a process itself. In a week or a month the president will rest content with the first--this has happened before. Primarily because this business imposes on him personally precisely no clear obligations. But as long as the outward appearance continues to be observed, some people might very much have to pay for it even. Sanctions against both the "nonsignatories" and the "signatories" will be applied, and this is clear even now, primarily by the press. So, colleagues, be vigilant, do not treat that seriously all that you hear from the Kremlin, be in no hurry to carry out an order--remember the immortal Schweik--for the direct opposite could follow.... [begin box] OBSHCHAYA GAZETA Pact Yes, we have a plan for the conclusion of a corporate High Pact. Let them have their treaty, we will have--for simplicity of distinction--a pact. This idea was suggested to us by the social emanations about which M. Leontyev spoke so splendidly in the newspaper SEGODNYA: "The will to accord, more, to its formalization on paper, is very clearly gaining momentum at the present turn of social life," which we had, of course, to have heard. Taking up a position in the rear of this modern phenomenon, we offer our colleagues a draft Pact on the Procedure of Coverage of the Social Accord Treaty in the National News Media. It is just two sentences long; discussion, therefore, will not be protracted and will create a real opportunity for the general signing of the pact the day after publication of this issue. So, our version: "Journalists subscribing to the pact shall categorically refrain from propaganda of the division of society into `signatories' and `nonsignatories.' The list of subscribers to the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA Pact is open, beginning 6 May." [end box]
