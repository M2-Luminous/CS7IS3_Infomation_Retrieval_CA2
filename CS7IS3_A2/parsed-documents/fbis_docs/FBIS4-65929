The opening of the Japanese market would be the appropriate way for a change of trend in the yen price increase. If Tokyo were unable to reduce surpluses through deregulation, the "only option left" would be "another revaluation of the yen as the price for the preservation of restrictive market structures," warned Necker. The BDI president acknowledged that the opening process initiated in Japan was attributable to the pressure exerted by the United States, but said he was opposed to Tokyo giving preference to the U.S. partner. "We Europeans want to have the same opportunities in Japan as the United States," stressed Necker, adding that "Japan's political security interests no longer justify giving the United States privileges." Necker, who is in Tokyo for talks with Prime Minister Hata and other government members as well as leading Japanese business and industry associations, also appealed to the German economic sector to see "Japan as an organizational center for the whole Far Eastern region." He said that, in this respect, more persuasive work had to be done in Germany. Medium-sized industry in particular had to develop a strategy for Japan, said Necker. A number of such firms had already successfully established themselves on the Japanese market. The Asia-Pacific Committee of German business and industry and Bonn should face the challenge of the Asian market, but in so doing, should not only consider China, but should make use of the incipient liberalization of the Japanese market.
