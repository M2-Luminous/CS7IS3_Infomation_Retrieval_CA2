The committee emphasized at a meeting in Ulundi that the provinces should be empowered to decide on the implementation of the program. A resolution was accepted on budgetary provisions to enable provinces to implement reconstruction policies. The committee expressed concern over what it said were reports about the intention of the central government to assume control of existing laws, which under the 1993 constitution fell within the competence of the provinces.
