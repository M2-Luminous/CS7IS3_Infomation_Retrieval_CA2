The high-level delegation was slated to arrive in Oman tonight in order to prepare for the participation of an Israeli delegation headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin in a new round of multilateral peace talks. Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik has learned that at this stage, the preparatory visit has been delayed by one week. It was also hinted that the Israeli media will not be permitted to attend the talks themselves -- scheduled to be held several days later -- as previously planned.
