Maragay] [Text] The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan [Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance -- RAM] will not surrender light anti-tank weapons and other high powered fire arms in its possession despite a declaration by the government of a general amnesty, its leader Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan said yesterday. In an interview with the Manila Standard, Honasan reiterated the RAM's stand against an amnesty proclamation by the government for all rebels, opting instead for a "comprehensive peace settlement" so that substantive issues addressed by the RAM during the peace negotiations can be fully resolved. "Even with an amnesty proclamation, we will not surrender any of our weapons. We will only turn over once a peace settlement is reached," Honasan said. Earlier, the RAM claimed it still possesses more than 30 light anti-tank weapons and several high-powered arms, stressing that the movement is far from being a spent force as the government alleged. Honasan said that aside from the RAM's considerable firepower, its influence over the armed forces remains and continues to pervade down the line even over new graduates of the Philippine Military Academy. He said the "civilian component" of RAM has increased and even exceeded its military component. Despite claims it still has the strength and the manpower, Honasan said the RAM does not rely on any outside funding from abroad, but on its "support within the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines]." The RAM has indefinitely suspended peace talks with the government since December last year, after Honasan raised issues which he said should be resolved first before the negotiations can continue. The issues being questioned by the RAM include the arrest and continued detention of six RAM members by the military, apprehended for illegal possession of ammunitions while the peace negotiations were ongoing. The RAM also asked the government for a reorganization in the armed forces and to allow members of the RAM panel to the peace talks to carry firearms for their security. The movement has addressed several talking points in its peace talks with the government: political reforms, economic reforms, electoral reforms, a campaign to weed out graft and corruption in the government and the implementation of a "true" land reform program. Before the suspension of the talks, the RAM and government peace panels concentrated discussions on the implementation of electoral reforms, in preparation for the forthcoming 1995 elections. The RAM wanted the government to "rotate" officials in Comelec [Commission on Elections] nationwide as an initial step to eliminating irregularities and fraud in the coming polls. In pushing for a negotiated peace settlement instead of an amnesty proclamation, Honasan said a declaration of a general amnesty will only preempt the issues being addressed by the RAM and government peace panels during the talks. "If you declare an amnesty, that's it. But what we are pushing for is the implementation of the reforms that we want. People will tend to forget that there are still issues to be resolved once an amnesty proclamation is announced," Honasan said. Meanwhile, President Ramos said yesterday a presidential panel has not yet completed the draft of the second amnesty proclamation covering members of all insurgent forces. The president told his weekly press conference that the proposal draft is still being refined by the panel composed of officials of the Department of Interior and Local Government, Department of National Defense and Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process. The draft of the amnesty proclamation was supposed to be submitted to the president last 11 March. But apparently several thorny issues have not yet been resolved by the president and his advisers. Among the unresolved issues are whether the amnesty should be unconditional or conditional, what common crimes can be absorbed by the crime of rebellion, and the implications of declaring a second round of amnesty on the ongoing peace negotiations with the various rebel groups.
