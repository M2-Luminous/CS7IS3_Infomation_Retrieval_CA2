Referring to the previous attack on the French Embassy and the Air France office in Tehran on November 9, the paper said, "undoubtedly the two instances of attacks on the foreign embassies in Tehran, involving in both cases European countries, are related to one another and are in fact links in a chain of premediated plots which are carried out with specific objectives." It stressed that such acts of terrorism are meant "to damage the international prestige of the Islamic Republic." "In the past few months the Islamic Republic had undertaken active diplomatic initiatives to resolve its problems with some of the European countries and it had attained great progress in this direction. "In the majority of cases the diplomatic initiatives taken by the Islamic Republic have been successful, and a broad range of understandings had been achieved. The most concrete sign of the improvement of relations between Iran and the Western Europe is the release of the two Iranian citizens by the French Government," said the article. It further added, "consequently it is quite logical to conclude that the attacks on the embassies are meant to undermine Iran's recent improved relations with the Western European countries. "Terrorist acts including attacks on embassies have always been condemned by the Islamic Republic as irrational endeavors which defeat their own purpose." The editorial in conclusion called for taking concrete measures to forestall any attempt which aims to sabotage Iran's diplomatic achievements and for tightening security measures around embassy compounds.
