FBIS4-9985 "drlat066_n_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Chile Court Acknowledges German Petition on Citizens Court Acknowledges German Petition on Citizens PY0504153494 Santiago Radio Cooperativa Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 5 Apr 94 PY0504153494 Santiago Radio Cooperativa Network Spanish BFN [Text] The Supreme Court acknowledged a petition from the German courts requesting a series of judicial actions regarding the arrest and disappearance of three Chilean citizens by German citizens residing in the Dignidad Colony [in Chile]. The court acknowledged the petition filed by Bonn's attorney general within the framework of legal proceedings against Dignidad Colony leader (Paul Schaeffer), suspected of being responsible for several murders. Investigations in Germany refer to the murder of Alvaro Vallejos Villagran, aka Loro Matias; Alfonso Chanffreau; and Ezequiel Poncio Vicencio. This information was disclosed by attorney Sergio Corvalan, who represents the Bonn court in Chile: [Begin Corvalan recording] Basically, the petition requests the questioning of witnesses, one of them a German citizen who is not a member of the Dignidad Colony and the shipment of attested copies of legal documents, as well as information from the Rettig Commission archives so it can be officially included in the case being handled by the German court. [end recording] Corvalan noted the significance of the Supreme Court's decision to acknowledge the petition because this is the first time the Chilean court has not objected to the German court's desire to investigate possible crimes committed by German citizens in Chile. Corvalan added that he will request that (Paul Schaeffer) appear before the Bulnes Court once again within the framework of another lawsuit, a civilian one in this case, filed by the Dignidad Colony against one of its former leaders, (Hugo Bar). Corvalan explained that (Schaeffer) appeared before the Bulnes Court on 31 March, but that he had been summoned for today, which represents an irregularity that annuls the proceeding.
