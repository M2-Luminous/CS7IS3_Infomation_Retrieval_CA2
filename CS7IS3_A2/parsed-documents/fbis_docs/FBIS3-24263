A similar scene also occurred in January of last year. The reasons, on the whole, are understandable. Each December, enterprises and organizations try, by hook or by crook, to make maximum payments to their own workers (every possible kind of bonus for the quarter and for the year, material assistance, wages for a thirteenth month and so on), in order to compensate somewhat for having wages lag behind price increases over the course of the year. And so, in January, there is no longer any money. But, even taking into account the small January "recoil," all the same, the increase in wages over the 2 months (December and January), on the whole, corresponded to the rate of price increases over this same period. That is, wages rose to the same extent as prices. So that there would have been nothing unusual in this temporary January decrease, if all the credited money had gone to those for whom it was intended. However, the main problem is the fact that, at many enterprises, people are not receiving their wages at all for 1, 2 or even 3 months or are receiving only part of them. Under these conditions, although the wages credited on paper and recorded by the statistics make it possible to make a judgment about trends, they do not give an accurate idea about actual payments. But in general, in and of themselves, wages still do not give a clear idea about the standard of living, because it is necessary to take not only them, but all monetary incomes calculated on a per capita basis and to correlate them with prices. So, if a judgment is to be made based on the level of actual incomes (adjusted based on the consumer price index), then, in 12 territories, life over the past year on the whole has deteriorated noticeably. Here, the actual January incomes in 1994 amounted to less than 70 percent of the incomes in January of 1993. These are the republics of Karachayevo-Cherkessia and Tuva, Stavropol Kray and Kursk, Samara, Novosibirsk, Omsk, Tomsk, Tyumen, Chita, Kamchatka and Magadan oblasts. But where, all the same, have actual incomes increased? They are supposed to increase by 10-20 percent (if all debts are paid) in Karelia, Khakasia, Pskov Oblast, Kostroma Oblast, Tver Oblast and a number of other oblasts. The increase is supposed to be even larger in Kabardino-Balkaria, St. Petersburg, Moscow and Leningrad and Moscow oblasts. Millionaires and Beggars The statistical data testify to the fact that the stratification into the rich and the poor is continuing. It has already been reported that the monetary incomes of the 10 percent of the most well-off Russian citizens are higher than the incomes of the 10 percent of the least well-off citizens by a factor of 11. In point of fact, the disparity is apparently much greater, because our millionaires and billionaires do not advertise the lion's share of their incomes and these funds "escape" the attention of the statisticians. On the other hand, among the indigent, there are, for example, no bums or beggars. So the disparity in incomes between the rich and the poor possibly amounts to factors of 30, 35 or even 40. Incidentally, the officially recorded disparity in the wages of the 10 percent of the rich and the poor has already exceeded a factor of 27. However, we can currently also report new indicators which characterize the stratification in Russian society. In January of 1994, 20 percent of the very well-off section of the populace had almost half (42 percent) of all the monetary incomes in the country, while 20 percent of the poor had only 7 percent of the incomes. The so-called Dzhin factor gives an even clearer picture. It shows how the concentration of incomes among the populace is proceeding. If all the people's incomes were equal, then the Dzhin factor would be equal to zero. But, on the other hand, if all the incomes turned out to be (theoretically) in the hands of a single superbillionaire, then the factor would be 1. Now let us see how this indicator changed in Russia. At the end of 1991, the Dzhin factor amounted to 0.256, to 0.327 at the end of 1992, to 0.346 at the end of 1993 and to 0.352 in January of 1994. That is, the factor is shifting from zero to one. It is clear even to a non-specialist that the stratification in society is not only continuing, but is even proceeding faster and faster. And the disparity in wages is just one more confirmation of this. In January, as always, however, the sphere of science and scientific services was in last place with respect to the level of wages -- R95,000 on average. The level of wages in instrument building is much lower --R71,000. In the past an elite subsector, determining to a great extent the rate of technical progress, it is currently, just like science and many other spheres, leading a miserable existence. At the other extreme are the workers of the fuel and raw materials sectors. The gas workers of Tyumen, for example, have credited wages of more than a million rubles on average. But even here there are problems -- the notorious nonpayment of wages, which we have already mentioned. Yet, all the same, the most irritating factor are the insane wages of many enterprise managers, including those of state enterprises. There is no control over them and the managers, "intoxicated by freedom," are setting for themselves, without advertising it, such sums as are shameful to talk about in our impoverished country. For many of them, the wages range from R5 million to R10 million. At the same time, the incomes of 18.4 million people amounted in January to from R10,000 to R30,000 or, less by hundreds of factors. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Average January Wages in Various Sectors and Regions of the Country: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |For the National Economy as a Whole |R134,200 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |All of Industry |R138,600 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gas Industry |R780,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Including: | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |In Tyumen Oblast |R1,223,487 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Oil-Production Industry |R361,700 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Including: | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |In Tyumen Oblast |R531,700 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Coal Industry |R324,300 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Light Industry |R80,600 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Instrument Building |R71,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Agriculture |R58,100 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Transportation |R224,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Construction |R171,400 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Health Care, Physical Exercise and So-|R122,500 | |cial Security | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Public Education |R113,600 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Culture and Art |R101,100 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Science and Scientific Services |R94,700 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Credit and Insurance |R326,200 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |System of Administrative Organs |R165,600 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Of course, it would be ludicrous and foolish to fight for the populist wage-leveling which contradicts both common sense and economic laws. But the excessive disparity in wages and incomes, especially the uncontrolled and intensifying disparity, is leading to mounting social tension in the country. This process has been aggravated sharply because of the chronic nonpayments (including those for which the state is at fault) of already credited wages. Whether or not the Ministry of Labor and the current government will be able to correct the situation and whether or not they have the skills needed to overcome the negative trends and to carry out an effective income policy -- this is the question. A Thousandfold Price Increase and This Is Not the Limit The government proudly reported that the rate of price increases was reduced sharply in February. Viktor Chernomyrdin stated at the expanded meeting of the government in the Kremlin on March 4th that prices in February increased by 13-15 percent. In actuality, according to the preliminary data of Russia's Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics], the increase in the cost of living was even less -- 10 percent. This is a record low inflation level for the last year and a half. But, is this something to be proud of? Is this not too high a price for reducing the increase in prices? What has played a role here, first and foremost, are the enormous arrears with respect to the payment of wages. It is understandable: the less cash in hand -- the less the demand -- and the lower the prices. But such an artificial reduction of inflation causes more harm than good. It is often said that it is not a matter of the wage arrears, but rather, the fact that our prices have almost reached the level of world prices and this is why, supposedly, their rise has slowed down. It should be stated that this is not so. A simple analysis shows that, at the beginning of March, for example, butter was cheaper in our country than in Washington by a factor of 1.5 (taking into account the official ruble-to-dollar exchange rate), milk was cheaper by a factor of 3.5, cheese by a factor of 2, wheat bread by a factor of 3, sugar by a factor of 2, potatoes by a factor of 4, and so on. So that here, we still have "room," alas, for price increases (although they have already increased on average a thousandfold over the last 3 and a half years). Thus, it is precisely the non-payments which have, to a great extent, had an influence on the reduction in the inflation rate. But the debts will have to be taken care of -- prices will go up again and such "twists and turns" will produce nothing but broad public dissatisfaction. Is it really worthwhile to proceed further in this fashion? No, there is only one way out of the dead-end -- a real structural reorganization, the attracting of private capital, a well thought-out social policy (including an income policy), the improvement of the tax system, and support of small business. The prime minister has talked about all of these things repeatedly. This would be a good time to get down to brass tacks. But, for now, the situation is continuing to deteriorate. The pace of the drop in production in February did not decrease, as the government experts expected, but rather, it remained very high. Here is the latest report from Russia's State Committee for Statistics: the physical volume of production in January and February of 1994 decreased in comparison with January and February of 1993 by 23.6 percent (including 23.1 percent in January and 24.1 percent in February). For example, only half as many shoes were produced in February than were produced a year ago, a fourth fewer knitted goods and a third less butter.... Where are we going?
