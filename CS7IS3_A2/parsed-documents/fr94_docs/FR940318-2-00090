FR940318-2-00090 FR940318-2-00065 A. Legislative Authority Title III of the Child Abuse Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;457, 42 U.S.C. 10401 et seq.) is entitled the ``Family Violence Prevention and Services Act'' (the Act). It was first implemented in FY 1986 and was reauthorized and amended for fiscal years 1993 through 1995 by Congress in May 1992 by Public Law 102&hyph;295. The purposes of this legislation are to assist States in supporting the establishment, maintenance, and expansion of programs and projects to prevent incidents of family violence and provide immediate shelter and related assistance for victims of family violence and their dependents. Both State and Indian tribal grantees are required to use not less than 70 percent of funds awarded for the purpose of providing immediate shelter and related assistance and not less than 25 percent of the funds are to be distributed for the purpose of providing related assistance as defined in section 303(f). B. Background During FY 1993, 139 family violence prevention grants were made to States, Territories, and Indian Tribes; the Department also made 51 family violence prevention grant awards to nonprofit State domestic violence coalitions. In response to the information and technical assistance needs of the family violence community the Department has established the National Resource Center for Domestic Violence (NRC) and three Special Issue Resource Centers (SIRC). The purpose of the NRC and the SIRCs is to provide resource information, training, and technical assistance to Federal, State, and Native American agencies, as well as to local domestic violence prevention programs and to other professionals who provide services to victims of domestic violence. In addition to the resource center network, the Department also awarded 21 family violence grants to assist in the development of public information and community awareness campaign projects and activities to serve as information models in the prevention of family violence. Six family violence prevention grants also were awarded to implement demonstration models/courses to train public prosecutors to successfully try cases of domestic violence. C.
