Government officials have also found factual errors in its latest report on the Korean financial market prepared by the chamber. Ministry of Finance [MOF] officials say the "one-sided, distorted and unbalanced" report might mislead American policy- makers and politicians into misunderstanding that Korea is a closed market, not a liberalizing one. An MOF official said, "The AmCham report appears to distort or overshadow Korea's latest efforts to reform the financial market. Thus we have prepared our own view on what AmCham members have highlighted." The MOF, however, is refraining from providing AmCham with its comments on each subject, believing its comments, as was in the past, will not be reflected in the revised AmCham paper. The MOF was said to have sent a "protest letter" to AmCham President James Riddle and U.S. Embassy commercial attache John Hoog, sources said. MOF officials said, "Depending on how you describe Korea or the United States, it becomes a "heaven or a hell." They added that one country, be it Korea or the United States, does not necessarily have only negative aspects." In fact, AmCham never used the word hell in its report, but when you read the whole of it, you get the impression that Korea is a hell for foreign investors, government officials said. They said AmCham has "made efforts to project a negative view of the Korean economy." The paper sometimes contains even "distorted and incorrect information about Korea's investment environment for Americans, they said. "What we are most concerned about is that a distorted or incorrect description of Korea might mislead foreign investors interested in Korea," they said. Whether reliable or not, the AmCham report has been used as a barometer by foreigners in evaluating the investment environment in Korea and a reference for formulating U.S. trade policy with Korea. A U.S. government official said, "The position of American businessmen is not necessarily the same as that of the U.S. government." But in fact, many American officials were "embarrassed" when they casually quoted part of the AmCham report without confirmation in official or private meetings with Korean government officials. If foreigners read AmCham's report without any background information, Korea might be wrongly described as a country that imposes the serious discrimination against non-Korean bankers and brokers, he said. He and many MOF officials said AmCham's report is biased and might tarnish the otherwise smooth and cozy relationship Korea and the United States enjoy. MOF officials said they were disappointed with the "double attitude" some AmCham members display in meetings, they "praised us for making efforts to liberalize the market but in written documents, they are hell-bent on describing Korea as a closed market," they noted. They said the report never mentioned what Korea has deregulated over the past few years and only highlighted the dark aspects. Furthermore, the report mentioned that Korea should "accelerate" its reform program. But the pace of the reform is a matter to be decided by the Korean government itself, they noted. Many American bankers, brokers and insurers are here for less than three years and they want to maximize profits during their stay. Thus it is only natural for them to want to see much of the pre-announced deregulation implemented while they are in Korea, MOF officials said.
