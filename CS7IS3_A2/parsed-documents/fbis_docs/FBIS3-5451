Japan has now categorized Thailand as the world's fourth most favorable country for investments. Mr. Suphachai Phanitchaphak, deputy prime minister, said that because of this sense of confidence, Japan is planning to move automobile spare parts and computer parts production bases to Thailand. This is because it is predicted that the trend of Thailand's economic growth rate this year will be even higher due to the expansion of investment in both the public and private sectors. [Begin Suphachai recording] While the rate of our economic development growth is, in my opinion, rather good this year -- at least eight percent -- the inflation rate here is between three and four percent, which is lower than the world's average inflation rate. Therefore, we should not worry about our financial stability. The same is true with the stability of our exchange rates. This is because at this point our monetary reserves amount to U.S. $26 billion so far, thus making our country rank one among the world's top ten for most favorable places for investment. With such a large volume of monetary reserves on hand, we should not have any concern about the natural flow of our cash. [end recording] The deputy prime minister, however, admitted that Thailand still encounters problems in agricultural production. The government has paid special attention to this development and has encouraged farmers to switch from planting low-priced crops to growing other alternative crops which fetch better prices. The government has already provided low interest rate loans to farmers who wish to do so. In addition, the government is now keeping a close watch on the approved investment projects in Zone 3 to see whether the trend of investment has expanded from the zone's center to its sub regions or not so that a cross border link-up can be set up with the economies of some neighboring countries. In the meantime, the government is speeding up the implementation of a project to link the eastern region with the northeast. This project has already been approved and its construction designs laid out. [Begin Suphachai recording] At the beginning of last year, applications for government approval to invest in Zone 3 increased five fold or 500 percent. We are now waiting to see how much money these investors, who received approval from the government, will spend on their initial investment and in which direction these investments will expand. Since the investment has been targeted for the center of Zone 3, we have yet to see whether it will be expanded to the zone's sub regions, especially border areas with neighboring countries. This trend will pave the way for our economy to spread out from the center to remote regions, especially border areas. There is a bright prospect of success in this direction because the Asian Development Bank and other countries have rendered support to such endeavors. I believe that problems in the remote border areas will be resolved more smoothly. [end recording]
