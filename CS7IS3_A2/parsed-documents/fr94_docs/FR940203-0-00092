FR940203-0-00092 FR940203-0-00021 The Pacific pocket mouse is likely facultatively or partially fossorial, relatively sedentary, and able to become torpid, estivate, or hibernate in response to adverse environmental conditions (Ingles 1965, Vaughan 1978, Zeiner et al. 1990). While active above ground, little pocket mice have ranged up to 320 m (1,000 ft) from their burrows in a 24-hour period (Burt and Grossenheider 1976). Little pocket mouse home ranges vary in size from 0.12 to 0.56 hectares (0.30 to 1.4 acres), and populations range in density from 1 to 5.5 individuals per hectare (0.4 to 2.2 individuals per acre) (Chew and Butterworth 1964). Pacific pocket mice primarily eat the seeds of grasses and forbs, but occasionally eat leafy material and soil-dwelling insects (von Bloeker 1931a; Meserve 1976a; Jameson and Peeters 1988; P. Brylski, pers. comm., 1993). The little pocket mouse has a high metabolic rate (Bartholomew and Cade 1957), continually needs food supplies while active, and loses heat rapidly. It has limited capacity to store food. Little pocket mice may stay in their burrows continuously for up to 5 months in winter, alternating between periods of dormancy and feeding on stored seeds or hibernation in winter under adverse conditions (Bartholomew and Cade 1957, Ingles 1965, Kenagy 1973, Whitaker 1980). Little pocket mice live up to 7.5 years in captivity and 3 to 5 years in the wild (Burt and Grossenheider 1976, Whitaker 1980). Pregnant and lactating females have been found from April through June, and immatures have been reported from June through September (Erickson 1993). Burt and Grossenheider (1976) previously reported that the little pocket mouse produces one or two litters (ranging in size from three to seven young) in a year. The Pacific pocket mouse is historically known from eight populations. Approximately 80 percent of all Pacific pocket mouse records are from 1931 or 1932 (Erickson 1993). The following summarizes the historical distribution of the Pacific pocket mouse by county: Los Angeles County. The Pacific pocket mouse historically was detected in three areas: Marina del Rey/El Segundo, Wilmington, and Clifton. No records of the Pacific pocket mouse exist in Los Angeles County since 1938 (P. Brylski, in litt., 1993; D. Erickson, consulting biologist, in litt., 1993; Erickson 1993). Orange County. The Pacific pocket mouse has been found at two locales in Orange County: Dana Point and the San Joaquin Hills. The species was found on ``Spyglass Hill'' in the San Joaquin Hills from 1968 to 1971 (Erickson 1993). G.G. Cantwell previously collected 10 specimens at the Dana Point Headlands in 1932.
