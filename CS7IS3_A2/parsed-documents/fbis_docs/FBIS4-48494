In his brief to the political leaders the prime minister outlined the grievances that led to the police strike and that several meetings were held between government representatives and an eight-man police delegation to review the grievances by the police. He said of the eight grievances presented to the government he told the police delegation that seven were already being addressed. The prime minister said he was disturbed that the day after the police had started the strike action some of them [words indistinct] and looted shops in Maseru, Mafeteng, Leribe, and other main centers in the country. Dr. Mokhehle said he called a meeting of the Defense Commission to discuss the problems arising out of the strike. He also met a delegation of the striking police, together with the honorable minister of foreign affairs and home affairs. The prime minister told the political leaders that after lengthy consultations with the police delegation he told them that the government could not afford to pay them the 60 percent salary increase they demanded. He said all civil servants were due to receive a 10 percent salary increase with effect from 1 April this year, and that any salary increase affected all sections of the civil service alike. In addition, the economy of Lesotho was such that the level of salary increase demanded by the police was not affordable. Dr. Mokhehle said there appeared to be an understanding between the government and the police delegation at the end of the four days of talks. The government acceded to the police assurance that they would not be victimized if they returned to work. The prime minister said notwithstanding the agreement reached between the government and the police, they decided to continue with the strike and called a press conference in which they declared that they would not continue work until their demands were met. Dr. Mokhehle said some political parties in the country, including the Basotho National Party, BNP, were involved in fanning trouble over salary dispute. He called on all the parties to declare that they were not involved and welcomed the statement of Marematlou Freedom Party saying that they were not involved. The leader of the BNP, Retsilisitsoe Sekhonyana, expressed disappointment over the prime minister's allegation of BNP involvement in fanning trouble in the police strike. Retsilisitsoe Sekhonyana said he respected the prime minister and was concerned that there were some people who supplied him with misinformation. After his remarks the BNP leader walked out of the meeting together with some members of his party.
