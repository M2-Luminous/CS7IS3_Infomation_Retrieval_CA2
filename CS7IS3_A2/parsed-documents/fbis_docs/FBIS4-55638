Matica Slovenska is a cultural and educational organisation founded in 1863. Matica's secretary, Stanislav Bajanik, said that mainly the government bill to provide for bilingual names of almost 600 towns in Slovakia's regions with mixed population, which is soon to be presented to parliament, "threatens state sovereignty and recalls the Horthyan occupation" (Hungary, ruled by regent Miklos Horthy, occupied a considerable part of Slovakia's south-eastern territory in winter 1938-39). Bajanik said he insisted on minority claims to be solved only after the autumn elections, otherwise they could be subject to pre-election machinations. According to Bajanik, the names of the almost one-fifth of Slovak towns to have multilingual names should be decided in a referendum. Matica is resolutely opposed to the re-naming of the towns carrying the names of significant figures of Slovak history and culture. "Nor does it want that originally Slovak towns and villages, which were Magyarised over the past century, bear Hungarian names," he stressed. Matica urges parliament to adopt a law which would enable the minorities to use only the towns' Slovak names transcribed into their mother tongue, and only in the communities where non-Slovak population form a simple majority. Matica also demands that all official documents be consistently written in Slovak, which is the "state language". The Slovak Government has already approved amendments to relevant laws providing for bilingual names of towns and villages in the regions where the ethnic minority forms more than one-fifth of the population, in line with minority claims and Slovakia's commitments to the CE. The government has also approved the bill enabling ethnic minority members to use Christian names and surnames in their original form, and the free of charge official change of these names from their Slovak version. The two legislative changes, now to be discussed by parliament, rank among Slovakia's most important commitments to the CE undertaken before the country was admitted to the Council last June. Their fulfillment is to be evaluated by the CE Secretariat in Warsaw on May 17.
