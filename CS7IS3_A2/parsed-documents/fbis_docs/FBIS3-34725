A Defense Department official has been assigned the task of determining how Third World nuclear installations can be targeted for U.S. air strikes. It is known that -- following China -- India, Pakistan, and now North Korea are Third World countries that have been the topic of international media discussion regarding their nuclear strength. India officially detonated a nuclear bomb in 1974, becoming a de facto member of the international nuclear club, but the United States has not paid much "attention" to India's nuclear program since then. On the other hand, when Pakistan achieved the capability to enrich uranium during the last decade, the United States started raising objections to Pakistan's nuclear program. It adopted a policy of "overlooking" Pakistan's nuclear program, though, because of Islamabad's courageous stand during the "Afghan war." After the end of the Afghan war in 1990 and the disintegration of the erstwhile Soviet Union as a superpower, however, Washington declared Pakistan's peaceful nuclear program a "weapons-oriented program" and stopped all military and economic aid to Islamabad. This aid has still not been resumed. The Pakistani people will be rightly concerned about this talk of targeting nuclear installations in Third World countries. There have been serious differences between the U.S. and Pakistani stands on Pakistan's nuclear program. In the opinion of the Pakistani people and several governments, the U.S. Administration -- under the influence of the Israeli and Indian lobbies -- has refused to accept the "peaceful" nature of Pakistan's nuclear program. This is the case even though Islamabad has given assurances at the international level that it will not build and has not built any nuclear weapons, despite having the ability to do so. Washington's stand, however, is that Islamabad is making nuclear weapons and that it should roll back its nuclear program. The U.S. Government is putting its entire emphasis on making Pakistan "abandon" its nuclear program and sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, or NPT. In response, the Pakistani Government has always adopted the stand that it is ready to sign the NPT provided that India -- which is a major nuclear power in this region -- signs the treaty first. It is regrettable that the United States views Pakistan's nuclear program in the perspective of its wider global priorities; this is why it has only been pressuring Islamabad to sign the NPT. Some changes in this situation have recently become discernible in the wake of remarks in certain U.S. circles, especially by Ms. Robin Raphel, chief of U.S. South Asia Bureau [title as published]. Washington now appears to understand Islamabad's view better than before. Lynne Davis, the U.S. under secretary of state for international security, has said that as far as nuclear proliferation is concerned, Washington will adopt an evenhanded approach to both India and Pakistan. Nevertheless, we should not indulge in any wishful thinking in the wake of statements by Ms. Robin Raphel and Lynne Davis, nor should we start to think that the U.S. Government's stand has completely changed and is now tilting in favor of Pakistan. In fact, the U.S. Government's basic stand -- the basic objective of U.S. policy -- is to have South Asia declared a nuclear-free zone. This element in the U.S. attitude is favorable to Pakistan, because Washington will no longer view Islamabad in isolation from the South Asian perspective on the nuclear issue; rather, it will view Pakistan's nuclear program from an overall perspective. In view of continued U.S. pressure on Pakistan's nuclear program, we consider Washington's new attitude a welcome shift. Yet we must express our regret that Pakistan is still the victim of discriminatory laws, such as the Pressler Amendment, intended to make Pakistan the target of "vindictive actions." Even though India detonated a nuclear device in 1974 and has subsequently built nuclear weapons, the United States does not think it is necessary to take any "action" against New Delhi, which continues to receive all sorts of U.S. assistance. We would also like to tell our U.S. friends that the imposition against Pakistan of such discriminatory laws as the Pressler Amendment has not helped -- nor will it help in the future -- to rid South Asia of nuclear weapons. The sooner the U.S. Government and its policymakers understand this fact the better, because U.S. policy objectives cannot be achieved by making Pakistan the target of "discriminatory laws."
