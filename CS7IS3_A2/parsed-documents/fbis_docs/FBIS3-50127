For 45 years, NATO has successfully preserved peace and the Euro-Atlantic system of values, and it introduced the spirit of cooperation in a Western Europe torn apart by war. These achievements should also spread to the eastern part of Europe. Hungary and other Central European countries would like to see guarantees that the changes of 1989-1990 are irreversible and that their return to the western world is taking place in an institutional framework, and not only through momentary, economic and political relations. Given the fact that there are no chances of gaining full membership in the European Union before the end of this decade, NATO is the only organization that can facilitate a rapid and secure implementation of our goals. Today, Central Europe can be compared to some kind of no-man's-land where, in addition to the threat of neo-imperialism, which cannot be totally excluded, economic and environmental security are not guaranteed either. Hungary must join the well-functioning Western structures to encourage foreign investments and an increase in the number of tourists, and to strengthen confidence in Hungary. We are at most halfway through the implementation of these goals. At the Copenhagen summit held in June 1993, the Council of Europe set out the goal of opening up toward the East. Six Central and Eastern European countries signed partnership treaties with the European Union; two of them, the treaties signed with Hungary and Poland, will come into force as from 1 February 1994, and the ratification of the other treaties is currently under way. A similar decision emerged at the NATO summit in Brussels on 10 January 1994: The "Partnership for Peace" program makes it clear that the countries that are successful in this cooperation could hope for NATO membership. At his meeting with the Visegrad four on 12 January 1994, U.S. President Bill Clinton confirmed that the security of Central Europe is also vital for the security of the United States. I think this view is not completely in harmony with the spirit of the Partnership for Peace program. Although Washington mostly accepted Moscow's position, the decisions made in Brussels and Prague offer more advantageous opportunities for Central Europe than a mere relocation of the former Iron Curtain more to the East. Our region, which was the scene of two world wars, does not want to be a border area or a battle ground again. A partnership relation between NATO and Russia is much more important for us than mere NATO membership for Hungary and having to face an big enemy power. Therefore, it is better to wait, although this also has its risks. As for the various criticisms regarding the Partnership for Peace plan, this peace partnership does not refer to everyone: While the "self-selection system" awards the pioneers and the good students, it is also an encouragement to those who have fallen behind. The Brussels decision helps both Ukraine and Russia, and we are particularly glad that the recent Russian-U.S.-Ukrainian agreement on nuclear weapons received a new impetus in Hungary on 18 December 1993, when Leonid Kravchuk and Al Gore met here on the occasion of the funeral of the late Hungarian prime minister. The meeting in Prague strengthened the Visegrad and Central European cooperation, something that has had priority for Hungary since 1990, and the recent U.S position also strengthened this. The other argument against expanding NATO says that the conflicts between some countries that want to join NATO would weaken the alliance. This excuse is unfounded. Organizations like the national minority chief commissioner of the Council of Europe or the CSCE are capable of coping with this problem, like the tensions deriving from the situation of 3.5 million ethnic Hungarians living on the territory of our neighbors, people who feel that the majority of the population shows hostile feelings toward them and their rights are not guaranteed. Together with the European Union and the Western European Union, NATO will contribute to the development of a more favorable atmosphere, to the solving or at least the easing of these tensions. At the same time, if the behavioral norms prevailing in Western Europe since the end of World War II spread to Central and Eastern Europe and penetrate the political elite, the armed forces, and the youth, the existing tensions might decrease considerably. We think that the Partnership for Peace program is the way that leads directly to NATO, and we are striving to make use of every opportunity for cooperation, whether political, diplomatic, consultative, military, logistic, or any other opportunity. We admit that full membership must be preceded by a long preparatory process, but we are convinced that we will fulfill the NATO demands in a few years. Our commitment is clear. From this moment, what have become the basic questions of our security policy are when and how.
