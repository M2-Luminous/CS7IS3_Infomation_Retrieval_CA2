FR940804-2-00125 FR940804-2-00068 The development of viable competition to entrenched monopoly cable interests is wholly contingent upon two requirements: competitors' access to appealing programming, and use of existing and proposed distribution networks. To be viable, a competitor must be able to assemble an attratctive package of programs to offer to consumers and have the ability to distribute its offerings. Because of these requirements, the merged TCI-Liberty entitles constitute a bottleneck_if not a stranglehold_upon the development of viable competition in the video marketplace. Only the closest scrutiny of the merged entity's conduct will ensure that the public interest is served in the development of effective alternatives to cable. The primary flaw in the Consent Decree is its term. The five-year period proposed is simply inadequate. The video dialtone facilities proposed by LECs_the principal potential competition to cable_will not reach a payback point for least seven years. 10 During this period, as nascent competition to cable more fully develops, LECs' video dialtone networks may be particularly vulnerable to anti-competitive conduct by TCI/Liberty. Indeed, as actual competition develops toward the end of this period, TCI/Liberty will have even greater incentives to engage in anti-competitive conduct to stem the loss of market share. In order to cure this deficiency, the term of the Consent Decree must be not less than seven years. 10 For example, Bell Atlantic has projected a seven year payback period. Ameritech has projected seven to nine years. Pacific Bell has projected nine years. US West has projected seven to eight years. A transition period is also necessary as the Consent Decree period comes to an end. In particular, at that point, it would be in TCI/Liberty's interest to withdraw appealing programming from competitive systems and packages. To prevent this from happening, the Consent Decree must be modified to prohibit TCI/Liberty from withdrawing any programming from a particular market unless the market in question is found to be subject to ``effective competition,'' as defined by Section 623(l)(1) of the Act. Of course, TCI/Liberty might have legitimate reasons for the withdrawal of some programming. Therefore, this prohibition would not apply to the extent that TCI/Liberty also withdrew the same programming from all systems in which it has an interest. Once withdrawn, this programming could not be made subsequently available to any TCI/Liberty system unless made generally available to all MSTDs under similar terms and conditions. In addition to these serious deficiencies, the Consent Decreee allows TCI/Liberty broad latitude for de facto discrimination. For example, TCI/Liberty could construct a price per volume table so that most local packagers could not afford appealing programming. TCI/Liberty could also set the volume price for programming high, charge this high price to its own systems and utilize the greater profit to reward those systems meeting market retention and growth incentive objectives. In essence, TCI/Liberty could provide its own systems with both incentives and a discount. Careful scrutiny on a going-forward basis is therefore required if TCI/Liberty is to be restrained from crushing developing competition. Without rectification of these inadequacies, the court will not be able to affirmatively find ``the propriety and equity of the decree proposed.'' Since the Consent Decree, as presently proposed, does not serve the public interest, it must be modified or rejected by the Court. IV. Conclusion For the reasons stated hereinabove, GTE beleives that the Department must withdraw its stipulation to the Consent Decree unless (1) the term of the existing provisions of the Consent Decree be increased to at least seven years, and (2) upon expiration of this seven year period, TCI/Liberty is further restrained from withdrawing any programming from distribution unless such programming is similarly withdrawn from all markets, specifically including all systems in which TCI or Liberty has an interest, or the specific market from which it is withdrawn has been found to be subject to ``effective competition'' within the meaning of Section 621(l)(1) of the Act.
