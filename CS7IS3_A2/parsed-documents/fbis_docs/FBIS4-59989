This was preceded by false statements, such as the statements of al- Ansi and al-Iryani. And in front of these barbarous forces, from the helpless they presented human shields to the cemetery of death. The statement mentioned that our Armed Forces have come forward against taking shelter by the fighters in the cities and villages and making the citizens from the sons of our people human shields facing the weapons of destruction and killing. We, in the name of the Yemeni people in every place, demand the immediate stopping of this foolish fighting, and we remind all that we are in the month of war-prohibition in the Hijriyyah [Islamic] calendar, in which almighty God prohibited fighting in them. We are even in the first 10 days of the month of Dhu'l-hijjah. What law except the law of the jungle allows this, and where are those insisting on fighting from Islam. It is rejected teaching and in Shari'ah, we in the name of the Yemeni people appeal to all Arab and Islamic countries and organizations to stand with us in calling on the fighters to cease fire, especially during the days of pilgrimage and the blessed 'Id al-Adha.
