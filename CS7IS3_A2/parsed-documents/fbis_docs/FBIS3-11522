The advisory committee's "waiver" will permit the conclusion of an agreement on the $35 billion debt owed to private creditor banks without the guarantee ("standby") of the International Monetary Fund. With a speech delivered in New York, and with the tone of a candidate for president, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso took advantage of the proximity of the conclusion of the agreement. At least two-thirds of private creditor banks (out of a total of 440) need to give a positive answer to the Advisory Committee's waiver before 24 March. If this does not happen Brazil will need the IMF guarantee to sign the agreement. The Committee's communique recommends that banks endorse the agreement. During an interview at the Intercontinental Hotel yesterday, where he is staying, Cardoso said he is sure that creditor banks would agree to the Advisory Committee's suggestion. On 16 March the IMF refused to guarantee the agreement, compelling Brazil to provide by itself -- without money from international financial organizations -- the guarantees demanded by creditor banks. On 15 April, Brazil will have to prove to creditor banks that it has $2.8 billion in zero-coupons (U.S. Treasury bonds with a 30-year maturity period and zero interest) to guarantee the agreement. "Brazil is a prudent country, and will know how to present that guarantee," Cardoso said, without specifying whether the country has already purchased the coupons from the secondary market. Brazil could have purchased the bonds from the U.S. Treasury at a lower price if it had had the IMF "standby." According to the minister, the bonds will be deposited at the BIS (Bank of International Settlements) in Basil, Switzerland, on the date the agreement is signed. Financial market sources have said that Brazil has already purchased those coupons. The minister said the final negotiation of the debt agreement was "a nice, well-designed operation." But he refused to say when or how Brazil purchased the zero-coupons that will be used as a guarantee for the exchange of Brazilian debt certificates. Cardoso said the agreement proves that Brazil is a "solvent" country and "promotes economic growth, reduces the Brazilian risk, and reduces international interest rates for the country." Cardoso added that "the end" of the debt problem will make growth more feasible, and will "strengthen any candidacy supporting an economic program like the one we proposed." He said Brazil has turned over a new leaf. "I am particularly satisfied, because I have accompanied this process for 11 years, since the time I was a senator," the minister said. The signing of the agreement, he said, will facilitate the entry of foreign financial resources into the Brazilian economy. "The Brazilian risk will have to drop, the `spread' [preceding word in English] (interest surcharge) will have to drop," he said.
