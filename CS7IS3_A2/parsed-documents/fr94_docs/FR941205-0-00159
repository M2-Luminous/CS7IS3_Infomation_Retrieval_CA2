FR941205-0-00159 FR941205-0-00029 Amortization. The Department does not believe that Congress, in its enactment of section 542(c), intended to permit the use of riskier financing practices such as balloon payment terms and negative amortization. Use of these types of financing practices in insured programs could increase the chances that an insured mortgage would go into default or otherwise increase the Department's exposure on a mortgage where the terms of the financing permitted negative amortization. It is the Department's view that requiring a mortgage to be regularly amortizing would curtail the use of riskier financing practices that could jeopardize the stability of the insured loan. Change in use. The Department's purpose in requiring that a mortgage insured under this program contain a covenant prohibiting a change in use of the insured property was to carry out the intent of Congress that the mortgage insurance be used to provide affordable residential housing, rather than for some commercial enterprise, such as a hotel or office building. It has been HUD's view in all of its insurance programs, and it is HUD's view in this rule, that such a provision is not intended to preclude the conversion of a project from rental to cooperative housing since both rental and cooperative housing are residential housing. The ``change in use'' provision is intended to preclude the conversion of a project from residential use to some other form of use, e.g , commercial use. Hazard insurance. The Department does not believe that Congress, in enacting the section 542(c) risk-sharing program, intended for the Secretary to insure a mortgage on a project that is not insured against damage or destruction due to fire or other hazards. Additionally, the Department cannot conceive of an HFA making a loan on a project that is not insured against loss due to hazards. The requirement that a mortgagor under a mortgage have hazard insurance is a standard mortgage industry practice. Additionally, it is the Department's position that hazard insurance is a fundamental requirement of Federal mortgage insurance to protect the public fisc against loss of public assets and, therefore, must be required in this program. Single asset mortgagor. The requirement that a mortgagor be a single asset mortgagor is a requirement that is critical to the Department's ability to prevent the mortgagor of an insured project from commingling funds of the insured project with other assets that a mortgagor entity might own, if permitted. If the Department were to allow a mortgagor entity to own assets other than the insured project, this would increase the chances of a mortgagor siphoning off funds from an insured project for use in a conventionally financed project. This could result in the mortgagor of the insured mortgage suffering severe financial difficulty, possibly defaulting on the insured mortgage and a subsequent insurance claim being filed by the HFA. In addition, the assets of an insured project could become at risk, as a result of their application to the debts of a conventionally financed project in financial difficulty where both projects have the same owner. Other provisions in subpart E pertain to the closing of a mortgage loan. The closing will be held by the HFA, which is then required to submit a closing docket (with required documentation) to HUD for insurance endorsement. The required documentation is set forth in the interim rule as well. Subpart F_Project Management and Servicing Subpart F sets out the rules for HFAs to service loans and manage projects. The HFA will have broad responsibility for the administration of this program, including monitoring and determining the compliance of the project owner with the requirements of this rule. HUD will not hold or be a party to any mortgage or note instruments between the mortgagor and the HFA. HUD will, however, monitor the performance of the HFA to determine its compliance with this subpart.
