FBIS3-33811 "drnes021_j_94009" FBIS-NES-94-021 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Feb 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen New Road Promised to Kidnappers NC0102095894 Paris AFP in English 0109 GMT 1 Feb 94 NC0102095894 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Sanaa, Feb 1 (AFP) -- The authorities in Yemen have told tribesmen holding three French tourists hostage for more than a week to free them "immediately" in exchange for pledge to look into demands for a road into the tribesmen's remote mountain fief. Reliable Yemeni sources said the government had given the promise in a letter signed by 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-'Ansi, deputy prime minister and general secretary of the Islamic fundamentalist Al-Islah party and by fellow deputy prime minister Mujahid Abu-Shawarib. Abu-Shawarib is himself a native of the region where the three French tourists are being held about 200 kilometers (120 miles) north west of Sanaa. The letter was due to be delivered late on Monday to the mountain village of Al-Madhan more than eight hours by road and trail from the capital. The move follows a decision announced on Sunday by the al-Hashid tribe whose territory adjoins Al-Madhan to halt supplies of food to the rebel village in order to force the kidnappers into surrendering. The men who seized the French tourists belong to the smaller Ahnum tribe who claim to be penalised because the only road to their enclave goes through al-Hashid territory with the result that often their farm produce is confiscated. A road to be built in the region was initially due to go through Ahnum territory but was later diverted to go through al-Hashid land. A report in the English-language YEMEN TIMES Monday said the ministry of public works had come under strong pressure from the al-Hashid tribal chief Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar who is also president of parliament to re-route the road so as to skirt the Ahnum enclave. The letter delivered Monday reportedly said "the path of the road will be reexamined if the French hostages are released." Henri Haslot and his wife, both retired agronomy teachers in their seventies and 42-year-old Brigitte Fontaine were kidnapped at gunpoint on January 23 as they were travelling on the road from Sa'dah in the extreme north of Yemen. A French foreign ministry spokesman Monday said the three were "well treated and in good health". The YEMEN TIMES showed a photograph of the three French tourists sitting smiling with a village man at their side. The paper said there had been at least 11 similar cases in the past three years, and that all of them had come to a negotiated settlement. It said several countries had advised their nationals not to go to Yemen unless it was absolutely necessary.
