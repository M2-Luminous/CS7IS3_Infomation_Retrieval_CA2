As this takes place, our Palestinian people continue to record, with Palestinian blood, their historical struggle against the unjust Zionist enemy. Meanwhile, most parties conspire with the Zionist enemy against them and sit at the same table with the enemy. 'Arafat's distant command over past years has been hostile to the national movement. 'Arafat had even chosen to stand in the trench of our people's enemies and to conspire against them. [passage omitted] Our militant masses, we in the PFLP-GC, from a position of responsibility, call on all the sectors of our people who are concerned over their homeland to carry out the following duties: 1. Reject all the defeatist plans submitted by Yasir 'Arafat; 2. Ignore differences that could hamper our militant march; 3. Escalate the Palestinian intifadah with the intensity that we saw during the militant days following the Hebron massacre; 4. Escalate the national armed struggle as it is the road to liberate Palestine from the river to the ocean; 5. Be wary of yellow journalism that squirts out venom against Palestinians who oppose the defeatist agreements; 6. Reject the autonomy conspiracy embodied in the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and confront it; 7. Enhance the sense of national belonging within Palestinian frameworks. Let the 29th anniversary of the PFLP-GC's establishment on 11 April be a day when we renew the pledge to our martyrs, wounded, and detained, and a day of confrontation against the Zionist occupation forces. Let us make of this day a day of sweeping wrath against the traitor defeatists in the Palestinian arena. We promise our people and our martyrs that we will continue to fight the Zionists and to avenge their pure blood that has saturated the soil of Palestine. It is a promise we make to Hebron and Gaza to avenge our martyrs who fell while defending the soil of Palestine. We promise our front to remain loyal soldiers until the land of Palestine is cleansed of occupation and the Palestinian state is established on all Palestinian national soil, with Arab Jerusalem, the Jerusalem of Muslims and Arabs, as its capital. It is revolution until the liberation of land and man. [Signed] The PFLP-GC
