It depicts Vladimir Ilyich in bas-relief and is inscribed: "Lenin's Cause Is Alive and Will Triumph!" The words aroused an irate question: What kind of "triumph" is this? The country is falling apart and lies bleeding. The common man is drinking himself to death. The louse-infested homeless, completely oblivious to their surroundings, are a sign of the times, and so is the T-80 tank. Its designers probably never dreamed that the test site of the wonder-vehicle would be the center of our capital. This is where the regime won a luminous victory by turning parliament into a candle with a gigantic flame. This probably was not the kind of triumph the creators of the propaganda visual aid had in mind. Furthermore, where is the raykom that ordered its creation and installation?... In the hills, in the auditorium of the V.I. Lenin Museum, communists from all of the republics sat down at one big table. This was the site of the coordinating conference convened by the UCP-CPSU and organized with the active participation of all those present. The conference began with a brief keynote speech by UCP-CPSU Council Chairman O. Shenin. The conference was one of the results of the UCP-CPSU's colossal efforts to reestablish our party. The road to the conference was not smooth. After August 1991 the enemies of the CPSU, both external and internal, did everything within their power to make it disappear forever. The former did this with prohibitions, and the latter did it with betrayal, thwarting the efforts of ethical members of the Central Committee and rank-and-file communists to continue their work. In summer 1992, however, a Central Committee plenum was held and became a point of departure for the restoration of a unified organization of Soviet communists. It was followed by the 20th All-Union Conference and 29th Congress of the CPSU, where the party was temporarily converted into the UCP-CPSU with a view to the current situation in the republics. It was joined by the majority of republic parties. Delegates from fraternal parties at the April conference of the CPRF passed a resolution on an extensive coordinating convention. On the eve of the conference our Belorussian [Belarusian] comrades presented the CPRF with a gift: a stuffed Belovizh bison with one sawed-off horn--an allusion to Shushkevich and an inducement to "continue the proceedings." There was no question that there was a wish for this, and it was a unanimous wish. Was anything else even possible? Each speaker presented an account of trouble and suffering. The Russians in Kirghizia who cannot speak the Kirghiz language and see no future for themselves there are living the republic: There is no recognition of Russian as the language of inter-ethnic communication in the republic constitution. Operations have stopped at 40 percent of the enterprises in Latvia, and most of the remaining enterprises are in the confectionery and furniture industries. The kolkhozes were broken up, and the separate farmsteads are back, but the people have already lost the skills of solitary labor and have no financing. The rate of unemployment according to official statistics is 10 percent, and the actual rate is 44 percent. A loaf of bread once cost 16 kopecks in Riga and now it costs 16 centimes, but the average wage was once 160 rubles and is now 30 lats. The Latvian leadership is making every effort to join NATO, to preclude Latvia's return to the union. The Russian economy is suffering a veritable collapse, like an avalanche. In Ukraine President Kravchuk kept his campaign promises: Everyone did become a "gentleman" and a millionaire, but a million karbovantsy will not buy much! Ukrainian communists believe that the situation in that republic could lead to a repetition of the events of last October in Moscow. What lies ahead? I will cite just a few of the speakers' predictions. The Communist Party of the Russian Federation is determined, as G. Zyuganov announced, to promote the reestablishment of the union state, defend government by the people, protect the laboring public, and restore social justice. The next speaker, V. Tyulkin (RCWP), clarified these goals, however, by stipulating that what had to be reestablished was not some kind of "union state," but the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This will necessitate reliance on labor collectives after the party's influence there has been strengthened, the development of the labor movement, and the organization of a general political strike. The representative of the Communist Party of Estonia (we cannot call all of the representatives by name) made the logical comment that the anti-people regimes will eventually be ejected by public indignation, but communists must be ready for this outburst. Some of the speakers suggested that the present rulers are dangerous because they are in the throes of defeat and there is no crime they would not commit in order to stay on top. A report on the draft plan "For a Renewed Union of the Soviet Peoples" was presented by Ye. Ligachev. Property is the main issue. The draft envisages a multistructured economy with a prevalence of public property for our reunited fatherland. "The union will have a socialist foundation," Yegor Kuzmich said. The Soviet system of government by the people must be restored. The soviets (and the dumas, councils, assemblies, and so forth) are the best form of democracy because they were refined by the course of historical events. The progression toward the union, however, will not be quick, according to A. Lukyanov. It will begin with economic integration, followed by a common defense structure, and only then by a political union. At this time, Anatoliy Ivanovich stressed, it is imperative that the Belovizh accords be denounced. The formation of a single CPSU is also likely to take some time. Obviously, this process will occur at the same time as the interstate integration. Until it has been completed, said Sh. Shabdolov, the leader of the communists of Tajikistan, each party will have its own charter and program, because "it would be ridiculous to talk about a single set of documents today. We have to be united, however, in the areas in which our unity is imperative." Representing the Ukraine, A. Martynyuk continued the discussion of unity and reported that the Communist Party of Ukraine had joined the UCP-CPSU as a full-fledged member, and then asked the leaders of the different communist factions to fight our common enemy instead of each other. Many speakers mentioned the responsibility of the communists of Russia and their genuinely historic mission. "Everyone is watching you," the communists were told. "The union will begin with Russia. The situation in Russia has an immediate effect on its neighbors," said R. Akhmedov, representing the Communist Party of Azerbaijan. "I listened to the comrades from the Russian communist parties. I have the greatest respect for them, but I did not hear how they are coordinating their own actions." Most of the conference participants agree that the UCP-CPSU is the only possible form of association at this time, but some leaders are not in any hurry to join it. Here is a brief summary of the encouraging information that was reported at the conference. The Communist Party of the Russian Federation now has 550,000 communist members, united in 20,000 primary party organizations, which are active in almost all rayons, cities, oblasts, and republics. The "red belt" of the Russian regions is growing wider: The leaders in 70 out of 88 are either confirmed communists or their supporters--these are the statistics of the "democrats." In Tajikistan the organizational structure of the Communist Party was maintained, it occupies a strong position in the ideological sphere, the party press has been restored completely, and the party owns property. In Azerbaijan, "the people have turned to us and are no longer waiting for a knight on a white charger." There are 33,000 active communists in the republic, but the party does not feel any pressure to grow at this time and it is preparing for its 35th Congress. In the Ukrainian parliament, Chornovil, the leader of the nationalists, "bobs up and down in his chair when he listens to speeches by communists because these people know what to say and how to say it." In Southern Ossetia 60 percent of the communists stayed in the party after reregistration. Construction workers in Turkmenistan have initiated the study and dissemination of V.I. Lenin's works. They buy his books and present them to individuals capable of rediscovering the Leninist well of wisdom.... Summing up the results of the two-day conference, O. Shenin said: "We have taken a step forward and have not taken any steps backward." ...On my way back to Moscow I saw the majestic Lenin pillar again. This time the words inscribed on it did not sound odd. It was all true. Lenin's cause is alive, and it is certain to triumph!
