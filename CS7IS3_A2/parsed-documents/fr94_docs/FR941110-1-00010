FR941110-1-00010 FR941110-1-00003 3. Two service bulletins that describe inspections of the wings. (These two service bulletins were made mandatory by AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03.) The Task Group has also recommended, for mandatory modification, the actions contained in McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 Service Bulletin 53&hyph;230, Revision 1, dated January 12, 1993. The FAA has reviewed and approved this service bulletin, which describes procedures for installation of doublers and clips at the intersections of upper longerons/intercostals and fuselage frames between longerons 10L and 10R at various overwing stations between Y=484.000 and Y=851.000, as applicable, depending upon series of the airplane. Accomplishment of these modifications would terminate the inspections required by AD 88&hyph;24&hyph;08 R2, amendment 39&hyph;6469 (55 FR 1002, January 11, 1990), which requires external eddy current inspection to detect cracking of the fuselage skin and certain longerons, internal visual inspections of certain longerons, and repair of any findings of cracking. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03 to require additional structural modifications and inspections. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the document described previously. There are approximately 892 Model DC&hyph;9 and C&hyph;9 (military) series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 568 Model DC&hyph;9 and C&hyph;9 (military) series airplanes of U.S. registry were originally affected by AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03. The requirements of that AD were estimated to take approximately 946 work hours to accomplish, at a current average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost for required modification kits was estimated to be $15,140 per airplane. Based on these figures, the FAA estimated that the total cost impact of AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03 on U.S. operators of Model DC&hyph;9 and C&hyph;9 (military) series airplanes would be $38,152,560, or $67,170 per airplane, over the initial 4-year time period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up, familiarization, or tool acquisition.) The FAA estimates that a total of 511 Model DC&hyph;9 and C&hyph;9 (military) series airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by the new requirements specified in this proposed AD. The new additional requirements proposed by this AD action would take approximately 638 additional work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost an additional $37,027 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total additional cost impact of this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $36,851,787, or $72,117 per airplane, over a 4-year time period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up, familiarization, and tool acquisition.) There are approximately 1,090 Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 173 Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes of U.S. registry were originally affected by AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03. The requirements of that AD were estimated to take approximately 47 work hours to accomplish, at a current average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost for required modification kits was estimated to be $752 per airplane. Based on these figures, the FAA estimated that the total cost impact of AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03 on U.S. operators of Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes would be $577,301, or $3,337 per airplane, over the initial 4-year time period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up, familiarization, or tool acquisition.) The FAA estimates that a total of 615 Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by the new requirements specified in this proposed AD. This increase in the number of affected airplanes is due to various reasons, including transfer of ownership and the fact that additional airplanes have accumulated time-in-service since the issuance of AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03 and have reached the threshold for modification/inspection. The new additional requirements proposed by this AD action would take approximately 13 additional work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost an additional $943 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total additional cost impact of this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,019,670, or $1,658 per airplane, over a 4-year time period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up, familiarization, or tool acquisition.) The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished the currently required or the newly proposed requirements of this AD action; however, it can reasonably be assumed that a majority of affected operators have already initiated the inspections and structural modifications required by AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03 [retained in paragraphs (a) and (d) of this AD] and many may have already initiated the additional inspections and structural modifications proposed in this new AD action. The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the accomplishment of the actions proposed in this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' actions. However, in actual practice, these actions for the most part would be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of necessary additional work hours would be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any costs associated with special airplane scheduling would be minimal. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;6701 (55 FR 34704, August 24, 1990), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows: McDonnell Douglas: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;92&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;6701.
