Section 254.5 would be revised to read as follows: §254.5 Notice requirement. On any flight segment using large aircraft, or on any flight segment that is included on the same ticket as another flight segment that uses large aircraft, an air carrier shall provide to passengers, by conspicuous written material included on or with its ticket or other written notice that is issued in conjunction with the sale of the transportation, either: (a) Notice of any monetary limitation on its baggage liability to passengers; or (b) The following notice: ``Federal rules require any limit on an airline's baggage liability to be at least $1850 per passenger.'' Alternative Proposal 1 4. Section 254.4 would be revised to read as follows: §254.4 Carrier liability. On any flight segment using large aircraft, or on any flight segment that is included on the same ticket as another flight segment that uses large aircraft, an air carrier shall not limit its liability for provable direct or consequential damages resulting from the disappearance of, damage to, or delay in delivery of a passenger's personal property, including baggage, in its custody to an amount less than the current Federal Minimum Liability Limit per passenger that is in effect on the date of the flight. The Federal Minimum Liability Limit will be re-calculated every other year, based on the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers since the previous adjustment, and published in an announcement in the Federal Register . 5.
