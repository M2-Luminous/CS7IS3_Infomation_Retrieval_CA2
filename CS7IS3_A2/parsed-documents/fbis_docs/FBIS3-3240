Addressing today's full meeting of the current session of the CPPCC National Committee, David S. H. Chu, said, "economic development can spur progress in sports. Meanwhile, progress in sports can also improve the quality of a nation, and promote economic prosperity and progress. In the course of deepening reforms and opening China wider to the outside world, he said, it is necessary to mobilize all positive factors to invigorate the Chinese nation, including the full use of comprehensive and great functions of sports. The fact that China's bidding for the holding of the 2000 Olympic Games won full support of the entire Chinese people shows cohesiveness of the Chinese nation, he said. Now, there are more and more countries loving peace and understanding and backing China, he added. According to Chu, bidding to hold major international sports meets is a great honor for a country or a nation. For a large country like China, it is far from enough to hold just several international sports meets every year, he said. The state should encourage cities and localities that have never held such meets to submit bidding, he said. Cities and localities that have held such meets should bid to host more. "To this end, the state should formulate a series of encouragement policies," he said. He revealed that he is currently assisting the state physics culture and sports commission in bidding for the holding of a major international sports meet -- the China Bicycle World Cup Tournament. Talks on cooperation have been held with two TV networks: CBS in the United States and Sky in Europe, he said. The 12-day tournament is scheduled to start from Hong Kong to the Tiananmen Square in Beijing via Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Nanjing and Tianjin. The two networks will televise live the tournament four hours daily. The successful bidding for the tournament will not only help improve China's cycling standards, but also will enable the cities the cyclists will move through to open wider to the outside world, said Chu, who is vice president of the China Golf Association and chairman of the Mission Hills Golf Club in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province.
