"I hope that they have learned a lesson," Mladic said. Explaining the talks today with General Michael Rose, the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mladic stressed in a statement for TANJUG that an agreement had been reached to send some military observers to Gorazde. We suggested to Rose that he organize a meeting of the warring sides because we have nothing to discuss with them, either about Gorazde or about anything else. We are not at war with UNPROFOR, but we are open to discussion on all issues, including the discussion of Gorazde with the Muslim side, with UNPROFOR's mediation, general Mladic said.
