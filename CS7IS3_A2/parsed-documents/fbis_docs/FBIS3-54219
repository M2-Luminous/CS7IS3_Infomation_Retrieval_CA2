The people expressed pride in these two events and talked about them in their private discussions. The first of these events is the leader president's meeting with the Armed Forces command members and his explanation of events in the Mother of Battles, and the second is his excellency's speech on the third anniversary of the great confrontation. After the speech was carried on the TV screen the evening of 16 January, the dollar prices rose to 160 dinars [D]. The dollar prices continued to rise against the dinar over the past two days, reaching D169 at 1400 on 19 January, and up to D171 by the end of that day. This shows that our enemy, which has not been able to wrench anything from us and failed to realize a clear military victory or a historical triumph, as the leader president said, has made some gains in the arena of the economic battle. Therefore, we have retreated a step. This shows that there is always a gap between the leader and his way of thinking on the one hand and the implementing tools on the other. The following facts explain this: When the new cabinet took office and made a number of decisions, the dollar price jumped from D68 to D80. Later, the dollar jumped to D150, dropped to D130, and continued to range between D130 and D135. Now it stands at D171. The real danger is that while in the past decisions reflected various aspects, they now reflect only the political aspect in isolation from other aspects because our departments commit mistakes in dealing with the blockade and the continuous pressure from abroad. Political decisions now are associated with economic facts that are not in harmony with them. They do not go hand in hand to realize their target. This prompts us to deal with this issue seriously, with extreme precision, and with an academic intelligence [dhaka' akadimi] coupled with the actual conditions. Why? The UN Security Council statements say: "Two months have elapsed since the Security Council issued its resolution on long-term monitoring of Iraq. Twelve months must pass in order to ascertain Iraq's goodwill and be able to discuss or lift the embargo." The statements of the French have become so ugly, exactly like their treatment of strangers in their land. Their statements are like their behavior and the behavior of their president, Mitterrand the supercilious, who is completely connected with the morals and behavior of those who ruled the Fourth Republic. Let us consider the following: In the past, when the dollar was exchanged for D30, we made our observations in a newspaper column. When it reached D60, we held a discussion, which did not last more than 15 minutes, to express observations and point out the negative aspects of the rising dollar prices. When the dollar price exceeded D100, we held a one and a half hour discussion to make some observations. If we want to discuss the current conditions, we will have to spend no less than two or three hours in order to propose solutions. This means that those who are responsible for implementing decisions do not benefit from these observations. Their work is confused. This is proved by the fact that after every meeting of the ministerial committee charged with the economic conditions, the dinar slumps further and further. Therefore, we suggest that each ministerial portfolio be dealt with in accordance with its achievements. And this is directly connected with the dinar and dollar prices, because this issue is casting a dark shadow and is affecting the daily life of the citizen. Therefore, the following yardstick should be the slogan: A rise in the dollar price means failure and a drop means success. The proof that there is a difference between the source of the decisions, which is the comrade leader, and the mode of thinking of the implementers is that his treatment of the rise in the dollar was quick and had a clear effect on the life of the citizen; namely, increasing the citizens provisions. This method is much better than economic measures that could have been taken and whose results would only appear in the long run without the citizen feeling them because of the rise in the dollar exchange rate.
