The Egyptian media did not mention the executions or the trial of the two Islamic militants. AL-HAYAT is edited in London and distributed in Cairo and other Arab capitals. Last year the authorities criticised the newspaper several times, notably in connection with its publication of an interview with Shaykh Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, whom the Islamic militants regard as their spiritual leader.
