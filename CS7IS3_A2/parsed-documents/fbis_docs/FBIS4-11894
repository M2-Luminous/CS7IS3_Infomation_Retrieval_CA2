Here is the statement full text: Sudan's Stance Towards Various Issues The government of the Revolution of National Salvation is fully aware of the fact that most of the problems that face the Sudan at the internal level and at the level of its relations with the other countries, including the United States, are tightly connected with the problem of the war in southern Sudan, therefore, the government has always been looking for the attainment of a peaceful solution to the problem in itself as well as for the treatment of the complications that the war has caused. This has been clearly reflected in the efforts exerted by the government in order to restore peace and to provide relief for those affected by the war. On the other hand, the problem of the war in the south is connected to varying degree with other problems encountered by the Sudan such as human rights, the quest for an equitable division of wealth and power and the creation of social and economic development. Since its advent the Revolution of National Salvation has put the quest for a peaceful solution to the conflict in southern Sudan at the top of its priorities. It took the initiative by sending a message to Colonel John Garang calling him for the table of negotiations, but he refused to receive that message, which was received instead by the former Ethiopian President Mengistu. The government also took the initiative by declaring a unilateral cease-fire which induced the rebels to capture Kurmuk Town, but the government had nevertheless committed itself to the transportation of relief products to the needy in the operation areas, including those controlled by the rebels. Two months after the advent of the revolution, in August 1989, a government delegation met with rebels delegation in Addis Ababa and the two sides agreed upon the necessity of the continuation of the negotiations in order to attain peace. During September and October 1989 a national conference on peace issues convened in Khartoum and tackled problems such as; (1) Power sharing (2) Distribution of wealth (3) Religion and politics (4) Unity in diversity During the period from 28th November to 5th December, the second round of negotiations between the government and the rebels was held in Nairobi, sponsored by former U.S. President Mr. Jimmy Carter. In effect, the government's agenda during this round and during all the subsequent talks were the resolutions of the national conference on peace issues. In 1991 the rebel movement was split into two factions. However, the government had not given up hope in contacting both of them. During May, June, 1992, and in response to the mediation of the Nigerian Government, another first round of negotiation was held in Abuja between the government and the two factions, and the agenda had been agreed upon for the future talks, but John Garang declared in Kampala during a press conference that he would not recognize the Abuja resolutions because the head of his delegation surpassed the powers delegated to him. The second round convened in Abuja in May 1993, and this time the concerned sides had agreed upon most of the raised points but the coming of John Garang at the end of the talks impeded the success of the round by causing a disagreement over the issue of residual powers. However, another round of talks between the government and the United Faction was held in Nairobi and resumed in Fashoda (Sudan) in August 1993. During the summit meeting of IGADD (6th to 8th September 1993), the presidents of Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda, expressed their desire to mediate in order to put an end to the war in southern Sudan. A meeting between the two sides of the conflict was thus held in Nairobi, 17th March 1994, but the talks have been postponed, to be resumed in the same venue on 16th May 1994. This long war which is imposed upon us in the southern part of the country has created a humanitarian problem. This problem is manifest in the great numbers of displaced persons who sought refuge in safer areas inside or outside of the Sudan. The government has therefore committed itself to displaced people until peace is restored and they go back to their areas. In fact, the government has done its utmost in order to provide relief for its needy citizens and at the same time it welcomed the support of the international community in this respect. The government has signed a number of agreements, some of which represent a breakthrough in the field of providing relief to those affected by war, even for those who live in the areas held by the rebels. The agreements include: (1) The general agreement with the International Commission of the Red Cross signed in 1984. (2) Operation Lifeline Sudan signed with the U.N. in 1989. (3) Operation Lifeline signed with U.N. in 1991. (4) The detailed agreement with the ICRC in 1992. (5) Operation Lifeline signed with the U.N. in 1993. (6) The Nairobi Agreement with the rebel factions on the facilitation of the flow of relief March 1994. In spite of the fact that the rebel movement has exploited these agreements to serve other ends, and in spite of the fact that certain organizations have acted in such manners that ignore the Sudanese sovereignty, the government showed a lot of patience and cooperation in consideration to the miserable situation of its citizens. However, the major handicap that faces us at the present is the lack of the means of transportation that secure the arrival of the relief materials to the needy in due time. And hence, the government is ready for full cooperation with the international community represented by the U.N. and donor countries for the import of the necessary equipment for the transportation of relief products as well as for the cooperation in the field of the supervision of relief operations. Democracy and Political System The concept of democracy in Sudan entails the exercise of people of their legitimate rights in governing themselves and choosing the political system that conforms with their social background, cultural heritage and economic prosperity. (?As to) the question of democracy (?on) the agenda of (?Sudan)- American relations, it is imperative to agree on the content rather than the form which is governed by the changing factors of specific community. Sudan has adopted a political system that conforms with its orientation, having in mind repeated failures of applying Western democracy since independence, in 1956. Although the political system is still in its preliminary stages, the active participation of people in popular committees' elections gave it the needed drive. Necessary steps are being taken to complete the system by introducing free and direct elections at all levels, from popular committee to the National Assembly. The political system tends also to elect the president and vice president directly. The federal system will help also to widen the base for political participation. Economic Reform Sudan's Government has exerted great efforts regarding privatization of the Sudanese economy to an extent that exceeded what is usually recommended by the IMF. It applied a tough policy of self-reliance and market economy which resulted in economic hardship. Unfortunately, the IMF has ignored its adviser's technical view, which praised Sudan for achieving an annual economic growth of 11.5 percent. The IMF response to American (?pressure) has denied Sudan any financial assistance. The IMF has lost its technical credibility and began to treat economic issues which are influenced by double standards. Terrorism Sudan has renewed its condemnation of international terrorism. It also requested those accusing Sudan of terrorism to furnish evidence to that effect. It is needless to say that Sudan does not harbour terrorists or training camps and the government has repeatedly declared that Sudan is an open country for those who want to see for themselves. Sudan also is not threatening the stability of other countries. To the contrary, Sudan is threatened by some neighbouring countries that provide rebels and opposition groups with logistics, camps and access to media. Efforts were made to refute these allegations about terrorism. Dialogue was started with the American ambassador in Khartoum and a letter was sent by the foreign minister to his American counterpart, suggesting exchange of information about the subject. Instead of a positive response, the United States include Sudan in its list of countries sponsoring international terrorism. A statement by ex-President Jimmy Carter and a testimony by an official of the State Department, at hearing in the congress on last March 1994, prove beyond doubt that the American decision was baseless. Human Rights Respect of human rights in Sudan is a matter of principle and the government is very eager to preserve these rights in accordance with its principles. Sudan welcomed the special rapporteur, Mr. Gaspar Biro, and accorded him all assistance possible to carry out his job. However, the report of the special rapporteur was full of misinformation and disrespect to the beliefs of the Sudanese people. Nevertheless, the U.S. Government delegation to the 50th session of the human rights committee decided to support the biased report and spearhead the attack on Sudan. We believe that the noble cause of human rights is being exploited politically and double standards were applied to ridicule the beliefs of Muslims, as did the report by the special rapporteur. This is a serious matter. Such irresponsible behavior defeats the real objectives behind the international instruments on human rights that call for the respect of different cultures and religious beliefs. Grievances of the Sudanese Government Against the USA Policy The Sudanese Government has its own grievances against the policy of the U.S.A. vis-a-vis the Sudan. It is a policy characterized by permanent hostility, escalation of contention and arbitrary. (1) The American administration based itself in its hostile position against the government of the Sudan on Congress Resolution No. 513, despite the selectivity and double standards practised by the American administration in applying this resolution. The administration did not take into account the legacy inherited by the NSR government such as an imposed war, refugees, displaced persons, drought and instability that hindered development, endangered unity and security of the country and posed a threat to neighbours. (2) The United States adopted a number of resolutions against the Sudan without any objective reasons, an act that deepened misunderstanding between the two governments, e.g.; (3) Congress Resolution No. H.R. 2295 (June 1993), H.R. 2332, (June 1993-1994), (March 1993) and 131 (November, 1993). [paragraph as received] (4) Hostile positions of the American Administration by preparing draft resolutions against the Sudan and lobbying for their adoption. Such positions were flagrant at U.N. General Assembly during 47th, 48th sessions, especially on human rights issue. (5) Hostile American positions against the Sudan within the Human Rights Commission sessions 48,49,50. The question of appointing the independent expert, the appointment of the special rapporteur, transition of Sudan from the confidential hearing to the public hearing phase and, finally, the adoption of the report of the rapporteur which contained insults against Islam, the creed of the nation. (6) Adaption by the American administration of the rebels' version at different international forums and different occasions, as proved. - The Washington Colloquium, organized under the auspices of Mr. Johnson, chairman of the Special Committee on Africa. - Hostility to the Islamic orientation of the Sudan and its cultural option. - The hostile position of the American Administration against Sudan at the IMF, an act that led to forcing the Sudan to quit the IMF. - The American Administration consistently stood against the Sudan in other international financial institutions. - Inscription of the Sudan on the list of countries that sponsor international terrorism, without the least proof by the American administration. - Anti-Sudanese declarations by USA officials in every international forum, subjectively and without any proof whatever. - Despite the American humanitarian assistance, a gesture appreciated in itself, yet this assistance is limited and does not cover liberated zones and falls short of involving infrastructure for relief operat ons. Conclusion Despite the grievances mentioned above and the damage suffered by the Sudan due to the American hostile policy, we do believe that there is no objective reason for this hostility. We are confident that the wrong information leaked to the American Administration, which caused the misunderstanding that prevail over the relations between the two countries, can be corrected through serious, frank, and active dialogue. The Government of Sudan stands ready for such dialogue and that it shall contribute, it is the conviction that dialogue is the confidence between the two countries and strengthen the ties of friendship between the two governments.
