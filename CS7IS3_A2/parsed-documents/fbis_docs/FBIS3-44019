Those two structures have described the MPLA-PT governor's words as thoughtless. Fernandes, who was interviewed in Luanda yesterday, described Malange Province's political and military situation as serious because of an alleged intensification of the attacks by the UNITA troops. According to him, those forces were also planting mines along access routes to farming areas used by the people. That MPLA-PT official has dared to show himself a faithful defender of the Futungo de Belas Palace leadership's interests. He made defamatory remarks about things that are not even happening. He even failed to notice when he confessed the truth by saying that Malange Province's difficulties owed to a large extent to a lack of support by the Luanda regime. [passage omitted]
