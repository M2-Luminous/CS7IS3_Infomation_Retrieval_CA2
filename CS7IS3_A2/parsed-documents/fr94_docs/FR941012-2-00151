FR941012-2-00151 FR941012-2-00099 This understanding is based on the above cited EN and relevant HRLs. HRL 953282, dated February 16, 1993, classified a 1 liter glass jar decorated with a blue ribbon and decalmania which created a country motif band in blue, pink, green and yellow around the middle of the jar. Customs held that, while the container did convey goods, its decoration, lid, and environment of sale all indicated that the principal use of the container was for storage, not the conveyance of goods. See also, HRL 087727, dated September 21, 1990, which classified spice jars as household storage jars. Customs proposes to continue to apply the standards outlined above. We note that due to the USDA report's recommendation that glass articles with wire bale and trigger closures (non ``Mason-type'') not be used for home canning, but rather as storage articles for dry ingredients, all glass articles with wire bale trigger closures and glass caps or lids will be classifiable under subheading 7013.39, HTSUS. However, we note that there are glass articles capable of both conveyance or packing of goods and household storage, as demonstrated in the Kraft case. Instances of these types of articles will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, with the above outlined characteristics determining the article's principal use and classification. Authority This notice is published in accordance with section 177.10(c), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.10(c)). Comments In accordance with the above discussion, Customs is now seeking comments from the public regarding the proposed change of practice with regards to the tariff provisions for all three of these classes of glass articles. Customs is especially interested in receiving comments regarding the characteristics that are indicative of each class. Before adopting this proposed change in practice, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted to Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), ยง1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and ยง103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11 (b)), on regular business days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulations Branch, U.S. Customs Service, Office of Regulations and Rulings, Franklin Court, 1099 14th Street, N.W., Suite 4000, Washington D.C. Dated: September 23, 1994. George J. Weise, Commissioner of Customs. John W. Mangels, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.
