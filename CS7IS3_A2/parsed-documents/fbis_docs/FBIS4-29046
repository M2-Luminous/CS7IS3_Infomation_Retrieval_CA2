Kakizawa is considering making the trip after the budget for fiscal 1994 passes the Diet around June 23 or 24, the sources said. He is expected to meet Secretary of State Warren Christopher and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. Kantor has reportedly been urging Kakizawa to visit the U.S. to promote talks on bilateral trade framework negotiations. Japan and the U.S. agreed last month to resume the trade framework talks, which broke down in February when President Bill Clinton and then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa met in Washington. The two countries have been holding working-level talks since then and are scheduled to hold vice ministerial talks in Tokyo on June 22 and 23 between Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi. Kakizawa is also likely to discuss North Korea's alleged nuclear development with Christopher along with measures to be taken by the United Nations, the sources said.
