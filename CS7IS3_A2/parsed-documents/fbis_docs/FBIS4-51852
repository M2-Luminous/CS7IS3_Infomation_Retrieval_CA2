FBIS4-51852 "dreas086_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-086 Daily Report 2 May 1994 North Korea ROK Leaders' `Violent War Remarks' Denounced ROK Leaders' `Violent War Remarks' Denounced SK0405073394 Pyongyang Radio Pyongyang in Korean to South Korea 0900 GMT 2 May 94 SK0405073394 Pyongyang Radio Pyongyang Korean BFN [Unattributed talk: "Violent War Remarks by the Civilian Warmongers"] [Text] As you, South Korean youths and students, are well aware of the fact that whenever it opens its mouth, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique under a civilian guise is unhesitatingly spinning out bellicose gibberish against our Republic. Not long ago, a man named Yi Pyong-tae, who is said to be the puppet minister of national defense of South Korea, talked about the integration [tonghap] through a northward invasion, babbling about launching a so-called retaliation through strong punishment and about making use of this as an opportunity for reunification when needs arise. He even revealed a plan for a northward war of aggression called New Operational Plan 5027--which is to be composed of 5-phase operational concepts. Timed with this, traitor Kim Chong-pil, the so-called chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party, has said that it is necessary to cope with [taeung] the North in a cool-headed and firm manner, saying that dialogues with compatriots as advocated by many people is a fantasy. As the saying goes: A crow can make no other voice than a caw no matter how much it strains its voice, only bellicose violent war remarks are being shouted out from the mouth of the warmaniac Kim Yong-sam treacherous clique. Last year, a man named Kwon Yong-hae, then puppet national defense minister, said that he would not hesitate to take the so- called military countermeasure [taeung], finding fault with our so-called nuclear development. Babbling about the threat of a southward invasion by the North, traitor Kim Yong-sam, a civilian warmonger, loudly stressed the need to work out every kind of countermeasures. The remarks against the northern part of the Republic made by the treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique are bellicose absurd remarks deeply reeking of a northward invasion. Although they had carried out numerous provocative maneuvers against the northern part of the Republic, the preceding South Korean ruling cliques dared not to make blustering gibberish of a northward invasion as the Kim Yong-sam ring is doing. Either at the scenes of riotous eating at Chongwadae [presidential office] or during its tour of the frontline area, the Kim Yong-sam ring is continuously making violent war remarks aimed at crushing [apsal] the Republic under the poor excuses. The reality clearly shows that no matter how loud it babbles about being civilian, the Kim Yong-sam treacherous clique is a group of cutthroat warmaniacs far exceeding their predecessor military dictators. Then, for what is the Kim Yong-sam unhesitatingly making gunpowder-reeking violent war remarks? The reason lies in their earnest [otokehana] attempt to (?ignite) the fuse of war of a northward invasion, inciting the (?atmosphere) of confrontation and mistrust and artificially straining the situation while indiscriminately spinning out reckless remarks against the northern part of the Republic. In other words, this means that the Kim Yong- sam ring, under the civilian ironclad helmet, will by any means [kioko] realize its ambition to reunify the nation by defeating communism. (?In reality), despite the strong opposition and rejection from the people at home and abroad, the Kim Yong-sam treacherous clique is trying to inflict nuclear disasters on its compatriots in collusion with its master by deploying new-type Patriot missiles in South Korea and even offering more military bases for the U.S. Armed Forces. Because of the reckless maneuvers of the Kim Yong-sam treacherous clique, a tense situation is being created today on the Korean peninsula in which no one knows when a nuclear war might break out. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is bringing the situation to the brink of a dangerous war while continuously making bellicose gibberish against the northern part of the Republic. This can never be tolerated. It is extremely just for the South Korean youths and students, who are firmly united around the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils to forcefully stage the struggle against the United States, war, nuclear, and the government. If the forces of aggression and war servants are left intact in South Korea, our nation cannot avert the danger of nuclear disasters. If the South Korean puppet clique thinks that, under its master's instigation, it can threaten and bring to the knees the Republic through the violent war remarks and introduction of modern weapons of mass destruction, and by playing with fire of a nuclear war, it is a wild fancy. Even if the warmongers should play with the fire of Team Spirit, our people will not be surprised, nor they will be surprised, even if they should make a threat by introducing something more formidable than [kuboda tohangosul] Patriot missiles. If the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should put into action the reckless violent war remarks, then, it will not be able to escape the fate of a tiger moth enjoying a flame.
