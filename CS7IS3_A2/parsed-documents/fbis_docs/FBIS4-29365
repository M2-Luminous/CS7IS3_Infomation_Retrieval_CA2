The current projection, approved by the cabinet in January 1990, calls for a food self-sufficiency rate of 50 percent in the year 2000. But Japan's decision to end its decades-old ban on rice imports last December in order to sign the Uruguay round trade agreement has altered conditions on which the latest projection was made. The agreement calls for converting nontariff trade barriers such as import bans into tariffs but allows Japan to have a six-year grace period before doing so on condition that it imports 4 to 8 percent of its domestic rice consumption during the period. Japan is to negotiate what to do over its rice market opening after the moratorium, making it uncertain what the domestic rice supply-demand will be after the year 2000. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is studying several options in projecting the supply-demand situation for rice and other key agricultural products after that year, ministry officials said. They include one case in which Japan will replace all import bans and quotas with tariffs, and another in which the grace period will be extended, they said. To date, the ministry has reviewed its long-term supply-demand projection for rice and other key farm products every 10 years to set a guideline on domestic agricultural production.
