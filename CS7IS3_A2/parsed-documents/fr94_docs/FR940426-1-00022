FR940426-1-00022 FR940426-1-00004 Question 1.16. What should be the role of disclosure, transaction transparency, and regulatory surveillance in determining the appropriate cooling-off periods? Question 1.17. Are there more appropriate criteria on which to base cooling-off period lengths than the $5/400,000 Share Test? Should the test be based on the dollar value of public float, market capitalization, or dollar value of average daily trading volume, or a combination of these elements? What would be the appropriate thresholds? 80 80 The Commission previously received limited, mixed comment on this issue. See File No. S7&hyph;33&hyph;92, containing comment letters on Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31347 (October 22, 1992), 57 FR 49039. Question 1.18. Should securities of very highly capitalized issuers be subject to a cooling-off period of less than two business days? How should these issuers be identified? Should any securities ( e.g., penny stocks) have a cooling-off period longer than nine business days? Question 1.19. Should distribution participants be permitted to effect bona fide hedging transactions in the offered security if such hedging is done to offset the risk of a position established before becoming a distribution participant? What should be the parameters of any such hedging exception? Question 1.20. During distributions of index- or equity-linked securities or similar derivative products, should broker-dealers be permitted to engage in risk-reducing activities until the time that the offering price or strike price is established? If so, what parameters are necessary or appropriate? Question 1.21. Should issuers be permitted to purchase covered securities throughout the distribution period if other antimanipulation guidelines are followed, e.g., Rule 10b&hyph;18? 81 81 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;18. E. Securities Concept Four: Regulation should be limited to securities whose prices may significantly affect the market's evaluation of a security in distribution. The provisions of Rule 10b&hyph;6 apply to the security being distributed, any security of the ``same class and series'' as that security, and ``any right to purchase'' any such security. 82 The rule also deems a distribution of a security that is ``immediately exchangeable for or convertible into'' another security, or that entitles the holder immediately to acquire another security, to include a distribution of such other security, thereby prohibiting bids for or purchases of the underlying security as well as the security in distribution. 83 The rule covers these securities because they bear a relationship to the securities in distribution such that distribution participants may be tempted to manipulate these related securities to facilitate the distribution. 82 Paragraph (a). This collection of securities are referred to as the ``covered securities'' in this release. 83 Paragraph (b). The relationship between the securities to be distributed and those to be purchased may be based on their similar terms or on a mathematical relationship conferred, for example, by a right to convert or exchange one security for the other. Bids for or purchases of related securities may result in price changes that render them expensive relative to the security in distribution. The disparate prices may prompt arbitrage transactions by other market participants involving the sale of the related security and the purchase (and possible upward effect on the price) of the security in distribution. Purchases of a related security by distribution participants also may be used to induce unrelated market professionals to purchase the security in distribution as a hedge. For example, large purchases of standardized call options are likely to force options market makers (who have sold the options) to purchase the underlying common stock to hedge their risk. A price increase in a related security also may indicate to a potential investor that the security in distribution is under-priced. The ``same class and series'' language has been construed broadly to encompass securities that are sufficiently similar in their terms to the security in distribution to raise the possibility that bids for or purchases of the outstanding security might be utilized to facilitate the distribution, even though there is no inherent mathematical relationship between the prices of the securities. 84 84 ``Same class and series'' questions have arisen most frequently with regard to debt securities. See Letter regarding Gamble Skogmo, Inc. (January 11, 1974) (available on LEXIS), in which the staff took a no-action position to permit bids for or purchases of the issuer's outstanding debt securities that varied by at least 1% in coupon interest rate and by at least ten years in maturity from those of the debt securities being distributed. Transactions in nonconvertible debt securities or nonconvertible preferred securities where both the nonconvertible securities being distributed and those to be purchased have been rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization (``NRSRO'') are excepted from Rule 10b&hyph;6. Paragraph (a)(4)(xiii). The exception is premised on the fungibility of investment grade issues (i.e., that securities with similar terms will trade on rating and yield rather than issuer identification). Prices of high-yield debt securities, on the other hand, are presumed to be influenced by issuer-specific information as well as interest rates. Cf.
