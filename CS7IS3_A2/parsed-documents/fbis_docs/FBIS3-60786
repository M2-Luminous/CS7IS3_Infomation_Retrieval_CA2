The explosion, which was part of a series of dynamite attacks that occurred on the eve of Chinese leader Mao Ze Dong's centennial--which the rebel group, the Shining Path, threatened to celebrate by executing a series of violent actions--destroyed three houses and injured five members of a family and a passerby. Security forces have reported that a man and a woman, presumably involved in the attack, were arrested in the vicinity.
