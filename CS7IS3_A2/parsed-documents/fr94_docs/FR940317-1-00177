ACTION: Advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM). SUMMARY: This notice seeks public comment on general policy and specific recommendations for voluntary and regulatory actions to address the effects of aircraft overflights on national parks. On December 22, 1993, Transportation Secretary Federico Peña and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced the formation of an interagency working group to explore ways to limit or reduce impacts from overflights on national parks. Secretary Babbitt and Secretary Peña concur that increased flight operations at the Grand Canyon and other national parks have significantly diminished the national park experience for park visitors, and that measures can and should be taken to preserve a quality park experience for visitors. The Secretaries see the formation of the working group, and the mutual commitment to addressing the impacts of park overflights, as the initial steps in a new spirit of cooperation between the two departments. National parks are unique national resources that have been provided special protection by law. The National Park Service (NPS) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recognize that excessive noise from commercial air tours and other flights over units of the national parks system can interfere with NPS efforts to achieve a natural park experience for visitors and to preserve other park values. Through the interagency working group, the NPS and FAA will cooperate in developing measures to resolve current noise impacts and prevent potential future impacts from overflights at national parks. The purpose of this ANPRM is twofold. First, the ANPRM addresses overflights of Grand Canyon National Park and national parks in the State of Hawaii, with particular emphasis on overflights by commercial tour operators. Second, the ANPRM solicits policy views and recommendations on more general issues as part of an effort to form a comprehensive policy on preventing, minimizing, or eliminating impacts of aircraft overflights. This notice presents options that may be considered as means to minimize the adverse effects of commercial air tour operations and other overflights on units of the national park system, and seeks public comments and suggestions on voluntary and regulatory actions to deal with noise and other overflight issues that may affect national parks. DATES: Comments on this ANPRM must be received on or before June 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on this advance notice should be mailed, in triplicate, to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;200), Docket No. 27643, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591.
