Similarly, the censure motion points out that the policy of the Nicolae Vacaroiu government runs counter to national interests by deliberately ignoring the developing of certain strategic sectors, which has disastrous consequences for the future of the country. The government is also accused of not observing its own government program. As a consequence of all this, the signatories of the censure motion appeal to all senators and Chamber of Deputies members to join them and express by vote their lack of confidence in the current government. The censure motion was signed by 141 senators and Chamber of Deputies members. Immediately following the presentation of the text of the censure motion and of the list of the parliamentarians who signed it, the parliamentary faction of the Liberal Party 1993 [PL-93] suggested that the Thursday [30 June] debates on the censure motion should be carried live by national television. They suggested this because the permanent bureaus of the two chambers of Parliament had expressed an contrary opinion. Submitted to vote, the PL-93 parliamentary faction's proposal that the Thursday debates of parliament should be carried by television was rejected by 138 votes against, 160 in favor, and 41 abstentions, as the proposal was not supported by a majority of the 407 parliamentarians who attended today's session, our correspondent reports.
