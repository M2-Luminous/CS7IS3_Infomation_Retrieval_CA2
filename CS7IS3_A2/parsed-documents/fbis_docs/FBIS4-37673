But this transition is at present handicapped by two factors: One is the refusal of several parties (the National Liberation Front, the Socialist Forces Front, the Rally for Culture and Democracy) to participate in the transitional institutions, the other is the Islamist phenomenon. [Sifi] The dialogue already brings together political parties, including moderate islamist parties, key figures, and representatives of social, trade union or cultural groups which are clearly representative. We will begin with all these parties and keep the door open; the seats reserved for the other parties (22 seats out of the 200 in the National Transitional Council -- editor's note) remain available, they can join us at any stage. The process of dialogue, with those who respect the Constitution and laws and who reject terrorism, is not easy, and it takes time. [LE SOIR] Time, while the violence by armed Islamic groups continues, particularly against civilians: doctors, journalists, professors. Why these targets and not just government representatives? [Sifi] You have to try and read these terrorist acts. They are seeking to upset the country's social and economic life, and they no doubt believed that through these acts they could act upon the population, bring them to the brink, and cause them to create even greater problems. It has not achieved this result, quite the contrary. [LE SOIR] Is there any possibility of solving the present crisis without entering into dialogue with the Islamic fringe? [Sifi] Certainly. What counts most in Algeria is the population. If it finds a response to its aspirations, housing, employment, I fail to see why this will not work. [LE SOIR] If the Islamists agreed to dialogue, what concessions are the authorities prepared to make? [Sifi] The authorities have no concessions to make. Anyone who talks of power-sharing is going against democracy. It is up to the population to decide who it is going to entrust with power. In any event our government is a transitional one, it is not intended to stay in place. [LE SOIR] But to move away from a security policy and toward a more social policy, you must succeed in "managing" the problem of the "hard-line" Islamists and the armed groups. [Sifi] I do not know where these people are. There are armed gangs who recruit young people with nothing else to do, but the rest of the population rejects such a situation. We must now stop this violence, the government must reinforce the antiterrorist measures. And all democratic states must ensure that their country does not become a rear or transit base for terrorists. [LE SOIR] In this respect, what are your relations with Germany and the United States, which have allowed in Rabah Kebir and Anwar Haddam respectively? [Sifi] A country has sovereign rights at home, but there are always limits that it must respect. Steps are taken to ask our partners to be vigilant, because things can happen without their knowledge. And this applies even more so when things are known. [LE SOIR] The WASHINGTON POST recently reported on direct contacts between the CIA and the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], which apparently gave assurances to the United States in return for a certain support. [Sifi] I have not received any precise information on the official positions except for that from the U.S. President who denounced terrorism. But it seems that Bill Clinton expressed the desire to see a broader government base in Algeria, which is ultimately what everyone wants. It is an approval of the Algerian approach. There had been very low level contacts with the people from the FIS. For information purposes perhaps. [LE SOIR] In certain circles, in Algeria and abroad, the authorities are also given some "bad marks," for human rights in particular: excessive repression, death squads. [Sifi] That is a tactic to destabilize the country. The security services have received firm instructions not to fall into the trap of repression, even at the risk of delaying their operations or of losing men. And every measure has been taken to severely punish any excesses. [LE SOIR] Caught in a cycle of terrorism-repression, Algeria sometimes gives the impression of economic inertia. What are your priorities? [Sifi] Our priorities lie in four areas. First of all, accommodation: We must make it possible to build as much housing as possible, in the framework of the development of a market economy. Because to date, housing programs along with all our other activities, have been in the hands of a corrupt administration. You have to wait from eight to 10 years for a home! We need 1.2 million houses if each one is occupied by seven people, which is much higher than the standards approved by the World Health Organization. [LE SOIR] And other priorities? [Sifi] The development of small- and medium-sized companies and agriculture, an area in which we are lagging far behind. We depend on the outside world: We import foodstuffs worth $2 billion every year despite our considerable resources. Then there are hydrocarbons, in which we are currently investing. They will allow us to double our gas exports by 1998 or 1999 and to maintain our present level of oil production. [LE SOIR] Will that undermine Islamism? [Sifi] Yes. All these investments meet the needs of the population, with improved management of the health, education, and water distribution sectors. Improvements in these areas will allow us to relieve the burden so far borne by the population. If it did not suffer at the hands of terrorism, it would be from crime, delinquency, or drugs. Terrorism has the same roots as the other evils. [LE SOIR] You are making your first visit to Brussels and Paris since your election. What are you going to discuss with the European authorities? [Sifi] We are going to see how we can speed up the adaptation of the accord which has bound us to the European Union since 1976. We hope the Union will delegate experts to start discussions within "reasonable" deadlines. This adaptation must take into account political and economic change in Algeria. [LE SOIR] And on the subject of the debt? [Sifi] After the accord concluded at the Club de Paris to reschedule the debt, we have until 31 December to conclude bilateral agreements with Belgium and 16 other countries.
