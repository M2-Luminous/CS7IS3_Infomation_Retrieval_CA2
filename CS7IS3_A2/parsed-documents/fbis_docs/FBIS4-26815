On June 14, the president decreed urgent measures to fight organized crime, triggering the debates which are ongoing. According to official statistics, about 5,600 organized criminal groups, or mafia, exist in Russia, while the crime rate has doubled over the past five years. During the first five months of this year, a total of 1,094,000 crimes were reported, including 30,000 murders, 67,000 severe physical injuries, and more than 200,000 robberies and thefts. "Crime has already penetrated the centers of power and is taking them over, extending its control over property, the economy, the market and politics," warned Sergei Stepashin, director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service. The presidential decree gives law enforcement agencies sweeping powers to detain suspects for up to 30 days and examine the financial affairs of anyone suspected of engaging in organized crime. Under the decree, police and federal troops have the right to search offices and homes without a court order. However, the human rights group 'Memorial' criticized the policy for "sacrificing the principles of law and democracy." The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, called on Yeltsin Wednesday to halt his decree while accusing him of violating the constitution. On the same day, the lower chamber passed a resolution by a vote of 279 to 10 with five abstentions, charging Yeltsin with "restricting the constitutional rights and citizens' freedom without sufficient basis." But Yeltsin stood firm by his order, although he is well aware there may be some questions about human rights violations contained in the decree, according to his press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov. However, First Deputy Interior Minister Mikhail Yegorov, a supporter of the decree, made a gesture of compromise by announcing "we will not detain anyone without the sanction of the prosecutor's office." Defending the police's right to detain suspects for up to 30 days without charge, Yegorov stressed that it was very hard to pin charges on sophisticated gangsters within 48 hours as required by the law. This issue has also divided the upper chamber, which met Thursday but failed to work out formal stand on the issue. Some deputies criticized the presidential decree for ignoring civil rights, while others called on the upper house to support Yeltsin. As the debate continued, police attempted to carry out a massive raid against organized crime in Moscow earlier this week with little success, it turned out, when a radio report revealed the secret operation.
