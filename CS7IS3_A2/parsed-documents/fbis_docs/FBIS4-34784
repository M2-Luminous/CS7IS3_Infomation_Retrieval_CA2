This primer, which is the 17th the CNDH has issued since it was founded, is directed mainly at the Indians of Los Altos and the Lacandona Jungle of Chiapas. In the introduction, the CNDH states that on 28 January 1992, the DIARIO OFICIAL published the decree by which an initial paragraph was added to Article No. 4 of the Constitution "recognizing the Mexican Indian peoples and stating that their existence signifies the basis for the nation's multicultural composition." Further on, the primer emphasizes that according to Article No. 27 of the Constitution; Article No. 128, Section No. 4, of the Federal Code of Penal Procedures; Article No. 269, Section No. 4, and Article No. 296 of the Federal District Code of Penal Procedures; and Article No. 164 of the Agrarian Law, as well as the 1989 Agreement No. 169 of the International Labor Office on Indian and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, Indian peoples have the following rights, among others: 1. Indian peoples deserve special respect for their rights and dignity, as well as for their culture and tradition. 2. Indian communities have the right to protect their languages, cultures, traditions, customs, resources, and specific forms of social organization, circumstances that permit them to maintain and strengthen their identity, as long as they are not incompatible with basic rights as defined by the law or with internationally recognized human rights. 3. Indian peoples have full fundamental rights, freedoms, and privileges, which the law grants without any discrimination. 4. Indian communities have the right to the peace that permits them to safeguard their members' lives. 5. Indian peoples have the right to an economic, political, and social development that guarantees a decent life. 6. The state must guarantee Indians' effective access to justice. 7. In federal and local trials involving Indians, their legal customs and traditions will be taken into consideration during the proceedings and when a final decision is made.
