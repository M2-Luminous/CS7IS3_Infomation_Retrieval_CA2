The deputy foreign minister has studied the situation on the spot, and not just from UN reports. For this reason the journalistic fraternity, which is sincerely in sympathy with him, nicknamed him the "Yugoslav shuttle." So it was him that we asked to comment on the tragic events in Sarajevo and also to speak about the initiative recently advanced by Russia for settling the Yugoslav crisis. [Kalyadina] Vitaliy Ivanovich, I remember how at a news conference you answered a question about why Russia, which is making a big contribution to the process of a Yugoslav settlement, does not advance its own independent plan by saying: "We are modest people." What now: Have we overcome our timidity and decided to show ourselves? [Churkin] No. That was said at the time rather as a joke. During the war in the Balkans Russia has repeatedly advanced its own initiatives. Precisely at critical moments in the development of events, moreover. A real danger has now arisen that all the tremendous work which the international community has done in its attempt to resolve the conflict by political means might be wrecked. If a settlement is not achieved on the basis of the plan for creating unions [unii] of the republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the situation will exacerbate sharply and could entail deeper world community involvement in the conflict -- with an extremist approach, moreover. To avoid such a development of events we proposed carefully preparing and holding a session of the UN Security Council at foreign minister level in Geneva and inviting representatives of the three warring sides in Bosnia to it, together with delegations from the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] and Croatia. The idea in itself is simple. But any initiative can look good, in my view, when it fits in with what has already been achieved. This is the crux of our proposal: to continue a more intensive joint search for a political settlement by utilizing the authority of the United Nations. [Kalyadina] Two chief questions in a Yugoslav settlement fit in with the well-known "carrot and stick" policy. The possibility of bombing strikes acts as the stick. The carrot is the encouraging prospect of the lifting of sanctions from Yugoslavia. According to our new initiative, Russia will advocate their lifting in the very near future if an accord is reached. And yet I remember you saying quite recently that things will not get moving without compliance with sanctions. Is this a fundamental revision of our position? [Churkin] No, essentially our position has not changed. The fact that on this issue we have succeeded in getting some things moving is another matter. We have gotten an understanding with the European Union that, once a peace agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina is signed, the sanctions will be lifted as it is implemented. A different situation is also possible, whereby the Serbian side will fulfill all the demands made of it, while the others will be unwilling to undertake a political settlement. In that case it will be necessary to find an opportunity to lift the sanctions from Yugoslavia on carefully stipulated terms. We must, after all, be mindful of the fact that not only the FRY is suffering as a result of them -- all the Balkan countries are incurring losses running into billions. [Kalyadina] The United States also seems to be starting to think about this. THE NEW YORK TIMES recently carried an interesting item, namely CIA forecasts from which it follows that the economic embargo against Serbia has outlived its usefulness and will very soon be lifted. Assessments by such a powerful organization as the CIA and published, moreover, in such an influential newspaper represent a kind of trial balloon. How realistic, in your view, is a revision of the U.S. positions on the sanctions issue? [Churkin] It is obvious to me and to many other observers that the U.S. position is changing substantially. At first, after acceding to power, the Clinton administration believed that the events in Bosnia represented aggression by Serbia. But now the United States is increasingly realizing that a civil war is at the bottom of the conflict. It is interesting that, whereas a year ago the Americans did not accept our approaches at all, they now sometimes quote us when they speak of their understanding of what is happening. In general there is evolution. But I do not believe that it will quickly result in the question of lifting the sanctions being raised, since the U.S. internal political struggle over the "Yugoslav issue" is even more complex than in our country. Europeans frequently criticize the Americans for not taking an active enough part in the Yugoslav business. But I believe, and I try to prove this to them, that the conflict is taking place in Europe, where primarily European interests are concentrated, and the Americans simply do not want to get involved. [Kalyadina] The Belgrade newspaper POLITIKA, which reprinted the article from THE NEW YORK TIMES, arrives at this remarkable conclusion: If it revises its views on the Yugoslav crisis, Washington could gain prestige by once again acting in the role an omnipotent peacemaker, and the Europeans should reflect on this. But maybe we should too? Is it not time for Russia to take the "Balkan question" into its own hands? [Churkin] When a problem involves many countries it is essential to start by asking ourselves: Just what do we want? A real solution to the problem, or a propaganda effect? We have all emerged from the Cold War, when there was little policy and a lot of propaganda. The main thing was to make some kind of grand initiative. And it was not important that everyone then forgot about it immediately -- the important thing was to get in first. But if you require something real it is sometimes more useful if the initiative is taken by your partners. That is how, in my view, the Yugoslav crisis should be seen. We are berated around the world for allegedly being pro-Serb. And if, say, an initiative to lift sanctions was proposed by us, it would stand little chance of success. When the same thing is proposed by the EU, it is quite a different matter. What is important here is that the proposal embody our approaches. Look, after the failure of the Vance-Owen plan a new European version of the plan arose. However, we were the first in diplomatic contacts to talk about that plan's inevitable failure... I believe that quiet diplomacy is far more useful than noisy diplomacy. And in general it is good when policy is made by those in good physical and financial shape. Every initiative should have material support. It is one thing if we propose a settlement plan and have four divisions to implement it or several billions, say, to restore Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Kalyadina] The question of sanctions can be put as follows: By advocating the lifting of sanctions, will Russia not be helpinmg to strengthen the internal political position of the Belgrade authorities and President Milosevic? [Churkin] That does not worry me at all. We would get even more bogged down if in seeking a settlement we tried to harm particular authorities. Moreover, there is, as the recent elections showed, no alternative to Milosevic at the present time. This has to be taken into account, as does the fact that the president has recently been playing a very constructive role in the talks. [Kalyadina] How, in your opinion, will Milosevic's victory help to resolve the conflict? After all, in the runup to the elections he had to think not only about how to loosen the sanctions stranglehold but also how to avoid being suspected, as it were, of undue leniency toward the Muslims and Croats. [Churkin] There is a general postulate here: the stronger the authority, the easier it is to make compromises. But I would not want my words here to be interpreted as meaning that the Serbs have hidden scope for concessions. [Kalyadina] Vitaliy Ivanovich, there was recently a verbal duel between your chief, Andrey Kozyrev, and Mr. Zhirinovskiy. Vladimir Volfovich threatened the minister with dismissal if he did not very quickly alter the policy in the Balkans and side unconditionally with the Serbs. In this regard the respected newspaper IZVESTIYA made a dispiriting forecast of growing conflict between the Foreign Ministry and the Duma. How justified was this? [Churkin] I have quite the opposite feeling. In terms of foreign policy in general and the Yugoslav settlement in particular we will, it seems to me, enjoy considerably more constructive relations with the Duma than with the former Supreme Soviet. There will be fewer attempts to introduce domestic policy conflicts into foreign policy and more work will get done. I, for example, can subscribe almost in its entirety to the resolution on Yugoslavia passed by the Duma. I would make only one addition. I would add the word "promptly" to the phrase "Propose that the president raise officially the question of lifting sanctions in the Security Council." And then sign. Moreover, in my opinion, the Serbs have realized that nothing will come of trying to exploit our domestic political conflicts. [Kalyadina] So has it now become irrelevant to ask "Whom do you, our masters of diplomacy, side with -- Serbs or Croats?" That, after all, is the way it was put to us at the start of the conflict... [Churkin] I consider the main problem in this conflict to be the extremist approaches of all three sides, including the Serbs. And those who state that as Slavs side we should with the Serbs are unwittingly doing the Serbs a bad turn, as they are giving support to those of them who are urging their own people to commit suicide. The conflict in general is so complex that it is impossible to fathom without having been on the spot and gotten the feel of it all. [Kalyadina] You have been there, indeed many times. And, incidentally, changes in your views are noticeable. Whereas previously you reminded people more of a professor-cum-theoretician of diplomacy, now, forgive the comparison, you are more like a "city manager" of diplomacy. Have you revised your stance fundamentally? [Churkin] I would not say that I had a pro- or anti-Western stance on the Yugoslav question. But I have always thought that, if we confronted the United States and Europe, nothing would be achieved either in terms of a settlement or in our relations. We have achieved the main aim of pursuing our own line but without falling out with anyone. We have won respect, it seems to me, even among those who criticize us. [Kalyadina] Given such esteem, perhaps a Churkin plan will shortly replace the Vance, Owen, and Stoltenberg plans? [Churkin] No, and do not get the idea that I am the author of our entire policy in the Balkans; I merely maintain contacts. As far as plans are concerned, as you can see, for the time being nothing specific is coming from them. It is extremely difficult to divide up a multinational country, where everything was tightly interwoven until still quite recently. [Kalyadina] What, then, can we do? [Churkin] We can hope for improvement, including the success of our initiative [Kalyadina] Excuse me, but I do not somehow very much share your hopes. In my view, the actual UN mechanism through which Russia intends to implement its idea is considerably out of date. The previous commander of the UN forces in Bosnia, the Belgian General Bricquemont, submitted his resignation with the words: "I am not reading any more Security Council resolutions, because they do not help...." [Churkin] But no other mechanism has yet been devised. So we have to improve the existing ones. Moreover, it is not the case that everything is bad. The United Nations used to be an organization of ideological confrontation. Now times are different. As far as our initiative is concerned, we will be able to talk about success if we manage to preserve the current settlement plan. When the Vance-Owen plan failed and the "let's bomb" proposal was made we managed to get everyone back to the negotiating table. That situation is shaping up now. [Kalyadina] So to recall the classic formula: It is one step forward, two steps back... [Churkin] That's the way it goes. In many respects diplomacy is a Sisyphean labor.
