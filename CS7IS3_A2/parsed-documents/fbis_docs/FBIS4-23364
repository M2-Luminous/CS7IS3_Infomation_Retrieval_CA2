It was a dull afternoon here in Lusaka. Almost nothing took place this afternoon. The government negotiating team remained in its hotel waiting to hear from the representatives of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], who this morning asked for more time to reflect and find solutions considered most appropriate for the future of the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan]. Regarding this issue, the government remains firm: The country's laws governing radio stations must be applied. This being the case, the government negotiating team will only agree to move on to other issues after the conclusion of discussions on the future of Vorgan. Meanwhile, UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim is cited by the DAILY MAIL newspaper as having said that the more government victories in the military field, the more serious difficulties the peace talks will face. He said UNITA will fight to survive. In turn, the government's General Eugenio Carneiro is cited by the DAILY MAIL as having said that the government is ready to resume talks and that UNITA's participation in the government is a fait accompli. All the same, Gen. Carneiro said, the government does not agree that UNITA should impose specific conditions. He said the international community should continue to pressure UNITA to become more flexible. [end recording]
