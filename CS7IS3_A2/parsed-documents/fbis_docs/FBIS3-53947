[Buwayz] Thank you. [Al-Miliji] Minister, a summit was recently held between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Ilyas al-Hirawi. Would you tell us what went on in this summit? [Buwayz] The summit was part of the continued coordination between the Lebanese and Syrian leaders. The summit followed on the heels of the [al-Asad-Clinton] summit in Geneva and, therefore, focused on the outcome of that summit and on a possible new approach to dealing with the situation. We have discussed a number of issues brought up at the Clinton- al-Asad summit. We have also discussed the future of the negotiations that may take place in Washington early next month. [Al-Miliji] During their summit did Presidents al-Asad and Clinton discuss south Lebanon? [Buwayz] Of course, it seems that the issue of Israeli withdrawal from the Lebanese south was discussed in that meeting, for it is an integral part of the Arab-Israeli negotiations process. There is no doubt that finding the best mechanism for achieving an Israeli withdrawal was among the topics discussed by Clinton and al-Asad. It seems that the Americans understand the need for an Israeli withdrawal as part of the peace process. [Al-Miliji] Would this understanding lead to concrete measures? [Buwayz] Of course, this understanding needs a certain mechanism to go with it. So far, Israel has not declared its intention to withdraw. Once it does so, we believe that the mechanism for implementing this withdrawal will be ready for discussion. The proposal to form a joint military committee without a statement of the goal of this committee, that is without a commitment to the principle of withdrawal, does not seem very logical to Lebanon. We want to know beforehand what the goal of the committee is. If the goal is to monitor the situation or contain the current security crisis, there is the Armistice Committee and we do not need to set up a new committee. If the goal is to disengage the forces, there is a multinational force in south Lebanon and, therefore, we do not need a new committee. The only good reason for having such a committee is to discuss a timetable for Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon. [Al-Miliji] The Lebanese received an invitation to participate in the coming round of Arab-Israeli talks. Has Lebanon received certain guarantees? Are there certain principles that will serve as the basis for the talks? [Buwayz] There are no guarantees in the strict sense of the word. The Lebanese head of the negotiating team will go to Washington along with a number of the delegation members to hold talks with the U.S. side on the mechanism issue, or on the approach that will be adopted in this round of talks. Some general matters or tendencies have already been formed. [Al-Miliji] What are these general matters or tendencies? [Buwayz] For example, there is a real desire to hold serious talks to achieve peace. [Al-Miliji] A desire on whose part? [Buwayz] I think on the part of all sides. [Al-Miliji] Including Israel? [Buwayz] Well, this will be a test for the Israeli position and approach. [Al-Miliji] This leads us to another question. What are the most important points of disagreement between the Lebanese and Israelis, in light of the past 12 rounds of talks? [Buwayz] The main issue is withdrawal. So far, Israel has not given us a clear statement on its commitment to a withdrawal to the internationally recognized borders. What we keep hearing is rhetoric that Israel has no ambitions [on Lebanese soil]. Such rhetoric, however, falls short of a clear commitment to withdrawal. We want this commitment to be spelled out with a clear decision that would open the door to an agreement on the details. [Al-Miliji] How about the issue of water? [Buwayz] Concerning the issue of water, there is no room for negotiations. Lebanese water is non-negotiable. [Al-Miliji] Concerning the South Lebanese Army, have the Lebanese and Israeli sides discussed any arrangements concerning the future of this army? [Buwayz] No, we have not arrived at that point yet. I think that it is too early to look into this matter. Until a commitment is reached concerning the principle of withdrawal, it would be premature to discuss such details. [Al-Miliji] President Clinton has met President al-Asad and will meet King Husayn. What effect will these negotiations have on the Lebanese track of the peace talks? [Buwayz] We believe, and I have said this before, that peace should be comprehensive. Any progress on any track, if it furthers understanding, is a positive matter. [Al-Miliji] My last question is: Are there any specific ideas that Lebanon is presenting ahead of the coming round of talks? [Buwayz] Lebanon calls for the return of its land. Lebanon is not obliged to present more ideas. Lebanon, I reiterate, awaits a clear commitment concerning the principle of withdrawal. Once such a commitment is made, everything can be resolved. [Al-Miliji] Thank you, minister. [Buwayz] You are welcome.
