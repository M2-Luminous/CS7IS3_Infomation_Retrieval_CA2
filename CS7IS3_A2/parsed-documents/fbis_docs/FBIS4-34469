FBIS4-34469 "drlat119_a_94010" FBIS-LAT-94-119 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 Colombia Prosecutor, Attorney Generals on Legal Issues Prosecutor, Attorney Generals on Legal Issues PA2006012194 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 16 Jun 94 pp 1, 16A PA2006012194 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO Spanish BFN [Text] Yesterday, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff requested Congress study the possibilities of establishing external controls on the immense power held by the institution he heads. He also asked the legislature to explore mechanisms to establish other types of precautionary measures, other than imprisonment, to ensure that those under investigation appear before prosecutors and judges. The prosecutor general's requests were made yesterday during a seminar for criminal prosecutors organized by the Attorney General's Office. De Greiff, Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta, Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez, and Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Sintura attended the seminar. Regarding the first request, the prosecutor general said legislators had not established controls on "the great amount of power given to prosecutors and that it is necessary to establish controls for the future." De Greiff said there is a 2d Court of Appeals at the Prosecutor General's Office, but this in itself is a contradiction because those who file suit in the 1st and 2d Courts of Appeals are delegates of the prosecutor general and belong to a body that has a unified administration, hierarchy, and follows general administrative procedures and criminal guidelines established by the prosecutor general of the Republic. "We respect this 2d Court of Appeals, because we do not attempt to have absolute power but, rather, one sole criminal policy, not many policies as in the past," the prosecutor general said. Regarding precautionary measures, he said "arrest warrants must be issued as an exception and when we do not have a guarantee the person under investigation will present himself to the authorities. It is more appropriate to promote legislative reforms that will allow us other types of precautionary measures, such as bail," de Greiff said. He admitted there are prosecutors who are quick to issue precautionary measures and involve people in cases. "Certain prosecutors are frequently quick to issue precautionary measures, and we have noticed people are precipitately involved many times in cases under investigation, as can be seen at inquiries when the prosecutor does not have all the necessary facts to ask questions," de Greiff added. The prosecutor general also said the institutions can no longer allow validation of the assertion: "Nobody is refused an arrest warrant in Colombia." "This sentence is shocking and has been in effect since the time when there were criminal investigation judges." The prosecutor general stated his position regarding a possible increase of jail sentences for several crimes and said increasing the penalties to the maximum is not the solution. The important thing is, he said, to have a penitentiary system that guarantees the rehabilitation of the criminal. "We gain nothing by putting all the hoods in jail if we do not have a penitentiary system that will give them a chance to rehabilitate," de Greiff said. Arrest Warrants "Several people say the best system is the one in the United States, where drug traffickers are given long sentences or life. Let me tell you this is not true. Those penalties are imposed on Colombian drug traffickers, not U.S. drug traffickers. I do not know of a single case where a U.S. drug trafficker has been sentenced to life." For his part, Arrieta said the Attorney General's Office should be committed to completing its investigations, that its role should expand and include the assurance that due process is complied with to safeguard respect for human rights, and that the law is interpreted and implemented correctly. "The main goal is to advance from formulating measures to restricting personal freedom to the point where such measures are only used when necessary to guarantee the appearance of those accused at court," the attorney general said. According to Arrieta, personnel of the Attorney General's Office must be vigilant in stopping certain prosecutors' abuses of issuing preventive arrest warrants. "We must adapt Colombian criminal law to international laws that recommend freedom as a basic principle during the investigative phase and thus leave jails for those who are serving imposed sentences." For his part, the justice minister said the current Criminal Procedures Code had improved the trial system because, according to him, it was an important instrument in inhibiting impunity, clearing the backlog in legal offices, and avoiding expiration of investigations. No contacts with the Cali Cartel Yesterday, De Greiff and Arrieta said they have had no contacts with lawyers of important Cali Cartel members for several months. According to de Greiff, the Prosecutor General's Office is waiting for the Valle drug traffickers to understand that the best alternative is to surrender to justice and that his office is willing to further this process. Arrieta said "the Cali Cartel lawyers are most surely waiting for the change in government to reinitiate their advances." The prosecutor general and the attorney general commented on other current national events: The Hidden Microphones in Samper's Campaign: The prosecutor general said it is being investigated, "but it will be difficult to find the culprits in this crime due to a lack of evidence. We will investigate as much as possible." Retirement Age: The prosecutor said he is waiting for the Supreme Court to define if he is an official with an established term or if he must retire when he is 65 years of age. Church and Politics: The attorney general said the call made by several bishops for their parishioners to vote for one of the candidates is unjustified. "I believe Monsignor Castrillon's call was a personal one and did not include the church as a whole. Church interference in politics is something we have already surpassed. It does not have any justification at this time." Disaster Attention Office: The attorney general said the Attorney General's Office will investigate as soon as the emergency subsides whether the officials in that government office had been negligent. "What is important now is attending to the victims. We will start to investigate once this phase is over. It would be senseless to do so now."
