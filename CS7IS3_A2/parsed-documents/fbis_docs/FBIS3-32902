[Recio] The subject we are to discuss today is very important, and people are talking about it on the streets. It is a topic on the streets because it refers to crucial problems, problems that people are experiencing on a day-to-day basis. These problems are also reflected in the workers' parliaments. And, of course, there are people on the street who ask whether these meetings are useful, important, or necessary. Some people would answer, no. Many feel that the parliaments are too formal, that they will not solve current problems, that this is a matter to be dealt with by economists. There are people who think that economic problems are technical, scientific problems, and listening to the people's opinions has no practical value. Of course, I do not agree with those ideas. [Garcia] What do you think, Eloy Concepcion? [Concepcion] I think these meetings are extremely useful. I think these meetings are unique; they are not held anywhere else in the world. And I say this is unique because the workers' parliaments represent an opportunity for the workers to express their opinions on important issues in the country, but mainly because they are an opportunity to put the house in order. I think the parliaments at the work places must have as the first point on their agenda -- I remember attending one parliament and it did have this on the agenda -- the analysis of problems specific to that area, such as productivity, use of work time, theft of products, use of resources, etc. Workers must meet to discuss their local problems, that is, to become aware of existing problems and of those they can solve without waiting for national measures. I think this is sufficient reason to hold the parliaments. [Garcia] What conditions are necessary for the development of these parliaments, to be what people really want them to be? [Recio] The first desire is to discuss internal problems, and this perhaps is the most important aspect of the meetings. The other aspect is that the assessment of problems of the economy by the workers in general is extremely important. Not only to fulfill a formal obligation, and not to comply with a compulsory practice, a theoretical practice by inexpert people dealing wilth a complex matter, but because they must be protagonists of any change. The problems of a country such as Cuba, within a society of workers, will not be solved by three, four, five, or six formulas, or even by 10 technical formulas. That is to say, the Cuban problem will not be solved by economists alone, although they should be solved by economists. We cannot underestimate the role of economic science, nor can we can overestimate it to a point of taking it as the only view. The problem consists of achieving a balance between the economy and politics, because our system will never be an exclusively efficient system. Efficiency must be combined with justice -- efficiency with equity -- and to achieve justice, the workers must be present, not only for the distribution of wealth but also for an exchange of ideas. [Concepcion] I agree with Recio on the first point: The parliaments are to discuss internal problems. I recently attended a parliament on Plan Six, referring to citrus fruits. I thought then that these meetings should be better organized and structured, because the administration's report is important. That is, these parliaments constitute essential economic training schools for workers. I would call them that. I think that the administrative report must be structured in such a manner that all the workers have in their hands the elements they have never before had. In this parliament I attended, the workers learned that last year there was a loss of 200 [words indistinct]. Well then, the analysis should focus on the loss. An important element broght to the workers' attention was that in 1993 some 10,000 quintales of oranges, tangerines, and lemons were stolen and taken to the black market. The workers, themselves, said: In Havana, or in this or that town, tangerines were lost because they were stolen. The other important issue is that not only the administration is to blame for this. I think there are three main factors that must be analyzed. With a certain degree of complacence, I noted that there are three factors: the administration, the union, and the workers. We often talk about the lack of organization at work, or about inefficiency, or misuse of labor hours, or even theft. The workers, the union organizations, and the administration officials are aware of what is going on; but they often just acknowledge and try to coexist with indiscipline. [Garcia] Concepcion, you mentioned an experience you had when you attended a parliament. I believe Recio also attended some parliaments; he might also like to tell us his experience or some anecdotes. [Recio] I also agree with Concepcion when he says that this is a good economic training school for workers. I fully agree with that and I would add, not only for workers but for the workers' leaders, for economic and political leaders, and for everyone. As you said, there are three factors: the administration, the union, and the workers. They often see negative things but they do not change the course of events, perhaps because of a total lack of action or because of ignorance, because people cannot see the significance of all this, because the economic process is very complex. We decided on a given economy for reasons I cannot outline now because it would take too long. This economy is based on material production, but it does not take into account the financial aspect, that is, that which has to do with costs, prices, profit possibilities, the budget, money circulation, etc. We have been practically negative in this aspect. We have practically overlooked it. We have failed to train the people. Then what happens? The first to take economic classes, in addition to workers, are the administrative board members because it is important for them to take these classes. The administration must have an objective, and that objective must be not only to produce, but to produce at the lowest possible cost. That is basic. But it is not done. For instance, when products are stolen, it affects the cost and production. If expenditures are not well accounted for, how can you find out the costs? [Garcia] We are looking for points of agreement on the need for these parliamants, but we also wonder what the parliaments offer in the end. [Concepcion] I think the parliaments must first adopt a plan of concrete and not general measures. I attended a parliament where I repeatedly heard worn out, obsolete words like eliminating this or that, organizing work, reducing subsidy, increasing production, promoting this or that, etc. These words in practice do not say anything. I think the plan of measures must be concrete, realistic, and with names. That is, productivity must be increased and to increase production we must do this and that, and Mr. So-and-so will do this and this, and John Doe will do this and that, because when the clock strikes five in the afternoon the workers leave, no matter what. In this case, the brigade that has not yet completed its task must remain until it finishes. These are concrete measures that must be adopted because, otherwise, the parliament will remain with its generalizations and theories, without achieving anything concrete. I do not know whether Recio agrees with me, but the country's economy will be saved to the extent that we save it in each worker's center. [Garcia] Motivation is good. I think these meetings can motivate workers, create an environment favorable to increase production, to solve the problems at the grassroots, so that the companies, as Recio said, will be more profitable, so that costs will be reflected in prices, and so that workers may also be aware of what their centers can contribute to the development of the nation. [Recio] I want to insist on this point: Not only the workers must be motivated, but the workers' leaders, as well. We must talk straight here. There are leaders who do not care about these problems, who do not lead anyone, and who do not discuss anything. And the workers must also demand that their leaders become more demanding. Because if the Cuban economy fails, who will suffer the consequences? [Garcia, Recio] The people, the workers. [Recio] And if something must be done and is not done, who will suffer the consequences? The people, the workers. And we workers are the owners here. This society was created for us, and we must show this ownership. [Garcia] A brief summary, please, Concepcion, because our time has ended. [Concepcion] In sum, we can say that following these problems of leaders and workers, we all belong to the same human group. We are workers, although we play different roles. The essence is that workers who are directly working the land or driving their machines must discuss their roles as workers, and the leaders must guide them well, using rational and logical economic measures. This is the objective and the goal of the parliaments.
