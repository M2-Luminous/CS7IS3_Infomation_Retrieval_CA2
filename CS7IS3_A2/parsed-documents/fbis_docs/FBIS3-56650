As expected, he is First Vice Premier Vladimir Shumeyko. True, the intended plan somewhat "misfired": Vladimir Shumeyko was one vote short in the first ballot, and a whole five votes short in the second (the minimum necessary being 86 votes). In the second round he was only two votes ahead of his main rival Petr Romanov. According to observers, this stance by some Federation Council members who refused to support Vladimir Shumeyko was largely due to the fact that he is viewed by many, if not exactly as "the president's man," at least as a representative of the president's team who is called upon to fulfill the will of the head of state, imposing it on parliament. Nevertheless, in the course of last night the attitude of some Federation Council members changed sufficiently to allow the first vice premier to muster even more votes than necessary -- 98. From the very beginning the newly elected chairman drew an implied distinction between the Federation Council and the State Duma, hinting that the upper chamber should positively differ from the lower when it comes to constructive approach and the absence of political confrontation. In particular he highlighted the fact that he would not permit any "lobby intrigues" or split in the upper chamber. For this purpose Vladimir Shumeyko asked for a time-out until the following morning in order to carry out consultations before the election of deputy speakers. In his words, preliminary discussion of the candidates is needed so that the vote should not lead to a split in the chamber and political polarization. He refused to tell journalists the names of possible candidates for the posts of his deputies, but obliquely intimated that one of them should be a representative of the Communists or their sympathizers. Of special interest is the concept of possible relations with the State Duma as voiced by the chairman of the upper chamber. All the signs suggest that the president's team has already "rehearsed" the scenario of actions in the event of nonconstructive forces ultimately gaining the upper hand in the Duma. At any rate Vladimir Shumeyko stated literally the following: Under the Constitution, the Federation Council as an organ and its individual members possess legislative initiative. The same goes for members of the State Duma. And "in an extreme case," he went on, it will be possible "in cooperation with Duma deputies, who really desire to do something, to elaborate legislative acts in joint committees and commissions and adopt them straightaway right here."
