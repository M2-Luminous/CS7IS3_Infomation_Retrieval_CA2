The down-to-earth majority will merely find confirmation that a handful of people in London, as in Hong Kong, remain mired in Tiananmen, long after the world and events have moved on. Or are they using Tiananmen to inflate their own egos and one of several justifications for unstinting support of Governor Chris Patten's brand of political reforms for Hong Kong. They also seem to be doing it in a most provocative fashion: urging self-determination for Tibet, strengthening diplomatic ties with Taiwan, calling for amendment to the Basic Law, as well as the internationalisation of Hong Kong. It is unlikely that China will be provoked. Having decided to go its own way with the British abandonment of "convergence" and the "through train", Beijing will be inclined to ignore this toothless tiger and carry out its own plans for Hong Kong in 1997. The non-reaction cannot be unexpected to members of the FAC. Nor indeed, the British government. Sir Percy Cradock told them as much. To quote the sinologist and architect on the British side of the Joint Declaration: "We have no legal obligation to put forward the Patten reforms... we have a moral and a political responsibility to push democracy as far as we can in Hong Kong in special circumstances. "But that certainly does not cover pushing democracy to the point where the Chinese carry out a vicious backlash and undo much of what you have done before... It is of little benefit and of great damage to set up disputed arrangements which are merely going to be torn down in 1997 when the Chinese take over." As sure as the sun rises that will now come to pass. And Beijing will do it without further discussion. China's ambassador Mr Ma Yuzhen put it even more succinctly to the FAC: "You may be aware of a prevalent view expressed by some senior British officials that they do not believe China will re- establish Hong Kong's three-tier councils for fear of international pressure. "May I say they are grossly mistaken if they really think so. In the absence of an agreement between China and Britain, China will definitely disband and re-establish Hong Kong's three-tier councils on 1 July 1997. "As a matter of course, China will re-establish Hong Kong's three-tier councils in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law. To say otherwise... is irresponsible and misleading to the British public and the people of Hong Kong." Sir Percy thinks Hong Kong people will pay a price for this. The down-to-earth will find little solace in agreeing with him.
