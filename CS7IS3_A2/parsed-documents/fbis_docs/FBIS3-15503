Sensors will be located at the Kursk and either Novovoronezh or Leningrad nuclear power plants. The final choice of the plant will be done at a meeting of Russian and German environmental ministers on March 9-10 in Leipzig. The monitoring system is expected to be used at all nuclear power plants of Russia's European part by 1995 under an agreement reached at a meeting of Russian experts that closed here today. It provides for location of sensors measuring the radiation level on the area around radiation-danger facilities (30 kilometers for nuclear power plants). The sensor information will be passed over to Moscow's Federal Center of Radiology Control via satellite. The first stage of the system has been completed at the Smolensk nuclear power plant. Its information has been available since December 1993. The Russian-German cooperation is done within the framework of an agreement on collection, transfer, analysis and estimation of radiology information. The document provides for German equipment of the federal center, supplies of standard software and development of applied software. The Russian side is in charge of basic assets, location of sensors and satellite communications. The agreement also includes bilateral exchange of information once a day under regular conditions and every ten minutes in case of the radiation level increase.
