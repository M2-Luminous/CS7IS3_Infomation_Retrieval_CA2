Japanese Dietmen on May 19 investigated the suppression of Chongnyon by the Japanese police in Osaka. They met with officials of Chongnyon and Japanese lawyers and acquainted themselves with the background and truth of the police crackdown. They concluded that the wholesale police search was motivated by a political intention to pry into the inside of the Chongnyon organisation and incite anti-Chongnyon sentiments. They visited the Osaka prefectural police headquarters and called the police chief to account for the suppression of Chongnyon. The Indian committee for supporting Korea's reunification, the all India Indo-Korean Friendship Association, the Indian Federation for World Cooperation and Cultural Relations, the Friendship Association of India and the Indian Diplomatic Club issued a joint statement May 14 denouncing the Japanese reactionaries' anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign. The statement denounced the Japanese authorities' suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan as an intolerable challenge to the DPRK and the Korean people and urged them to immediately stop the unjustifiable and rude acts and apologize to the DPRK.
