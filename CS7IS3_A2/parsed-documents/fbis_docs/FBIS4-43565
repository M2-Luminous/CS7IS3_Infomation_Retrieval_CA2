[passage omitted] Alain Juppe was interviewed in the Ivorian capital by Jean-Karim Fall: [Begin recording] [Juppe] We have said very clearly that our intervention should be given the green light by the United Nations. We are examining the type of UN resolution that could give a mandate to member states to intervene to save the population, which is the prime concern. Several European countries that we have contacted have told us, some publicly, that they approve of the principle of the operation. I spoke to my Italian, Spanish and British colleagues, and other contacts have been made in Paris. Several African countries have also expressed their support in principle. We are now examining the concrete modalities of the operation, the duration of which should be limited; it should have precise objectives and should be exclusively humanitarian. The aim is to save people who might be killed within the next few days. The operation should be carried out by several countries. To avoid any ambiguity, France does not wish to go it alone. [Fall] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is opposed to any French presence in Rwanda. Could this mollify your determination to intervene? [Juppe] No. This does change our determination, but we would like to convince the RPF of our intentions. I understand that some extremists want to solve the problem through a complete military victory. This will solve nothing. One day a reconciliation process to share power will have to be reached, enabling Hutus and Tutsis to live together in Rwanda. France tried to obtain this kind of settlement, most notably through the Arusha Agreement. We will continue our contacts with RPF officials. I would like to stress that we obtained their agreement to let a humanitarian convoy through to Kigali; 30 tonnes are on the way. I believe that it is possible to explain better what we are doing. [Fall] You told the daily LIBERATION that you are in favor of judging those responsible for this genocide. Are you in favor of an international tribunal? [Juppe] Yes. Such a tribunal will probably have to be set up. It is out of the question to reinstate extremists with so much blood on their hands when we sit around a table in an attempt to find a peace agreement. They will have to be identified and punished. [Fall] Many observers consider that Hutu extremists started this genocide. Do you share this view? [Juppe] It is indisputable that the day after president Habyarimana -- who was able to maintain a balance for years, who agreed to the Arusha process -- died, extremists from his camp, militias, initiated massacres which I myself called genocide, in the proper sense of the word, namely: To exterminate a population on the ground of its ethnic characteristics. There is not any doubt about this. Massacres by the other side took place when the RPF troops advanced: This is also obvious. [Fall] You also said in LIBERATION that French policy in Rwanda had not always be faultless. On which precise point do you believe that France made mistakes? [Juppe] Who can pretend to be infallible? Rather than stress mistakes I would rather stress what we have attempted to do in Rwanda. I will gladly mention it, since this process was partly initiated before April 1993. As I said earlier, our aim was reconciliation and power-sharing. [passage omitted] I cannot accept the accusation of bias or of France's support for one side against the other. This is not what happened. I repeat that what we tried to do was to help the population -- who will have to cohabitate one day or another -- live together. [end recording]
