FBIS3-12795 "drnes043dd_94009" FBIS-NES-94-043 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Mar 1994 Palestinian Affairs Quray' Says `No Alternative to Negotiations' JN0303170694 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 1610 GMT 3 Mar 94 JN0303170694 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Telephone interview with Ahmad Quray', chief of the PLO Economic Department, in Tunis, by Sa'id Mu'addi, in the studio, from the "With the Events" program; date not given -- recorded] [Text] [Mu'addi] Apparently, there is no alternative to resuming the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. What is the solution for the resumption of these negotiations? [Quray'] First of all, we believe there is no alternative to negotiations in order to implement the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington. However, the negotiations cannot be resumed without providing an appropriate climate and the necessary conditions to resume them. Therefore, confidence, which has been undermined, must be restored and there should be an appropriate climate. The Israeli Government should work seriously to provide this climate because matters are in its hands, and not in the hands of others at all. The Israeli Government should first ensure that settlers will not move about carrying weapons outside their homes, if it is unable to immediately disarm them. The second point is that there should be a serious discussion about dismantling a certain group of settlements, since those settlements constitute a real threat to the peace process. The third point is that the Palestinian people are worried about their security. After the Declaration of Principles has been signed and while we are discussing with the Israelis the security issues that concern them, it is now time to have a serious discussion about the security of the Palestinians. The real threat is the one against Palestinian security. Therefore, the Palestinians should rest assured that there is protection for them. Why not have an international presence? Why not? [Mu'addi] Do these conditions represent the minimum demands in order to resume the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations? [Quray'] First of all, I did not set conditions. I spoke about providing an appropriate climate conducive to the success of the negotiations. This massacre has created a psychological shock. Therefore, an appropriate climate should be created. This is not in our hands. It is in the hands of the Israeli Government. The ball now is in the Israeli Government's court. If it wants this process to succeed and this agreement to be implemented, then it should promptly take these measures. Another question, which I believe should be taken into consideration if the Israelis are serious, is that a committee should be formed now to hold negotiations on the question of settlements. I know the discussion of settlement activity was postponed until the final status negotiations, but this massacre has proven that settlements should be discussed now. I am not setting this as a condition related to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, but I am pointing out this issue so that it can be discussed as of now. By the time the final negotiations are held, this process will have made major steps and some measures probably will have been taken. [Mu'addi] Don't you think that these proposals or conditions mean the reopening of the Oslo accord? [Quray'] The Oslo accord is open in the first place, and it is being negotiated. What is proposed here is not amending it, but giving it dynamism and vitality. As is the case with any agreement, the stages of its negotiation and implementation create dynamism and vitality to make it succeed should there be any obstacles. So we are only opening the negotiations about settlement activity. Why not do this? This does not mean that the Oslo agreement has been rejected or that its file has been reopened, as has been said. Israel is attempting to go forward without resolving the problems obstructing implementation. This should not happen. [Mu'addi] It was announced in Tunis today that a Palestinian committee of inquiry was formed to investigate the criminal incident in Hebron. What will this committee do and is it possible for it to cooperate with the Israeli counterpart committee? [Quray'] It is simply a fact-finding committee to compile a complete file about this ugly, horrendous, unprecedented massacre. Regarding the possibility of cooperation, well, this committee is going to find all the facts and everything that is necessary to have all the information. [Mu'addi] Mr. Ahmad Quray'. Thank you very much. [Quray'] You are welcome.
