Sakalas and V. Andriukaitis acquainted the journalists with documents related to the procedure of no confidence in the government that this faction is initiating. The journalists were also informed that 13 Seimas members had already signed the text of the declaration of no confidence in the government, and that seven additional members intended to sign in the near future. (The signatures of 29 members of Seimas are required for the Seimas to take up deliberation of the issue of no confidence in the government.) Seimas deputy chairman A. Sakalas set forth the main principles on the basis of which the Social Democrats were expressing their lack of confidence in the LDDP government. According to him, the current government did not implement its strategic pledges and did not present a vision of the future of Lithuania. "We do not know what kind of industrial structure is foreseen for Lithuania, or what Lithuanian agriculture will be like and whether the effort will be exerted to make it effective. We also do not know what kind of banking structure we will have," A. Sakalas noted. In his opinion, the government has heretofore said nothing about the development of the services system, or about solving transit problems, including military transit. There was also nothing being said about the creation of free economic zones, the development of infrastructure, or the problems of employment and unemployment. Also, according to the head of the Social Democratic party, the government was operating without adhering to the program that it had adopted. He asserted that in the wake of the actions of the current government, Lithuania has "eaten" its way to a $174 million debt, and that this debt will have to be repaid from the pockets of the taxpayers or by using new loans. "The economic crisis continues to deepen, and industrial and agricultural production is decreasing", A. Sakalas continued, noting that no one foresees when this crisis might end. He also characterized as fictitious the increase in residents' income proclaimed by the government, since about 70 percent of this increase was achieved by using foreign credits, and the remainder came from "eating up" the savings of residents and enterprises, as well as from the "economy" to compensate for unpaid taxes. A. Sakalas is of the opinion that responsibility for the situation in the country also falls on opposition parties and that this responsibility takes various forms. These include the proposal by the conservatives to initiate early elections, something which A. Sakalas considers unrealistic at this time; or the suggestion to "pick off one minister at a time", which Sakalas says is being proposed by certain LDDP representatives; or simply operating on the basis of the principle "It's none of my concern" and observing the situation passively. According to A. Sakalas, the Christian Democrats have chosen this last route, asserting that "We did not appoint this government, and so it isn't for us to dismiss it either." The Social Democratic leader appraised that kind of position by the Christian Democratic party as "political impotence or hypocrisy in not wanting to see the poverty of the Lithuanian people." When asked who might replace the government led by A. Slezevicius, V. Andriukaitis said that considering the extent of the crisis, "it is doubtful whether a single political force could or can lead Lithuania out of that crisis." He believes that no one political force currently has such a level of popular support that its proposed reforms would be accepted. V. Andriukaitis noted that "the problem of coalitions is becoming the urgent concern for all political parties at this time." In his opinion, political forces could make a pact of concord for two years, regulate the decision-making process in the Seimas, form a new government, and confirm its new program.
