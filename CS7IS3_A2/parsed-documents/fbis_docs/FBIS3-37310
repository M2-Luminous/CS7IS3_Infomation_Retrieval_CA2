Today it is the turn of the Azeri side. The state adviser for foreign political affairs of Azerbaijan VAFA GULUZADE talks to the Interfax correspondent in Baku. IF: The Russian special envoy Vladimir Kazimirov stayed for several days in Azerbaijan. He attempted to achieve progress in the process aimed at the political settlement of the Armenian-Azeri conflict within the framework of the Russian mediation. What does Baku think about the visit? GULUZADE: As is known, late in November Vladimir Kazimirov was in Baku. He discussed with the Azeri side a Russian plan and took into account all our remarks. Then the head of the Russian mediatory mission was to leave for Yerevan to discuss the plan with the Armenian side. Then his car was fired at from Armenian positions. It was a serious incident which was not settled immediately because the Armenian side refused to apologize. I believe the current visit by Kazimirov to Yerevan and Baku is the continuation of the November mission. Russia is the mediator in the conflict and acts accordingly. However, the time that has passed since November was missed since there were fierce battles at the fronts. There were many casualties and there are even now. I put the responsibility for all these developments on the Armenian side. Azerbaijan is attempting to solve the problem peacefully, through political talks. IF: Namely? GULUZADE: This means that Armenia must withdraw its troops from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan. (Yerevan claims that involved in the hostilities are the Nagorno Karabakh self-defense forces, not Armenian troops--"IF"). This may cause the beginning of the talks on the essence of the Armenian-Azeri conflict. However, the Armenian side want to stay on the occupied territories to settle there and build fortifications. The world public does not know about this in full measure. At the same time, Yerevan deludes the world public opinion claiming that Armenia stands for a peaceful settlement of the conflict and fully shares the schedule of the settlement developed by the CSCE Minsk Group under which Yerevan put its signature. It took part in the recent meetings of the Minsk Group in Vienna, and I say with full responsibility that the Armenian side disagrees with the schedule. The signing of the schedule was a diplomatic maneuvering. Armenia has added a letter to the signature in which it puts some conditions. For example, the Armenian side conditions the compliance with the schedule with the guarantee of the Nagorno-Karabakh safety in a way seen by Yerevan. On the other hand, Armenians say that they understand the notion "side" as the recognition of the Nagorno-Karabakh status. Could it be said that the Armenian delegation signed the Vienna schedule? I believe now the peaceful settlement of the conflict fully depends on the will of the Armenian side. There is a resolution of the UN Security Council and there are universally acknowledged norms which say that any talks may be conducted only after the occupied territories are liberated. In conditions of the occupation of one-fifth of the Azeri territory, it is out of the question to speak about any peaceful talks, I believe. It is possible to hold a Minsk conference and speak about the status of Nagorno-Karabakh only after the withdrawal of the Armenian troops. IF: What does the Russian peace plan specify? GULUZADE: The Russian plan mainly coincides with the CSCE schedule. It has similar demands and a similar schedule for the withdrawal of Armenian troops from the occupied territories. It is premature to speak about it once it is not yet coordinated. (As is known, later the Azeri side turned down Moscow's proposal on cease-fire since February 1 for at least 2-3 weeks and put a condition of the withdrawal of the Armenian troops from Azerbaijan -- "IF"). IF: Does the Russian peace plan provide for the deployment of a Russian peacekeeping contingent in the zone of conflict? GULUZADE: There is much speculation around the problem of the deployment of a Russian or a CSCE peacekeeping force. I believe these forces can be deployed.. First, they must be deployed along the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia because the aggression against Azerbaijan comes from the Armenian territory. Second, such forces could be deployed between the warring sides after Armenia withdraws its occupation troops from the captured Azeri territories. The question about the peacekeeping force was also discussed in Rome last year, at the meeting of the CSCE foreign ministers. According to the decision taken there, the peacekeeping force may be deployed on the territory of this or that state only on the country's request, which is the manifestation of respect for its Constitution and territorial integrity. Naturally, if we wish, we shall apply to Russia. IF: The official Baku demands the withdrawal of the Armenian troops from Azerbaijan. Does it mean that they must be pulled out from Nagorno-Karabakh, as well? GULUZADE: Logically, from the point of view of justice, all Armenian armed forces must be withdrawn fro the territory of Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh is also part of Azerbaijan. According to foreign sources, 8,000 Armenian nationals fight on the side of the so-called Karabakh forces against Azerbaijan. I believe it is a matter of complete cease-fire and full withdrawal of Armenian troops from Azerbaijan. IF: What could be Baku's attitude to the deployment of the Russian forces along the border between Azerbaijan and Iran as CIS external borders? GULUZADE: I believe it is a matter of the future. For us the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia is the most acute problem. This was mentioned by President Geydar Aliyev during the visit by the commander of the Russian Border Guard troops, General Andrey Nikolayev, to Baku. As to our borders with Iran... well, Azerbaijan is a sovereign state. It will guard its borders itself. At the same time Azerbaijan is a CIS member-state. Baku may negotiate to what degree CIS can help ensure common interests. IF: Which is the likelihood of a Moscow meeting between presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan which is a common talk over the past time? GULUZADE: I believe a relevant political basis should be developed for such a meeting. If Russia acts as a mediator, it should take into account all factors for the conflict to be settled. If so, details could be discussed under Russia's auspices. But, by that period, the essence of the problem should be coordinated; that is, I repeat, the withdrawal of the Armenian troops from Azeri territories. Azerbaijan poses no obstacles for a peaceful settlement. This is confirmed by many statements made by President Geydar Aliyev. For the peaceful process to start it is necessary that Armenia show a desire to such a settlement and make a statement that it will withdraw all its troops from Azerbaijan. This could be achieved given the goodwill of the Armenian side, and, I would say, the due decisiveness of Russia. I want to emphasize that Russia has levers of pressure on Armenia. The Russian Army is deployed on its territory. It is common knowledge that Yerevan uses the fact for acquiring armaments, ammunition and even uses Russian servicemen in the above conflict. IF: What is known about the date of the meeting? GULUZADE: I do not know anything about the date of the meeting. I believe the talks should be an aim in itself. The meeting could take place if the mediator will be able to prepare the necessary basis for it. Azerbaijan has enough of goodwill and constructive approach.
