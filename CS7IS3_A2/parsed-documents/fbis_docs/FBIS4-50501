At 0900, when Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, and Zhang Baifa, executive deputy mayor of Beijing, entered the center, all those present gave warm applause to them who both served as leaders of shock brigades well-known throughout the country in the 1950s. [passage omitted] Youth shock brigades came into being in the 1950s as national economic construction was on the upsurge. In the new situation brought about by reform and opening-up, the banner of the shock brigade has become ever more resplendent, under which a large number of young pioneering workers have emerged. [passage omitted] On behalf of the younger generation, Li Keqiang, first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, asked the older generation to rest assured that the younger generation would carry forward the fine tradition of the older generation and that the banner of the shock brigade would fly high into the next century. Forty years elapsed in the twinkling of an eye. Recalling the past and comparing it with the present, Li Ruihuan was excited. He said: "Tremendous changes have taken place in our country over the past 40 years. During these years, youth shock brigades in the capital have made outstanding contributions to the construction of the city, winning honor for building workers, for Beijing residents, and for the Chinese people. Youth shock brigades have scored marked achievements, gained a wealth of experience, trained a large number of qualified personnel, and formed fine traditions and work style. I hope that you carry forward all such good things and develop them." Liu Ruihuan then said: "The new situation has set new requirements for us. I hope that while carrying forward the tradition, you will gain fresh, more useful experiences. You should not only do a good job in building houses and roads but also step up your ideological education. A new generation of well-educated, well-disciplined people with lofty ideals and moral values should be cultivated. It is hoped that the younger generation is better and stronger than the older one." Words with deep feeling and ardent exhortation! When Li Ruihuan finished his speech, the audience responded with warm applause.
