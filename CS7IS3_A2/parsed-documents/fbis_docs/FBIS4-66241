So it was imperative that our current trademark law be revised. The NPC Standing Committee approved in February 1993 the "Resolution on Revising the PRC Trademark Law" and the "Additional Regulations on Punishing the Criminal Counterfeiting of Registered Trademarks." Their practicality and necessity are seen mainly as follows: 1. They Expand the Scope of Trademark Protection Article Four of our Trademark Law drawn up in 1982 provided that: "For enterprises, institutions, and individual industrial and commercial operators, as to their produced, manufactured, processed, selected, or sold commodities, they must obtain exclusive trademark rights, and should apply for registration to the Trademark Bureau." It is thus obvious that this protected only commodity trademarks, not service trademarks. This was because China's commodity economy was still undeveloped at the time, with service trades, or tertiary industries, such as banking, insurance, transportation, post and telecommunications, commerce, commodity supply and marketing, real estate, tourism, restaurants, hotels, and other consumer service trades, not yet having broken free from the planned-economy mold, and being in a backward state, leaving service trademark protection still not on the agenda. But after a dozen years or so of reform and opening, China's commodity eonomy had made great progress, with tertiary industries playing an increasingly important role in our national economy and people's lives, and receiving ever more attention. WEN HUI BAO reported on 18 February 1993 that the proportion of China's GNP accounted for by tertiary industries is up from 1992's 31.8 percent to 33.1 percent. And Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju stated in a government work report in February 1993 that by the year 2000, the proportion of our GNP made up by tertiary industries will be over 45 percent. With the prosperity of tertiary industries, as improper competitive behavior in service trades had appeared, it was necessary to make clear provisions in law for service trademark registration and protection. So-called service trademarks refer to the marks used by service enterprises, to distinguish the services provided by various enterprises. Service trademarks are one of the targets of industrial property rights protection. Article 1 Section 2 of the "Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property" provides that: "Industrial property protection targets are patents, functional new models, industrial exterior designs, trademarks, service trademarks, business establishments, product origin marks, or country of origin names, to curb improper competition." And Article 6 Section 6 also provides that, "all member nations of this union should protect service trademarks, ...." It is reported that nearly 90 countries (regions) in the world today legally protect registered service trademarks. The U.S. began to take service trademark registration applications in 1949, and Japan began to in 1992. As a member nation of the Paris Convention, China is committed to abide by the Paris Convention provisions, by protecting exclusive service-trademark rights. Meanwhile, as international trade developed, the number of applications in China for service trademarks by all member nations of the Madrid Agreement had grown yearly. But as China had not provided in law for protection of service trademarks, we were unable to process these applications. So when we revised our trademark law in 1993, we added Sections 2 and 3 to Article 4 of the Trademark Law, providing that "for enterprises, institutions, and individual industrial and commercial operators, as to the services they provide, they must obtain exclusive trademark rights, and should apply to the Trade Mark Bureau for service trademark registration." These sections also provide that "the provisions in this law on commodity trademarks are applicable to service trademarks," bringing service trademarks into the scope of protection. 2. They Provide That Place Names of Administrative Regions Above the County Level May Not Be Used as Trademarks Our 1982 Trademark Law did not make prohibitive provisions on whether place names of administrative divisions could be used as trademarks. But practice proved that the major flaw in using place names as trademarks was their lack of prominence, not helping consumers to distinguish them from other similar commodities. Meanwhile, this did not conform to international practice. So Article 8 of our revised Trademark Law includes an additional section, that: "While place names of administrative divisions above the county level or publicly recognized foreign place names may not be used as trademarks, place names do have other implication exceptions; already registered and in-use place-name trademarks will remain valid." It can be seen from the provisions of this section that while place names of administrative divisions may not be made registered trademarks in principle, some place names have other implication exceptions. This clearly indicates that a much-used place name can be made a registered trademark. For instance, the "Changshou" in the well-known Changshou County refers generally to long life; and the "Fenghuang" in Fenghuang County is a kind of bird [phoenix], symbolizing good luck, riches, and honor, which are examples of much-used words. Our legislators also considered the reputation in both China and abroad of place names used in the past as registrerd trademarks for certain commodities, such as Guizhou Maotai [liquor], Qingdao Beer, and Jinhua Ham, so to stabilize protection of already registered trademarks, provided that "already registered and in-use place-name trademarks will remain valid." This provision reflects the high degree of unity of principle and practicality in the spirit of Chinese legislation. 3. They Improve Trademark Registration and Revocation Procedures Trademark registration refers to trademark users, in order to obtain exclusive trademark rights, applying according to legal procedures to trademark registration organs for trademark examination and approval, to be granted the statutory fact of exclusive trademark rights. China's registration principle is that only registered trademarks have legal protection, but unregistered ones do not. Article 12 of our 1982 Trademark Law provided that: "When the same applicants use the same trademark for commodities in different categories, they should submit [separate] registration applications based on commodity classification form." This shows that China's trademark registration application followed the principle of "one form, one category," in which application for the same trademark was limited to one category of commodity and, when the same applicants used the same trademark for different categories of commodities, they should submit separate applications based on commodity classification form. But practice proved that for enterprises that produced many classifications of products, this registration application procedure was tedious and more expensive. The trademark registration applications of the "Madrid Agreement for International Registration of Trade Marks" and developed Western countries all used the principle of "one form, multiple categories," or that the same applicants could in one application apply for the same trademark for different categories of commodities. This principle streamlined the procedure, helping to protect the trademark ownership of production plants, while promoting the development of diversified products by a single factory. So we drew on this more scientific application procedure, deleting the word "separate" from Article 12, showing that China's trademark registration applications are more internationalized. Article 27 of our revised Trademark Law adds a section, that "already registered trademarks, which violate the provisions of Article 8 of this law, or obtained registration by fraudulent or other improper means, will be revoked by the Trade Mark Bureau, and that other units or individuals can ask the Trademark Examination Commission to rule on revocation of so registered trademarks." The addition of this section on the revocation of registered trademarks was very timely and necessary. The grounds for this revision were: 1. Part 1 of Section 2 of Article 6 of the "Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property" provides that, for notorious trademark duplication, copying, or dubbing, Convention member countries can, based on their own laws or at the request of concerned litigants, refuse or revoke registration credentials, and prohibit their use. And Part 3 of Section 2 of Article 6 provides that, for trademarks registered or used through dishonest means, requests for cancellation of registration or prohibition of use may not be subject to time limitations. 2. As to China's judicial practice, the phenomenon of obtaining registration through fraudulent or other improper means is common, with falsified documents and hiding of the facts being employed for trademark registration; the public is well familiar with trademark registration through means, such as duplication, copying, or dubbing. This article provides that registered trademarks already obtained through fraudulent or other improper means should be revoked. This so-called revocation [cancellation] is one of the reasons for registered trademark termination. We need to clarify here that cancellation differs from nullification. Nullification means that the registered trademark owner voluntarily renounces the use of the registered trademark and asks for it to be cancelled, or uses its expiration to not request continued use of the registered trademark so that it is cancelled; cancellation means that the applicant has violated the pertinent provisions of the "Trademark Law," and been subjected to disciplinary sanction, being the use of coercive means to terminate the trademark rights. From these set cancellation grounds, as to actions to obtain registration through fraudulent or other improper means, in line with the provisions of Article 58 Section 3 of the "General Rules of Civil Law," actions committed "by fraudulent means" by one party, "which violate legal or public interests," are invalid [null and void] civil actions. As invalid civil actions have no legally binding force from the time the behavior begins, cancellation of trademark rights means that exclusive trademark rights are terminated beginning not on the day they are cancelled, but rather are null and void from the day the behavior begins, giving them back-dating force. As to invalid civil behavior, anyone can request validity certification. So this section of our revised Trademark Law provides that in addition to the Trade Mark Bureau having cancellation authority, other units and individuals can request cancellation so that, with a ruling by the Trademark Examination Commission, the registered trademark will be cancelled. This provision is fully in accord with Civil Law provisions on invalid civil behavior. 4. They Increase the Penalties for the Criminal Counterfeiting of Registered Trademarks In recent years, all sorts of illegal criminal acts, such as imitating others' registered trademarks, counterfeiting others' registered-trademark symbols, and selling commodities clearly known to have fake registered trademarks, had become rampant, continuing despite repeated crackdowns, to directly infringe upon registered exclusive trademark rights, bring severe chaos to socio-economic order, and infringe on the legitimate rights and interests of the masses of consumers. The increase in fake commodities was a negative effect of the replacement of the old economic system with the new, which negative effect had not been curbed for many reasons. While certain criminal elements manufactured fake and shoddy commodities, counterfeited others' trademarks, and used the means of bribes to promote sales to earn exorbitant profits, the industrial and commercial administrative management sector imposed mostly fines in such criminal cases, which objectively fostered criminal arrogance. In addition, Article 127 of the PRC "Criminal Law" set too light penalties for counterfeit trademark crimes, providing only for imprisonment for up to three years, detention for [community] service, or fines. For those who obtained huge amounts of illegal income, such penalties were obviously too light to have a deterrent impact. In light of this, the Seventh NPC Standing Committee passed on 22 February 1993 the "NPC Standing Committee Additional Regulations on Punishing the Criminal Counterfeiting of Registered Trademarks" (abbreviated hereafter as "Additional Regulations"). These Additional Regulations provide important revisions and additions to the pertinent parts of our "Criminal Law," which in detail are as follows: 1. They increase the statutory penalties for such crime. All who illegally use trademarks the same as other registered trademarks for similar commodities, where the illegal income is large or in other serious cases, or who sell commodities well known to bear counterfeit registered trademarks, where the illegal income is large, can be sentenced to up to three years of imprisonment, with those where the illegal income is enormous being sentenced to 3-7 years imprisonment, as well as fined. And those who counterfeit or manufacture without authorization others' registered-trademark symbols, or sell registered-trademark symbols that are counterfeited or manufactured without authorization, where illegal income is large or in other serious cases, can also be punished according to the abovementioned statutory penalties. 2. Article 127 of the PRC "Criminal Law" provided for "imprisonment for up to 3 years, detention for service, or fines." This provided for choosing just one penalty, being commonly called "punishment without fines, or fines without punishment." As it used the word "or" rather than "and," the "Additional Regulations" provide for fines also for criminals sentenced to up to 3 years imprisonment or detention for service, as well as for those sentenced to 3-7 years. This will economically curb this type of crime, keeping such criminals from benefiting economically. 3. Article 127 of the PRC "Criminal Law" also made provisions concerning "violations of trademark management laws and regulations, in which industrial and commercial enterprises counterfeit other enterprises' already registered trademarks...." It is not hard to see that this section provided only for cases in which industrial and commercial enterprises counterfeited trademarks, not ones in which individuals did so. As this was obviously out of line with China's current conditions, the "Additional Regulations" delete the words "industrial and commercial enterprises." 4. The "Additional Regulations" provide that "where enterprises and institutions commit the above two crimes, their units will be fined and, as to their responsible personnel [1] and others [2] who are directly liable, criminal liability will be investigated and affixed according to the above two regulations." While China's criminal law used to provide for a single penalty system, legal persons [corporations] can now be regarded as criminal subjects, which can be sentenced to fines, with the two abovementioned liable subjects being sentenced to deprivation of their freedom. 5. The "Additional Regulations" provide that "for state workers who exploit their posts to deliberately shield or prevent the prosecution of enterprises, institutions, or individuals that they well know have criminally violated these regulations, their criminal liabilitty will be investigated and affixed according to the provisions of Article 188 of the Criminal Law." In other words, state workers who commit the above crimes will be punished according to Article 188 of the Criminal Law on illegal embezzlement by company employees. [passage omitted]
