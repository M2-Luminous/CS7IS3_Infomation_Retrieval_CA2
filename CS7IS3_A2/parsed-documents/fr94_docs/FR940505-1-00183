FR940505-1-00183 FR940505-1-00012 (2) contain a convincing minimum set of measures that all employers must implement to reach the target APO; (3) provide that failure by the employer to meet the target APO will result in implementation of a regulation-specified, multi-measure contingency plan designed to meet the target APO; or (4) include financial penalties and/or compliance incentives for employers who fail to meet the target APO that are large enough to provide a significant prospective incentive for the employer to design and implement an effective compliance plan. An option can be used by itself or in combination with others. The proposed ECO regulation uses a combination of the first and the fourth program design options. In sum, the proposed ECO regulation meets the basic ECO program requirements. Consequently, the proposed ECO regulation may be adopted by a state or locality to meet the requirements of Section 182(d)(1)(B). A general discussion of its requirements is included below in section (c). The detailed proposed ECO regulation is included in this Federal Implementation Plan NPRM at 40 CFR 52.2999. c. Employer and compliance plan requirements. The proposed ECO regulation requires the following seven actions of employers: (1) register with EPA as an employer subject to the regulation; (2) designate an Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC) at each work location; (3) conduct an annual APO survey of its employees at each work location to determine employees' current commute patterns and report the results of the APO survey to the EPA; (4) develop and submit to the EPA before March 1, 1997, 2 years from program inception, and in subsequent years as required by the regulation, trip reduction plans that describe activities to be implemented at the location under an ECO program; (5) implement the ECO program described in the approved trip reduction plan; (6) no later than March 1, 1999, 4 years from program inception, increase the average passenger occupancy (APO) at each location by not less than 25 percent over the average vehicle occupancy (AVO) for Sacramento ECO program area; (7) maintain the target APO upon achieving it. An employer failing to accomplish any or all of these actions would be in violation of the proposed ECO regulation and would be subject to penalties under section 113 of the Clean Air Act. The required components of an employer's compliance plan are as follows: (1) the name of the employer, address of the work location, and name, title, and signature of the Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC) at the work location; (2) the results of the most recent APO survey and a description of the procedure used to conduct the APO survey; (3) a description of the physical and transportation service characteristics of the work location, and demographic, work, and travel-related characteristics of the employee population; (4) a description of ECO strategies currently implemented that provide commute alternative incentives to employees at the work location and additional ECO strategies the employer will implement at the work location; (5) activities planned by the employer to implement the ECO program and a time schedule for implementation of the program; and (6) a description of the process by which the employer will periodically monitor and review progress toward the APO target. Employer plans will be certified by a third party for completeness in order to reduce EPA's implementation burden. EPA will approve or disapprove plans. The Air Pollution Control Districts for the Sacramento nonattainment area will have the right of first refusal to certify plans of employers in their district. Should one or more APCDs decline the opportunity to certify employers, another organization or other organizations will be designated by EPA as plan certifiers. By March 1, 1999, all employers must submit either a maintenance plan describing either how the employer will maintain the target APO, or an update compliance plan describing what additional measures the employer will take to reach the APO target within one year. An employer's update compliance plan must discuss good faith efforts to achieve the target APO, provide an explanation of why the ECO strategies included in the last plan did not produce the target APO, and discuss how the update compliance plans will cause the employer to achieve the target within one year if the target has not been met by then as required.
