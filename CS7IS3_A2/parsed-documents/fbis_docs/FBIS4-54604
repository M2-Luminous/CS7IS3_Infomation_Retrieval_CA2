FBIS4-54604 "dreeu085__a94017" FBIS-EEU-94-085-A Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 ANNEX Hungary Police Comment on Arrest of Hungarist Leaders Police Comment on Arrest of Hungarist Leaders AU2904142094 Budapest MTI in English 1200 GMT 29 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2904142094 Budapest MTI English BFN [Text] Budapest, 29 April (MTI) -- The National Police Headquarters (ORFK) will initiate keeping far-right Hungarist Movement leaders Albert Szabo and Istvan Gyorkos in custody pending trial on Saturday [30 April] at the latest. The two were arrested at dawn on Friday. ORFK's Colonel Istvan Balatoni told reporters on Friday that 14-15 flats were searched, fascist publications and 500 swastika-emblems were confiscated, and 18-20 people were questioned during the dawn sweep carried out in cooperation with the Office for National Security. According to Balatoni, the Hungarist Movement went public at its April 27 news conference in order to recruit sympathizers, because their founding document was signed only by 11 people, some of whom told the police that they knew nothing of Szalasi's ideology. (Ferenc Szalasi -- 1897-1946 -- led Hungary's fascist Arrow-Cross Party and Hungarist Movement. He was executed as a war-criminal in 1946.) Balatoni stressed that charges of inciting ethnic hatred had only been lodged against Szabo and Gyorkos, while the police lacked sufficient evidence against the third Hungarist leader, Gyorgy Kemal Ekrem. Last year for a similar crime Gyorkos was sentenced to a year's imprisonment, suspended for three years. The colonel denied any connection between the police action and the Hungarian Democratic Forum presidium's Thursday morning condemnation of the Hungarist Movement or Prime Minister Peter Boross's Thursday afternoon statement to the same effect. Balatoni said that preparing such a coordinated operation takes a longer time, and it has to be carried out at a time when the suspects are most probably at home.
