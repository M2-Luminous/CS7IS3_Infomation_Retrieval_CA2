There was, it is true, a certain confusion in the beginning. Indications of this are the diplomatic illness that the president "endured on his feet" and the statements of various officials that contradicted each other, which has already become traditional. But at the culminating moment the situation was assessed accurately, the weakness and ambiguity in the positions of the other players were fully exploited, and the thrust that was created by NATO's ultimatum was used to support its own line, which also led to the triumph of Russian diplomacy. There is boasting in Moscow about Russia's independent role. The obvious irritation in Western capitals with Russian "license" is competing with secret satisfaction over the outcome of the Sarajevo crisis. Meanwhile, success became possible only because all the players, although hardly by agreement, played their role in the general game. Using KGB terminology, the West played the role of "malicious investigator," after which came Russia's turn, to whom it fell, in the person of the "good investigator," to reap the fruit. Russia and the Western powers objectively mutually complemented each other in their actions, but differed sharply in their substantiation. The price of such rhetoric, it would seem, is not high. But it always addressees itself to those social forces that have a predominant influence on foreign policy and, therefore, it is not indifferent to the real driving motives of the parties. Russia explained its resistance to NATO's ultimatum in a different way: The impermissibility of attempts to bypass it, the unacceptability of imposing the model of settlement, and the danger of any decision other than a continuation of negotiations. But objectively this denoted an attempt to lessen international pressure on the Serbian side, which was the most powerful and most successful in seizures, and which would also reinforce its position behind the negotiating. And while at the beginning of the Bosnian conflict Russian foreign policy tried, albeit inconsistently, to be impartial, as it developed it began to regard "Orthodox co-religionists" and "Slavic brothers" with greater and greater favor. This corresponded fully to the biased leniency of the European states toward Croatia, and of the United States toward the Bosnian Muslims. However, the important interests of the Western states are not affected here, and only the Bosnian gap in European law and order stains their reputation. It is hardly possible to ascribe to genuine Russian foreign policy interests an inclination to assist the Belgrade regime in a partition of the former SFRY in accordance with the ideals of a Greater Serbia. Bosnian rural areas are hardly the most effective scene for demonstrating greatness. The space, where the collapsed Yugoslav dinar, contrary to an anti-German mood, is being squeezed out by the German mark, which Russia will be unable to counter with anything for a long time, is outside the radius of influence of the Russian economy. In precisely the same way a military advanced post, separated from it by the territories of Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania, is not very suitable for the defense of Russia, if the counterproductive task of having a permanent irritant on NATO's southern flank is not set. There is also no promise of foreign policy dividends in an alliance with an international social outcast that contrived to squander the enormous foreign policy capital of the former SFRY. Of course, it can be assumed that Russia's readiness to support "a Serbian cause" to the last Serbian soldier is explained by sober political realism. After all, Serbia, as has happened more than once, will remain an "historical ally" of Russia only while the war lasts and the international isolation continues. It is then in Russia's interests to support this status as long as possible. The task is the more gratifying in that it does not require any sacrifices by Russia, except for damage to its international prestige. But access to the matches for the powder keg of Europe is a considerable temptation. The intent is sufficiently cynical to appear politically authentic. Of course, in this case also, the question of the cost of such a temporary "historical alliance" remains. The reality, however, is more transparent. Russian foreign policy is more and more becoming a direct derivative of the arrangement of internal political forces, taking on a dangerous independence from the strictly foreign policy interests and objectives of the country. The most authoritarian ruler is incapable for long of refuting through his behavior the well-known formula of foreign policy being a continuation of domestic policy. The exerted striving for foreign policy self-affirmation is greater the weaker the domestic stability of the existing regime, the narrower its social base and political support, and the more dismal its socioeconomic situation. It is not just a question of complaisance to the pressure of the national-communist opposition that prevails in parliament and to the intrigues of the lobbyist groups, from the pro-Serb to the Karabakh and Abkhaz groups, which need an example and an international-legal precedent to legalize their own claims. It is not only a matter of the efforts of the president's "court" to forestall the opposition by intercepting some of their slogans and the votes of the electorate. For the country as a whole, which is obsessed with a complex of greatness but which is deprived of many of its status symbols and a material basis, there is an inevitable striving to assert an independent role in the international arena. The time has also come for a sobering up of Russian foreign policy from "romantic Westernism," and just as naturally for a departure from "market romanticism." The policy is even more pertinent in that such romanticism is principally foreign to the West itself. Fraternizing with windmills is just as absurd as fighting them. Perhaps it is for this reason that all the factions of the State Duma voted for a resolution that denounces NATO's ultimatum. However, the age-old misfortune of the Russian character--dislike for the middle ground--turns into a tragic shortfall in the policy of the centrist social and political forces. Therefore, there is a very great risk that "market romanticism," given the most insignificant changes in the composition of the leading personalities, will be replaced by an antimarket romance, and that illusory Westernism will turn into great power illusions. The magical transformation of Kozyrev's Stockholm parody into a Russian foreign policy program is a dangerous symptom of precisely such an evolution. It is entirely superfluous to talk about the foreign policy constructions of the national-communist opposition. The Sarajevo crisis revealed latent maturing processes of changes in Russian foreign policy. This may become the guarantee of more businesslike relations of Russia with Western states--proof of the fact that not only is the West necessary to Russia, but that Russia is also necessary to the West. The Sarajevo crisis can also turn out to be the start of a new opposition. But while Russia cannot escape a serious discussion with the Western partners, for example, as a result of their attempts to counteract the voluntary reintegration of the post-Soviet space, to quarrel regarding Bosnia is pure childishness. But the president and his circle are hardly ready to be at loggerheads with the State Duma over this. It is because what is happening there in fact makes no difference to one or the other. After all, Russian foreign policy, to Russian politicians of various colors, is only a place for settling domestic political scores.
