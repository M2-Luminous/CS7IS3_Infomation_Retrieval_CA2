The researchers here performed a computer study of monthly reports from AIDS-prevention centers, daily reports of HIV infection, and reports of epidemiological investigations filed in the Russian Center for Controlling AIDS to identify a correlation between HIV infection and drug use. They found that, as of 1 November 1992, a total of 588 individuals had been diagnosed as having HIV, and eight of those individuals had had casual sex with drug users. A poll of 86 intravenous drug users indicated that most of them (upwards of 90 percent) shared unsterilized needles. None of those polled had shared needles with foreigners, although 13-18 percent had shared needles with prostitutes. Users of so-called pervitin accounted for the highest percentage of drug users who had sex immediately after intravenous injection of the drug. Most of those polled did not have a steady sex partner, did not use condoms, and had sex with prostitutes. Only 6 percent had had sex with foreigners. The pervitin users appear to be at greatest risk among the drug users for spread of HIV. References 6 (Western).
