The member states of the WEU [Western European Union], i.e., the European Union [EU] minus Denmark and Ireland, concluded an association agreement with six countries of Central and East Europe (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania) and the three Baltic countries. According to [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, this agreement "signals a decisive phase in the organization's development." Since the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, the WEU, which is the only European body competent in defense matters, has become, if not the "armed wing" of the European Union, then at least the embryo of a future common defense and the "European pillar" of NATO. With the reinforcement of these nine new "associate partners," it will become the only forum for discussing the concept of security in Europe without the Russians or the Americans. "We emphasized the parallelism of the East European countries' membership in the EU and in the WEU," clarified the French foreign minister. In other words, their associate membership should be seen in the light of their future EU membership. [passage omitted] Alain Juppe feels that one must not see either "competition " or "contradiction" between the Partnership for Peace and the agreement signed yesterday in Luxembourg, but rather "complementarity." In this respect, [French Defense Minister] Francois Leotard emphasized that exercises by the French-German brigade together with Polish units this fall in France would be placed under the double sponsorship of the Partnership for Peace and the WEU. He also recalled that the Groups of Multinational Interarmy Forces, which are currently being looked into by NATO, may be placed under WEU command, with possible reinforcements being provided by troops from the East European countries. This did not stop him from recommending that the WEU should develop its own capabilities in the areas of "satellite observation, intelligence, and strategic mobility." He also revived the idea of a French-German armaments agency. So, little by little, the WEU is shedding its anonymity and the design of a "Greater Europe" is seeing the light of day through enhanced cooperation in security matters. "Saint Schuman day [reference to French statesman Robert Schuman] is definitely a symbol!," commented one diplomat yesterday.
