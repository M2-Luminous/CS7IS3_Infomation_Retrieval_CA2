Today, the Military Court Supreme Council will hear the charges against Generals Jaime Salinas and German Parra, who criticized the performance of General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, Army commander and commander of the Armed Forces Joint Command. For Gen. Parra alone, the military prosecutor has requested a sentence of eight months' imprisonment. Salinas and Parra maintain that their comments were personal and were made in their capacity as civilians now they are retired. The Military Court has sentenced Gen. Luis Cisneros Vizquerra to 90 days' imprisonment "for insulting his superiors." Cisneros was interior minister under the military government that ruled between 1968 and 1980. Gen. Alberto Arciniega, who presided over the court that sentenced Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman to life imprisonment, in January 1993 was charged with offense and insult. He sought refuge in the Argentine Embassy because of these charges and then travelled to that country. Gen. Jose Pastor Vives has been charged with insulting his superiors, and was sentenced to a provisional sentence of 60 days' imprisonment. Vives was involved in the thwarted coup of 13 November 1992, but was pardoned later on. The trial of Gen. Sinesio Jarama began on 2 May. He is charged with allegedly insulting the Army as an institution. Gen. Salinas, who was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for having headed the aborted 13 November coup, is also being tried for offending the Armed Forces and insulting his superiors. Gen. Parra, former transportation minister during former President Alan Garcia's government (1985-90), is charged with offenses and insults. Several constitutional experts have stated that although the Constitution establishes some political restrictions for military officers on duty, it is not the same for those who are retired and are regarded as civilians. Raul Ferrera, former dean of the Lima Law School, stated the application of the military code contradicts the Constitution, which guarantees the right to an opinion of every citizen, without distinction.
