FBIS4-66526 "jpnea020___94034" JPRS-NEA-94-020 JPRS Near East & South Asia 4 March 1994 NEAR EAST REPUBLIC OF YEMEN Salih Accused of Instigating Unrest Salih Accused of Instigating Unrest 94AE0094A Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI in Arabic 4 Mar 94 pp 28-29 94AE0094A Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI Arabic CSO [Text] Barely a few hours had passed following the "compulsory embrace" between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Amman on 20 February 1994 when battles erupted between the North Yemen Army and South Yemen Army, thus giving rise to questions on how serious the two sides are about implementing the "covenant and accord document," which had been signed by Yemeni figures under the sponsorship of King Husayn, and on whether there really is a reasonable mechanism for implementation. A very resentful Jordanian official has said to AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI, "Why, then, did they come to us? Why all those arrangements, debates, and mutual visits? Moreover, why did that throng of 300 Yemenis representing all of Yemen's tribes, parties, institutions, and intellectuals come to us? Why did the security and military situation erupt even before the ink used by 37 officials to sign the covenant and accord document could dry up?" Another official was more realistic and less emotional. He said, "It isn't like this. The document isn't a cease-fire declaration. It isn't even a declaration of unity. The document is a timetable to disengage in the political and economic clash. Don't forget that this is the first time in Yemen's modern history in which all Yemenis with all their factions have agreed to such a broad dialogue. An opportunity must be given to people to overcome the obstacles and implement the accord." Struggle Is Dominant Regardless of what the two officials have said in their contradictory assessments, struggle for power and for the distribution of positions and wealth continues to dominate Yemen's map. Those who scrutinized the face of President 'Ali Salih and of Vice President 'Ali Salih al-Bid when they were sitting to the right and left of King Husayn during the accord-signing ceremony at Raghadan Palace, Amman, were able to pick up signs of tension and of dissatisfaction. Even though the spontaneous address which 'Ali Salih delivered, (and in which he thanked Yasir 'Arafat and the United States!), did not betray his fear that the document would face difficulty in implementation, 'Ali Salim al-Bid was so frank and so reserved that spectators expected him to upturn the table and end the party suddenly! Al-Bid declared that he had reservations because accords had been previously signed but not implemented. He then proceeded to talk about the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] martyrs who have fallen in the mutual assassinations between North and South. Al-Bid went on to list the names of those assassinated, and the audience imagined he was about to abandon the microphone and depart from the hall. But al-Bid found the right way out when he went on to add, "But Yemen is dearer than all of these people." From that moment, there has been strengthened belief that it will be extremely difficult to implement the document and that the path is not strewn with roses but planted with mines. A few hours later, 'Ali al-Bid's fears came true when the first battle erupted in a border area between units of the Southern Unity [al-Wahdah] Brigade and the Northern Giants [al-'Amaliqah] Brigade. Sanaa said that the YSP fabricated the confrontation to reinforce its presence in al-Mukalla Province, whereas Aden said that Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, commander of the First Armored Division and President 'Ali Salih's half-brother, was behind igniting the confrontation because of his opposition to the covenant. On the following day, a broader and more serious confrontation erupted. Thus, the chain of battles and of people killed and wounded started. Far From Modern State A member of the Yemeni delegation in Amman said to AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI, "We are tribal and we are still very far from the modern state. Even I who sit with you here am tribal despite the fact that I have studied in Europe. I talk about dialogue and democracy and I defend the counter opinion. But when the moment of truth comes, the tribal spark ignites within me and I forget all I have studied." When we asked him if he expects the Amman accord to fail, he said, "There are dozens of agreements which haven't been implemented. We agreed previously. But the difficulty has always been in implementation. Despite this, the Amman accord is the most important to date. It has a timetable and it has dealt with numerous details that weren't tackled by past accords. We hope that whenever things get dark--and they are dark in our country most of the time--we will seek guidance from this accord!" This Is How Battles Erupted Why did battles erupt and how do Northerners and Southerners view the covenant? A Yemeni delegation member who requested that his identity not be revealed has said, "Decades of division, colonialism, tribal rivalries, backwardness, and poverty make it impossible to move to a modern democratic state as fast as intellectuals wish. It is a matter of legacy and of entrenched concepts. What more than this massive arrival of Yemenis in Amman would one ask for? But then the response to those who seek unity has been a war declaration." He went on to add, "One must acknowledge that our centers of power are infiltrated. There are secret hands that strike from time to time and there are divided loyalties. Moreover, the mentality of the Northerners who put tribe above any party or social consideration is different from the mentality of the Southerners who have had contact with the British and the Soviets, who have been educated, and many of whom have become politicized Marxists." We asked him: "As a Southerner, what is your viewpoint?" He responded, "Frankly, President 'Ali Salih controls most of the political and military positions through the tribe. His immediate family rules Yemen. This condition doesn't please me and doesn't please our people in the South. We are more educated and more capable of management. Yet, our share of power isn't compatible with our capabilities. It is true that the Northerners exceed us in numbers. But even by this criterion, we are done an injustice." But what about the oil factor? He responded, "You are aware that there are vast oil stores in the Southern territories. The discovery of this wealth has stirred a sense of injustice among our kinsmen, and they constantly wonder if unity with the North is in their interest or not. They say that the North, which dominates the decisionmaking, is capable of exploiting and devouring the South's oil, and they demand a fair distribution of wealth." So, you aren't against unity? "No, not at all. We are only opposed to concentrating influence in the hands of certain people to the exclusion of others. We are against the North's devouring of the South. We want an equal unity, not a unity of annexation. However, people have to be educated and persuaded of the benefit of unity. We are a single people. Our tribes are the same and our roots are the same. But we are like two brothers, each of whom has grown up in a different environment. When the two meet, this environment makes each brother seem to be the antithesis of the other." But the document gives you more than what you have had, doesn't it? In response, he said, "Even though the document seeks to increase the South's share of power, which is our right, it doesn't meet all our demands. Despite this, we have accepted it. However, the percentage of Northerners who reject it is higher than the percentage of Southerners who reject it. The reason is that the document takes away some power and some influence from the Northerners. The centers of power in Sanaa seek to dominate Aden completely. This is what made al-Bid stay in retreat in the South for six months." Do you expect the battles to continue? Another Yemeni delegation member said, "The situation is very tense and people in both parts are very afraid. There are true efforts to defuse the situation. But it is very difficult to tell whether these efforts will succeed. The issue depends on how sincerely the two sides have accepted the covenant and accord and how able they are to implement it."
