UN sources admitted late Friday that the tank, the last of seven to pass through the Sarajevo exclusion zone as a concession by UN envoy Yasushi Akashi, had escaped the surveillance of UN military observers (UNMO) as it approached the Serb-held suburb of Lukavica. The disappearance of the tank was "intolerable," UNPROFOR spokesman Eric Chaperon said at a morning briefing. Another UN military official, speaking unattributably, said: "This is farcical, to put it mildly." The UNMOs lost track of the tank around 7:30 p.m. (1730 GMT) three kilometres (two miles) south of the inner suburb of Grbavica, Chaperon said. The tank's escape was "a clear violation" of the February 9 ultimatum by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ordering Serb heavy weapons to a distance of 20 kilometres (12 miles) of the city centre. "The exclusion zone is still in force and the tank represents a threat to the city," Chaperon said. The military official said the UNMOs had "seen the tank-transporter travelling empty in the return direction and deduced that the tank had been unloaded at Grbavica." "What is certain is that the tank did not go through the checkpoint at Grbavica and that it is therefore somewhere inside the city," the official said. The ongoing fiasco over the Serb tanks was triggered by Akashi's concession to Serb leaders in Pale last Tuesday allowing them to transit through the exclusion zone under UNPROFOR escort. The deal has "embarrassed" UN officials here and exposed serious disarray in the UNPROFOR operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Failures of communication between UNPROFOR headquarters in Zagreb and officials in Sarajevo led to conflicting statements by UN spokesmen as the Serbs exploited the situation by sending their tanks into the zone without prior notification. Early Friday, as spokesmen in Sarajevo announced the scheduled transit of two more tanks, the last of those initially announced, Akashi in Zagreb said he was reversing his decision as he felt he had been "deceived by the Serbs." The Serb tanks proceeded anyway, without notification. One was blocked at Lukavica and the other, which left from Pale late Friday, escaped the attention of the UNMOs "somewhere near the bobsleigh slope" that overlooks the city, Chaperon said. He blamed "poor visibility" and said the UNMOs were slowed by the Serb escort that was following the tank. "This is a problem of communications relating to the UNMOs. It's the UN system taken to absurd lengths, since they don't report to UNPROFOR but directly to New York," a UN officier said on condition of anonymity. "In addition the UNMOs move in groups of two, they are a mixture of nationalities, and sometimes they don't understand each other." Akashi's initiative has allowed Serb military commanders to expose serious communications problems between Sarajevo, Zagreb and now New York. It has angered the Bosnian Government, which considers the UN envoy has given a military advantage to the Serbs and is demanding Akashi's resignation. It also prompted a rare public rebuke Friday from the U.S. State Department, which said the Japanese diplomat had erred and that Washington had made down "our very strong concerns" to the UN secretariat. The Serbs now have four tanks within the NATO exclusion zone, two known to be at Hadzici and one at Osijek, in Sarajevo's outer suburbs, and a fourth near the city centre which, Chaperon said, "we cannot locate."
