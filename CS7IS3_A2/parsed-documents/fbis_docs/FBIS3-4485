As part of the drive, the semi-official trade promotion body is organizing a delegation of machinery manufacturers and traders to attend an international trade fair to be held in Bogota, Colombia in July, the spokesman reported. CETRA will provide transport subsidies for local machinery manufacturers who want to exhibit their products at the Bogota trade show, the spokesman said. "We are also compiling a list of major Colombian machinery importers and will help local manufacturers negotiate trade deals with them," the spokesman said. "We hope we can sell all the Taiwan machines displayed at the Bogota show," he added. The spokesman said the biennial Bogota Trade Fair used to focus on consumer goods, but, starting this year, it will also feature machines and other production equipment. The demand for production facilities in Bogota and other Latin American countries has been growing steadily in recent years, fueled by recovering economies, the spokesman said. Moreover, the spokesman said, Bogota has largely cut its tariff rates on machinery imports. "This is a good time for Taiwan machinery makers to penetrate that market," he noted. CETRA will rent a large booth for local manufacturers to display their machinery at the Bogota fair, the spokesman said. "Local manufacturers of plastics, footwear, textile and molding machines are welcome to join the CETRA mission to tap the Colombian market," he added. If the Bogota show turns out to be a success, the spokesman said, CETRA will use similar tactics to help local machinery manufacturers explore other Latin American markets.
