[passage omitted] Following Friday prayers, the brother Presidential Council chairman spoke to the worshipers at the mosque and congratulated them for their blessed prayers, and reviewed the developments in the national arena in light of the signing of the document of accord and the current preparations for implementing and translating it on the ground. He referred to the steps covered since the signing of the document in the Jordanian capital, Amman, and the regrettable ramifications that took place later. He especially emphasized the military field, and the measures adopted to stop these military ramifications, and the success realized by the joint military committee in this field. He said that following the signing of the document, there was great hope that the crisis was over and that the beginning of a new stage was at hand, that the document would be implemented and that all parties would adhere to it. Regrettably, what happened showed the determination of certain people not to reunite the constitutional establishments to enable these establishments to carry out their duties in implementing the document. The brother president said: In this address to you, I want to assure you and all the masses of our people that we will make every effort, alongside all unionists and good people, to contain the crisis. Let our people be sure that we will not allow discord and fighting among the sons of our people, we will not allow one drop of Yemeni blood to be shed for the sake of narrow interests, and we will not allow anyone to encroach on the homeland's security and stability. He said that no one individual, party, or group has the right to maintain a mandate on unity or people, or any part of this people, adding that unity is a safeguard that will never be relinquished whatever the price might be. He said heroic Sanaa, the historical and political capital of the unified Yemeni homeland is a city for all unionists, and is the home for all Yemenis in all parts of the homeland. He stressed that our people will stand firmly with unity, with democracy, and with the document of accord, and will confront those who sow strife and incite sectarian, racist, or tribal problems. The people will also confront all forces of renegades and secession. The brother president said: We are concerned that Yemeni blood be spared and that our people be spared the difficulties and our country be spared the destruction. We will seek with all the power we have to build Yemen and avoid all the gloomy pictures it witnessed in the past. With the unity, we closed the files of the past. We will not permit the occurrence of new tragedies in the history of our people and homeland. Those who speak in a loud voice about a state where law and order prevail should offer us the model they followed for 25 years, in the economic, administrative, and development spheres to find the basic structure for development, and building the state. We do not need to speak more about the model they had offered to the citizens over that period of time. This model is well known to our people, part of whom still suffer from its tragic consequences. We regret to say that such people now seek the recurrence of this model throughout the entire homeland so that our entire Yemeni people will suffer, after already attaining their unity on 22 May 1990. Our people have hoped that this unity will be the dividing line between these dark ages and a new era based on freedom, democracy, justice, respect for human rights, and on real development from which the homeland benefits. We aspire to build a modern Yemeni state, a state where blood, honor, and property will be safeguarded, a state based on law and order, on free economic activities, and on fair competition for achieving what is better. We will not allow any force whatsoever to tamper with the security of the homeland and the tranquility of the citizen. The brother president added: We want the specter of fear to end and the crisis to disappear for good from the minds of our people. We want our people to live a quiet and safe life far from the crises which some insist on repeating in the homeland's life and which poison the lives of the people. Some appear to have forgotten how to live without these crisis, something to which they have become accustomed during their lives. Our steadfast people in one part of the homeland have paid a prohibitive price for this. They now want all the people throughout the entire homeland to pay the price of this crisis which has been going on for over six months. Our people have suffered from tribulations and have sustained hardships as a result of this crisis. The brother Presidential Council chairman added: We and all the good people hope to welcome 'Id al-Fir with happiness and joy and with a sense of safety. We are confident that our people, who overcame many challenges through their history, will also pass this test and will maintain their determination to achieve unity, democracy, peace, and progress.
