FR941019-2-00135 FR941019-2-00081 United States District Court, District of Arizona, United States of America, Plaintiff, v. Pilkington plc and Pilkington Holdings Inc., Defendant. No. CIV 94&hyph;00345 WDB. Comments of PPG Industries, Inc. on Proposed Final Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement PPG Industries, Inc. (``PPG'') comments on the Proposed Final Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement in United States v. Pilkington plc as follows: Preliminary Statement Pilkington has repeatedly brought vexatious litigation and has attempted to restrain trade under the guise of protecting the confidentiality of float technology and enforcing license restrictions. While the Proposed Final Judgment does make it more difficult for Pilkington to continue these practices, Pilkington has already publicly indicated in its own press releases that it intends to continue engaging in such behavior to the degree that the consent decree allows it. For example, on May 26, 1994, the Pilkington press release announcing the terms of this consent decree stated: The Government's allegations are unproven and would not have survived a test in court. *␣*␣* The Consent Decree *␣*␣* recognizes the subsequent evolution of [float] technology and that recent float bath technology developed by Pilkington will continue to be treated through normal licensing arrangements. *␣*␣* Pilkington's protection and licensing of its total float technology, throughout the rest of the world, remains unaffected. *␣*␣* Pilkington is reassured that the confidentiality of the process is protected and that the normal licensing arrangements for current and future float glass technology are secure. Pilkington Press Release, May 26, 1994. As reported in the Financial Times on May 27, 1994, Sir Robin Nicholson, Pilkington's technology director, said: We have got what we wanted, in that we retain a substantial amount of proprietary knowledge which we can license in the normal way. ``Pilkington Emerges with Advantages,'' Financial Times, p. 6, May 27, 1994. Based on Pilkington's own statements and to prevent continued vexations litigation and trade restraints, PPG submits that protection of the public interest counsels modification or clarification of the Proposed Final Judgment in the following limited respects. Comments 1. Float License Agreements Change: Paragraph IV.A.1. should be modified to provide: ``All obligations of U.S. LICENSEES in all LICENSE AGREEMENTS between any defendant and any U.S. LICENSEE are hereby declared null, void and unenforceable. No defendant shall take any action to invoke, enforce or assert any claim under any such agreement.'' Alternatively, at a minimum, paragraph IV.A.1 should be modified to add: ``Moreover, no defendant shall enter into, enforce or claim any right under any AGREEMENT to the extent that it requires any U.S. LICENSEE to: (i) Report and grant back to any defendant all improvement in FLOAT TECHNOLOGY; (ii) limit exports of FLAT GLASS to any geographic areas; (iii) litigate disputes in an arbitration, as opposed to a U.S. Court, unless such arbitration permits the application of substantive U.S. antitrust law, including its provisions for treble damages and attorneys' fees awarded to a prevailing plaintiff; or (iv) prove that the SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY had become publicly known before being relieved of the territorial and use restrictions.'' The references in paragraphs IV.A.2.(b); IV.A.3; IV.B.1; IV.B.2(a); and IV.C to ``trade secret under applicable law'' should be changed to ``trade secret under applicable law, provided that any applicable non-U.S. trade secret law will not be applied to permit the protection of items of technology that would be unprotectable under U.S. law.'' Reason for Change: As is set forth in the complaint in United States v. Pilkington plc, CIV 94&hyph;00345&hyph;WDB (D. Ariz.) (the ``Complaint''), defendants have used float license agreements (``FLAs'') to restrain trade and secure monopoly power unlawfully. The Competitive Impact Statement and the Complaint both note that Pilkington has no intellectual property of substantial value, that, since 1982, Pilkington's remaining secret unpatented technology consisted largely of engineering solutions with no substantial value over other equally efficacious engineering alternatives and that one of the devices Pilkington has used to perpetuate its control is its FLAs, including their burden-shifting clauses, which require licensees to establish the nonexistence of confidential information in any arbitration. Competitive Impact Statement (``Comp. Imp. Stat.'') at 10; Complaint §24. If Pilkington is to be allowed to continue to protect its alleged trade secrets, it should be required to prove that they exist. Pilkington should not be able to shift that burden of proof, as it has done in its FLAs. Pilkington's grant-back clauses require licensees to report and grant to Pilkington all improvements in float glass technology. They thus deprive any licensee of the incentives to create innovative technologies, precluding any competitive advantage to accrue to an innovative licensee and, in effect, discourage efforts to create such technologies. The grant-back clauses should be invalidated for that reason. Pilkington also should be precluded from utilizing the FLA arbitration clauses to enforce so-called trade secret claims. Those clauses have permitted Pilkington to assert claims in a forum that: (a) Is hostile to the application of U.S. antitrust law; (b) does not recognize the extraterritorial application of U.S. antitrust law and may not recognize even this Final Judgment; and (c) enforces anticompetitive restrictions not permissible under U.S. antitrust law. Any issues involving U.S. trade secret law and U.S. antitrust .␣.␣. law should be litigated in a forum that will permit an adjudication and award under those laws. 2. Assertion of Claims Against PPG With Respect to the Use or Licensing of the LB Process Change: Change paragraph IV.A.1 to provide: ``with respect to the use, licensing or sublicensing of any SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY or any process developed with the use or aid of SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY.'' Paragraphs IV.A.2.(a) and IV.A.3 also should be modified accordingly. Reason for Change: In the Shenzhen Arbitration, which Pilkington filed in 1985 and which continued until 1992, Pilkington asserted that PPG's LB process was ``tainted'' because it was developed using Pilkington float technology, irrespective of whether PPG's use was wrongful. That ``taint,'' according to Pilkington, subjected the LB process as a whole to an obligation of confidence coextensive with that applicable to information that was transferred by Pilkington to PPG. The design and effect of Pilkington's ``taint'' argument was to make it virtually impossible for any licensee to develop competing innovative technology free of Pilkington's aggressive claims and litigation, thus further discouraging and inhibiting the development of innovative technologies by those most likely and able to engage in such developmental efforts.
