This was mentioned in a first report on arms trade. According to a new law, every year the Belgian Government should present a report on arms trade in our country. Only a small part of the weapons was exported from Flanders -- the southern part of Belgium -- Wallonia -- clearly remains the largest weapon exporter. A controversy on weapon deliveries to the Middle East led to the collapse of the last Martens government. Shortly after that the law on arms trade became stricter. Exports of weapons to countries violating human rights or to countries where a civil war is going on are no longer allowed. Also deliveries to transit countries or countries involved in terrorist actions and drugs trade are no longer possible. The present report on arms export gives very few details, which makes it difficult to check all the deliveries. It is, however, sure that most of the weapons continue to go to the Near and Middle East. Senator of the moderate nationalist party Volksunie, Willy Kuijpers, has said that the new law on arms trade hasn't changed anything. Kuijpers is closely watching arms exports to Turkey where their Army is fighting the Kurds. The senator says it is impossible to find out whether deliveries to Turkey were extended or not. A member of the Turkish Embassy wanted to attend the discussion of the report in the senate, but he was refused admittance.
