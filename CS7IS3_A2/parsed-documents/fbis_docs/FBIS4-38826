The president, who is now on a state visit to Russia, was addressing the Federation Council (the upper chamber of the Russian parliament). Kim Yong-sam noted that "the cooperation of the leaders of the Russian administration and parliament to forge a new era of regional peace will also help promote peace throughout the world". The president said that through an extensive dialogue with President Yeltsin this morning he was convinced that Korea and Russia could be "trusted partners in quest of greater shared prosperity well into the 21st century". According to the president, both states should cooperate to ensure the success of the reform policies now being pursued in both lands. Kim Yong-sam expressed hope that his current visit will boost Russian-Korean cooperation that "will make us even better neighbours". He reminded that the two-way trade jumped from only 900 million USD in 1990 to 1.6 billion last year. Korea's businesses have invested 24 million USD in 25 development projects in Russia, and as of March 1994, 29 major Korean companies had established branch offices in Russia. Touching upon the situation on the Korean peninsula, the president noted that "it is imperative to resolve international suspicions about North Korea's nuclear development programme as quickly as possible" adding that "without a decisive solution of the nuclear issue, it will be impossible to preserve peace not only on the Korean peninsula but also in Asia as a whole". "If and when the nuclear issue is settled, the Republic of Korea is ready and willing to provide economic support to North Korea to help it rebuild its tattered economy and carry out reform", Kim Yong-sam stressed. The president appealed to members of the Russian parliament to actively cooperate to solve the North Korean nuclear issue. The president cited well-known verses by Russian poet Fedor Tyutchev: "Russia cannot be grasped by reason... It can only be trusted". Emphasizing the last line of the poem, the president said that he trusted that "the rise of a stable and prosperous new Russia will signal the beginning of a new era of universal prosperity of not only the Russian people themselves but also of all Asians and all mankind".
