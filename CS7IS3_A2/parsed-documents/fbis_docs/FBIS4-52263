Kang Yong-hun, president of the South Korean Red Cross, said in an address at a ceremony marking "World Red Cross Day" that exchanges of hometown visits by aged parents between South and North Korea should be realized as soon as possible. "And the South-North Red Cross talks should be resumed at an early date," Kang said. The 10th main talks of the South and North Korean Red Cross were held in December 1985. North Korea rejected the 11th talks, urging the South to stop staging "Team Spirit," the annual joint South Korean-U.S. military exercise. An estimated 10 million people in South Korea have family members in the North who they were forced to leave behind during the 1950-53 Korean war. "North Korea should keep its word, first of all that it will return crew members of the 'Tongjin-ho,' a South Korean fishing ship," Kang said. Son Song-pil, chairman of the North Korean Red Cross, sent a telephone message to the South on Jan. 21, 1987, saying the crew of the Tongjin-ho would be returned. The Tongjin-ho and its 12 crew members were captured by North Korean ships on Jan. 15, 1987, about 28 miles northwest of Paengnyong Island in the West Sea. Kang emphasized that to solve these problems, consultations between the South and North should be realized as soon as possible, urging Pyongyang to give a positive answer. The South Korean Red Cross is studying ways to propose the 11th main talks of the South-North Red Cross after waiting for Pyongyang's reaction.
