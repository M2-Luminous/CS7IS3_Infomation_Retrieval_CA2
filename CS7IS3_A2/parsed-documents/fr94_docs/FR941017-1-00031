ACTION: Proposed rule; reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reopening to November 16, 1994, the comment period for a proposed rule that appeared in the Federal Register of July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36379). The document proposed to revise the guidelines for voluntary nutrition labeling of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish; revise the definition for compliance with respect to adherence by retailers to those guidelines; and revise the labeling regulations and labeling values for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruit, vegetables, and fish. This action is in response to the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. In addition, the document solicited comments on all aspects of the FDA data base review process. FDA is taking this action in response to several requests for an extension of the comment period. DATES: Written comments by November 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments, data, or information to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jean A.T. Pennington, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;165), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;205&hyph;5434. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36379), FDA issued a proposed rule to adopt regulations to revise the guidelines for voluntary labeling of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish. The agency also published a correction document on July 21, 1994 (59 FR 37190), to correct an inadvertent error in the proposal. Interested persons were given until September 16, 1994, to comment on the proposal. FDA has received several requests from trade associations for an extension of the comment period in order to better review the proposal and prepare comments. Most requests ask for a 30-day extension. After careful review of these requests, FDA has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow additional time for comments. With the additional period, the agency is providing more than 90 days for comments. FDA considers that this amount of time should be more than ample for interested persons to complete and submit their comments. Accordingly, the agency is reopening the comment period to November 16, 1994. Interested persons may, on or before November 16, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: October 6, 1994. Fred R. Shank, Director, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
