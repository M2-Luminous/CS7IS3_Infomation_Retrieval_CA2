The loans granted totaled 342.013 billion bolivares on 18 March. According to the latest report on weekly indicators, the BCV statements show the Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund [Fondo de Garantia de Depositos y Proteccion Bancaria-- Fogade] received most of that amount, or 308 billion bolivares, to be granted in turn for financial assistance to Banco Hipotecario de Occidente and seven banking institutions having problems of liquidity. The BCV has loaned 35.435 billion bolivares directly to commercial banks in the form of anticipated payments, discounts and securities borrowing, and by regular methods of loan assistance. During the second week of March, mortgage banks required 270 million bolivares, whereas financial corporations did not require direct aid. During the previous week, the nominal increase was 29.698 billion bolivares, because by 11 march the BCV's loan assistance was 312.314 billion bolivares; 35.085 billion bolivares went to commercial banks, and 276.959 billion bolivares went to public institutions, a segment in which Fogade is included. At the start of January, the BCV's outlook for loan assistance was totally different. By 1 January granted loans totaled 29.073 billion bolivares. Banks had barely needed 23.128 billion bolivares, whereas public institutions needed 5.945 billion bolivares. The financial crisis, heightened by the closure and intervention of Banco Latino, absorbed 1,000 percent more than the figure registered in January. More precisely, the aid went up 1.076 percent. Requests for money in general decreased during the week of 18 March, in relation to the week of 11 March, as BCV officials reported when they explained the results of their studies on the institution's activities during the past period: "BCV's actions were aimed at lending credit aid, directly and through Fogade, to institutions that have problems of liquidity, although to a lesser degree than during the preceding week." Regarding Other Operations The BCV concentrated on selling zero coupon bonds [bonos cero cupon] and did so in record amounts for the ones with the regular 91-day validity and even, for the first time in 1994, for the ones valid for 184 days. Furthermore, it placed Government Treasury notes into private operations. Liquidity during the week studied by the BCV increased by 1.3 percent, due to a 1.4-percent increase in cash deposits [depositos a la vista] and a 2.8-percent increase in savings. The monetary base increased .7 percent due to the "incidence of expansion" created by Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation's internal financial effort and the financial institution's credit aid, "all of which was not compensated in the base absorption carried out by the institution through open market operations and the sale of foreign exchange." Commercial banks' acquisitioning and placing of assets increased at the same 1.3-percent rate during the week. Concerning investments, clients preferred cash deposits, which increased 3.4 percent. [figure as published] In contrast, long-term certificates decreased 1.1 percent.
