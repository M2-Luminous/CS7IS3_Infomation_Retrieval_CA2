"Now they don't know what to plant. At first prices rose, but then the granaries were opened and they got more confused," the assistant governor of Sichuan province, Xu Zhongmin, said. Wheat prices have fallen 5 percent in Sichuan since the state intervened to ensure supplies of cheap food in the cities, Xu said. "There is a limit to what the city people can stand. But at some point you've got to consider the interests of farmers and how to spark their enthusiasm." Speaking after a weekend seminar in Shenzhen, Xu admitted stability remained a problem among Sichuan's 90 million peasants. "Their mood is relatively stable now, but we're still taking measures to resolve problems which cropped up," he said. Last June peasants in Renshou county, south of Chengdu, rioted over fees imposed on them to build a new road. Beijing subsequently criticised Sichuan leaders for their failure to pay adequate attention to the rural situation. "We've fired a whole bunch of cadres in Renshou since then, and told the rest to change their impatient and harsh approach to dealing with the farmers," Xu said. "This wasn't a big thing--there were only about four or five people who created the disturbance--but it caught the attention of the central government and that made it important." Efforts to hold extra fees charged by local governments to within 5 percent of incomes had been "basically successful", he said. Of the five phrases that make up Beijing's latest slogan for government work in 1994, Xu said Sichuan was concentrating on the one that says "guarantee stability". In line with Beijing's new policy on agriculture, Sichuan leaders were focusing their attention on raising bottomline incomes of farmers, he said. On average, farmers in Sichuan earned a meagre 695 renminbi (HK$617) last year, less than a third of urban incomes in the province. The urban-rural gap continued to widen, with rural incomes growing at 9 percent, compared to 20 percent in cities. Xu said the province was aiming to boost per capita rural incomes by Rmb80 to Rmb100 this year, through a mixture of price reforms and outright income supplements. Boosting rural incomes also depends on developing the province's township enterprises, which employed about 8 million people last year. This would not only help stabilise the mood of farmers, according to Xu, but would also draw in more foreign investment. "We always claim to have a huge market. But if the peasants remain poor it's not worthwhile--it becomes a false market," he said. Part of the plan relies on encouraging farmers to leave the land. Sichuan "exports" more than 5 million workers to other provinces every year. This "Sichuan army" earned the province Rmb5bn in remittances last year, Xu said. Another 5 million farmers leave the land every year for towns and cities in the province. "We have a rule of thumb that one peasant who leaves the land can support a whole family," Xu said. "We support this kind of thing." But with resignation and uncharacteristic frankness, Xu admitted he was slightly out of touch with Sichuan's rural situation. "It's such a big province that I lack a deep understanding of the situation," he said. "It's especially hard for a provincial leader to know when some local cadres are committing errors. It could take us many months to find out."
