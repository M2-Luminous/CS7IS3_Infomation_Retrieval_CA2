Not one of the versions proposed Wednesday morning was passed. In fact, two approaches were considered: The first included a political assessment of the situation which has taken shape in the country and which was noted in the president's message itself; the second without a political preamble, consisted exclusively of the decree section which speaks of proposals to the Russian Federation Government for overcoming the socioeconomic crisis in the country and of the Duma's plans in the same area. The first version was insisted on by the Communists, the Agrarians, "New Regional Policy," and the "Russian Path" deputies' group. The second version was insisted on by "Russia's Choice" and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord. The distribution of votes which has taken shape in all the principal ballots is such that none of the sides can count on a "clear victory." But preliminary accords are still proliferating in the sessions. It is, in general, not difficult to calculate why. The political preamble is essentially perceived as an "indictment" of those who have supported and implemented the reforms in Russia over the past two years. It is also clear that "Russia's Choice" will never agree to the prospect of the revival of "state management of a mixed economy." If we read through both texts carefully, then, with the exception of the aforementioned preamble, we will not find many differences between them. Except that there is an appendix to the "political" version with an approximate list of laws of paramount state importance. Among the 22 draft laws the law "On State Policy in the Sphere of Defense and the Country's Security" is placed seventh in terms of significance. The litigant sides will most likely have to make a compromise in the very near future. If only because the document itself -- the decree on the Russian Federation president's message -- will hardly be of great applied significance. The deputies themselves said as much. It turns out that the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly is still continuing to expend its energy on exclusively political debates and is not able to switch to a concrete list of the laws which the country is awaiting with enviable patience.
