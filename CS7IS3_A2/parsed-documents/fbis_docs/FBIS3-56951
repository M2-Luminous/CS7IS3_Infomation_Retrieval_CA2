[Krietov] How were Russian relations with the DPRK and the ROK in 1993? [Yakovlev] Relations between Russia and the two Koreas were developed in various areas last year. Let us recall what Russia has inherited from the former Soviet Union. Relations between Russia and the DPRK have been complex and painful. The ROK has treated us with a certain suspicion [ilchonghan pulsin]. Seoul did not understand how Russia would develop and how Russia's development would effect the situation on the Korean peninsula. What did we do last year? Russia and the DPRK reassessed the grounds of relations between the two in 1993. The reassessment was made on the line of big changes in Russia, the Korean peninsula, and all over the world. We have dissolved the DPRK's misgivings that Russia would take a biased policy while adhering to the ROK's view on South-North dialogue. We are working with Pyongyang in political and economic areas and help in removing obstacles to South-North relations. Deputy Foreign Minister Kunadze visited Pyongyang last year as a special envoy of the Russian president. During this visit, Russia and the DPRK agreed to amend treaties on and legal grounds of relations between the two countries, including the 1961 Russia-DPRK treaty, and to resume and activate contacts between the two countries' foreign ministries, including contacts in the United Nations. In 1993, Russia and the DPRK signed a treaty on scientific and technological cooperation and a treaty on cooperation in the fishery area. They have continued mutual cooperation in the DPRK lumbering business in the Russian territories. I emphasize that this is complementary [sangho powanjok] cooperation. We will continue such cooperation based on the amended grounds. We are generally satisfied with the development of relations between Russia and the ROK. We have developed practical [silmujok] cooperation based on the grounds of relations between the two countries. We remember that a treaty that secures a new atmosphere [sae chuserul hwakposikinun choyak], a lump-sum economic agreement, and a series of important documents, and a series of other important documents between Russia and the ROK were signed when President Yeltsin visited Seoul in November 1992. We continued political dialogue with the new ROK administration of President Kim Yong-sam last year. Based on our mutual political understanding, we have solved even problems rooted in the past. When I say this, I have a series of problems, including the one involving the ROK airliner, which was shot down in 1983, in mind. Another series of problems, including the one involving the burial of radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan, have not yet been solved. We highly assess ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit to Russia in the summer of 1993. During this visit, Russia and the ROK confirmed their mutual interest in the results of Russia-ROK relations in various fields, the same view Russia and the ROK hold on many world and business issues, and each other's willingness to cooperate in resolving those issues. It is more important, however, that contacts of people, including sportsmen, art groups, businesses, and scholars, have become more active. This reinforced the atmosphere of mutual trust not only on the official level but also between the people of Russia and the ROK. A schedule of cultural cooperation for 1994 has been signed. This has increased the possibility of learning the history, culture, and traditions of each other's country. Relations between scientific and educational organizations of the two countries have been promoted comprehensively, and contacts between the two countries' scientific academic organizations. Scientific and technological cooperation has also rapidly been developed. Hundreds of Russian experts and scholars are working in the ROK, and many ROK experts are in Russia. [(Yakovlev) continues] An important aspect of relations between Russia and the ROK is economics. Regrettably, the relations had a difficult time last year due to the adverse economic situation in Russia and decreases in production in the ROK. The volume of trade of goods between the two countries amounted to $1.5 billion. We plan to start 25 large-scale projects this year after overcoming difficulties facing economic cooperation. They include construction of an ROK industrial complex in the Nakhodka free economic zone and a gas pipeline between Russia and the ROK via the DPRK. [Krieto] How do you assess the overall situation on the Korean peninsula? [Yakovlev] The situation on the Korean peninsula is very complicated. Pyongyang and Seoul signed the Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression, and Exchange and Cooperation in February 1990. North-South talks and premiers contacts started. Regrettably, they discontinued soon because the disagreement on mutual inspections and the Washington-Seoul decision to resume the Team Spirit military exercise. This issue is now being resolved in the course of talks between Washington and Pyongyang. We demand that the talks be concluded with success. Russia resolutely opposes nuclear weapons proliferation in any form, and we oppose the emergence of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. Safeguards are necessary to prevent the emergence of nuclear weapons. Safeguards will be ensured when the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] rules are adhered to strictly. We demand that all (?problems) between the DPRK and the IAEA be resolved completely without specific national circumstances being considered. We fully support the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, signed by the DPRK and the ROK. We think this declaration will give impetus to Seoul-Pyongyang talks on denuclearization. Russia, China, the United States, Japan, and other countries concerned must promote a favorable environment for denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, alleviating tension, and promoting North-South trust. [Krieto] What do you think of the future of relations between Russia and the ROK? [Yakovlev] It is time Russia and the ROK start carrying out the various large-scale projects that were agreed on during President Yeltsin's visit to the ROK. We are looking forward to new summit talks in Moscow this year. We must hold the talks based on results from the implementation of the previous agreements. We plan to develop cooperation with the DPRK, first, in the economic field. The two countries must form a joint committee on the treaties existing between them. We must [word indistinct] an organization for regular negotiations on urgent issues on the Korean peninsula and restructure the DPRK's debt to Russia, which amounts to over 3 billion rubles at 1990 prices. The repayment of the debt is not an issue that can be resolved in a year but must be resolved based on more efficient forms of economic cooperation. Collectivization of agriculture [words indistinct] is one of them. Experts say we can pool the potential of the DPRK, ROK, China, and Russia to develop natural resources, build social infrastructures in Russia's Far East, and develop the Tumen River estuary bordering Russia, China, and Korea. Russia's policy toward the Korean peninsula has also focused on improving North-South relations. As President Yeltsin has said, the North and South hold the key to national reunification. An important task of Russia's policy is to help the DPRK and ROK use it. No doubt, Russia's interests on the Korean peninsula can be promoted when Russia maintains normal good-neighbor relations with the North and South.
