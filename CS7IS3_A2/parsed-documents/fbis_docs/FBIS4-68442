Gaydar and B. Fedorov, the mass media reported that the corps of directors had come to power, that the government would carry out its will, and consequently, that an end had been put to the reforms in Russia. What was the basis for such conclusions? It would be better to make a judgment on industrial policy based on the actual relationships between the government and enterprise directors, not on the basis of theoretical arguments. In this connection, their meeting in an expanded collegium of the Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy was significant. The directors of the basic sector of domestic industry--metallurgy--and a number of government officials headed by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets held a dialogue which did not conform to what has been described by our SMI [mass media], let us say frankly. The directors did not speak as the opponents of reforms. The government was in no hurry to compliment "the generals of industry." This was a meeting of pragmatists, first of all. Essentially all the problems facing the Russian economy are concentrated in enterprises of the country's metallurgical complex, because they are the ones who have incurred the largest expenditures for energy consumption, locked in all the country's mining and 25 percent of the coal industry, and taken over a substantial part of the output of the machinebuilding complex and the electrical engineering industry, and so forth. These problems must be resolved, because without the metallurgical industry, the Russian economy cannot be reformed any further: metallurgy is the foundation on which all industry stands. The country's basic and most important sector is in crisis today, and no matter how painful its manifestations are, searching for those at fault for this situation in the central departments in Moscow is unlikely to be correct. And not only because metallurgy is always the focus of close attention by the government (it is sufficient to remember that the government examined stabilization of the work of a number of subsectors of the metallurgical complex on several occasions last year), but primarily because today metallurgical enterprises are independent subjects of economic activity and subjects of the market. And they should operate independently. But it seems to me that many metallurgical enterprise managers have not realized this fact yet, and have not completely adapted themselves to conditions in an economy which is being reformed. There are reasons for this. Centralization in industry, for which ministries were used as a tool in the USSR, was probably most apparent in enterprises subordinate to the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy and Ministry of Nonferrous Metallurgy. Let us remember how the ministers "trained" the directors in selective conferences. The commands are still fresh in most of their minds: "Stop production--give the converted metal back to the cooperatives... Discontinue domestic deliveries--set aside so many metric tons for export, so many for the Ministry of Defense..." We were trained to work by command and in accordance with volume indicators, and although 2 or 3 years ago we were studying the work of foreign firms and invited the presidents of concerns and representatives of joint-stock companies who have been working under market conditions all their lives, we have not been able to develop anything similar to their system of management. We denationalized property and formed shareholding enterprises, and we essentially limited ourselves to this. After acquiring a basis for independent economic operation, we began setting prices ourselves. Transport workers set rates which, from their point of view, were the best possible to maintain the sector. Can the prices for energy resources be called abnormal if the power engineers set them freely, guided by the very specific situation in which they found themselves? Ask any manager in the Ministry of Fuel and Energy about this, and he will say that all the prices for electric power announced for consumers through the RAO [Russian Joint-Stock Company] "YeES Rossiya" are based on the cost of the metal, coal, and so on. But as a result we arrived at a situation in which no one can do anything: everyone owes each other. Who has to set up a system for payments between enterprises, in accordance with laws drafted by the government, of course? The Ministry of Finance? Of course not. Who has to ensure that the banks, whose founders are engaged in economic operations, provide for effective demand? The government? Also no. We have to say frankly that a management system has not been created in metallurgy. A Committee on Metallurgy has been established, and it performs a great deal of useful work in shaping government policy with respect to the sector, but metallurgists have not been able to come to agreement among themselves. Beginning with the mining enterprises, through all the production conversions right down to the fourth process stage, there are absolutely no financial relationships--those relationships which can establish and maintain the necessary production ties in any situation--among the subjects engaged in economic operations. A management system is able to identify the common interests of enterprises and unify them, not in accordance with a formal characteristic, but because of their economic, financial, and property linkage. It is precisely this link which is traced in the classical structure of any Western concern associated with metallurgy, whether it is a technological or multisectorial association. It is precisely this link which creates additional interest for the producer and is the stimulus for production. Until we establish it, it is very difficult to speak about stopping the manifestations of the crisis at some stage. We are now attempting to unite the interests of miners and metallurgists, miners and transport workers, aluminum producers and power engineers, and we are speaking about cartel agreements, which may be only natural for economic subjects in the current stage from the viewpoint of tariffs, and on the other hand, from the viewpoint of prices for finished products. But this kind of agreement remains on paper if its participants make a stand for their narrow interests and are oriented not toward the final ton on which each one's profit is calculated, not toward the production cycle as a whole and all the processing stages, right up to completion of the end product, but only toward the stage associated with their direct activity. Civilized approaches to relationships between economic subjects are well-known in the world, and we have to develop them as well if we do not want to return to the old system, which should be ruled out completely today. We must not go back to the command system, but forward, toward a financial system of management. Today we cannot pay for Kazakhstan coal for the Magnitogorsk, Nizhniy Tagil, and Orsk-Khalilovo combines, for chromium ore for Chelyabinsk and Serov, and we cannot count on Ukrainian enterprises... We should not think that we can get along without that part of the raw material and production base which was left with the near abroad after the collapse of the USSR, and that Russia is in a position to restore everything that it lost. According to our estimates, this would cost the country $12 billion. Will the taxpayer understand us if we ask him to pay such a sum? Of course not. Based on professional knowledge of technological production facilities and experience in personal relationships, it is incumbent upon us to restore ties and reactivate a unified metallurgicl complex, but only through financial relationships, which should become the basis for the system of metallurgy management which we have to create. I am following how the situation in our economy is being interpreted in the West. There they say the Central Bank is chiefly at fault for the lack of the results needed in the reform, because it supposedly is extending credit to state enterprises. But this is not the case. We have to acknowledge the complete absence of a state system for increasing investment activity. Metallurgy, like a number of other sectors, was given substantial benefits related to customs duties, export operations, and currency deductions last year. But these benefits did nothing to increase investment activity: because of the crisis in effective demand, a substantial part of the funds released were directed to the consumption fund. Unfortunately, we do not hear the voice of enterprise managers, and they have to raise questions about costs in the government's work, credit and financial problems, and on both tax and pricing problems, that is, on key questions where the government has to work out the basic rules of the game in accordance with which economic subjects should interact between themselves and with the state. The most important subject for our economic policy is the change of enterprises to shareholding, which should produce definite results in the activity of each economic subject; the urgent task of organizing a banking system is extremely important as well. The government can resolve all these matters only with the help of our specialists. We will not find any others who know domestic metallurgy and understand the problems facing it.
