Commenting today on Sha'ban's confession, Hamid said there is another piece of evidence proving that Libya is not involved in the bombing: The president of the Swiss company that produced the timer used in the bombing retracted his testimony, on the basis of which Libya was condemned. Hamid said the Arab League dealt with the Libyan-Western crisis objectively and rationally in accordance with the UN and Arab League Charters. He said the Arab League's proposal that the two Libyan suspects be tried by a Scottish panel of judges in the International Court of Justice in The Hague was meant as a chance for a fair trial based on the legal rule that the suspect is innocent until proven guilty. Hamid described the West's solid rejection of any peaceful solutions to the crisis as lacking in an objective justification.
