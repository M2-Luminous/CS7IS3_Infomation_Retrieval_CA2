Kirsteins said he was surprised by the "theatrical performance the Latvian government staged" to protest Yeltsin's decision. In Kirsteins' words, Russia has never regarded its radar station at Skrunda in Latvia as a military institution but it always considered it as a military base. In this context, Yeltsin's statement is not surprising. On the other hand, it is characteristic of the Russian government to issue inadequate statements to see reaction of other countries to them, Kirsteins said. Such statements are retracted afterwards, he said.
