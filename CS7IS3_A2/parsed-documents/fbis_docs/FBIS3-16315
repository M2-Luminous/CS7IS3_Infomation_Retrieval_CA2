The program is devoted to former President Nixon's visit to Moscow. Dorenko says it was intimated to Nixon that he could not see Yeltsin because Yeltsin was busy. He adds that Yeltsin himself spoke of this prior to his departure for a two-week vacation in Sochi. Yeltsin is then shown being interviewed at the airport. He says: "My leave simply means that my work routine is altered somewhat. Of course you are able to have walks, to go for strolls, to have a rest, but, at the same time, you are also able to work. "All the same, I am in control of the situation; I mean the position and the state of affairs in the whole of Russia. I monitor it constantly, as it were, not just every day, but several times a day. Relevant leaders report to me and that is why if anything comes up, I will fly back forthwith. However, it is not currently thought that any upsets might materialize and that is why I am flying in a rather calm mood. "As for my work -- yes, all the time I work on something serious for the future. Currently the work is this: the mechanism of the implementation of the presidential address to the Federal Assembly; that is to say, the address is one thing, but the matter of its implementation point by point, especially where the statehood dimension is concerned, and so on, and so on, and so forth, well, there must be a schedule for this, as you would have for a monthly day-by-day plan of action, as it were."
