The scientists, from the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, came to this conclusion based on a survey of southern Jiangsu's Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou. According to associate research fellow Huang Wenxin, who was in charge of the research project, southern Jiangsu covers an area of 17,500 sq km and has a population of 13 million. Its gross domestic product last year jumped by at least tenfold over 1979, when China began its rural reform, and its economic development speed ranks first among the country's rural areas. According to the latest statistics, the proportion of industry in this area rose to 90 percent last year and that of the non-rural labor force to 80 percent. The annual farmers' income last year averaged more than 2,000 yuan per capita, and the standard of farm machinery and irrigation in more than one half of the counties and cities had already caught up with that of the economically-developed countries. At present, southern Jiangsu is promoting its rural modernization by setting up more industrial and commercial zones, rural residential quarters and farmland-protection areas.
