In spite of Alhaji Koromah's protestations, it seems very few of his men are left in his old headquarters at Tubmanburg following Roosevelt Johnson's recent assault on the town, and the peacekeeping force, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] has been accused of siding with Johnson. Well, yesterday, Roosevelt Johnson called us to say that Alhaji Koromah has now been finally and irreversibly ousted as ULIMO leader. Today, Alhaji Koromah called us from Conakry to repeat allegations against ECOMOG. Robin White asked him what he had to say: [Begin recording] [Koromah] We are asking the field commander of ECOMOG to immediately withdraw his forces -- Nigerian forces that are in ULIMO territory -- because they have contravened the Cotonou accord by engaging in active combat against us, along with the dissidents. [White] What exactly are you accusing the ECOMOG troops of doing? [Koromah] In fact, I got word from my commander by radio communication that the iman of Tubmanburg, Imam Mohamed Sheriff, who sought refuge at the ECOMOG base in Tubmanburg, has been found dead. Secondly, another commander of ULIMO, Brother Allen, was taken by the Nigerian ECOMOG, tortured -- his bodyguards killed -- and asked as to where we were getting our arms and ammunition from. [White] Have you now fled to Guinea? [Koromah] You have interviewed me many times from Conakry. I have fled to nowhere. We control six counties within Liberia, so, this is no fleeing. In fact, from here I will be touring a couple of other countries that contributed to ECOMOG. [White] But you couldn't get to Tubmanburg today. [Koromah] Today, no; it is not on may schedule. [White] But you wouldn't be able to go there at all. [Koromah] Well, it's the insecurity in times of fighting. Obviously it will not be prudent to go and sit in the middle of the fighting and be a target just to prove that you are in control or you are brave. That will be stupid. [White] How many men do you still have with you? [Koromah] I have the entire ULIMO, beside the dissidents. You should be asking those who are fighting how many couple of hundred men we have! We have more than nine, 10, 11 thousand ULIMO soldiers, and you ought to know that Lofa alone has six to seven thousand ULIMO soldiers! [White] Mr. Koromah, if they only have a couple of hundred men, why have they managed to drive you out of Tubmanburg? [Koromah] Well, if you were listening to me, you wouldn't ask that question. I just told you that these people are fighting along with active combat Nigerians, and they're using heavy artillery and other things, and they never drove us out of Tubmanburg! [White] They say that they've sacked you as ULIMO leader. [Koromah] Well, I mean they want to kill me, so we shouldn't be surprised to hear them say they sacked me. Somebody wants your head, he's talking about sacking. They don't have legitimacy, territorially, militarily, and otherwise to sack anybody anywhere. So, they cannot be recognized by any international organization. These are dissident groups that are fighting. My only concern here is that we do not want the peacekeepers to continue to get involved with it. [end recording]
