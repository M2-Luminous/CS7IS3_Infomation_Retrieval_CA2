FBIS4-47914 "drafr088_a_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-088 Daily Report 5 May 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Burundi Premier Interviewed on Nyangoma's `Disappearance' Premier Interviewed on Nyangoma's `Disappearance' LD0505153894 Paris Radio France International in French 1230 GMT 5 May 94 LD0505153894 Paris Radio France International French BFN [Text] Has Leonard Nyangoma, minister of the interior and of security, been dismissed in Burundi, or did he resign, as was originally believed? The question remains unanswered. As we know, Nyangoma is a hard-liner of the Front for Democracy in Burundi [Frodebu], and the government recently distanced itself from his remarks. Muriel Pomponne put some questions to the Burundi prime minister, and Anatole Kanyenkiko contented himself with answering that he has not seen his interior minister for a long time: [Begin recording] [Kanyenkiko] The minister ended his mission on 25 April, and we note that he has not yet returned. This situation is quite awkward because we do not know the reasons for this delay. [Pomponne] If Mr. Nyangoma has not returned, could he be considered to have resigned? [Kanyenkiko] I note that he is putting himself in the position of deserting of his post, but I hope he does not go as far as that. It is not a question of dismissal. The government's policy combines a return to peace and security and collaboration with all political partners and all authorities, and if someone sets himself against this, then he is thwarting the government's policy and the government's policy has to be credible. [Pomponne] Do you consider that Mr. Nyangoma has sometimes gone against the government line? [Kanyenkiko] Yes, as you will have noted in his remarks. [Pomponne] Do you consider that he is one of the instigators behind the armed militias in the northern regions of the capital? [Kanyenkiko] With regard to this question, we leave it up to the judicial system to shed light on this matter. All we can tell you is that today the disarmament operation has borne fruit in so far as Kamenge, Kinama, and Cibitoke have become calm once again and normal activities have resumed. [end recording]
