The President Begins a Realignment of Forces"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The president's unwillingness to turn to the Constitutional Court (the sole body with the power to overrule the Duma's resolution) suggests that his attitude to the amnesty decision is not as negative as some of his associates (Sergey Filatov and others) make out. This version is also corroborated by the fact that all measures to prevent the execution of the sacramental resolution came a little late in the day. Indeed the Duma made its amnesty decision on 23 February while the president's response (letters to speaker Rybkin and General Prosecutor Kazannik) did not come out until the 26th. Of course, such a belated reaction can be attributed to the general lack of coordination in the presidential services and their unreadiness for such a turn of events (although it is very hard to describe the Duma's decision as totally unexpected). Yet it can be supposed that all these "impeding" actions on Yeltsin's part are no more than an artful stage production devised not only to prevent an investigation which is unwanted by the president, but first, to demonstrate to the radical democrats the president's solidarity with their position; and second, to facilitate Aleksey Kazannik's transfer from the General Prosecutor's Office to the Constitutional Court. It this is correct, Yeltsin's acceptance of Kazannik's resignation is not a sign of disgrace but only part of a calculated plot. It is not ruled out that the aura of a principled and independent man will help Kazannik take the vacant seat of the Constitutional Court chairman. (It should be noted parenthetically that Aleksey Ilyushenko, currently acting prosecutor general, can hardly ever become an object of such a complex intrigue. His political reputation is quite certain: He is a former member of the Interagency Anti-Corruption Commission which charged Rutskoy with signing some compromising documents). To be sure, the State Duma's amnesty decision hardly pleased the president. Signs are, however, that the upper hand was gained by those members of the presidential team who maintained that the "Octobrists" are much more dangerous in the symbolic image of martyrs than as real political figures. The complaints by the radical democrats who treat this action as a step toward civil war appear unsubstantiated. After all, the amnesty decision does not restore the political power duality September 1993-style but only increases the number of opposition leaders by a few men. The liberation of Anpilov and Konstantinov will hardly consolidate the opposition and inspire it to take to new barricades. The performance by these political figures in September and October aroused criticism even among Yeltsin's forthright opponents while the associations led by them -- the National Salvation Front and Working Russia -- are now in a profound organizational crisis. As for Aleksandr Rutskoy, as a politician he certainly enjoys great authority. But it should be remembered that he became leader of the whole opposition and a real alternative to Yeltsin by virtue of his high post, in the extreme situation of a coup d'etat. Now opposition politicians (Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, and Baburin) should see him rather as a potential rival: According to people close to Rutskoy, he intends not only to return to politics but even to contest presidential elections.
