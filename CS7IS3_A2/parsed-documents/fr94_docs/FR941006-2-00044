FR941006-2-00044 FR941006-2-00031 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [FRL&hyph;5088&hyph;1] Acid Rain Program: Draft Permits and Permit Modification AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of draft permits and permit modification. SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing for comment one draft substitution plan and five draft nitrogen oxides (NOx) compliance plans for two utility plants in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR parts 72 and 76). DATES: Comments on the draft permits and modification must be received on or before November 7, 1994 or the date of publication of a similar notice in a local newspaper, whichever is later. ADDRESSES: Administrative Records. The administrative record for the draft compliance plans, except information protected as confidential, may be viewed during normal operating hours at EPA Region 5, Ralph H. Metcalfe Federal Bldg., 77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, IL 60604. Comments. Send comments, requests for public hearings, and requests to receive notice of future actions to EPA Region 5 (A&hyph;18J), Air and Radiation Division, Attn: David Kee, Director (address above). Submit all comments in duplicate and identify the compliance plan to which the comments apply, the commenter's name, address, and telephone number, and the commenter's interest in the matter and affiliation, if any, to the owners and operators of all units covered by the plan. All timely comments will be considered, except comments on aspects of the permit other than the compliance plan and comments not relevant to the compliance plan. Hearings. To request a public hearing, state the issues proposed to be raised in the hearing. EPA may schedule a hearing if EPA finds that it will contribute to the decision-making process by clarifying significant issues affecting a compliance plan. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Contact Genevieve Nearmyer, (312) 353&hyph;4761. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated final rules implementing the SO 2 portion of the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing the substitution and reduced utilization issues. In today's action, EPA proposes to approve substitution and NOx compliance plans and include them in final permits for the following utility plants consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement and 40 CFR part 76: Petersburg in Indiana: one substitution plan for 1995, in which units 1 and 2 designate H T Pritchard units 3 and 4 as substitution units; five NOx averaging plans, one for each calendar year 1995&hyph;1996 in which the actual annual average emission rates for NOx shall not exceed the alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitations of 0.60 lbs/MMBtu for unit 1, 0.44 lbs/MMBtu for unit 2, 0.41 lbs/MMBtu for unit 3, and 0.41 lbs/MMBtu for unit 4, and the actual annual heat input shall not be greater than the annual heat input limit of 10,635,000 MMBtu for unit 1, and shall not be less than the annual heat input limits of 23,670,000 MMBtu for unit 2, 36,935,000 MMBtu for unit 3, and 36,118,000 MMBtu for unit 4. The other units designated in the plans are H T Pritchard units 3, 4, 5, and 6 and Elmer W Stout units 50, 60, and 70. The designated representative is Robert A. McKnight. H T Pritchard in Indiana: 586 substitution allowances for 1995 to unit 3; 1,305 substitution allowances for 1995 to unit 4; one substitution plan for 1995 in which Petersburg units 1 and 2 designate units 3 and 4 as substitution units; five averaging plans, one for each calendar year 1995&hyph;1996 for units 3, 4, 5, and 6 in which the actual annual average emission rates for NOx shall not exceed the alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitations of 0.80 lbs/MMBtu for units 3 and 4 and 0.54 lb/MMBtu for units 5 and 6, and the actual annual heat input shall not be greater than the annual heat input limits of 1,312,000 MMBtu for unit 3, 1,883,000 MMBtu for unit 4, 2,044,000 MMBtu for unit 5, and 4,766,000 for unit 6. The other units designated in the plans are Petersburg units 1, 2, 3, and 4 and Elmer W Stout units 50, 60, and 70. The designated representative is Robert A. McKnight. Dated: October 4, 1994.
