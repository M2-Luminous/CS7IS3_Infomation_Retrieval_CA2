They must respect the people; listen to them; improve their work performance; and fight against corruption, authoritarianism, and bureaucracy. That will increase public trust to the government and the regime. Government officials must be trained in their work, management skills, and legal knowledge. The government must work with mass organizations to contain and eliminate sucessfully social vices, and safeguard social and political stabilization. Life in mountainous areas is still very difficult and backward. Public relation work in ethnic-inhabited areas is still weak. We must pay proper attention to economic development and social issues in mountainous areas by opening schools in every mountain village, rebuilding schools under deterioration, eliminating the situation of teaching different grades in the same classroom, and reducing malaria, gout, leprosy, and tuberculosis... We must stop the imbalance between economic development and social advancement. Government and mass organizations must coordinate their socioeconomic duties. The relation between the government and mass organizations is not a relation in which the government is always helping mass organizations. It must be understood that the government can only accomplish its duties, especially in movements to "eliminate starvation and reduce poverty" with the great support fo mass organizations. These movements must help poor families and families who rendered meritorious service to the country. These movements must also carry out other socioeconomic projects. Government Decision No. 163 about the relation between the government and the Vietnam Women's Union is an example of coordination. The two sides must actively remind one another about the need for good cooperation and high efficiency in their work. 3. Renovating the working contents and methods for fatherland fronts and mass organizations to match their new duties is a necessary task. In the new situation with a new economic structure, the people will not accept fatherland fronts and mass organizations' ideas and programs of action if they do not meet their legitimate interests and aspirations. Realizing this, the sixth party Central Committee resolution on mass motivation work confirmed: "The work of mass organizations is to unite their members to look after their own practical interests, contribute to the national cause, and construct and protect the revolutionary government". President Ho Chi Minh said: "Mass organizations are organs of the masses, fight for the masses, protect the masses' interests, and closely connect with the masses and the government." (Ho Chi Minh Collected Works, Volume 5, page 393) The people's interests must be guaranteed and stipulated in the legal system. At the same time, their interests must also be guaranteed by a system of mass organizations, in which, the position, role, and function of each mass organization must be guaranteed by the law. The mass organizations must perform their best functions and duties to guarantee the people's benefits. A. Fatherland fronts and mass organizations need to accelerate their political and ideological education to improve the people's knowledge. They have to instill national pride in the public. They also have to encourage them to overcome starvation and poverty, to enrich themselves legally for a better life, and to contribute more to society. They also need to upgrade the people's education levels, morality, aesthetics, professionalism, thoughts, and working skills. They should improve information services for politics, economy, culture, and society via newspapers, radio, television, and their other means. We must upgrade the quality of the mass organization information service to ensure better dissemination of the party and state line and policy. The service must carry information suitable to particular communities and regions so the people can clearly understand the nature of the party's line and policy before they consciously observe them. On the other hand, mass media agencies must tell the truth in any situation, avoid optimism, and direct public opinion on major political events. At the same time, they should carry articles suitable to different sexes amd ages, answer daily questions, and guide the public for to lead decent, useful, and helpful lives. We must continue to construct and perfect a system which provides great effects to the public (social clubs, cultural houses, political and cultural centers, professional associations, and so forth). In order to attract more people, we must expand political activities and heighten national tradition and political awareness with social movements such as visits to former revolution bases for youths, receptions given to revolutionary prisoners sentenced to death, and public campaigns to support Cuba and victims of natural disasters. Efforts must be made to develop various scientific research institutes and investigative agencies to effectively monitor and survey public opinion and the people's aspirations to correctly formulate measures for mass mobilization work and make proposals to the state for revising and supplementing various lines and policies. We must improve activities to promote democracy and the ideological work at various mass organizations especially at the grass-roots level such as teams, chapters, work groups, families, and populated areas. We must strive to ensure that the people's thought and actions are in conformity with lines and policies of our party and those of the era. B. Activities of the Vietnam Fatherland Front [VFF] and other mass organizations must be carried out in a wide and far-reaching fashion and must be in line with the socioeconommic development task. Following the arduous protracted war for national salvation and independence, our people's forefront tasks at present are to carry out socioeconomic development program and build a bountiful and happy life for the people as President Ho Chi Minh wishes: "Our nation will regain total independence, our people will enjoy full freedom, our countrymen will lead a bountiful life and are equally entitled to proper education." To live up to mankind's advancement, we will not stop at just a moderate happly life, but we should strive to attain a bountiful life with tastes and modern facilities. This is also the urgent demand and aspiration of our people. Whether or not the VFF and other mass organizations score achievement in their activities depends on how far they can meet the people's aspirations in this regard. As for the industrial and goods circulation sectors, with the current market economic system, their production and business activities are facing serious challenges. They may experience failure, subjected to dissolvement, or can continue their operation with success, all depend on their efforts and determination. As a result, mass organizations should not cross their arms in vain and adopt a passive attitude when facing difficulties. They should, however, surge forward to participate in activities to develop their units and organizations. They should coordinate with responsible agencies to satisfactorily rearrange production, carry out projects, and apply contractual work for finished products at factories and workshops to enhance the workers' responsibility toward their work and the market; strive to diversify forms of ownership and introduce the share-holding enterprise system so as to prevent losses of state property, create more jobs for the workers, increase their income, and stabilize their daily life. Various mass organizations and societies must mobilize their members to discuss and share weal and woe with specialized production establishments to find ways and means to overcome difficulties, protect and develop capital, produce new products, change equipment, strengthen industrial production network; improve packaging, delivery, and the production of new products. Efforts must be made to find new clients and expand markets while participating in implementing the policy on developing economic components. We must actively detect shortcomings in our legal system to make proposals to the state for revising the irrational laws while striving to protect the laborers' interest. We must respect the legitimate interest and social equality of owners of establishments, oppose all illegal business activities and tax evasion. In agriculture, various mass organizations must mobilize the peasants to implement resolution no. 10 on the contractual system, promote the allocation of land for long-term use and granting of ownership over some means of production to the peasants; encourage family economy and motivate peasants to engage in fruit orchard, fish rearing, gardening, aquaculture, and the production of specialized goods. Efforts must be made to develop the assistance program among the laborers to help one another in term of crop seeds, capital, and experience to integrate them into an economic cooperative organization to work for a mutual interest. Various social associations must carry out activities to guide the peasants to improve their production, transfer new technology to peasant families, develop all potentials to produce more products to amass wealth. For instance, the Women's Union in Tuyen Quang province has participated in a movement to promote agriculture and forestry, teach the peasants on how to raise hogs by using sugarcane juice, raise milk goats, and produce biogas (by using animal manure). Moreover, they also set up women's groups (481 in number) to practice thrift, provide loans to poor members to engage in some kind of trades or production to increase income and improve their daily life. Various mass organizations must also strive to help and guide their members and the laborers to develop the family economy, produce agricultural products, develop production activities, and improve goods circulation. In cities, efforts must be made to improve work at resturants, dress-making factories, transportation, production of handicrafts, and export goods, thereby creating favorable conditions for the people to help resolve the unemployment problem and increase their incomes. While we integrate our efforts in carrying out economic development program to revolve various problems, we should pay attention on resolving the social issues. Various mass organizations and societies must pay special attention to protecting the laborers' interest because it is a great and complicated issue. Social issues and social policies are very copious. They involve jobs, food, clothing, housing, transport, education, rest and recreation, medical treatment, physical fitness, and the building of a new culture. Satisfactory resolution of this issue will have a vigorous effect on the feelings and emotions of the people and on their confidence in the party. Together with responsible organs, mass organizations must be mindful of the need to resolve employment and must hold discussions to chart new course for production activities and new work methods. This is to help maintain production and set up additional workshops to create more employment. Mass organizations must motivate the people to participate in the movement against the degradation of educational and health facilities and to respond to a fund-raising drive designed to obtain money to ensure better pay for teachers, improve academic qualities, and repair and build schools and classrooms. We must ensure the enactment of good by-laws for schools and must pay attention to organizing vocational training in general education schools. We must encourage the people to build their physical fitness and preserve their health. We must build first-aid stations and medicinal herb gardens and satisfactorily care for the welfare of public health cadres and personnel. We must motivate the people to make contributions to the causes of providing medical treatment for handicapped children and disabled people and bringing up orphans. We must motivate the people to respond to the movement for family planning and must improve the composition and quality of our diet. We must encourage and organize the people and create conditions for them to build houses in accordance with urban planning. We must promote the building of more brick houses in rural areas, build new urban areas, and ensure satisfactory repairwork for houses in various communities. We must organize democratic debates among the people so they can help formulate and comply with regulations on the safeguarding of their neighborhoods and city wards. Mass organizations must cooperate with popular defense forces and professional security police in tracking down and getting rid of hoodlums, thieves, and other social ills. We must set up security funds and incentive funds to maintain and care for popular defense forces. We must motivate the people to detect evil elements and subject them to self criticism for correctional purposes. Youth union members and youth association members must help and encourage backward people to make progess. This can be done in various forms and ways, the most important of which being the setting of good examples for other people to follow. We must encourage the people to participate in popular national defense work, ensure the fulfillment of troop recruitment targets, carry out the army's rearguard policy, using diversified methods to ensure that combatants and their families engage in national defense activities with peace of mind. We must build a sense of attachment among members of a unit and between themselves and their parent unit and must promote mutual assistance among people in cases of illness and mishaps. We must encourage giving assistance to people in the event they suffer from misfortunes, catastrophes, and illness and for those hapless families with incapacitated members. We must set up mutual assistance funds, charity funds, and retirement funds in the rural areas. Mass organizations must motivate the people to contribute their energy and money to helping the administration build public utility projects such as bridges, roads, power lines, schools, first-aid stations, communication networks, and cultural and information systems. To make a long story short, we must initiate a widespread mass movement to carry out the following programs and movements: The program to do away with hunger and ease poverty, the program to resolve employment in conjunction with efforts to develop and restructure the economy, and provide vocational training for the people, especially for youths, the program for population and family planning, the program for preliminary heath care, the expanded program for immunization, the health insurance program, the program to develop folk culture, build a civilized lifestyle and cultural households, the program to fight outmoded customs and social ills, the program for illiteracy eradication, the program for compulsory education, the movement for physical fitness, the movement to repay the kindness of those who have performed their meritorious deeds for the nation, and the charity movement. Mass organizations must cooperate in enaging in community reconciliation efforts in various residential areas. We must form reconciliation teams made up of prestigious and enthusiastic people. Meanwhile, we must make youth union members and youth association members responsible for the task of resolving differences among the people. We must motivate the people to live and work in accordance with the law. In the same token, the people must have the right to use the law as a means of self defense. We must fight against acts of coercion and injustice among government cadres and employees and against their misinterpretation of the law. In carrying out the mass motivation task, mass organizations must closely cooperate with youth union members and youth association members in motivating outside people. We must involve ourselves more fully in seeking to know the specific situation of each family and each person and the feelings, emotions, and aspirations of the people. We must talk to the people, listen to their views, and discuss the situation with them. In this way, the people will be thoroughly aware of and voluntarily comply with the party and state policies and lines. We can also discuss those policy issues that are not properly carried out. Mass organizations may ask the state to amend or revise its policies in a rational and appropriate way. Mass organizations must work toward resolving policy-related demands of the people. They must blend themselves with the people to to find out each other's similar points of views. Activities of mass organizations must be compatible with the activities and interests of the people. Mass organizations must learn from the people and be in the service of the people. They must avoid imposing their will on the people or doing anything against the aspirations of the people. Our policy system has, at certain times and in certain areas, not been compatible with realities. Given the limited capabilities of the state, mass organizations must explain this fact to the people so they can understand and live with it. We must consult with the people over our planned enforcement of policies to prevent them from feeling unhappy with our policies or the enforcement of these policies. Just as Nguyen Trai put it: "We must strive to do in such a way as to keep villages and hamlets free from angry voices," and "this will bring prosperity, peace, and happiness for all." Our people's intellectual standard has been further improved in keeping with the era of wisdoms, science and technologies. As there are many talented intellectual workers in our society who are the sons or brothers of the laboring people and who are renowned both at home and abroad, our existing mass motivation method is all the more important and will certainly develop its effect.
