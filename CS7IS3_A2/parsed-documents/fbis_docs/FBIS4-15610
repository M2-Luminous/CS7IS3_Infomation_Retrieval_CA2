First Deputy Commander of the Black Sea Fleet Vitaliy Larionov told ITAR-TASS on Monday that this information is now being checked. Black Sea Fleet leaders are still awaiting a report from the commander of a squadron of reserve ships seized in Odessa. He and his colleagues are also expected to be released. Larionov described the incidents in Odessa as unexpected, particularly because they occurred when Odessa was celebrating the 50th anniversary of its liberation from the Nazi and because civilians, including women and children, had been affected. Several were injured. "Our task is to ensure calm in the Crimea and Ukraine. We are not going to brandish arms, but we must protect our officers and their families," Larionov continued. "We could have taken more decisive measures, but we decided against it for the benefit of Russia and Ukraine as we remembered that the Black Sea Fleet is subordinated to both."
