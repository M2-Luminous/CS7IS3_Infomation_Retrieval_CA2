FBIS4-25046 "drchi107_w_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-107 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Security Police Will Pursue `Hostile' Elements Security Police Will Pursue `Hostile' Elements HK0306080494 Hong Kong CHENG MING in Chinese No 200, 1 Jun 94 p 14 HK0306080494 Hong Kong CHENG MING Chinese BFN [By Kuan Chieh (7070 2212): "CPC Vows to Come down to Hong Kong to Make Arrests"] [Text] At a national work conference of public security, state security, armed police, and judicial department chiefs (bureaus) convened in Beijing in the first half of April, the CPC made known for the first time that public security and armed police officers have the power to track down and arrest key members and ringleaders of hostile organizations outside the borders who are involved in and mastermind violence and sabotage and who agitate to overthrow the socialist system and the central people's government on the mainland. The headline sounds scary. But it is genuinely true. "Resolutely Strike at Hostile Elements Colluding with Hostile Organizations Overseas" The CPC convened from 7 to 9 April a national work conference of the heads of public security, state security, armed police, judicial departments (bureaus). High on its agenda was a resolute ban on outlawed hostile organizations and a stern crackdown on subversive activities and sabotage by hostile forces. Ren Jianxin, Luo Gan, Xiao Yang, Ba Zhongxin, Tao Siju, and others attended and addressed the conference. Ren Jianxin spoke on behalf of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and State Council: Banning and striking at organized activities to agitate and subvert the state and people's government and destroy social order by outlawed organizations and hostile forces are the main tasks in safeguarding state security, defending the constitution, and protecting social order. This is especially true for crack downs on domestic hostile forces and elements either colluding with overseas hostile political forces or those overseas who are working against China and the CPC or are in the employ of overseas hostile political forces and organizations, and this remains a key job for public security, the armed police, and judicial departments. Ren Jianxin said: As soon as something goes wrong in society or there is a slight change in the climate of the outside world, domestic hostile forces and elements will emerge and pursue agitation, sabotage, and subversion with overseas hostile forces. This is regardless of what people might think about these matters, and these forces and elements will desist because of our warnings. Agitation, sabotage, and subversion are the missions of these hostile forces. Overthrowing the socialist system and the people's government and creating chaos in tandem with the hegemonic powers' China strategies are the objectives of these hostile forces, both outside the border and overseas. "Public Security Has the Power To Track Down and Arrest Key Members of Hostile Organizations Outside the Border" Regarding "counterrevolution," the conference chose to stress and pay more attention to its substance rather than its name. The conference came to a consensus on jail term reductions, parole, and medical parole for good behavior for criminals on counterrevolutionary charges. The conference made known, for the first time, that under specifically defined circumstances, public security and armed police officers have the power to track down and arrest key members and ringleaders of hostile organizations outside the borders whose involvement in masterminding violence, sabotage, and agitation in the mainland to overthrow the socialist system and the central people's government has been proven. The Wolf Is Really Coming "Outside the borders" in CPC parlance refers to Hong Kong and Macao. If we read between the lines of the above statements and check them against the report on "a hundred Hong Kong people blacklisted" in the December 1993 edition of our journal and the "Success 240" military exercise reported in the article on the "Guangzhou Military Region's mock takeover of Hong Kong" in the February 1994 edition, which reveals that CPC public security officers have been stationed in Hong Kong since as early as 1992, and link them with the early secret visits to Hong Kong by a massive number of CPC officials, they will get a good idea of how well prepared the CPC is for the move. Lu Ping's statements on his recent visit about Hong Kong being an economic city and not a political city also foreshadows such a move! Even before the death knell of 1997, the good-natured Hong Kong people will witness the horrific drama of CPC people coming down to Hong Kong to make arrests with force. There was once a person who cried that the "wolf was coming," which turned out to be a false alarm. But this time, the wolf is really coming.
