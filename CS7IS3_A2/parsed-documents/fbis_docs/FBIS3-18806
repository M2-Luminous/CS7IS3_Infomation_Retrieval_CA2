The draft budget for next year will, however, "certainly no be adopted by parliament before the Bundestag elections (16 October)," government spokesman Dieter Vogel announced after the Cabinet meeting. However, the Federal Government will stick to the usual dates and pass the draft budget in the Cabinet at the end of June. The basis are the overall economic basic data, which have to be presented this April, and the next tax estimate in May. Vogel added: "The Cabinet is aware of the fact that extreme thrift in budget policy and in the demands of the individual ministries is necessary also for 1995." The chancellor did "not leave any doubt" as to this necessity. The Cabinet members "will take this into account when working out their plans for 1995," Vogel said.
