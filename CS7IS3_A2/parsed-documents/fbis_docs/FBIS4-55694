Even the pope emphasized during his visit to the Baltic states that "the great peoples and the small peoples must enjoy the same respect for their rights." [Walesa] Once the opposition between the two blocs, with their symbol, the Berlin Wall, had disappeared, the vision of a single Europe of free, democratic nations seemed just around the corner, a foregone conclusion. Sadly, reality has turned out to be just the opposite. Like the other Central and East European countries that have regained their freedom and sovereignty, Poland is experiencing difficulty in asserting its status as a partner on an equal footing. Our path toward European economic and security structures looks long and tortuous. European solidarity is lacking. We are running up against policies steeped in protectionism, particularly economic protectionism. It is difficult to get the West to realize that leaving our countries to their own devices may mean placing the whole of Europe in jeopardy. It may mean a relapse in the reforms. Nature abhors a vacuum, hence our campaign to widen the European security area, which in turn will only become possible with a gradual entry of the Central and East European countries into the European structures. [Svidercoschi] Is there danger of a new bipolarity? [Walesa] I have been saying for months that attempts to reestablish the old, bipolar order can now be seen. Indeed, what other conclusion can we draw, when others want to decide on our behalf, when Russia can lay down conditions to NATO? A situation in which the great impose their will on the small is unacceptable. The rights of all must be respected in the same way if we really want to talk about freedom and sovereignty. The highway code is the same for everyone, for large cars and small ones, but different standards are being applied here according to individual interests. How can we talk about equality in the face of so many examples of disparate treatment? Poland is experiencing this, too, and my admonition to the West is that it should beware of these shortsighted, selfish policies. I see that, despite a lot of fine words and declarations, there are still divisions in Europe, as if Europe lacked a vision, a concept of how to handle the great victory that the collapse of communism represented. [Svidercoschi] Do you fear Russian expansionism? [Walesa] The free, democratic Poland clearly defined its foreign policy priorities from the outset, adopting as its primary goal membership in the European economic and security structures. Russia is an extremely important neighbor of ours, and we attach great significance to bilateral relations, provided they are rooted in the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Economic cooperation with this enormous market is a must for us. I do not fear what you call Russian expansionism, despite the fact that Russia dictated conditions to us for many years. What is more, had this expansionism continued, it would not have stopped at a country like ours; it would have gone further. However, I believe that the policies of a democratic Russia will not be dominated by the imperialist designs of the past. It will find its rightful place among the other democratic countries, respecting the rules of the international community. We intend to develop every form of cooperation with a Russia of this type. This is essential for the common Europe. [Svidercoschi] But it would appear that Western Europe has not yet realized the urgency of seizing the present historical and political moment. [Walesa] As I have already said, my warning to Europe is not to let this moment slip through its fingers. History will judge us on this basis. We have never yet had such a chance to build a single free, democratic Europe, the Europe of the "little homelands," the Europe that, in its unity, will nevertheless allow each state and nation to preserve its own identity, the Europe where no one lays down the law for others, where the rules of the game are clear, accepted by all of the players and obeyed to the last. [Svidercoschi] You once said that the former communists won in Poland not on the strength of the old ideology but because they were more active and better skilled in the wielding of power. Do you still think so? [Walesa] I confirm what I said when I predicted this trend. I would add that the victory of the postcommunists is also due to the fact that our societies have had to bear the weight of reforms, which many people find hard to stand. The free market and capitalism have brought a lot of serious problems: unemployment, uncertainty about the future, and fewer social safety nets. Not everyone can become a capitalist overnight. Pockets of poverty have sprung up alongside the rapid rises to fortune. Many people see the closure of their unproductive factories, when economic figures supplanted ideology as the criterion, as unfair. Once upon a time, we all had equal shares of the poverty, but things have changed now. The rules of the market economy are paramount. [Svidercoschi] Have mistakes been made? [Walesa] In our inexperience, we, too, made mistakes when we came to power. In any case, the transformations in the system were quite unprecedented. Perhaps we wanted to make up for the lost years too fast, sometimes losing sight of the individual, his anxieties, his fear of the unknown. Anyway, you cannot change people's mindset overnight, and it is in this mindset that communism has its stronghold. It takes years for people to realize the extent to which the future depends on their own capacity for action, for running things, so the reaction of people who are disappointed and look back with longing at their former security, regardless of the poverty, comes as no surprise. But they will have to get it into their heads that you never jump into the same river twice, and there is no going back. This is already evident in Poland, as the recent wave of strikes has shown. Our chances lie in reforms. I know they are difficult, but we have to pay this price. We have to do everything to ensure that the price remains as low as possible, particularly for the weaker layers of society. [Svidercoschi] Can Solidarity have exhausted its entire potential in terms of ideals? [Walesa] Solidarity, which came into being in 1980, has ensured a place for itself in history. It was a social movement that enjoyed an incredible strength and role in Poland and Europe. But the time for fighting is different from peacetime. It poses different challenges. Solidarity continues to seek its identity, whether to take on the role of a political force or to remain a union defending the interests of the grass roots, which are now made up mainly of workers in the major factories. Solidarity has encountered great difficulty in resolving this dilemma over recent years. As a movement that contributed to the collapse of the communist system and launched the process of economic, political, and social reforms, it has often found itself at a crossroads: Should it act as a protective umbrella for the various governments that have emanated from it or as an opposition in the event of government policy diverging from the interests of the union grass roots? [Svidercoschi] And what has it decided? [Walesa] The turning point came with the Solidarity campaign that culminated in the fall of the government led by Hanna Suchocka and cleared the way for the postcommunists. Solidarity is now increasingly opting for a union role, but I believe that the country's sense of responsibility and the overriding national interest will prevail over the particularisms of the union and its leaders. I believe that Solidarity will not discount what it has fought for, and it will remain moderate and circumspect in its demands. [Svidercoschi] Mr. President, you will be attending the commemorations at Monte Cassino [Italian World War II battlefield]. What significance does that 50-year-old page in history have today? [Walesa] For many Polish soldier-exiles, the journey to their homeland, from which they had been forcibly uprooted, ended at Monte Cassino. Before reaching it, they had crossed half the world, surviving the concentration camps and prisons of the "inhuman land." However, their dream of a return to Poland faded in Italy. All they had left was a last wish engraved in stone: "Passerby, tell Poland we fell in its loyal service." Poland has not forgotten, even though there have been those who have tried to wipe out the memory. [Svidercoschi] There were the communists in Poland... [Walesa] Many of those who decided to return were persecuted, humiliated by the new power imposed on the Poles. General Anders, who had led them back to Poland, was stripped of his citizenship. But people's memories and hearts do not change by decree. The spirit of a nation cannot be imprisoned, nor can its freedom be taken away. [Svidercoschi] They had fought for the freedom of Poland and Europe. [Walesa] Although the battle of Monte Cassino did not change the course of our history, the sacrifice was not made in vain. It was part of Poland's contribution to the victory of democracy and freedom over Nazi barbarism. It was a contribution to the rebuilding of a free, democratic Europe. Sadly, there was no place for us in this Europe. But, had it not been for that battle, we would have found it much more difficult many years later to transform the dream of a free Poland into reality. We always remember it, and it is our wish that Europe remember it, too. Our wish is that no one should ask whether we are entitled to a place in the community of free, democratic European countries.
