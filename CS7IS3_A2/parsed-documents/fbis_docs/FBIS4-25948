"I have had enough of being constantly watched in contempt of the law, and I want to stand up for my rights," the former student leader of the 1989 pro-democracy movement said by telephone. He added that he was also protesting the government's indifference to appeals from the Chinese people for more democracy. A number of petitions sent to the authorities by dissident groups. [sentence as received] Wang, 24, was freed in 1993 after spending four years in prison. He said Tuesday that he would begin a fast unless the police presence around him was removed by Wednesday night. He said he feared for his safety, adding that two plain clothes police followed him everywhere, and that four or five others were stationed day and night in front of his building. Wang returned here Sunday from the eastern province of Shandong. He decided to leave the capital for the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre on June 4, in order to "avoid police harassment." At the end of May, the dissident signed a petition with six other people, protesting the treatment of those involved in the 1989 pro-democracy movement and calling for the release of all those detained. A number of petitions and open letters have been sent to the government this year by dissidents and intellectuals pushing for more democracy. But the government has responded by intensifying repression, arresting many dissident leaders and putting others under intense police surveillance.
