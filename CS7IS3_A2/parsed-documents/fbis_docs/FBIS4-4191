The magnificent banquet hall was ablaze with lights and filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere to welcome the guests. Prime Minister Jasray first made a welcoming speech and proposed a toast. He said: "Mongolia and China are friendly neighbors. In recent years, through both sides making joint efforts, bilateral relations have become more active, the legal foundation has been consolidated, and the scope of cooperation has been expanded. I am satisfied by this." Jasray pointed out that developing good-neighborly and friendly relations with China was, and will continue to be, one of the primary principles of Mongolia's foreign policy. He said: In 1960, Premier Zhou Enlai, China's famous statesman, paid an official visit to our country and signed the Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty between the two countries; 34 years later, Premier Li Peng makes an official visit to Mongolia again. He said: "Your Excellency Mr Premier, your visit to our country is the continuation of the established regular senior and summit meetings between Mongolia and China and I deeply believe that your visit will hold an important position in the history of Mongolian-Chinese relations." Talking about the domestic situation, Jasray said that Mongolia is undergoing a difficult period of transition to the new market economic structure. He deeply believes that, with the positive efforts of our people and the support of the international community, the country will certainly succeed. He said that he was glad to see that China had made great achievements in carrying out reforms in line with China's own national conditions. He said: "We sincerely hope that the PRC, which has worldwide influence, will continue to be stable and prosperous and will continue to develop. China's peaceful foreign policy is an important factor for guaranteeing peace, stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a whole." In his speech of thanks, Premier Li Peng said: In the 45 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mongolia, although there have been twists and turns for certain historical reasons, we were still glad to see that the leaders of the two countries have continued to exchange visits in recent years. Personnel exchanges at various levels have been frequent and mutual understanding and trust have been deepened, while gratifying progress has been made in exchanges and cooperation in various fields. This has brought major benefits to both countries and both peoples. The present state of Sino-Mongolian relations did not come easily and we should treasure it dearly. Li Peng said: Thirty-four years ago, Premier Zhou Enlai visited Mongolia and signed the Friendly and Mutual Assistance Treaty. This treaty has played an important role in the development of bilateral relations between the two countries. He said: "Tomorrow, we shall sign a new treaty on Sino-Mongolian friendship and cooperative relations. I believe the signing of the treaty will open a new page in the annals of Sino-Mongolian relations, will further advance the development of bilateral relations, and will bring about broader and brighter prospects for friendly cooperation between the two countries. The Chinese Government attaches great importance to relations with Mongolia and is willing to join hands with the Mongolian Government in creating a long-term, friendly, and cooperative relationship extending beyond the 21st century. Li Peng said: Both China and Mongolia are now striving for the development of their own national economies. A stable and developed China will make contributions to peace and prosperity in Asia and in the world. He said: "We respect the Mongolian people's choice of their own development course and sincerely hope and believe that the Mongolian people will overcome the temporary difficulties, restore the economy, and effect national regeneration." Li Peng pointed out: Peace and development remain two major themes facing contemporary human society. The Chinese Government and the Chinese people are willing to join all peace-loving states and peoples, including Mongolia, in making unremitting efforts to build the new order of peace, stability, cooperation, and development in Asia and in the world. Premier Li Peng's wife Zhu Lin; Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission; Han Shubin, minister of railroads; Qi Huaiyuan, director of the State Council's Foreign Affairs Office; and Wuliji, chairman of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Regional People's Government, who are accompanying Premier Li Peng on his visit to Mongolia, were also invited to the banquet.
