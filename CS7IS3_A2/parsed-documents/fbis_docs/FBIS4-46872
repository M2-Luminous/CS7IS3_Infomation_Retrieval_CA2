Chernyak, doctor of economic sciences: "What To Save: the Hair or the Head?" [Text] Inflation rates declined considerably over the past several months in Ukraine from 80-100 percent at the end of last year to 12.6 percent in February, 5.7 percent in March, and 6 percent in April of this year. How should that be viewed? In several ways, I believe. On the one hand that is a sign of economic stabilization, primarily of the monetary system. On the other hand the slowing down of inflation is accompanied by a sharp drop in production (this drop amounted to 39.1 percent in four months of this year as compared with the same period last year). In essence that spells destruction of the economy. In economics not only the result is significant but also the method by which it was obtained. A decrease in the rates of inflation was obtained by strictly monetary methods: by the conduct of a rigid monetary and credit policy, as well as a policy of wage freezing. Over the past four months wages remained at the same level. In February the average wage of workers in the state sector amounted to 760,100 karbovantsy, which is 40 percent below the minimum consumer budget. The freezing of wages and their irregular payment resulted in diminished demand becoming a factor in lower production, while poor credit availability aggravated the nonpayment crisis. Inflation cannot be slowed down by halting production. That would be saving the hair but losing the head. At present the main issue is not curbing inflation but animating production. Our principal problem is not the problem of inflation, but that of production, and now also that of marketing because of the depressed demand. It is necessary to bear in mind not only the growth rate of prices, but also their level (compared to wages). The government anti-inflationary policy of the past two years was directed at restraining wages and controlling enterprise consumption funds, that is, at the suppression of effective demand. V. Lanovyy and especially V. Pynzenyk were responsible for its formulation. Such a policy does not suit our realities since in our case we have mostly an inflation of costs and not an inflation in demand. Suppression of demand conditions a further decline in production and it is specifically the decline in production and a shortage of goods today that constitute the main reason for inflation, along with, of course, monopolism and the lack of a competitive environment. Therefore the development of production on the basis of privatization, demonopolization, restructuring, promotion of entrepreneurship, and stabilization of the financial system must become the basis of the anti-inflationary policy. It is clearly necessary to introduce indexation of wages and all income while eliminating control over enterprise consumption funds.
