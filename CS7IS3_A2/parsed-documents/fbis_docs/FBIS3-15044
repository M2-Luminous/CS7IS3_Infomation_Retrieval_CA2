Another Thaw in Russia?"; date and place not given: "Evening Conversation with Viktor Anpilov"] [Text] On the very day that the decree on the amnesty was being adopted, the freedom-loving State Duma deputies from Russia's Choice began shouting: "Now Anpilov is getting out of Lefortovo and will call his thugs out onto the streets!" The same prediction was made by alarmed television commentators. "The freed criminals will cause unrest in Moscow" they said, trying to intimidate the viewers by showing the former convicts leaving prison. Well, in that case how can you avoid asking the now freed Viktor Anpilov about the unrest that he is planning in Moscow? Here is his reply on his first evening at home. [Anpilov] There will be no unrest. I have always strictly observed the laws. [Nikiforova] Viktor Ivanovich, does that mean you do not regard yourself as guilty? [Anpilov] It does not matter what I think. During the five months that I spent in prison they did not present a single piece of evidence against me even though from the very outset I wanted a judicial investigation and had even prepared my speech for the trial. But to call someone a criminal before the trial is not allowed even under the new Constitution. As I was leaving prison I said: If life had improved over these past five months that would have been the weightiest evidence of my guilt, but it has deteriorated considerably and people are protesting. Of course there must be an objective investigation into the causes and all the circumstances of the events of September and October. [Nikiforova] Nevertheless, could you say a few words about your immediate plans.... [Anpilov] I intend to travel and meet with labor collectives. I shall go to Tula, Vorkuta, Chelyabinsk, and Yekaterinburg -- I want to tell people the whole truth about what happened in May and September-October last year. In the conditions which have been created, the labor collectives must become owners of their own enterprises -- they alone have the right to dispose of everything built by them, they alone have the right to dispose of their output and set the wages of the administration. This will be the dictatorship of the proletariat. [Nikiforova] So does that mean back to work for you? There must have been much to think about and reassess, surely? [Anpilov] I wrote a book in prison -- I called it "The Lefortovo Dialogues. A Prison Synopsis of Hegel's Lectures." I wrote it in the form of the transcript of a conversation between a Prisoner and the great thinkers, from Socrates and Plato to Lenin. They are conversations about the state and the rule of law. The dialogue with Lenin was about how the greatest revolution was lost and why. [Nikiforova] And in conclusion.... [Anpilov] My thanks to the PRAVDA collective for their solidarity and support. Let us stand up together for the position of the struggling proletariat!
