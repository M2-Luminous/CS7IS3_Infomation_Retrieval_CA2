In an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT newspaper today, Musa said talks should be the basis of the process to salvage Yemeni unity and that any military clash will be futile because there will be no victor, only bloodshed and continuous conflict. He emphasized that the military conflict strikes at the core of Yemeni unity because unity should be based on mutual desire and the converging views of everyone--people and leaders. On reports of foreign interventions in the Yemeni war, Musa said there is no information in this regard but there is talk that there are groups of returnees from Afghanistan who are pursuing certain goals in some areas of Yemen, but this issue is under strict observation by many countries. Commenting on Egyptian-Sudanese relations, Musa said he intends to visit Sudan soon and noted that he had met with Sudanese President 'Umar al-Bashir and Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih during the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa. In his interview, Musa discussed Egypt's role in the peace process, especially on the Syrian-Israeli track. He said Egypt does not impose its role, but such a role does exist. He added: Naturally, it is not our policy to intervene in certain tracks, but the Egyptian role is there and ready to serve the Arab brothers, including Syria. Musa said: Egypt does not play the role of mediator in these negotiations, because we are an Arab state committed to Arab goals-- that is, a comprehensive withdrawal, the Palestinian people's right to self-determination, and a comprehensive and just peace between the Arabs and Israel. Answering a question on the Lockerbie issue and whether he had discussed it in his talks with British officials, he said: We explained our stand on this issue to the British officials, considering the continuous, intensive contacts between President Mubarak and Colonel al-Qadhdhafi. Our clear stand is that we are against any further escalation of this issue. On the idea of a Middle Eastern market and asked if there is a strategic Egyptian study of the issue, he said: Of course Egypt is conducting concentrated studies concerning the region's economic future in peacetime. However, Musa added, there is no proposal for a Middle Eastern market; the whole issue is no more than an idea that has often been floated. He said that there is no study about a Middle Eastern market and it will not materialize unless peace is established.
