A survey shows that farmers obtained an additional 2.43 billion yuan from growing new varieties of grain and cotton on eight million hectares of farmland, averaging 240 yuan per household over the past three years. Jiangsu began to encourage farmers in 1990 to undertake scientific farming in line with the market economy. The province now has 12 comprehensive experimental farm centers, 324 townships and more than 2,000 villages doing pioneer work in the application of agro-science, and 150,000 households specializing in scientific farming. These organizations and households have formed a network to popularize agro-science. While encouraging scientists to go to the rural areas to help farmers boost production, Jiangsu has paid attention to importing advanced technology for growing grapes and apples and cultivating rice.
