Rakhmanin, editor of the "13 Tverskaya Street" department, under the rubric "Commentary of the Week": "One in Three Get Aid From the Mayoralty"] [Text] I will begin with a rather interesting, in my opinion, forecast for Muscovites' standard of living in the coming year. It was issued by the economic policy department of the Government of Moscow at the budget hearings recently held by the deputies in the city Duma. According to the latest estimates, the average monthly wage will increase 6.5-fold. And prices--sevenfold. At the same time, the amount of money channeled by the mayoralty into social protection of low-income residents will increase 14.8-fold, and its share in the city budget will increase 2.6-2.8-fold. This money will enable the city to provide aid to 3.6 million Muscovites--one-third of the capital city's population. No sharp decline in Muscovites' standard of living is envisaged for 1994. I personally never counted myself as an optimist. What is considered a "sharp decline in the standard of living"? And does it matter anyway whether it drops sharply or gradually but steadily? All in all, we have had a considerable increase in the number of skeptics over the past few years. Few now believe in promising assurances "a la Gorbachev" that in a half a year (a year, two years...) life will get better. No matter what forecasts politicians and economists come up with, every month we determine rather precisely our standard of living by the amount of cash left in our wallet on the eve of receiving a long-awaited paycheck or pension. Like the absolute majority of Muscovites, I am not terribly confident in tomorrow. What I do not doubt, however, is that no matter what comes, Luzhkov will keep his word and will find the money for social needs. I have seen more than once at city government meetings how, in response to eternal laments of the capital city's Minister of Finance Yu. Korostelev that there is no available money in the budget and no place to get it, the mayor has said unambiguously: "Money for social aid must be found." Every day I sort out new mail (and the newspaper is getting increasingly more letters, for which we are grateful to our readers). Well, there is a lot of criticism addressed at Luzhkov's team--all sorts of criticism, sometimes fair and sometimes not quite. The government and its local representatives ought to be criticized for still terrible roads (despite titanic efforts), mud and trash in the streets, occasional lapses in central heating, and leaking roofs. But I have never seen a letter in which Muscovites berate the mayor for lack of attention to social programs. In this respect Moscow is far ahead of the rest of Russia. I have in front of me a document signed by Yu. Luzhkov on 28 December--a comprehensive program of social protection measures for certain categories of Moscow residents in 1994 and a report on the results of the analogous program in 1993, which considerably expanded and strengthened social guarantees set at the federal level. Last year, 61.7 billion rubles [R] was spent on financing the city's social program from the budget fund for social protection. The 1994 budget envisages financing of expenditures on the implementation of measures of social protection of the population taking into account their indexation. The Moscow City Statistics Administration will now conduct a monthly calculation of the subsistence minimum in keeping with the decision of the trilateral commission of the Government of Moscow, the Confederation of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and the Moscow Trade Unions Federation. In the near future, proposals will be finalized on improvements in the system of supplements to pensions of nonworking pensioners and child allowances. The prefectures have been instructed to adopt within a month regional programs of social protection of the population using the districts' financial resources. In keeping with the program signed by the mayor, the Moscow Government is increasing subsidies for school lunches and food for low-income pensioners, the mayoralty's personal stipends to students, and subsidies to students in acute need. Subsidies for children who do not attend preschool facilities are being increased to 25 percent of minimum wage (which currently amounts to R3,655); supplemental pay to child allowances for single mothers, families with many children, and nonworking mothers who receive benefits from social security organs; and extra pay for food products for children under the age of three. An newborn child allowance is being increased to double the minimum wage. In addition, a number of measures of social protection envisaged by republic legislation and financed out of the Moscow budget, naturally, remain in effect. We plan to look at individual parts and provisions of this comprehensive program in the next few issues.
