Korea TA2306140294 Tel Aviv HATZOFE in Hebrew 23 Jun 94 p 2 TA2306140294 Tel Aviv HATZOFE Hebrew BFN [Report by Knesset correspondent Yona Kohen] [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres confirmed in the Knesset there is room for concern regarding the events in North Korea, which is dodging international supervision. Addressing the Knesset plenum, Peres emphasized the need of implementing international political steps regarding this issue. Peres said the world is changing its shape from a world of enemies to a world of dangers. The lethal combination of missiles and nuclear weapons has changed the issues of borders, defenses, and settlements; it is doubtful whether there is any way to prevent the missile danger. Peres said that our defense system must meet the magnitude of the missile and nuclear weapons danger. Peres added that political agreements can prevent the nuclear danger. The foreign minister hopes an international coalition will be formed against the countries harboring missiles and nuclear arms. North Korea is presently playing a "cat and mouse game." The United States is heading the countries confronting the North Korean threat. Peres said that the United States is determined to prevent the danger, adding that Israel will support whatever action it takes in this issue.
