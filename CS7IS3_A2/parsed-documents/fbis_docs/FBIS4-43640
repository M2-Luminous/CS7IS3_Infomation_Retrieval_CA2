The document, initially conceived in April 1993, is expected to be signed by France's GICAT (Association of Land-Based Weapons Manufacturers) and its European counterparts: Germany's BDI, Great Britain's DMA, Spain's AFARMADE, Belgium's BDIG, Portugal's MID, Denmark's DI, Norway's NHO, Sweden's NIF, and Turkey's SASAD. The Netherlands Government's position is not known yet, while the Greeks have reportedly chosen not to sign the document. The move, initiated by the French, is a first. It is indicative of the determination of manufacturers to start a campaign, geared toward politicians, in favor of a "Buy European" clause. The document to be submitted on Tuesday [21 June] will be short (two pages), but it will list some 10 commitments and wishes by these European defense associations. Above all, they call for a "an overall buy European" clause. Next comes the determination to see politicians acknowledge "the vital role of research and development," as is being done in America at a time when European defense budgets are dropping. The charter calls for "European countries to harmonize their needs" and "control procedures"; it asks for "active political, diplomatic, and financial support" as well as the "preservation of Europe's defense industry's vital interests." The document also calls for "balanced transatlantic trade relations." In other words, in the future, the Americans should buy as many weapons from the Europeans as they sell to them. Great Britain, for instance, often chose to buy American rather than European. This issue currently is attracting a lot of attention since London is soon to make a choice between American and European manufacturers for two kinds of equipment. First of all, for 90 assault helicopters, which represents a 15-billion-franc contract. In the running are McDonnell-Douglas' "Apache," which would be produced under license by Westland (a British firm not unfamiliar with such practices), and Eurocopter's "Tigre" (Eurocopter is a subsidiary of Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace). London's second choice is for a military transport aircraft. Here, it can either purchase Lockheed's C-130J, or take part (through British Aerospace) in the development of the "Future Large Aircraft" together with other European manufacturers. This call for transatlantic reciprocity is a sneer at Switzerland's and Finland's decision to choose McDonnell-Douglas' F- 18 combat aircraft over the Mirage 2000-5 of France's Dassault Aviation. Another alternative also springs to mind: Sweden is currently looking at two air-to-air missiles, one U.S.-made, the "AMRAAM" (recently chosen by Denmark) and Matra's "Mica." The charter is an ambitious platform, but without political support, it may never amount to anything much.
