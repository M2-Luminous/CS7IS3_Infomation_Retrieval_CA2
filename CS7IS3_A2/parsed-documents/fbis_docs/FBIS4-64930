The next time we Nordic foreign ministers meet, Sweden, Norway, and Finland will be involved in the European Union [EU] as observers." Niels Helveg Petersen, a happy Danish foreign minister, was cheering on the Nordic area in the EU after yesterday's meeting in Iceland. But the meeting's host, Icelandic Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson (Social Democratic Party), had a bitter comment to make: "Iceland, the Faeroes, and Greenland will become even more marginalized within Nordic cooperation. Now everybody is saying that `the whole of the Nordic area is part of the EU.' When we Icelanders come to future Nordic meetings, will we have to sing `Who can sail without wind?'" The conclusion that Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson has reached is that Iceland too must give consideration to membership. He is engaged at present in an intense domestic battle to this end, in which he does nothing to spare David Oddsson, his prime minister, from the nonsocialist Independence Party. Oddsson's party is deeply divided on the EU issue, as is the left-right coalition government. The fisheries minister, for example, is an opponent of EU membership. Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson's weapons in his battle are three opinion polls that have been carried out since the negotiations in Brussels and the results the Norwegians achieved in the talks on fisheries. These show that a majority of Icelanders now want to investigate the possibility of EU membership. A year ago only one-quarter of those interviewed had a positive view of membership. "It is said that politicians lead the people. But here in Iceland the people lead the politicians!" Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson told his Nordic counterparts.
