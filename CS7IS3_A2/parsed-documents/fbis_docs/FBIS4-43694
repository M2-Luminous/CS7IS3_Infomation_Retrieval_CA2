Expressing puzzlement over the discrepancy in the figures, Casavola said the Court was told by INPS on April 15 that its sentence would cost 9 trillion lire. "What are we supposed to do about it if the head of INPS then provides the government with different figures," he went on, referring to this week's INPS estimate of 22 trillion lire. Labor Minister Clemente Mastella has put the total bill even higher, at 30 trillion lire. "INPS is a public body, there ought to be some sort of public data bank," said Casavola, reiterating that it was the Court's job to judge laws, not to suggest how laws should be financed in accordance with the constitutional requirement that every law have adequate cover. But he described the INPS pickle as the result of "improvident" past policy, claiming that previous governments had ignored its warnings. As to the possibility of the backpayments being spread over different fiscal years, Casavola said it was "up to the government to decide how it is to find the financial cover." Commenting indirectly on the furore caused by its ruling, Casavola hinted at a need for the Court to work more closely with parliament in framing action to prevent such financial problems coming to a head with apparently little warning. He expressed favour for the German model, where "the court expresses an opinion, giving parliament the time to intervene and adjust things." Casavola also described the polemics over the repayment of an 85,000 lire lump-sum healthcare tax as "demagogical." "Young people spend more than that when they go to the disco," he said. The court has around 50 public spending cases pending, Casavola said. The INPS press office clarified later that the cost of making backdated supplementary payments to about 600,000 pension-holders was initially estimated at 9 trillion lire, but could rise to 16 trillion lire, "as recognised even by a Constitutional Court expert" if it were to apply to all the pension-holders who had not received these payments as of September 30 last year. The 16 trillion becomes 22 trillion by adding in the 6 trillion lire cost of a second Constitutional Court ruling, last December, making pensions reversible, INPS said. The rough figure attributed to Mastella is a stab at including extra costs for interest payments and monetary fluctuations, which "cannot be quantified until the dates of sentence pronouncement and application are known," INPS said. It denied receiving a request "on April 15 or any other date" for a cost estimate from the Court.
