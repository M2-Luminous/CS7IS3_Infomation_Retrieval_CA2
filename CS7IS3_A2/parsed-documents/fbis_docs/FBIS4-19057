France may submit a resolution on Gorazde to the Security Council, according to Alain Juppe, the minister of foreign affairs. Francois Leotard also addressed the Assembly. The minister of defense justified the intervention by allied planes against the Serbs in Gorazde. Francois Leotard: [Begin Leotard recording] We could not allow the attacks on Gorazde to continue, especially those of these last few days. We will not permit Gorazde to become another Vukovar. The events in Gorazde doubtless mark another turning point in the Balkan crisis. Either the determination of the international community will be understood by all the factions, then the road will be open for fighting to be suspended, and negotiations to start again. Or the opposite will happen: The obstinacy of some people, perhaps too the orders of some military factions, will make the use of force necessary again, with the increase in military might that this would imply and the risks that one can imagine would result. Ladies and gentlemen, I have repeated several times that there can be no military solution to the Bosnian conflict. [end recording]
