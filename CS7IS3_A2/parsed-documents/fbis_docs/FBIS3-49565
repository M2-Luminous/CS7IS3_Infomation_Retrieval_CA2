They think that with this revenue, they will be able to close some gaps in the budget. [Kaczmarek] I think that generally speaking, this is one of the dilemmas of privatization in Poland: To what extent the mechanism of selling state-owned property -- and I would like to stress that I think state-owned property can only be sold once since we do not plan on nationalization -- is supposed to constitute a mechanism of a kind of safety cushion for public finance problems. Poland is undergoing some quite significant and major reforms and they are accompanied by disturbances in some sectors of public finances under some of my minister colleagues, so on the one hand they are critical of privatization, but on the other hand they expect precisely their expenditures to be financed by revenue from privatization. That of course reminds me of the philosophy of applying a band-aid to some of the wounds in the budget, whereas I am more interested in revenue from privatization serving the purpose of restructuring companies or branches that the state may regard as strategic, within its industrial or economic policy, so we would not eat our own tail. [Geryn] Up to now, privatization has been and still continues to be criticized. Some even say outrightly that the concept is an implementation of a liberal dogma and that since half of our economy has been privatized, these processes should be slowed down a bit. Do you think that Poland can currently afford to slow down the rate of privatization? [Kaczmarek] This will always continue to be a dilemma and I think the Sejm debate which is ahead of us concerning the directions of privatization will be a debate where I hope some -- and I will encourage them to do so -- will speak about what needs to be done in the future, whereas some others will stubbornly stick to the past from which I personally would like to draw conclusions. I think there will also be some disappointments in this regard, either by various reviewers or by sensation-seekers, in the sense that there can be no radical change in the directions of privatization, and the simple reason for that is that we are just learning ownership transformations, that is privatization. What goal should privatization serve in Poland? Should it be financing the budget deficit, improving the efficiency of the Polish economy, extending ownership rights to large parts of society, or should it serve primarily to exclusively concentrate those mechanisms which serve to improve the economic efficiency, to increase competitiveness, and consequently to increase prosperity? One should also keep in mind another issue: Ownership transformations should not only be understood to mean a transfer of state-owned property to the private sector, but also as a process of creating the right conditions for the functioning of the private sector from the very beginning, from scratch. And as I have also recently been saying repeatedly, privatization is also a system and a process of transferring power, and that is certainly the reason it generates so many conflicts. [Geryn] Mr. Minister, forgive me this analogy but if I were to close my eyes now while listening to you, I would have a feeling of listening not to Minister Kaczmarek but to [former Ownership Transformations] Minister Lewandowski. [Kaczmarek] It is hard to describe some economic processes using words other than these since these processes are simply constant and always the same. All we can do is draw some conclusions from the past and I think one could probably compile quite a long list of such conclusions with regard to which there would have to be changes in the current draft. As the government, we intend to present in the draft some material to the Sejm where emphases will be placed in different ways, with regard to Polish privatization, with particular emphasis continuing to be placed on developing the capital market, increasing competitiveness, as well as on preference being primarily given to restructuring, followed by the selling of companies, and on improving the access of employee partnerships to small companies, including performing the role of owner. But there is immediately another dilemma here: Can Poland as a state administration currently afford to manage 6,000 state-owned enterprises? I think the answer is no. [Geryn] Will we finally see a law on reprivatization this year? The issue has been dragging on for four years now. Everybody knows that there can be no progress in privatization without reprivatization. [Kaczmarek] The issue is included on the list of priorities when it comes to the directions of privatization for 1994. We have to approach the issue of the scale of reprivatization from a perspective of two issues, if I could phrase it this way: The first one is the state's financial capabilities -- which means it cannot be a process which would lead to a weakening of the state budget whose condition is quite weak anyway; and the other one is that we will also be guided by the principle that up to now a law was in force -- it could have been a bad law but it was still a law -- and so we will implement reprivatization in cases where somebody's property was nationalized illegally, without paying compensation, and so on and so forth. We will try to observe these principles, or at least such is the conclusion drawn from initial debates during sessions of the Council of Ministers.
