[passage omitted] Commenting on [Kalmyk President] Ilyumzhinov's statement in an ITAR-TASS interview, David Kugultinov, a popular Kalmyk poet and chairman of the Council of Elders at the president, described it as an "ill-considered step." "One should at least consult the people and find out their opinion, before taking such an important decision. By all appearances, the suggestion of our leader came as a result of instability in Russia, as well as in its leadership. I do not think that Kalmykia will turn into an out-of-the-way place, if it loses its status of a republic and its Constitution. But it will lose the energy of statehood, which has been and continues to be a source of hope for all those who live on its territory. Haste has never done any good to anybody, and I am sure the Kalmyk people will realise it and will not support their president," Kugultinov said.
