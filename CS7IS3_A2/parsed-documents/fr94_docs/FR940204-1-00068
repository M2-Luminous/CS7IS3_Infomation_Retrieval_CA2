FR940204-1-00068 FR940204-1-00013 Ms. Dee Warenycia petitioned the Service to list the callippe silverspot butterfly as an endangered species in a letter dated January 14, 1991, which was received on January 22, 1991. The Service completed a status review and determined that enough information exists to propose the species for listing. This proposal constitutes the final finding for the petitioned action. On March 20, 1975, Behren's silverspot butterfly was listed as 1 of 42 insects whose status was being reviewed for listing as either endangered or threatened by the Service (40 FR 12691). This insect was listed as a category 2 species in the May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664), and January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), Animal Notices of Review. Dr. Dennis Murphy of Stanford University petitioned the Service to list Behren's silverspot butterfly as an endangered species in a letter dated June 28, 1989, which was received on June 29, 1989. The Service determined that the petition contained substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted and published notice of the 90-day finding on November 1, 1990 (55 FR 46080). The Service did not receive any new information in response to the November 1, 1990, notice. However, the species was listed as a category 1 species in the November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804), Animal Notice of Review on the basis of significant increases in habitat loss and threats occurring throughout its range. This proposal constitutes the final finding for the petitioned action. The Alameda whipsnake (as the Alameda striped racer) was listed as a category 2 candidate species in the September 18, 1985 (50 FR 37958), Vertebrate Wildlife Notice of Review. In the January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), Animal Notice of Review, the Service again included the Alameda whipsnake as a category 2 candidate species and solicited additional information on its status. The November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804), Animal Notice of Review included the Alameda whipsnake as a category 1 candidate species on the basis of significant increases in habitat loss and threats occurring throughout its range. This proposal to list the callippe silverspot butterfly, Behren's silverspot butterfly, and Alameda whipsnake is based on the best available scientific and commercial information, various scientific papers and unpublished reports available to the Service, and information gathered from various scientists specializing in these taxa, especially Mr. Sterling Mattoon and Mr. John Steiner. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists. Species may be determined to be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the callippe silverspot butterfly ( Speyeria callippe callippe ), Behren's silverspot butterfly ( Speyeria zerene behrensii ), and Alameda whipsnake ( Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus ) are as follows: A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of their habitat or range . The primary cause of the declines of the callippe silverspot butterfly, Behren's silverspot butterfly, and Alameda whipsnake is the loss of habitat from human activities. These species are imperiled by the current and potential future destruction and alteration of their habitats due to off-road vehicle use, trampling by hikers and equestrians, unsuitable levels of livestock grazing, and invasive exotic vegetation. The Alameda whipsnake and Behren's silverspot butterfly also are imperiled by residential and commercial development. Off-road vehicles and human or horse trampling pose threats to the colonies of the two butterfly species as these activities could crush the foodplants of the larvae or the adult nectar sources. The callippe silverspot butterfly was once more widespread in the San Francisco Bay Area. At least five populations of this species have been eliminated by urban development and other causes. The species currently is known only from two sites in San Mateo and Alameda Counties. One of the known extant populations of the callippe silverspot butterfly is located in a city park. This colony is small and may be imperiled by human-induced and natural causes (Mattoon, in litt ., 1991). The other known extant population of the callippe silverspot butterfly is found on San Bruno Mountain in San Mateo County (Mattoon, in litt ., 1991; Thomas Reid Associates 1982). Although the majority of the natural areas on San Bruno Mountain have been preserved and will remain undeveloped in perpetuity, collection of specimens by amateur lepidopterists poses a threat, as discussed under Factor B. Behren's silverspot butterfly has been extirpated from a significant portion of its former range, which extended from the mouth of the Russian River in Sonoma County north to southern Mendocino County. One of the six known historic colonies was eliminated by a housing development (Mattoon, in litt ., 1989). No specimens have been observed at the other historic colonies since 1987. Currently, this animal is known only from a recently discovered locality northwest of the town of Point Arena in Mendocino County (Sally DeBecker, Pacific Gas and Electric, pers. comm., 1990). The site is subject to grazing by livestock. Although no plans have been proposed for the site, urban development is occurring in the area.
