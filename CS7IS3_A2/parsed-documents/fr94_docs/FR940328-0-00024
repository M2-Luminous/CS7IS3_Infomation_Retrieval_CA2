FR940328-0-00024 FR940328-0-00012 Cyanea truncata was first collected on the Punaluu Valley Trail in 1911 by Joseph Rock and was placed by him in the genus Rollandia (Rock 1913). On further examination, Rock (1917) transferred the species to the closely related genus Cyanea because of its free staminal column. Charles N. Forbes (1916) described and named a specimen from Waiahole Valley C. juddii, which Rock later reduced to synonymy under C. truncata (Rock 1919). Harold St. John (1939) recognized this taxon at the varietal level and published the combination C. truncata var. juddii. In 1987, St. John, questioning the validity of the characters used to delineate the genus Cyanea, transferred all taxa of Cyanea to another closely related genus, Delissea (St. John 1987, St. John and Takeuchi 1987). Few botanists have accepted St. John's taxonomy for this group; the majority continue to recognize the genus Cyanea, and the latest revision of the genus recognizes only C. truncata (Lammers 1990). The specific epithet refers to the plant's occasionally truncate leaf base. Cyanea truncata, of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae), is an unbranched or sparsely branched shrub covered with small sharp prickles. The oval leaves, which are widest above the middle, are 8 to 24 in (22 to 60 cm) long and 4 to 10 in (10 to 26 cm) wide, and are lined with hardened teeth along the margins. The upper surface of the leaf is hairless; the lower surface is hairy, has sparse projections, and is pale green. Clusters of 8 to 40 white flowers with magenta stripes are produced on horizontal or hanging stalks between 2 and 12 in (5 to 28 cm) long. Each slightly curved flower is 1.3 to 1.7 in (32 to 42 mm) long and about 0.3 in (7 mm) wide and has spreading corolla lobes that are one-fourth to one-half as long as the flower. The fruits are round orange berries about 0.4 in (9 mm) long that contain many tiny seeds. Cyanea truncata is distinguished from other members of this genus by the length of the flower cluster stalk and the size of the flowers and flower lobes (Degener 1932a; Forbes 1916; Lammers 1990; Rock 1913, 1919; St. John 1939). Historically, Cyanea truncata was known from Punaluu, Waikane, and Waiahole in the northern Koolau Mountains of Oahu (HHP 1991b2 to 1991b4). These sites have not been recently surveyed due to their inaccessibility, but it is known that suitable habitat is present. One population of at least two individuals was known to exist in ``Hidden Valley,'' a drainage northwest of Kaaawa Valley that terminates at Kaaawa Point in the Koolau Range (HHP 1991b1, Rock 1962); however, that population was destroyed by feral pigs (CPC 1989a, 1989b, 1990). In 1991, John Obata of HPCC discovered 20 immature lobeliods growing on private land along a gully floor further upstream from the site of the destroyed C. truncata population (HPCC 1991a; J. Obata, pers. comm., 1991). This was thought to be the only known population of this species. An individual from this sterile population was salvaged from pig-damaged areas in 1991 and this individual flowered on June 22, 1993. This individual turned out to be Rollandia crispa (not C. truncata ). A site visit in July 1993 determined that all of the plants previously thought to be C. truncata were actually R. crispa. No individuals of C. truncata were located, though it is possible that juvenile plants could be found in the valley floor (Loyal Mehrhoff, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993). Cyanea truncata typically grows on windward slopes in mesic to wet forests at elevations between 800 and 1,300 ft (240 and 400 m) (HHP 1991b1, Lammers 1990). Associated plant taxa include Hibiscus arnottianus (koki'o ke'oke'o), Diospyros sandwicensis (lama), 'ohi'a, Aleurites moluccana (kukui), Cyrtandra propinqua (ha'iwale), Neraudia melastomifolia (ma'aloa), Pisonia umbellifera (papala kepau), and Piper methysticum ('awa) (HPCC 1991a; Wagner et al. 1990; J. Lau and J. Obata, pers. comms., 1991; L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). The major threats to Cyanea truncata are habitat degradation and predation by feral pigs, competition with invasive alien plant taxa ( Clidemia hirta (Koster's curse) and Psidium cattleianum (strawberry guava)), and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of remaining individuals.
