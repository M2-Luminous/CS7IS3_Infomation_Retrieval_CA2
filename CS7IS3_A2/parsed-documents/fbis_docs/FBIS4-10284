The newspaper quoted the rebel leader as saying: "There is movement among Mexican Army troops to cut off EZLN forces in the zone" in which the EZLN maintains control over various communities. The guerrillas and the government held their first round of talks 21 February-1 March. At the conclusion of the talks, the two sides issued a list of 32 commitments (rebel demands and government proposals). The EZLN then opened discussions among the Indian communities on the government's proposals, but this activity was suspended following the 23 March assassination of ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. Marcos indicated that in order for the consultations to resume, "it is necessary for the Army to reduce its presence and for the ranchers, businessmen, and politicians to suppress their belligerence, at least to the level that existed before the dialogue." Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis recently said peace talks could resume within the next few weeks, but Marcos insists that new conditions are required. The guerrillas have denounced a series of alleged aggressions by the cattlemen, including the killing of an EZLN member by a rancher in Altamirano Municipality.
