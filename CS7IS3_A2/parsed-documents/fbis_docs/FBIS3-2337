From their own experience many units have found it necessary to take the path of comprehensive management. So-called comprehensive management means that under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, the staff, political, logistics, and technical departments of military units cooperate closely; military, political, logistics, and technical officers make joint efforts to conduct management; work in the fields of education, training, management, and logistics guarantees is combined closely; and ideological, administrative, legal, and material means are used comprehensively to exercise across-the-board management over all troops at all times. Troop management and education should also be conducted jointly by military units, local governments, and families of soldiers by various available means in order to establish a systematic management network. Thus, advantages of all quarters may complement each other and achieve comprehensive management results. Comprehensive management embodies the principle of materialist dialectics and reflects the internal regularity of troop management under the new historical conditions. For a long time in the past, many comrades just regarded troop management as a matter concerning the management of internal affairs of troops, such as keeping barracks clean, performing formation drills, and maintaining required standards for appearance and bearing, and regarded this as the tasks of a certain department. This caused some artificial limitations in management work. We admit that an important aspect of troop management is related to organization of the troops' daily lives and duties, the coordination of internal relations, and the maintenance of the internal order. It is the foundation for troop management in all aspects, but it is not the whole of management work. In fact, many problems in troop management are not just administrative problems; instead, they were caused by comprehensive factors and could not be properly solved if only one department was responsible for handling them. Practice shows that management work is related to a wide-range of affairs, comprehensive factors, and day-to-day work in various aspects. Comprehensive management is suited to these characteristics of management work and may ensure that troop management is conducted regularly and scientifically. The key to proper conduct of comprehensive management lies in unifying thinking and strengthening leadership. In the final analysis, comprehensive management needs the mobilization and participation of forces in all aspects. All officers and men, no matter what rank they hold, should take troop management as their own task. Military units should warmly consult local governments and families of soldiers and solicit their help within the scope of their ability. In this regard, if people's thinking is unified, then a solid ideological foundation will exist for comprehensive management. Being a systems project, comprehensive management requires strong leadership to exercise organization and coordination. Party committees at all levels must take this work as a major matter concerning the consolidation of troops in all aspects, and should include it in their work schedules, regularly studying it, settling problems in good time, and coordinating the work of all departments. As long as party committees effectively and properly coordinate everything, a new situation will certainly appear in troop management. Chairman Jiang pointed out when talking with cadets of the National Defense University that it is necessary to strictly enforce troop discipline, strengthen troop management, and effectively manage the troops well. Leaders and departments at all levels and cadres of all sorts should work for the aim of enhancing combat effectiveness, concentrate on troop construction and troop management, take the initiative in studying management skills, make efforts to improve management, and take the path of comprehensive management in order to raise the work of troop management to a new stage as quickly as possible.
