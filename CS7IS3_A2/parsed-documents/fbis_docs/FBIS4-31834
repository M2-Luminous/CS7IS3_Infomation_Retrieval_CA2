This year the organization of the conference was entrusted to the Polish side. What expectations does your office attach to this event? [Saryusz-Wolski] I will not deny that our expectations are quite considerable. The present conference is the largest all-European event that has been organized in our country to date. In that sense it is a kind of test for us: a practical examination of our ability to organize undertakings of this kind. Second, it is the first time that the Europartenariat conference has been held outside the geographical confines of the European Union [EU] . Depending on how well we carry it out, other countries which aspire to EU membership may be given a chance to organize the conference on their own ground in the future. I am thinking here first and foremost of our partners in the Visegrad Group. So, even though most of them are probably very envious of us, we can be certain that they are keeping their fingers crossed for us, too. [Warszewski] But why was Poland selected to host the conference in the first place? [Saryusz-Wolski] Leaving false modesty aside, I can tell you that it was because we have a very good rating in Brussels, that is, in the EU central structures. We head the list of the countries recently associated with the EU in almost every aspect, if not actually in every single "discipline." We are often actually ahead of the EU Commission's expectations in submitting our recommendations and suggestions; we also record the highest economic growth on the whole European continent. Consequently, we regard the fact that we were offered the opportunity to organize the Europartenariat meeting here as a privilege, and at the same time we view it as a serious obligation. We are aware that the EU has watched the standard and quality of the preparatory work we have put into organizing this event very carefully, just as it will watch us during the course of the event itself. I hope that this test will go well for us. In fact, I think that it could go much better than Brussels expects. [Warszewski] Apart from the purely promotional and propaganda significance which it undoubtedly carries, is the Europartenariat important from the economic viewpoint? [Saryusz-Wolski] Its importance lies predominantly in the economic sphere. The promotional aspect is just in addition to that. The Europartenariat is an all-European forum for contacts between medium-sized and small companies. It fosters creation and tightening of close cooperation links. After all, it is precisely that category of companies -- relatively small -- which constitute the most essential basic structures of healthy European economies. They are the first and quickest to react to the signals coming from the markets, they adopt technological innovations with the greatest ease, and they are a particularly effective tool in the fight against unemployment. In this sphere, Poland has quite a lot of ground to cover before it catches up with other countries. Large enterprises still dominate the structure of our industry. This proportion must be reversed as soon as possible, or else our strategic objective, that is, EU membership, will recede into complete unreality. I hope that the Europartenariat is able to successfully accelerate all changes in that direction. [Warszewski] When, in your opinion, will Poland stand a realistic chance of joining the EU? [Saryusz-Wolski] At the moment, no one in Europe is willing to set a precise date for us. However, we believe that there is a chance that we will be entering the new millennium already as fully fledged EU members. As time goes on, we encounter less and less surprise from the other side when we broach this subject. We learn to understand the expectations harbored by Brussels, while Brussels appears to comprehend our aspirations better and better. It is all a rather complex process of mutual learning about each other. Let us hope that this process will be relatively quick. [Warszewski] Professor Richard Baldwin's report on this subject, which received a very thorough review and analysis in POLITYKA not so long ago, is much less optimistic on this point. Prof. Baldwin insists that a true accession to the EU of the countries belonging to the Visegrad Group will realistically take a minimum of 25-30 years. [Saryusz-Wolski] That report is a most misleading and highly tendentious document. We are well acquainted with it. During his latest visit to Poland, EU Commission Chairman Jacques Delors expressed a highly skeptical opinion about it. The report does not actually express the official EU opinion: It is only a study which was financed by the EU Commission. That is a fundamental difference. After all, there are hundreds of different reports circulating around the Commission. Many of them are highly positive in their assessments of our chances. In our view, the Baldwin Report suffers from a number of methodological shortcomings. If you are determined to dissuade someone from something, you will use any means available. We intend to prepare an official public statement in this matter shortly. [Warszewski] But is it not, by any chance, the case that we are not yet altogether certain what kind of Union we will be joining? That organization is at present undergoing a process of most dynamic development. It is not yet completely certain what the transformation result will be. [Saryusz-Wolski] Indeed it is not. However, we do not have too much of a choice. The uniting Europe is for us the only strategic direction for the future. Some time ago I said that we must shoot at the duck not where it is now, but where it will be in the year 2000. I believe that, to a certain extent, this holds true for our situation today. [Warszewski] Assuming that we manage that feat, will the duck turn out to be a tasty dish? [Saryusz-Wolski] That will also depend on us and on whether we succeed in making the best use of the years we have left until we join the EU as a full member. But the Union, too, must learn certain things. I have already mentioned the need for all Europe to engage in a learning process: It goes without saying that it cannot be a one-sided process. Our own transformation prior to our joining the EU is certain to take much time and effort, but in the long run it should ultimately bring tangible advantages to all citizens. A united Europe cannot be decreed by official declarations: It must be a consequence of the beliefs held by its citizens. This is the only way which can lead to a truly united continent. [Warszewski] I understand that the Europartenariat poses itself the same objective. How much shorter will our road to Brussels be after the present conference? [Saryusz-Wolski] It will certainly be shorter, that is beyond question. I can even tell you precisely how much shorter. It will be shorter by the 10th Europartenariat! [Warszewski] Thank you for talking to us.
