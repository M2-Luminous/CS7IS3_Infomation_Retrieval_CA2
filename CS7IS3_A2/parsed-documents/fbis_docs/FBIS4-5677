Akimasa Egawa, head of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry's Broadcasting Bureau, said Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) and commercial television stations will be subject to punishment. Some unsuccessful candidates were reported to be assured of election in the early stage of vote counting in the House of Representatives election in July last year, he said. Egawa said the existing law bars television stations from offering biased reports to viewers. In the general election, NHK and five commercial key stations provided erroneous reports in 19 cases, according to the ministry.
