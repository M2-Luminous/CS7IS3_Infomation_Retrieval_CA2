I would like to speak on the theme of the Iranians [deported to Iran by France]. You said that this was a matter of national interest. National interest is not far from reason of state, and the experience we have of this around the world and in history shows that reason of state is rarely legitimate. My question is: On such an affair, how long can one carry on without giving a substantial explanation? [Lamassoure] We shall see how things turn out. Where the fight against international terrorism is concerned, there are times when it is preferable to keep silent. Believe me, Albert du Roy, everyone will understand. [du Roy] So this is a matter of international terrorism. Please reassure us that it has nothing to do with economic interests. [Lamassoure] No, absolutely not. It is matter of national interest. [du Roy] A last very simple question on this subject: I suppose that The Interior Minister Pasqua is happy with the Government's decision? [Lamassoure] The decision was made by the relevant authorities. Each played his role within the framework of the institutions of the Fifth Republic. [du Roy] So we are no longer trying to terrorize the terrorists? [Lamassoure] We are fighting against terrorism energetically. [du Roy] Another theme I would like to speak about is Russia. [passage omitted] In the program of Mr. Zhirinovsky, who has emerged as the great winner of the Russian elections, there are elements which are clearly imperialistic, even warlike, and there are racist elements. If democracy were to bring him to power, would French aid continue? [Lamassoure] Two things: First, Mr. Zhirinovsky is not the great winner of the last Russian elections. [passage omitted] Second, it is quite clear that we cannot tolerate the kind of comments that Mr. Zhirinovsky has been making. [du Roy] What if he asks to come to France? [Lamassoure] If he continues to make these kind of comments, I do not see how we could welcome him in France. In particular, the kind of comments he made about Bulgaria, about President Zhelev, which are offensive, about the Romanian people, about the Baltic states, Finland, Turkey, and other countries, are totally unacceptable. I would like to tell the representatives of Romania, of Bulgaria, and of the Baltic states that we consider their security as our security, and that we will be very careful to ensure that these countries may enjoy the same security guarantees as do all the other countries of Europe. [du Roy] One last question on this: Should those countries of eastern Europe who so wish be allowed into NATO? [Lamassoure] I do not think that this would be a good solution. The Atlantic Alliance was set up during the cold war to protect us against the Soviet threat and the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet threat no longer exists, the Warsaw Pact no longer exists. The Atlantic Alliance remains. We still need it. We can understand the security concerns of some countries of central and eastern Europe, but an alliance has to face a threat or an enemy. If you were to extend it to half of them, to central Europe but not to Eastern Europe, then those who are excluded will, at best, feel that we are not interested in their security, and at worse that we consider them enemies. If we were to extend it to the whole of central and eastern Europe, but not to Russia, then imagine the reaction in Moscow, whoever is in power in Moscow. Also, if we open it up to Russia as far as Vladivostok, then it is no longer an alliance but a security system. What we are saying in France is that what Europe needs is not an extension of the Atlantic Alliance but a security system in which alliances have their role to play. There will be a NATO summit on 10 January. The Americans have proposed to these countries what they call a partnership for peace. Let us give particular importance to this partnership for peace. What we are suggesting -- what we call the Balladur initiative, the proposal for a conference on stability made by Mr. Balladur and accepted by the 12 -- is that all the countries in central and eastern Europe who have minority problems, cross-border minority problems, who are concerned, should gather around a table to find specific solutions to these problems. The day they find those solutions, then we will give a European and international guarantee to the solutions they themselves have found. [passage omitted]
