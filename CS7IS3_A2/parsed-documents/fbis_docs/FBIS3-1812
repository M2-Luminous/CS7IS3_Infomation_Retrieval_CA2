C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, March 2 (CNA) -- Negotiators from Taiwan and the United States are working together on a patent and trademark reciprocal protection agreement on the third day of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection talks here in Taipei. Chen Tzuo-chen, deputy director-general of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that a reciprocity pact will ensure better protection for inventions by peoples of the two countries. The US delegation to the talks, now in their third and final day, was originally concerned that revisions to Taiwan's patent law did not stipulate jail sentences for violations, Chen said. But American delegates said they were satisfied after learning that the revised law increases fines to the equivalent of twice the damage incurred by violation, he noted. The three-day IPR consultations between Taiwan and the United States are expected to conclude late Wednesday [2 March].
