It is going ahead strictly according to the programme and quite successfully," Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said at a press conference here today. According to Grachev, all forces and materiel, including about 2,300 servicemen, to take part in the peacemaking action, are now concentrated in the conflict zone. Grachev also said that "a large number of U.N. observers, who are carrying out good work", has been functioning in the region. He said he wished if other countries also took part in the peace-making operation aimed at disengaging the conflicting sides and promoting peace in Abkhazia. "We are ready to work under the aegis of the U.N. and even under other commands," the minister said. Grachev expressed regret that "there are no prospects of the U.N. peacemakers' participation in the near future". He referred to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's opinion voiced at their personal meeting. According to Grachev, whether the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) will take part in putting end to the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, will be decided at a meeting of CIS summit meeting scheduled for September. The minister also said it is rather doubtful that any of the CIS states will allocate bigger army contingent than Russia. According to him, one could speak only about a small peacekeeping detachment. Nevertheless, those CIS member-countries, which are only setting up their armed forces, could contribute into financing the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia, Grachev said. Touching upon his meeting with the NATO supreme commander in Europe, Army General George Joulwan, Grachev named cooperation in holding peace-keeping operations as one of the main topics to be discussed in future. Among the major trends of such cooperation, Grachev pinpointed joint planning and holding peace-keeping operations, working out general criteria for their material and technical supplies, and military personnel training.
