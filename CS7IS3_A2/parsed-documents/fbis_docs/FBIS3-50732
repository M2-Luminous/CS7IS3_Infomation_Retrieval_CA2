Despite that honorable stance, during a recent tour of La Habana Province with a group of newsmen covering the sector, he agreed to dispel doubts and even to think aloud about issues yet to be defined. [BOHEMIA] Mr. Minister, in the midst of so many shortages, is it logical to claim that the UBPC will increase production? [Jordan] We all have high hopes. I recognize the need for resources in order to achieve high crop yields. The "microjet" banana, for example, requires fuel for irrigation and the application of potassium, neither of which we currently have. However, if you take constant care of this crop, if you trim the shoots and remove the leaves, make sure the sprinkler gets the plant properly wet, prune the plants at the proper time and get rid of the weeds, you will increase production. That is what we are after in trying to bring man closer to the land that he works. The new system of farming increases the feeling of ownership, economy, and the optimum use of resources. To the extent that we work efficiently in these units--and we are already observing great motivation--with weeded crops, the right population on plantations, and everyone interested in results, you will see success in production despite material limitations. [BOHEMIA] In the UBPC, how many men will be behind desks and how many closely linked to the land? [Jordan] In these cooperatives, all workers are directly involved in production. Depending on the day's activities, the president will also work in the fields because that is where the economy, the yearly plan, is truly designed and also because, like the rest of his community, he is committed to producing. At the present time, three or four persons make up the UBPC administrative staff. The number of reports has been cut substantially. [BOHEMIA] Do you think the enterprises will decline in importance? [Jordan] No. I would say they have more work. What is interesting is the change in their duties. The enterprise no longer administers, but by virtue of its role as the government's representative, it is the organ that draws up the annual plan together with the UBPC, provides technical and material support, buys production, helps supervise and oversee how crops are doing, and observes whether technical requirements and scientific guidelines are being met. [BOHEMIA] In what areas of agriculture will there be no UBPC? [Jordan] They do not all have to have a UBPC. Certain state enterprises such as Isla de Turiguano in Ciego de Avila, for example, do not have to be included in cooperatives. There they have 11,000 head of cattle on 700 caballerias of land. La Cuba in the same province has a plan to reach 140 caballerias of microjet bananas and may continue as it is. It even suits us that they have decided to remain as state entities because we shall be able to make comparisons with the UBPC. Our analyses have shown that certain aspects such as genetics, the fattening of livestock, and special plans to raise mules, horses, buffaloes, and so on, should not change. With respect to citrus fruits, there are places where changes are not possible because they do not have such important infrastructures as housing. In poultry and hog raising, the conditions for change do not exist either because there is not enough feed. [BOHEMIA] In other words, different forms of agricultural production will exist. [Jordan] We shall have the UBPC, the state farms that cannot go into cooperatives because they do not present the right conditions, the CPA [Agricultural-Livestock Cooperative], CCS [expansion not given], and the once fallow land that has now begun to produce in the hands of collectives made up of our comrades. In addition, you have areas allocated for the production of tobacco and the half hectares given to those who set up a kind of family garden as part of the action of the People's Council. [BOHEMIA] What about collection? [Jordan] The organization of the system of collection has been harshly criticized. There are flaws. Products do not arrive on time, there are losses and diversion and so on. Reorganization is a complex task because we must take three different situations into account: the capital, the provincial capitals, and the rest of the country. I do not think there will be any problem with allowing producers to take their harvested crops to sell in the town squares of the municipalities and small towns. However, the case of the provincial capitals and large cities is different because many municipalities tax products. That is where collection mechanisms must be carefully worked out. The most difficult situation is in the capital because as many as 1,200 sales outlets must be in the rural areas. We are currently discussing proposals based on a detailed analysis. [BOHEMIA] Will mobilizations of support diminish with the changes in agriculture? [Jordan] We want cooperatives to have the labor force they need. Some may try to reduce wage costs by cutting personnel, a phenomenon that we must follow closely because it could affect how well crops are cared for. This is why I do not think the development of agriculture can be based on mobilizations, but rather, on the proper use of specialized labor. However, we have to be realistic. Solutions are not just around the corner and mobilizations will still be needed, particularly for peak harvest times, even though I think we shall now be more rational in terms of their number and use. [BOHEMIA] What will be done with production surpluses? [Jordan] It is difficult to speak of surpluses when we have not even managed to raise production to a level that meets the basic needs of the population. I wish our problem tomorrow would be to decide what to do with surpluses! Nevertheless, let us not get ahead of ourselves. I think that when that happens, we shall analyze it as one element that will further stimulate and unleash productive reserves.
