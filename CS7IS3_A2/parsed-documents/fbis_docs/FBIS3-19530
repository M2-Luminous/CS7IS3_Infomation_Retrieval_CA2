[Maudit] Do you understand why people are finding it very difficult to understand this year's budget policy? [Sarkozy] I understand their difficulties all the better given that this year we have broken some old habits. The budget ministers who came before me used to announce an estimated deficit, and subsequently published an operational deficit which bore no relation to the former. This year we are introducing a change which I am very proud of. Our 325.7 billion franc [Fr] deficit for 1993 is even Fr1.9 billion less than the estimated amount. [Maudit] A shrewd reply which, however, leaves the question unanswered. Is this drop in the deficit not in fact explained by certain clever tricks in the presentation of the figures? [Sarkozy] What tricks? The reduction in the deficit depends on the development of both expenditure and income. Overall expenditure is only Fr7.2 billion higher than the initial estimate -- which proves that expenditure limits have been scrupulously complied with. On the other hand, income has surpassed our estimates by Fr9.2 billion. [Maudit] Does this confirm that recovery is under way? [Sarkozy] Precisely, given that this income surplus is essentially due to a rise in VAT [value-added tax] receipts, which increased toward the end of the year. This is the best indicator of a recovery in economic activity. The government is thus harvesting the first results of its policy. [Maudit] The deficit is dropping, but the debt is soaring... Do you believe, therefore, that indebtedness is not the only trustworthy indicator? [Sarkozy] You are talking like a theologian. I am a pragmatist. Both indicators are equally important, because today's deficit is in fact tomorrow's debt, and today's debt consists of yesterday's deficits. It is therefore perfectly true that the state's debt has increased by 38 percent over two years. However, 30 percent of this figure is explained by the increase in the deficit that we have inherited from our predecessors. The remaining 8 percent is explained by the fact that the social security debt has been taken over, and the fact that VAT reimbursements by installments have been abolished. [Maudit] Are you not establishing a precedent by allowing the state to take over the social security debt? [Sarkozy] You know very well that the social security debt existed before we came into office. Quite simply -- and you yourself denounced this old expedient in the past -- our predecessors conveniently left out the social security debt from the government's budget on 31 December, only to bring it back into the budget at a later stage. So, please do not accuse us of having concealed this debt! On the contrary, we have been truthful in disclosing its existence. [Maudit] However, social security will continue to plunge into debt unless the state comes to its rescue. [Sarkozy] I would like to remind you that the prime minister wishes to implement all the necessary reforms to prevent the social security gap from becoming increasingly wider. This is in fact the aim of pension reform, and of the initial measures on health insurance, which will be followed by other savings measures. I am therefore hoping that by taking over the social security debt, the state will be definitely settling the account. What is inadmissible, however, is to have allowed the social security deficit to deteriorate in the first place. That is the real scandal. [Maudit] However, you have yourself authorized a few exceptions to budgetary orthodoxy -- for example, by financing current expenses with the income from privatization, something which Edouard Balladur always refused to do in 1986-1988. [Sarkozy] The prime minister has entrusted me with a very simple task: establishing a budget which will help economic recovery as much as possible. The present context is radically different from the situation that you have just mentioned. In 1986-1988, France was at the height of recovery, and it was therefore unnecessary to support business activity. At that time, it was normal to allocate the income from privatization to subsidizing public companies and to paying off the debt. In 1993, we found the economy in a state of deep recession. I am therefore asking you: Can the same budget be planned for an expansion period as for a recession period? My answer is clearly "no." [Maudit] When recovery begins, you will therefore stop using the state's assets to fill the gaps in the budget? [Sarkozy] An exceptional situation requires exceptional measures. When we are again be able to rely on income from taxation, part of it will be used to reduce the deficit. As a matter of fact, we have committed ourselves to doing so with the five-year law which provides for a massive reduction in the deficit between now and 1997. I am not happy allocating two-thirds of receipts from income tax to reimbursing interests on debts in the 1994 budget. But I have no other choice. When you are faced with a Fr140-billion drop in receipts from taxation, you must still find some means of reviving the French economy. [Maudit] You do not therefore share the view that the budget process is not open? [Sarkozy] What I can tell you is that I am fully prepared to work toward greater openess. The first problem with the budget process is the fact that the most important debates take place at the forecast stage -- when nobody knows what will really happen. When it comes to implementing the budget, then there is no more debate. It would be advisable to change this. No doubt, a debate should take place in parliament when the budget is implemented, in order to draw up the balance sheet. But, believe me, if such a debate were to be held today, I would not be worried in the least.
