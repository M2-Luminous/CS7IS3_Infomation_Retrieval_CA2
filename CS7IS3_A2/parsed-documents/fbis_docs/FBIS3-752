[Mangope] Well, we are undoubtedly in charge of our country. When I say we, I mean my government. [Hefers] But still we have the SA [South African] Defense Force in the streets of Mmabatho and Mafikeng right at this moment? [Mangope] Well, as the result of recent happenings, we have an agreement with the South African Government in terms of which the South African Defense Force, which is in the country, as you say, but they have not taken over -- they are there to help, and that is just that? [Hefers] And are you happy with that situation? [Mangope] Well, so far, I don't see anything wrong with it. [Hefers] Do you think that the presence of the SA Defense Force has played a role in stabilizing the situation? [Mangope] Well I think that has to be put in perspective. My own defense force was very, very, very instrumental, together with the police, that section that has not insurrected; they are very much in charge of the situation, and I think they did a very a [word indistinct] to do to restore in as much as it was within their power to do so. [Hefers] Mr. President, what is the feedback at the moment that you are getting from your people in Mmabatho -- I mean your generals, your cabinet ministers, and so on -- about the situation? [Mangope] The situation is that there has been, I think in the true character of communism, an operation as we have seen it in Eastern Europe, in Russia; this has been typical communism, and a chance to overthrow a legitimate government. And I think I must really pay special tribute to my defense force, to my police, to my security people, and even to my colleagues in the government for the manner in which they had faced this upheaval, which undoubtedly was caused by the African National Congress [ANC], the Communist Party, and perhaps to the littlest extent the National Party.
