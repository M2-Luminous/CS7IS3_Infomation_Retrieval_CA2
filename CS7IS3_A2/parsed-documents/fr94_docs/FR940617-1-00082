FR940617-1-00082 FR940617-1-00012 The agency has evaluated standard textbooks and published data on the effectiveness of isopropyl alcohol used topically on the area prior to an injection (Refs. 3, 4, and 5). The minimum effective concentration of isopropyl alcohol for this use is 70 percent. Further, the agency is not aware of any information concerning the use of isopropyl alcohol below 70 percent for this indication. Therefore, the agency is proposing to include isopropyl alcohol 70 to 91.3 percent in Category I for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation for the limited indication ``for the preparation of the skin prior to an injection''. The Miscellaneous External Panel recommended that drug products containing alcohol and isopropyl alcohol bear the following warning: ``Flammable, keep away from fire or flame,'' (47 FR 22324 at 22330). The agency concurs with the Panel's recommended warning and is proposing this warning in ยง333.450(c)(4) of this tentative final monograph. In order to ensure the warning's prominence, the agency is further proposing that it appear in boldface type and as the first warning immediately following the heading ``WARNINGS''. The agency is aware of ten reports (Refs. 6 and 7) of first and second degree burns occurring in patients undergoing electrocautery procedures. The burns were caused by the ignition of the isopropyl alcohol in patient preoperative skin preparations containing chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone- iodine in 70 percent isopropyl alcohol. The reports indicate that these incidents have occurred despite the presence of detailed warnings in the products' labeling cautioning that the products are flammable until dry and should not be allowed to pool on body surfaces or should not be used in conjunction with electrocautery procedures until dry (Refs. 8 and 9). Based on these reports, the agency tentatively concludes that patient preoperative skin preparations containing isopropyl alcohol in concentrations of 70 percent or more cannot be adequately labeled to allow the safe use of these drug products in conjunction with electrocautery procedures. Therefore, the agency is proposing that patient preoperative skin preparations containing isopropyl alcohol in concentrations of 70 percent or more bear the following label warning: ``Do not use with electrocautery procedures.'' The agency is further proposing that the proposed warning immediately follow the flammable warning being proposed in ยง333.450(c)(4). The agency is not currently aware of any similar incidence occurring with other nonemollient patient preoperative skin preparations containing alcohol in similar concentrations. Therefore, at this time the agency is not proposing that patient preoperative skin preparations containing alcohol identified in ยง333.412(a) bear a warning concerning the use of these products in conjunction with electrocautery procedures. However, the agency will consider extending the warning to patient preoperative skin preparations containing alcohol if new information indicates that this is necessary. The agency invites specific comment and data on the safety of both alcohol and isopropyl alcohol containing patient preoperative skin preparations in conjunction with electrocautery procedures.

The Panel also stated that benzyl alcohol and chlorobutanol were safe, but recommended that the ingredients be categorized as Category II for effectiveness. However, in the first aid antiseptic segment of this rulemaking these alcohol ingredients were reclassified from Category II to Category III for effectiveness as first aid antiseptic ingredients. (See 56 FR 33644 at 33673.) Because no comments, data, or information were received, and because the agency is not aware of any health-care antiseptic uses for these ingredients, benzyl alcohol and chlorobutanol are not being classified in this rulemaking for health-care antiseptic drug products. The agency published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for mercury-containing drug products on January 5, 1982 (47 FR 436). That notice, based upon the recommendations of the Miscellaneous External Panel, proposed to classify OTC mercury-containing drug products for topical antimicrobial use as not generally recognized as safe and effective and as being misbranded. The agency received no comments. The Panel classified the mercurial ingredients, as a group, in Category II; some for lack of safety, some for lack of efficacy, and others due to a lack of both safety and efficacy. However, in the first aid antiseptic segment of this amended tentative final monograph, several mercury-containing OTC topical antimicrobials have been reclassified from Category II to Category III for effectiveness. Mercurial ingredients placed in Category II for safety were not reclassified. The ingredients reclassified are calomel, merbromin, mercufenol chloride, and phenylmercuric nitrate. This change was made in keeping with the revised effectiveness criteria for the drug product category ``first aid antiseptic,'' which were not available at the time the Miscellaneous External Panel evaluated the effectiveness of mercurial ingredients. (See 56 FR 33644 at 33672.) The agency is unaware of any clinical data or marketing history for the use of mercury-containing drug products as health-care antiseptics. Consequently, these drugs have not been classified as health-care antiseptics. In addition, the agency has reviewed submitted data on two combinations containing mercurial ingredients and proposes a Category II classification for these combinations.
