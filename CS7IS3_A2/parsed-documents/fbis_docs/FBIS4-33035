FBIS4-33035 "drlat105_r_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-105 Daily Report 31 May 1994 Peru U.S. Withdrawal of Drug Enforcement Aid, Radar `Lacks Logic' U.S. Withdrawal of Drug Enforcement Aid, Radar `Lacks Logic' PY0106011194 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1807 GMT 31 May 94 PY0106011194 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 31 May (EFE) -- Oswaldo Sandoval, president of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Peruvian Congress, said today that the U.S. decision to withdraw its airplanes and radars supporting drug enforcement in Peru favors drug trafficking. Sandoval said the U.S. decision "is incoherent, and lacks logic, as everyone recognizes that drug enforcement is the responsibility of producers as well as consumers." Sandoval said that without U.S. logistical support in Peru "the mafias could transport drugs without fear of being intercepted by the Peruvian Air Force, which joined the drug enforcement effort with recognized success in 1992." Arnaldo Velarde, Peruvian delegate before the Inter-American Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse (CICAD), said that the interruption of the U.S. aid was decided "unilaterally, and without consultation." Velarde also confirmed that Washington has suspended the flights of its AWAC and Orion airplanes, and has ordered the withdrawal of the radar operating in Yurimaguas that is used to control flights at the Peruvian and Colombian border. Velarde said: "This will greatly hurt drug enforcement, because the Peruvian Air Force lacks the necessary means to detect the airplanes flying on the Colombian border, 99 percent of which are used to carry cocaine." The suspension of aid was recommended by the State Department with the argument that shooting down civilian airplanes suspected of carrying drugs "is a violation of international law." The flights of the AWAC and Orion airplanes, which are equipped with high technology radars, allowed the Peruvian Air Force to detect and intercept the drug trafficking airplanes, which in some cases, when they refused to obey the orders to land, were shot down. Velarde said that Peru will continue "with its own means" the drug enforcement effort, but he indicated that the detection of airplanes carrying drugs "will be slower, difficult, and expensive" without the U.S. aid.
