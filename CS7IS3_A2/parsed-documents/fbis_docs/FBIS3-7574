He said, "I think that unfreezing Japan's participation in peacekeeping forces (PKF) and carrying out PKO, based on the five principles as efforts to contribute to the international community, are the limits of the national consensus." He further touched on the stand of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] on this issue and said: "The SDPJ will agree to cooperate in election campaigns for the House of Councilors. However, it may oppose the plan to review the PKO (Cooperation Law)." Thus, Ichikawa reiterated his view that the agreement between the coalition parties on defense, foreign affairs, energy, and other basic policies are indispensable prerequisites for the future establishment of a new-new party [shin-shinto] and for cooperation in election campaigns for the House of Councilors. Ichikawa denied the possibility of dissolving the House of Representatives to contest a general election under the present multiple-seat constituency system, saying: "Some people are hoping for such a situation. However, we would be trampling on the people's will if we contest (elections) under the current system after the enactment of the Political Reform Law. The current situation will not result in the mass resignation of the cabinet or the dissolution of the Diet."
