A U.S. Government report released Thursday accused Japan and other countries of trade barriers against American goods and services, warning that Washington might take action against them. Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said the U.S. stance shows that Washington has a "lack of understanding" of Japan's willingness to be a good partner of the United States. Kohei Abe, president of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, said the U.S. accusation was "surprising," noting that the report argued that the Japanese industry's procurement from U.S. suppliers was insufficient. Abe said the industry will continue to purchase necessary equipment in a fair manner, without discrimination against foreign suppliers. Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Japan should carefully examine the contents of the report and take necessary steps to avoid possible U.S. sanctions.
