He also talked about the "responsibility" of the "SDF." This revealed the sinister intention of the Japanese reactionaries to drive the "SDF" into overseas aggression, declares NODONG SINMUN today. The news analyst says: The "international contribution" of the "SDF" claimed by the Japanese reactionary ruling quarters is an excuse to justify troop dispatch overseas and the use of arms. By "increasing role" of the "SDF" through the United Nations, aichi meant to step up its military advance and operations overseas by abusing the name of the United Nations. The Japanese reactionaries are these days preaching the inevitability of the use of weapons and battles of the "SDF" units dispatched overseas and calling for malrevision of the "law on cooperation in UN peacekeeping operations," which confines their activities to non-military spheres, and for the "constitutionality" of "military activities under UN command" and "exercise of the right to collective self-defence." Under the cloak of "exercise of the right to collective self-defence" they intend to start military aggression in real earnest on wider areas, major zones of resources and strategic points of the world. Japan today is the world's number two in military spendings. What must not go unnoticed is that the Japanese reactionary ruling quarters are actively promoting Japan's nuclear armament. The Japanese reactionaries must discard the anachronistic militarist mode of thinking and act with discretion.
