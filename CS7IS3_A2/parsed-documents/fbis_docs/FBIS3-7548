Although I do not have all the details, we were lucky since it could have been worse, with one false move turning the incident into a great tragedy. The incident occurred because there are military bases on Okinawa. I feel both deep regret and anger. It is hoped such accidents will not occur in the future. [Miyagi] I question whether there is room for an aeroclub on Kadena Air Base, which is already overcrowded as it is. The people of Kadena have been forced to endure unbearable conditions, with most of their town being taken away and used as a military base under the Japan-U.S. security arrangement. One false move could have turned the incident into a major accident. We will have the matter investigated, and depending on the results we may demand the aeroclub be abolished.
