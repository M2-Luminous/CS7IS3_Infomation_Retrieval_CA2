FR940928-0-00072 FR940928-0-00021 B. Instantaneous Water Heaters and Heat Pump Water Heaters Instantaneous water heaters heat water as it is needed, rather than heating it in a tank and keeping it hot while storing it. An advantage to this approach to water heating is that there is no standby loss with the associated increased cost and loss of efficiency. 47 Instantaneous water heaters can heat water by means of oil, natural gas, or electric resistance, although there are few, if any, oil-fired instantaneous water heaters in production. The DOE test procedure presently contains test methodologies only for gas- and oil-fired models and not for electric. 48 47 Standby loss refers to the energy that is used to keep water hot in the storage tank of a storage type water heater while hot water is not being used. 48 See 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix E. If DOE were to prescribe a test procedure for electric instantaneous water heaters, the Commission would initiate a rulemaking proceeding to consider labeling them. Heat pump water heaters are similar to small room air conditioners. They extract heat from the air around them but, instead of exhausting it to the outside, they use the heat to increase the temperature of the water in a conventional storage tank. They exhaust the resulting cool air into the surrounding area. 1. Feasibility of Labeling The NPR asked whether labeling (as distinct from testing) instantaneous and heat pump water heaters would be economically or technologically infeasible. 49 Five comments addressed this issue. Washington Gas recommended deferring consideration of labeling heat pump water heaters until more information is available on the effects that the climate conditioning of the space around the heat pump water heater have on the product's energy consumption. 50 The other four comments favored requiring EnergyGuide labels on both types of water heaters. 51 GAMA repeated its consistent position that labeling of all water heaters, including instantaneous water heaters and heat pump water heaters, is not technologically infeasible, but is of little benefit to consumers because water heaters are not usually purchased off a showroom floor. GAMA acknowledged, however, that if the requirement to label storage water heaters is to continue, then instantaneous water heaters and heat pump water heaters also should be labeled. 52 CEC, ACEEE, and ALG all favored a labeling requirement for both types of water heaters without qualification. 53 49 See 58 FR 7856. 50 Washington Gas, EE&hyph;1, 1. Because the DOE test is conducted in a controlled environment that requires a constant temperature for the space in which the heat pump water heater operates, this consideration, while relevant to the issue of the product's energy usage in actual service, is not relevant to the values that will appear on the EnergyGuide labels, which are for comparing the energy usage of competing products, not disclosing actual energy usage in the home. 51 GAMA, E&hyph;3, 2, 3; CEC, EE&hyph;2, 4, 6; ACEEE, EE&hyph;3, 2; ALG, EE&hyph;5, 1. 52 GAMA, E&hyph;3, 2, 3. In its recent review of the Rule, the Commission considered and rejected GAMA's suggestion to repeal labeling of water heaters. See 58 FR 34014, 24 (July 1, 1994). 53 CEC, EE&hyph;2, 4, 6; ACEEE, EE&hyph;3, 2; ALG, EE&hyph;5, 1. CEC said, ``Labeling of [instantaneous water heaters and heat pump water heaters] is both economically and technologically feasible. It has been done for storage water heaters for many years. It is only fair for it to be required for other types of water heaters.'' The record does not indicate that labeling for these products is technologically or economically infeasible. Most comments instead favored treating these water heaters like the type already covered by the Rule. Accordingly, the Commission amends the Rule to require EnergyGuide labels for instantaneous water heaters and heat pump water heaters. See section 305.3(d) of ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 2. Revised Definition of ``Water Heater,'' Including Definitions for Instantaneous Water Heaters and Heat Pump Water Heaters The NPR proposed amending the Rule to include the definitions for instantaneous water heater and heat pump water heater that appear in section 430.2 of DOE's rule, but with a proviso, like the one proposed for pool heaters, stating that the Rule's requirements are limited to those products for which there are DOE-prescribed test procedures. 54 The definition in section 430.2 of DOE's rule is supplemented in the test procedure portions of DOE's rule (Appendix E to Subpart B of 10 CFR Part 430). In the NPR, the Commission reasoned that the proposed approach would allow the Commission to avoid repeating the definition limitations in DOE's Appendix E to Subpart B, as well as limitations inherent in the way the test procedure itself is written (for example, by the fact that the DOE test procedure presently does not contain a procedure for measuring the energy usage of electric instantaneous water heaters.) 55 54 See 58 FR 7853&hyph;54. The proposed definition would replace the definition of ``water heater'' currently in the Commission's Rule at 16 CFR 305.3(d)(1&hyph;3). 55 58 FR 7854. Five comments addressed the proposed definition. ACEEE stated that the Commission's adoption of the definition in section 430.2 of DOE's rule with the proposed proviso would be acceptable. 56 GAMA also favored adopting the section 430.2 definition and proviso. 57 CEC stated that the Rule should be amended to include the language in section 430.2, but opposed the addition of the proviso, stating that DOE has developed, but not yet published, an all-inclusive test method. 58 Paloma requested the Commission to adopt the definition for gas instantaneous water heaters from Appendix E rather than from section 430.2, because the Appendix E definition limits the size of the products to be covered. 59 Washington Gas stated that instantaneous water heaters are used with and without a storage tank, and that the minimum flow rate of an instantaneous water heater should be defined if it is to be used without a storage tank. 60 56 ACEEE, EE&hyph;3, 2. 57 GAMA, E&hyph;3, 1. 58 CEC, EE&hyph;2, 2, 4. The referenced proposed test method was announced by DOE on August 23, 1993, at 58 FR 44538, 44547&hyph;48, 44571, along with proposed modifications to the test procedures for furnaces and vented home heating equipment. DOE sought comment on a new ``annual efficiency'' energy descriptor, which would be in addition to the current thermal efficiency descriptor and which would measure pilot light usage and electrical consumption. DOE also sought comment on procedures that would facilitate an estimation of annual operating cost for pool heaters (see also note 35). These proposed modifications to the DOE test procedure for pool heaters were referenced in a subsequent DOE proposal to amend the minimum efficiency standard for pool heaters. 59 FR 10464, 10519&hyph;21 (March 4, 1994). 59 Paloma, E&hyph;2, 1. 60 Washington Gas, EE&hyph;1, 1. Because instantaneous water heaters are not tested under the DOE test procedure with a storage tank, the Rule will not address this issue.
