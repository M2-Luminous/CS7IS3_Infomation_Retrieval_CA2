The statement says: "Regarded from the current historic point, it can be confidently said that devastating developments in the Abkhazian region in 1992-93 have been the largest tragedy for 200 years of Georgia's slavery under the Russian yoke of oppression. Every one of us can clearly understand that the effect of the tragedy is disastrous for the Georgian state and the Georgian nation. We have to make a final inference: Who is our real enemy, who is hiding beyond Abkhaz and Ossetian militants armed with the newest military equipment and who is actually governing Georgia's policy? There is only one answer: The Russian empire, which managed to occupy and annex not only Abkhazia and Samachablo, but the whole Georgia as well, and which, by means of puppet regimes in Tbilisi, Tskhinvali, and Gudauta-Sukhumi, carries out the genocide of Georgians, tears a united body of the Georgian state and encroaches upon the state independence achieved by peaceful means. Every agreement concluded with the alleged mediation of Russia has served this aim and created a foundation for the estrangement of the Samachablo and Abkhazian regions. It may be assumed that a list of anti-Georgian wrecking activities of the puppet regime has not been exhausted. The policy presently conducted in Samegrelo [Russian: Mingreliya] creates grounds for bloody provocation at the Enguri river and augurs the continuation of the genocide of Georgians and disastrous effect for the whole Georgia."
