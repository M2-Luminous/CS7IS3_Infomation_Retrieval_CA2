Despite the constitutional guarantees of the freedom of the press and speech and the law on the independence and impartiality of Slovak Television [STV], the decision adopted by the coalition deputies to recall the STV Council is a gross violation of these legal guarantees. The ZSN points out to our and the world public that the current parliamentary and government practice of implementing the party principle is threatening the independence of the mass media. The coalition political parties, which have a majority in parliament, are, by their conduct, ignoring the Charter on Human Rights and Freedoms and the Council of Europe resolutions concerning the mass media, especially Resolution No. 428/1970 on the mass media and human rights, which emphasizes the media's independence of political supervision, and Council of Europe Recommendation No. 1147/1993 concerning the responsibility of parliaments for the democratic reform of radio and television broadcasting in the countries of Central Europe. We are alarmed by the silence of the democratic press in Western countries over the totalization of political life in Slovakia, the practices of political purges, and the regression to communist normalization by the former entities of the communist party that are today operating within groupings throughout the political spectrum of the coalition. The ZSN appeals to the entire Slovak journalistic community and to professional journalistic organizations at home and abroad for professional solidarity in defending professional and civil rights. From the Point of View of the Slovak National Party: Who Will Be Next? The Slovak National Party [SNS] states that the recall of a substantial part of the Slovak Television Council was carried out on the basis of unconfirmed speculation and unverified documents. It is more than certain that the main reason for the recall is the feeling of a lack of control over STV on the part of the provisional government coalition because the council had been nominated by the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the SNS, although none of its members were members of any party or movement. This was not a matter-of-fact issue, but a purely political decision. This is also borne out by the fact that the coalition's representative, when presenting the proposal for the recall, used an argument that turned out to be erroneous in relation to the materials the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NR SR] deputies had at their disposal--that is, on the issue of the STV Council's Statute. The ruling coalition did not make even the slightest attempt to find a real reason for recalling the STV Council; the vote was held immediately. The SNS feels that what happened in the NR SR during the recall of the STV Council can only be described as a display of arrogance by the current ruling authority and the ruling coalition grouping in parliament. It is necessary to ask once again what or who will be next.
