Presidential hopeful Ruben Dario Carles said on 8 January that should he become president, he would be willing "to negotiate keeping U.S. military bases in Panama." Carles said "there is a Permanent Neutrality Treaty that allows the United States to remain in Panama or intervene in our country if it wants to without having to consult Panama to do so." According to the presidential hopeful, he would be willing to negotiate an agreement that would allow the United States "to stay 10 or 15 years in Howard [Air Force Base], Rodman [Naval Station], or [Fort] Kobbe," provided Panama could export beef, fish, sugar, and other products as compensation. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 10 Jan 94 p 7A) After the Arnulfist Party (PA) and the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena) broke off negotiations, PA President Mireya Moscoso de Gruber announced that conversations have been under way for several weeks with leaders of the National Unity Mission (MUN) and the Independent Democratic Union (UDI) to negotiate an alliance with Moscoso de Gruber as the presidential candidate. MUN President Jose Manuel Paredes and UDI President Jacinto Cardenas met on 11 January with Moscoso de Gruber to discuss details of the presidential slate, which must be approved by their respective party conventions scheduled for 23 and 30 January.

Blades said he will not seek alliances or give up his presidential aspirations, saying: "I cannot transfer the people's support to another person." Blades also urged the other political parties to present their platforms, inasmuch as only the Papa Egoro Movement has presented a government platform. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94) It has also been reported that Guillermo Ford, another presidential hopeful, has said the majority of the Molirena convention delegates will vote for his nomination on 23 January. Ford has reiterated that if he is nominated, "he will not yield the presidential nomination to any alliance." Ford has added that Molirena, the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), and the Solidarity Party will possibly form an alliance and that there is no reason to fear the Democratic Revolutionary Party. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94) The Electoral Tribunal magistrates and the Justice and Peace Commission members met recently to coordinate their work so that the May elections will be held "in an atmosphere of peace and calm." Commission member Bishop Jose Luis Lacunza has warned that political and social differences "must not be solved through violence," and he voiced fears about the many firearms in the hands of civilians. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94) The Electoral Tribunal on 11 January decided that the Popular Alliance (AP) will be unable to participate in the May elections, rejecting its recognition, as it nullified the conventions held by two conflicting factions in October 1993. One faction is led by Omayra "Mayin" Correa and her sister, Noris Correa, while the other faction is led by Matilde Mendez and Tomas Gonzalez. The Electoral Tribunal has said that the two factions have violated the Electoral Code several times. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 12 Jan 94 pp 1A, 8C) PA President Mireya Moscoso de Gruber has disclosed that the Authentic Liberal Party (PLA), the UDI, and the AP have confirmed they will ally themselves with the PA. The Popular Nationalist Party (PNP) and the MUN will reach a decision on 16 January. Gruber has also said that if Molirena remembers that the Arnulfists will head the presidential ticket, "negotiations could be resumed." (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 12 Jan 94 pp 1A, 8C) The AP faction led by Matilde Mendez has appealed the Electoral Tribunal's decision not to recognize the party, noting that the Tribunal has not fully considered all of the evidence, which shows Mrs. Mendez should be recognized as party president. Electoral Tribunal Magistrate Guillermo Marquez has announced that the tribunal will "study the request for a reconsideration of the tribunal's ruling." (Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 12 Jan 94) Molirena legislators are trying to get one of their two presidential hopefuls--Ruben Dario Carles or Guillermo Ford--to give up his presidential aspirations. The legislators met on 12 January with Carles to analyze his candidacy, while they met on 13 January with Ford to exchange viewpoints. RPC Television has learned the legislators are requesting that Ford decline, as Carles seems to have more support within the party. Meanwhile, members of the Social Christian Unity Movement, a dissident faction within the PDC, insist they will support Carles, and they feel that any alliance nominating PDC leader Ricardo Arias Calderon does not stand a chance. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94) Panamanians should be very careful about poll results, and these "should be taken with a grain of salt," Tomas Herrera, president of the Civic Renewal Party, has said, adding that his party has never been included in these polls. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94) PDC presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon has demanded "urgent changes" in various departments of the Attorney General's Office; otherwise, drug trafficking "might take over this government office." Arias Calderon said the Panamanian people seriously mistrust the Attorney General's Office, and the president of the Republic must do something. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94) The PDC presidential candidate, Ricardo Arias Calderon, has also said the law enforcing authorities should remain apolitical. Arias Calderon has said: "I think it is very important that the National Police should stay out of politics." The institution was created to protect all Panamanians, Arias Calderon said during a meeting with young professionals, students, and workers. He also downplayed the results of recent polls, adding that 60 percent of the voters are still undecided. (Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 14 Jan 94)
