FR940812-2-00208 FR940812-2-00074 4. Applicants represent that purchases and sales between Series will be consistent with the policy of each Series, as only securities that otherwise would be bought and sold on the open market pursuant to the policy of each Series will be involved in the proposed transactions. Applicants further believe that the current practice of buying and selling on the open market leads to unnecessary brokerage fees and is therefore contrary to the general purposes of the Act. In order to minimize the possibility of overreaching, applicants have agreed to comply with the conditions discussed below. Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. Each sale of Qualified Securities by a Rollover Series to a New Series will be effected at the closing price of the securities sold on a Qualified Exchange on the sale date, without any brokerage charges or other remuneration except customary transfer fees, if any. 2. The nature and conditions of such transactions will be fully disclosed to investors in the appropriate prospectus of each future Rollover Series and New Series. 3. The trustee of each Rollover Series and New Series will (a) Review the procedures relating to the sale of securities from a Rollover Series and the purchase of securities for deposit in a New Series and (b) make such changes to the procedures as the trustee deems necessary that are reasonably designed to comply with paragraphs (a) through (d) of rule 17a&hyph;7. 4. A written copy of these procedures and a written record of each transaction pursuant to this order will be maintained as provided in rule 17a&hyph;7(f). For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
