ACTION: Notice. In the Matter of: Certain Devices for Connecting Computers Via Telephone Lines. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review the presiding administrative law judge's (ALJ) final initial determination (ID) issued on May 24, 1994, in the above-captioned investigation finding a violation of section 337 in the importation into the United States, and the sale within the United States after importation, of certain devices for connecting computers via telephone lines. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elizabeth C. Rose, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436. Telephone: (202) 205&hyph;3113. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Farallon Computing, Inc. (``Farallon'') filed a complaint on October 12, 1993, pursuant to section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. ยง1337) alleging that 16 respondents had violated section 337 in the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States after importation of certain devices for connecting computers via telephone lines. Those 16 respondents were: (1) ABL Electronics Corp. (``ABL''), (2) Caltechnology International Ltd. (``Caltechnology''), (3) CPU Products (``CPU''), (4) Enhance Cable Technology (``Enhance''), (5) Focus Enhancements, Inc. (``Focus''), (6) Full Enterprises Corp. (``Full''), (7) Good Way Industrial Co., Ltd. (``Good Way''), (8) MACProducts (USA) (now known as DGR Technologies, Inc.) (``DGR''), (9) MicroComputer Cable Co., Inc. (``MCC''), (10) Ming Technology Corp. (``Ming''), (11) Pan International (USA) (``Pan''), (12) Shiunn Yang Enterprises Co., Ltd. (``Shiunn Yang''), (13) Taiwan Techtron Corp. (``Techtron''), (14) Technology Works, Inc. (``TechWorks''), (15) Total Technologies, Ltd. (``Total''), and (16) Tremon Enterprises Co., Ltd. (``Tremon''). Complainant Farallon alleged infringement of certain claims of U.S. Letters Patent 5,003,579, which it owns. The Commission published a notice of investigation in the Federal Register on November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60671). Two additional respondents were subsequently added to the investigation: Ji-Haw Industrial Co., Ltd. (``Ji-Haw''), and Tri-Tech Instruments Co., Ltd. (``Tri-Tech''). See 59 Fed. Reg. 10164 (March 3, 1994). Of the 18 respondents named in this investigation, the Commission has approved terminations based on settlements with respect to the following 16 respondents: ABL, Caltechnology, CPU, DGR, Enhance, Focus, Full, Good Way, Ji-Haw, MCC, Ming, Pan, Shiunn Yang, Techtron, Total, and Tremon. Only respondents Tri-Tech and TechWorks have not settled with complainant Farallon. On April 26, 1994, the ALJ granted Farallon's motion for a summary determination that a domestic industry exists in accordance with subsections 337(a)(2) and (a)(3). The Commission published a notice of its decision not to review that ID on May 24, 1994. See 59 Fed. Reg. 26811&hyph;12 (May 24, 1994). On April 28, 1994, Farallon filed a motion for summary determination of violation of section 337. The motion was unopposed by any respondent and was supported by the Commission investigative attorney. On May 24, 1994, the presiding ALJ issued an ID finding that there was a violation of section 337. The ALJ found that the '579 patent was valid and infringed, that Tri-Tech imported the infringing product into the United States, and that after importation, TechWorks sold the infringing product in the United States. No petitions for review of the ID or government comments were received by the Commission. In connection with final disposition of this investigation, the Commission may issue (1) An order that could result in the exclusion of the subject articles from entry into the United States, and/or (2) cease and desist orders that could result in respondents being required to cease and desist from engaging in unfair acts in the importation and sale of such articles. Accordingly, the Commission is interested in receiving written submissions that address the form of remedy, if any, that should be ordered. If the Commission contemplates some form of remedy, it must consider the effects of that remedy upon the public interest. The factors the Commission will consider include the effect that an exclusion order and/or cease and desist orders would have on (1) The public health and welfare, (2) competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, (3) U.S. production of articles that are like or directly competitive with those that are subject to investigation, and (4) U.S. consumers. The Commission is therefore interested in receiving written submissions that address the aforementioned public interest factors in the context of this investigation. If the Commission orders some form of remedy, the President has 60 days to approve or disapprove the Commission's action. During this period, the subject articles would be entitled to enter the United States under a bond, in an amount determined by the Commission and prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission is therefore interested in receiving submissions concerning the amount of the bond that should be imposed, if remedial orders are issued. Written Submissions The parties to the investigation, interested government agencies, and any other interested persons are encouraged to file written submissions on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding. Complainant and the Commission investigative attorney are also requested to submit proposed remedial orders for the Commission's consideration. The written submissions and proposed remedial orders must be filed no later than the close of business on July 8, 1994. Reply submissions must be filed no later than the close of business on July 15, 1994. No further submissions will be permitted unless otherwise ordered by the Commission. Persons filing written submissions must file with the Office of the Secretary the original document and 14 true copies thereof on or before the deadlines stated above. Any person desiring to submit a document (or portion thereof) to the Commission in confidence must request confidential treatment unless the information has already been granted such treatment during the proceedings. All such requests should be directed to the Secretary of the Commission and must include a full statement of the reasons why the Commission should grant such treatment. See 19 CFR 201.6. Documents for which confidential treatment is granted by the Commission will be treated accordingly. All nonconfidential written submissions will be available for public inspection at the Office of the Secretary. This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), and sections 210.53 and 210.58 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.53 and 210.58). Copies of the ID and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are or will be available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;2000. Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on the matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on 202&hyph;205&hyph;1810. Issued: June 29, 1994. By order of the Commission. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16471 Filed 7&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
