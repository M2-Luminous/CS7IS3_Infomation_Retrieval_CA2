This question is becoming particularly significant at a time when a dialogue with Ankara is being manipulated and U.S. Presidential envoy Matthew Nimetz has begun a new round of contacts in Athens and Skopje. According to reliable information ELEVTHEROTIPIA received from official lips, the current U.S. position is as follows: 1. Relations with Turkey. It is necessary to break the ice. Although "Attila's" [the Turkish troops in Cyprus] presence in Cyprus is a fact, the two countries can begin meetings and reach agreements on secondary issues (tourism for example). This will make bilateral relations easier and will benefit both countries. It will also remove a factor of tension in the Balkans. (Regarding the Cyprus issue, the United States admits that in the past few years it has more or less "forgotten" it and it is not among the top issues of concern). 2. The Skopje Issue. The problem focuses on the name issue. The United States considers all the rest--symbols, constitution--as subsidiary. It stresses emphatically that both sides must show flexibility [previous word in English]; but because Greece is the strongest, richest, and most stable country in the Balkans, it should be the one "to make the first step." In addition to the above "advice," the United States stresses that in no case should Greece consider it an alternative to relations with the European Union [EU]. It stresses: "We are friends with Greece and all of the EU member states." The United States implies that it does not make concessions to any country, especially Greece. This "advice" was expressed after--and obviously during--U.S. President Bill Clinton's meeting with Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in Washington.
