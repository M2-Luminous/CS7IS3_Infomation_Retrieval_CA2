[Franco] The constitutional reforms longed for by the people. The tranquility and normality of the elections. The curbing of inflation. The consolidation of our economic growth. The permanent and effective struggle against starvation and misery. The eradication of all forms of violence. The recovery of self-esteem. Health as everyone's legitimate right and school for all. And finally, for our happiness, winning the World Cup. [Dal Bosco] What should Brazilians expect from President Itamar Franco in 1994? [Franco] Work, being aware of his duties and obligations, maintaining democratic order, and a strict and direct communion and unity of purpose with Brazilian society. [Dal Bosco] Is there any risk of a military coup or a rupture in the democratic order in Brazil? [Franco] No, absolutely not because I firmly believe the political conditions in our country have matured, and the democratic institutions have definitely found their direction. They are becoming more solid as shown by the recent historic events. [Dal Bosco] Having governed for one year, do you believe that your own expectations have been fulfilled? [Franco] I believe so. There is no doubt that Brazil has grown. It has grown to such an extent that this year shows a GDP growth of nearly 5 percent and a 14 percent growth in industrial production. Although, it is obvious that the country still has a very high inflation rate. Therefore, we hope that with Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic plan it will be possible to substantially reduce inflation when fiscal readjustment goes into effect. In addition the government desires the patriotic cooperation of Congress and of all segments of society. Next week I will have been at the head of the government for one year. I am certain that 1994 will be very good for the country. If there is nothing else that I can do, then I will democratically pass the government on to my successor, hoping that he will find a country that is socially more just and economically more solid. [Dal Bosco] Which country would inspire you if you could somehow magically mold Brazil's future? [Franco] I am from the working class, by excellence and by roots, and I have been molded in the class of Alberto Pasqualini (the Rio Grande do Sul State lawyer is considered to be the father of the Brazilian working class. He was a town councillor and a senator, he supported the movement that put Gertulio Vargas in power in 1930, and he was a minister of state under Vargas in 1944. Leader and theoretician of the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], Pasqualini helped to draw up the party's charter. In 1948 he published the Fundamental Directives of the Brazilian Working Class, which was adopted as the bible of the PTB. In the publication, he defends the thesis of extirpating "social usury" from the country, something that is contained within the economic relations that do not take social justice into account. Pasqualini died in 1960 at the age of 58). [Dal Bosco] Are you sure that Fernando Henrique Cardoso's plan will be successful? [Franco] It is not Cardoso's plan. It is a government plan. But I can tell you something: I will not allow the country to fall into a recession, but that is not the case. Never in modern history has someone supported an economy minister as I have supported Minister Cardoso. I have just lost two excellent advisers because they disagreed with the economic plan. One of them is an excellent ambassador (referring to former Culture Minister Geronimo Moscardo) and the other is a loyal party leader and a very good fighter (referring to Deputy Roberto Freire). [Dal Bosco] What do you intend to do if you become convinced that the plan will lead to a recession? [Franco] If that should happen, something which I do not believe, I will tell the minister to stop and we will have to find another alternative. [Dal Bosco] There are those who contend that you, Mr. President, support [Finance] Minister Fernando Henrique [Cardoso] from a technical standpoint, but that in your heart, you agree with former [government] leader Roberto Freire, who criticizes high interest rates and recession. [Franco] The heart has reasons that the mind itself cannot fathom. [Dal Bosco] How so, Mr. President? [Franco] Simply that -- the heart has reasons that the mind itself cannot fathom. [Dal Bosco] Are you, Mr. President, in favor of the reinstatement of the 100,000 civil servants that were dismissed during the Collor administration? [Franco] I am in favor of injustices being redressed, period. Our first proposal originally contemplated only the re-examination of those cases that involved a flagrant breach of the law or an injustice. Furthermore, even according to the most pessimistic estimates, those cases do not add up to 100,000. If the project were to be passed by the Senate, to maintain its original spirit and become law, we would then re-examine the cases of those who believe they have suffered some damage and plead their reinstatement on a case-by-case basis. The reinstatement will never be automatically done. [Dal Bosco] Are you personally in favor of ending the state's monopoly in the oil industry and telecommunications in the constitutional reform? [Franco] Personally, I am not. However, one has to bear in mind what decisions and alternatives are the most appropriate ones for the historical moment we are living in Brazil and for the current economic and social order. [Dal Bosco] The CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] ... [Franco] (interrupting) The CPI is an affair that pertains to Congress. [Dal Bosco] Would it be possible to strike an alliance between the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] for the forthcoming presidential elections? [Franco] What I can tell you with regard to the elections, is that the three coming months -- January, February, and March -- will be decisive for the country, since during that period party affiliations will be decided, government officials who campaign for election will have to resign, the economic plan will be under way, and the CPI will issue its final report. [Dal Bosco] Do you believe, Mr. President, that PC [Farias] and former president [Fernando] Collor are scheming against you? [Franco] I do not think that PC is involved in such a thing. My relationship with him was limited to the election campaign. I spoke with him on very few occasions. [Dal Bosco] And how about former President Collor? [Franco] I think that he is. I read about the accusations he leveled at me in VEJA, but did not want to answer them. However, after thinking about it, I decided to write some lines. (The president excuses himself, leaves the room, and comes back with a typescript in his hand. He slowly unfolds the paper and reads the following:) "From the Olympus, located in the celebrated Casa da Dinda [Collor's official residence in Brasilia], that deposed little god fires his machine gun of half-truths and insidious innuendoes seeking to smear other persons' honor. It seems a most coherent attitude with the personality and feelings of those who disdain other persons' uprightness because they do not have it." This is the first time that I have responded to that individual. Up to now, I had tried to show my respect for and keep my distance from the former president of the Republic. [Dal Bosco] Mr. President, does PC Farias' ghost check deposited in the account of your secretary Geraldo Faria exist after all? [Franco] If there was a ghost check, we did not know about it at that time. Furthermore, who would have imagined the possibility of the existence of ghosts back in 1989? There is a check for the campaign, but it has not been issued for the absurd amount that is being said. (Franco refers to the rumor that it was a check for $700,000, when in fact the only one found was for $145,000). Besides, Faria is a very tidy person. He kept all the documents, notes that prove where the money was spent. The checks for the campaign were even deposited in other accounts. My account has absolutely nothing. PC Farias or anybody else may say whatever they want. But, why should only the election campaign in Minas Gerais be under scrutiny? Especially in the case of Geraldo Faria, who was not the treasurer general of the campaign. Are the 1989 election campaigns of all candidates being delved into? Former President Collor is facing charges for what he did during his presidency. One should make it clear that the Superior Electoral Court approved the PRN's [National Reconstruction Party] accounts at that time. Why study them now? I, Itamar Franco, was neither coordinator nor treasurer at either regional or national level. That was no concern of mine. [Dal Bosco] The Federal Police seized one of P.C. Farias' personal appointment books, where he had marked a meeting with you for April 1990, during Fernando Collor's government. Do you remember that meeting? [Franco] I did not see Paulo Cesar Farias after the campaign ever again. I never called him P.C. because our relations were always formal. I do not remember having talked to him after Collor took over power. This is why there is no way I could have negotiated the nomination of Eliseu Resende to head Vale do Rio Doce with him. President Collor recommended Resende to head Furnas [Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc], not Vale. Resende was told of his appointment before the swearing-in ceremony, when he was still at his former public office. [Dal Bosco] In 1990 you purchased a D-20 pickup truck, and then exchanged it for two cars. What is the story behind that? [Franco] I reported everything to the tax department. I kept the pickup truck for only a few days. I answered some questions about the matter then. I am almost sure that I also sent a copy with explanations to Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. I do not have copies of the documents here, but I can show them to you later. [Dal Bosco] A D-20 pickup truck is worth nearly $35,000. Did you have the money to buy the truck? [Franco] Of course I had the money to buy it. Otherwise I would not have made the deal. I did not steal the pickup truck. My tax record shows that everything was in order. [Dal Bosco] Does a Republic of Juiz de Fora really exist? Do you ask its people before making a decision? [Franco] Such a republic has never existed, nor will it ever exist. But there is a town called Juiz de Fora that is very dear to me. It is not only a picture hanging on a wall. Before making a decision I usually hear the opinions of a large variety of people, as well as my own heart. [Dal Bosco] Why did you decide to work in Rio de Janeiro this week? [Franco] There is a very simple reason. I had more than 20 requests for audiences from people or groups established in Rio de Janeiro. I simply decided to receive those people in the city. [Dal Bosco] Didn't you want to send a message to the country indicating that everything was calm? [Franco] It might be understood that way. There is calm and tranquility in the country. There is no need for the president of the Republic to stay in Brasilia. The country has its democratic order ensured, and there are no risks. I can tell you before you ask that I never thought of resigning as president of the Republic. [Dal Bosco] Are you tired? Do you wish you could take some days off to rest? [Franco] The other presidents did not have vacations, either. As far as I can remember the only exception was President Getulio Vargas. He used to spend a few days at the Palacio Rio Negro, in Petropolis, in Rio de Janeiro. The president should have some 20 days or so to rest, in a place of his choice, in Brazil. Obviously he could not be traveling back and forth. He would stay at a single place. I only have one more year as president, and I do not think of that possibility. But I will ponder about the idea, for the future. After all, everyone has the right to some rest: journalists, physicians, lawyers, the president of the Republic. I need the Brazilian press to understand that, too. Society, I am sure, understands it. [Dal Bosco] Why did you lose patience with the press in Juiz de Fora? [Franco] I recall very well an O GLOBO photographer asking me when I left my apartment whether I wanted to talk. I answered no, and left for a friend's place, but journalists followed me. I think they should not do that, but I understand that it is their job. When I arrived at my friend's house, the housekeeper, who is a humble person, asked the journalists to withdraw. No one listened. They invaded private property and followed the car. They entered nearly 70 meters inside the property. This is no way to earn respect. If they wanted to take my picture they had a chance when I left my apartment. I think the incident showed a lack of respect. Where I come from you do not enter someone else's house without knocking at the door first. You only trespass through an open door if it is a church. I would not walk into a friend's house without knocking, even if the door was open. It is a matter of good manners. One of these days we will have a more serious incident. Journalists will find a more courageous housekeeper or security guard. [Dal Bosco] But wouldn't a security team avoid the problem? [Franco] No. I think the incident could have been worse. I politely asked the reporters to leave. Security guards could have beaten them. I believe that with security guards it could have been worse. To tell you the truth I would rather drive my own car. I don't drive one because I don't like driving. [Dal Bosco] With no security guards, don't you fear an attack? [Franco] Security is necessary, but it depends on where I am going. I want to have political and democratic visibility. When I am in my hometown with my daughters I do not think the bodyguards are necessary. Concerning a possible attack, I have no fear. U.S. presidents move in armored helicopters and limousines and they still die. Bodyguards would not prevent someone from killing me. [Dal Bosco] Is it true that pompous ceremonies at Planalto Palace bother you? [Franco] Ceremonies with much ostentation I do not like. I think they are too artificial. But I do obey the rules. I do everything the protocol chief orders. But I try to do it in the simplest manner. For instance, the granting of credentials to ambassadors was a pompous ceremony. I even had to wear black tie. Why wear black tie to receive ambassadors? The simpler ceremony is more human. I think most people also think that way. They tell me they would rather have simpler ceremonies. [Dal Bosco] Are you dating someone? [Franco] Who knows? I do not want to talk about it. I do not talk about my intimate life. I do not ask a reporter whether she is dating someone, or whether she is in love (laughs). [Dal Bosco] What do you like doing on weekends? [Franco] Exactly what I am doing now: meeting with friends and listening to a good piano player. (At this moment President Franco is meeting with friends at the Brasao Restaurant, in Juiz de Fora, where he goes every time he is in town. Before, as special guest of the group, he attended the graduation of his daughter Georgiana, who studied law at the Vianna Junion Law School. At the Brasao, he drank beer and ate meat and cheese pie. At the piano, Professor Maria Teresa Lerdersnaier, from the Music Conservatory, played: Love is a Many Splendored Thing, Bolero by Ravel, and the theme of the movie Casablanca, As Time Goes By. The piano player has been playing for Itamar Franco for more than 15 years, and whenever the president is in town, she goes to the Brasao in his honor). [Dal Bosco] Is it good being the president of Brazil? [Franco] It is not a question of its being good or bad. It is, above all, a task, and has its gratifying aspects, while other decisions and solutions are difficult. [Dal Bosco] What have been your best and worst days in the presidency? [Franco] The happiest day I could not say. But one of the saddest days was when my mother died on 9 December 1992. [Dal Bosco] How would you like to be remembered by Brazilians? [Franco] It will be up to history, with its impartiality, to record that.
