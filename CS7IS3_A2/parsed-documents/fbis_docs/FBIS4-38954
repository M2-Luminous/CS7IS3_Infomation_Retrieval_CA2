Therefore, Meshkov said, he did not insist on immediate approval of government ministers, but suggested that presidential decrees be given the force of law in full compliance with the results of the March 27 republican referendum. "I believe this proposal need not any discussion, since it reflects the people's will and should be put to vote right now. The more so as this is critical to the Crimea, for it enables to promptly respond to the fast-changing situation in the republic and about it", the Crimean president noted. The draft law on legislative acts passed by the president provides for endorsement of presidential decrees on issues not regulated by the republic's legislation and parliament. However, many speakers at today's parliament session pointed out that the draft law contradicted the Crimean Constitution and allowed the president to put his decrees into force not waiting for parliament to approve them. Furthermore, Meshkov has not yet signed the Crimea's restored Constitution of May 6, 1992, which for this reason cannot be considered effective at the moment. After heated debates, the majority of lawmakers representing the Rossia faction voted to remove this issue from the agenda. The parliament passed a decision on a three-kilometer-wide zone along the coast of both the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, in which land plots can be allotted only with parliament approval. It was also decided to set up a temporary commission to examine all the plots allocated in this zone in the period of 1992-94 to ensure compliance of their acquisition with law. After that, lawmakers got down to debates over the structure of the Crimea's new parliament.
