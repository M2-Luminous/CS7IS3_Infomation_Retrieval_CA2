FR940926-0-00034 FR940926-0-00010 Most commenters supported the proposal to incorporate NGV2 into the Federal standard. However, AAMA and Ford opposed the design and material specific approach of NGV2. III. Agency's Decision A. Overview In today's final rule, NHTSA is issuing a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard, Standard No. 304, Compressed Natural Gas Fuel Containers, that specifies performance requirements applicable to a CNG fuel container's durability, strength, and venting. A pressure cycling test evaluates a container's durability by requiring a container to withstand, without any leakage, 18,000 cycles of pressurization and depressurization. This requirement helps to ensure that a CNG container is capable of sustaining the cycling loads imposed on the container during refuelings over its entire service life. A burst test evaluates a container's initial strength and resistance to degradation over time. This requirement helps to ensure that a container's design and material are appropriately strong over the container's life. A bonfire test evaluates a container's pressure relief characteristics when pressure builds in a container, primarily due to temperature rise. In addition, the final rule specifies labeling requirements for CNG fuel containers. As previously mentioned, the agency has issued a final rule establishing a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard, Standard No. 303, Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles, that specifies vehicle performance requirements applicable to the fuel system of a CNG fueled vehicle. As explained in that final rule, the fuel system integrity requirements are comparable to those requirements in Standard No. 301. Like that Standard, the new requirements limit the amount of fuel leakage in specified frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash tests for light vehicles and a moving contoured barrier crash test for school buses with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds. NHTSA believes that CNG containers must be evaluated in all possible failure modes and environments to which they may be subjected. Since the requirements contained in today's final rule do not address all these situations, the agency is currently investigating other possible requirements for CNG fuel containers and anticipates issuing a SNPRM that would propose performance requirements applicable to such characteristics as a CNG fuel container's internal and external resistance to corrosion, brittle fracture, fragmentation, and external damage caused by incidental contact with road debris or mechanical damage during the vehicle's operation. The agency tentatively believes that these additional performance requirements are critical for determining a CNG container's safety. In addition, the agency anticipates proposing additional labeling requirements that should provide critical safety information about inspecting a CNG container and its service life. NHTSA notes that it has no statutory authority to regulate certain aspects involving CNG containers, including inspection requirements during the manufacturing process, in-use inspection requirements, and retest requirements during use. B. Adopting Industry Standards In the NPRM, NHTSA explained its decision to propose pressure cycling and burst tests and requirements. While the agency's proposal was based on NGV2, the agency decided not to propose certain provisions of the voluntary industry standard that the agency tentatively believed might unreasonably restrict future designs. Similarly, NHTSA decided not to propose regulations issued by the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) 5 for CNG storage containers used on motor vehicles, explaining that the RSPA regulations do not address the conditions unique to the motor vehicle environment (e.g., increased cycling due to refueling and pressure relief when the cylinder is less than full). NHTSA further explained that in contrast to RSPA, NHTSA does not typically regulate design and materials since NHTSA is statutorily directed to issue performance-based safety standards. 5 RSPA is an administration within the United States Department of Transportation that among other things regulates the transportation of hazardous materials. NGVC and several CNG container manufacturers stated that NHTSA should adopt the voluntary industry standard that has been developed by the CNG industry working group. In support of this request, the American Gas Association (AGA) cited a 1982 Office of Management and Budget Circular that states ``It is the policy of the Federal Government to (a) Rely on voluntary standards *␣*␣* whenever feasible and consistent with law and regulation pursuant to law *␣*␣*.'' AGA and NGVC believed that the voluntary standards provide a higher level of safety than the regulations proposed by NHTSA. They further stated that if NHTSA were unable to adopt NGV2 due to its prescriptive nature, then NHTSA should still allow automobile and equipment manufacturers the option of certifying to the industry standard by referencing NGV2 in the regulations. In promulgating a CNG container standard, NHTSA has sought to the extent possible to adopt the tests and requirements set forth in NGV2. NHTSA was limited in its ability to do this by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Safety Act, 49 U.S.C. 30111), which commands the agency to issue ``motor vehicle safety standards'' as minimum standards of motor vehicle performance that are practicable, meet the need for motor vehicle safety, and are stated in objective terms. NHTSA found it necessary to modify certain elements of NGV2 to be consistent with this statutory mandate. For instance, the agency has not incorporated those aspects of NGV2 that are stated in nonobjective terms (e.g., a container shall not show ``evidence'' of deterioration or failure) NHTSA has decided to incorporate NGV2's design and material requirements since the agency has been unable to find or develop a meaningful dynamic performance requirement that would adequately evaluate a container's initial strength and susceptibility to degradation over time. The agency believes that the requirements are no more specific than necessary to achieve these safety purposes. NHTSA notes that it would be impermissible under the Safety Act for the agency to adopt FMVSS provisions referencing NGV2 in its entirety and stating that automobile and equipment manufacturers had the option of certifying compliance to NGV2 by referencing this voluntary industry standard. The Safety Act provides for manufacturer self-certification with respect to FMVSSs only. To be part of a FMVSS, the provisions of a voluntary industry standard must fully meet all of the requirements of the Safety Act. Since all of NGV2 does not meet these requirements, NGV2 may not be incorporated in its entirety. Even if NGV2 met these requirements, NGV2 could not be incorporated in the FMVSS except to the extent that the FMVSS made compliance with NGV2 mandatory. C. Pressure Cycling Test In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed pressure cycling requirements that would require that the fuel container withstand a cycling test at ambient temperature, without any leakage or deformation exceeding one percent of any circumference. In the test, the container would be hydrostatically pressurized to the service pressure, then to not more than 10 percent of the service pressure, for 13,000 cycles. The container would next be hydrostatically pressurized to 125 percent of the service pressure, then to not more than 10 percent of the service pressure, for 5,000 cycles. The cycling rate would not exceed ten cycles per minute. 1. Number of Cycles The proposed cycling requirements were intended to establish minimum levels of safety performance for the durability of CNG fuel containers used in motor vehicles. The agency stated its tentative belief that the requirements are consistent with provisions in NGV2 and with RSPA regulations for containers used to transport CNG. The agency believed that the pressure cycling requirement would help to assure that a CNG container is capable of sustaining the cycling loads imposed on the container during refuelings. The number of cycles specified in the proposal, 13,000 plus 5,000, is representative of four refuelings per day, 300 days per year, for 15 years. AAMA, Norris, and Thomas commented on the number of pressure cycles. These commenters stated that the proposed number of cycles was excessive and not representative of the actual operating conditions the CNG containers would typically experience. AAMA and Norris stated that cycling the container at 125 percent of service pressure for 5,000 cycles would be adequate. Thomas made inconsistent statements about the appropriate number of cycles. On the one hand, it stated that 9,000 cycles at service pressure would be more reasonable than the proposed number of cycles. On the other hand, it stated that the agency should adopt NGV2 which specifies 18,000 cycles.
