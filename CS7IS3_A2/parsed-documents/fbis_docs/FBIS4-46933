FBIS4-46933 "jpusr062___94044" FBIS-USR-94-062 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 4 June 1994 RUSSIA REGIONAL AFFAIRS Vladivostok May Price Increases Noted Vladivostok May Price Increases Noted 944F0778B Vladivostok VLADIVOSTOK in Russian 4 Jun 94 p 3 944F0778B Vladivostok VLADIVOSTOK Russian CSO [Report by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Mark Viktorov: "Minimum Wage Currently Equals the Cost of 13 Loaves of Bread"] [Text] According to the kray statistical administration report, the greatest price increases in May were registered with respect to for-fee services for the population--8.8 percent; prices for foodstuffs and consumer goods rose, respectively, by 6.2 percent and 6 percent. Within the foodstuffs category, the greatest price increases occurred with respect to cereals--by more than 14 percent. For instance, the price of polished rice rose by 17 percent. Prices for quick-frozen fish (not including gourmet varieties) rose by 12.5 percent. The last week, however, was marked by a certain decline in prices for milk and products made of it. In particular, milk prices declined by 2.1 percent: from R1,096-R1,073 in the kray on average. It should be noted that rye bread--whose price, by the way, rose by 40 percent last week, from R773 to R1,087 per kg--was not available for sale anywhere in the kray except in Vladivostok. Despite the fact that, as statistical data show, food prices rose at a somewhat slower rate, their range in different cities and rayons continues to vary greatly. For instance, prices for macaroni items differ by a factor of three: While the cheapest macaroni is sold in Vladivostok (R662 a month), the most expensive ones are in Pogranichniy Rayon (R2,100). At the same time, Vladivostok is the leader in milk products cost. The same applies to very expensive meat products and imported sausages. As to our own bologna, which is affordable for our population, it is practically impossible to find it in the stores. The exception is the Vladivostok meat combine's own store. Those whose refrigerator, washing machine, or vacuum cleaner broke down, discovered in May that the cost of their repairs went up by 25 percent. For instance, the cost of repairing the refrigeration unit in a refrigerator increased from R133,000 to R165,000. Barber salon services also cost more now. For instance, men's fancy haircut now costs more than R7,000, and the cost of chemical permanent increased to R16,500. The cost of car maintenance service increased over a month from R105,000 to R122,000. Prices for tickets for concerts and the circuses increased over May by almost one-third. For instance, while in April one ticket to a concert cost in the kray on average R20,000, in May it cost R26,000. The cost of housing and municipal services increased almost 1.5-fold over last month. However, as VLADIVOSTOK has already reported, beginning 1 June these services will cost many times more.
