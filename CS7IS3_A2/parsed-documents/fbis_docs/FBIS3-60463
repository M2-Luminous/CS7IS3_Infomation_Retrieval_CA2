From what he said, the overall level of cases of influenza does not exceed the normal level. The number of cases is not increasing, but decreasing. According to N. Malyshev's prediction, in the near future you can scarcely expect a big surge in the number of cases of influenza. By way of preventive measures, he recommended that the inhabitants of the capital should toughen themselves up, take fresh air, plenty of fluids, lemon, and honey, and by way of medicines -- Dibasol. At the same time, according to Moscow's main infection specialist, "I find diphtheria a far greater headache." N. Malyshev reported that between the beginning of this year and 25 November 2,001 patients with diphtheria have been registered in Moscow, including 458 children. In the same period of time, 86 people have died of diphtheria. A total of 316 new people suffering from diphtheria have been registered in November alone, including 188 children. The number of people with diphtheria has trebled in comparison with the same period last year. Fatalities from this disease are increasing even more. "The only effective preventive measure is vaccination," N. Malyshev stressed. According to figures from the Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision, the level of intestinal diseases has risen again since June 1993 following a number of very favorable years in Russia. In 1992, for instance, the lowest level of cases of dysentry was recorded in the whole period of the official registration of this disease (since 1970). However, in the first eight months of this year, the number of people suffering from dysentry has risen in the Russian Federation in comparison with the same period last year by 21.2 percent. The greatest increase was in the northern and northwestern regions. In all, during the eight months, information about 30 outbreaks has come to the attention of the Russian State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision. Cases of cholera have also been registered. In July-August, 11 Russian citizens who returned from India, Pakistan, and Turkey were diagnosed as having cholera. Two cases have been identified in Dagestan and Stavropol Kray.
