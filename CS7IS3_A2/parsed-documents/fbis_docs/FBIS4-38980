Also, a Russian serviceman headed for Estonia must inform Estonian authorities about his concrete task in the withdrawal process. Anatoly Chizhikov, the military attache at the Russian embassy in Tallinn, told BNS the embassy received May 12 from the Estonian Foreign Ministry a description of the procedure established to control the entrance of Russian military into Estonia, which contains the stipulation concerning the withdrawal timetable. Chizhikov said it is "absolutely unacceptable" to the Russian side, especially with regard to the higher command of the Baltic Fleet or the Northwest Army Group. "It would mean that the commander in chief of the Baltic Fleet or the Northwest Army Group would upon entering Estonia have to present a schedule for the pullout of all fleet or army units, respectively. The government delegations have for two years been unable to reach agreement on the timetables, and now it is demanded from servicemen," the Russian officer said. Foreign Ministry spokesman Juri Arusoo told BNS that the ministry indeed sent May 10 a note to the Russian Embassy to regulate the order of entrance into Estonia of Russian military. Arusoo said the reason behind the note was that "trips by the military became too frequent, so (we wanted) to make sure they wouldn't be to-ing and fro-ing for no reason." Arusoo explained the demand to present the timetable only applies to "military men of a certain level." "Of course exceptions can be made to every rule and the higher command are not required to present upon entrance to Estonia the schedule for the withdrawal of all units under them," the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
