Together with the Czech Republic, Slovakia advocates shortening the term for removal of customs and non-tariff barriers from eight to five years. Economic ministers of the four CEFTA countries -- the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland -- are expected to approve speeding up the liberalisation of mutual trade on February 4. "We do not want to slide back to the times of COMECON [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance], but want to revive trade among Central European countries," Miroslav Adamis, director of the Multilateral Cooperation Section at the Slovak Ministry of Economy, told CTK today. He said CEFTA's importance resides in liberalising trade, even though it does not free financial flows, capital and labour. It will thus enable its member countries to see what is in store for them when they join the free market of the 12-member European Union. The use of European Union rules on the origin of goods at the same time supports cooperation of enterprises from CEFTA countries in penetrating Western markets. "The CEFTA countries have not yet coped with the decline of trade after the transition to accounting in freely convertible currencies in 1991, when it turned out that our goods could not compete with Western offerings," Adamis said. "CEFTA's reviving influence did not manifest itself more even when further decline stopped. Last year's trade turnovers with Poland and Hungary remained on the level of 1992. But this year CEFTA can be expected to bring results," he added. Around one-half of the trade turnover is fully liberalised, according to Adamis, and the next stage of removal customs duties will begin in July. Most industrial products will be freed from customs duties before 1998. But even shortening the original term for removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers from eight to five years will not free all goods from the "protective umbrella." Adamis said he believed there was no political will to accept other countries to CEFTA, but that cooperation could be expanded through bilateral agreements on free trade, especially with Slovenia, Romania and possibly also with Turkey and Israel. The Czech Republic remains Slovakia's main trade partner.
