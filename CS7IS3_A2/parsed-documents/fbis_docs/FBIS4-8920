Buha said in an interview to Obrenovac radio that `Mr Churkin had a very ambitious plan to turn partial peace in Gorazde into a lasting ceasefire in the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would give sense to the former, but the Moslems rejected the global plan so that very little has remained of the partial plan.' `Faced with the current situation, it is possible that Mr Churkin was afraid of possible further developments so that his statement that talks with Serbs should be discontinued was made in the heat of the moment,' said Buha. Over the weekend, Churkin and head of the U.N. mission in Former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi mediated talks on ending hostilities between the Bosnian Moslems and Serbs. We agree with Churkin that his country, Russia, must act as a great country which it is, i.e. with responsibility, but we also believe that it should use the right words to address other problems elsewhere and that a small country like ours should not be the mirror of its greatness, he said. Reacting to Churkin's statement, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations Yuriy Vorontsov said that the Russian Government and President Boris Yeltsin did not stand behind it. Buha denied that there were any significant disagreements between the S.R. political and military leaderships, adding that there were only some minor differences. Asked whether the return of Lord David Owen marked also a return to Geneva talks, Buha said that the peace talks should have stayed in Geneva. Future Geneva talks must start from the fact that, after the creation of the Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia, there are currently two entities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Buha said and added that the talks should be held in two phases. In the first phase, the two states should be delineated while in the second agreement should be reached on possible future ties between the Moslem-Croat federation and the S.R., he said. Under U.S. pressure, the Moslems and Croats last March signed an agreement on forming a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia, which would subsequently form a confederation with Croatia. The Serbs were not invited to the talks.
