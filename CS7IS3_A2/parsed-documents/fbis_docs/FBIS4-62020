Kohl was speaking at a supper hosted by him in honour of Russian President Boris Yeltsin at the Petersberg Government Residency today. The chancellor emphasised that the German people are for new democratic Russia's integration into the circle of democratic industrial states. This is the reason why the Germans favoured Russia's inclusion, as broadly as possible, into the political part of the "G-7" summit, he said. According to him, Germany's Western partners expect from Russia constructive cooperation in settling European and international crises. Helmut Kohl recalled that the last of the Russian troops will leave the German territory in August this year. "This will not only be drawing a line under the post-war history of Europe. We are united in saying that this gives our countries a special opportunity for strengthening and widening new friendship and partnership. That is why we wish to mark the withdrawal of Russian military personnel together in a solemn and fitting form," he said.
