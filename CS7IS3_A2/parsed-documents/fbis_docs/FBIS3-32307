The report adds that in this context, the Secretariat maintained relations with more than 300 cities from different countries of the world. Outstanding among these was Spain, where 200 towns contributed support. Buses, street cleaning equipment, ambulances, and school and automotive equipment were part of the donations made in 1993 in an effort to alleviate the shortages prompted by the U.S. blockade and the demise of the international socialist community.
