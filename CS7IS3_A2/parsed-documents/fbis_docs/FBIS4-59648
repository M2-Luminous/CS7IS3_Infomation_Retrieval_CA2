[Musa] The talks dealt with many issues. These included bilateral issues, regional issues pertaining to the Middle East and Africa, and international political and economic issues. Therefore, the talks with the prime minister, the foreign secretary, other ministers, and members of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee were exhaustive and detailed. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What was your impression regarding British attitude to these issues, considering that these important issues are of interest not only to Egypt but to the entire Middle East area? [Musa] I detected British interest in these issues. We are interested in talking to all influential states about a number of problems, including, for example, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the peace process in the Middle East, and the situations in the Gulf, South Africa, and Somalia. All these issues are of interest to a large number of states, the important states. This is what prompts us to act on the international level. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What is the significance of your current visit to London at this particular time? [Musa] The purpose of the visit is to hold consultations, particularly during the important period preceding the resumption of the peace process on the other tracks. The purpose is also to consult on the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, the new era that has begun in South Africa, the critical situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in which Britain is playing a big role, and a number of other existing problems. [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Minister Musa, regarding the situation in Yemen, everyone is asking which way the Yemeni crisis is heading? What do you say? [Musa] I tell you that the Yemeni crisis is extremely bad. Fighting and bloodshed cannot augur good or lead to a settlement or unity. At any rate, we have been following the situation. As you may know, President Husni Mubarak has received envoys from both parties to the conflict in Yemen. Egypt is playing an extremely active role to contain this crisis. We undertook this role even before the outbreak of the fighting. The outbreak of fighting introduced new elements into the issue. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Can we expect a solution to the Yemeni crisis soon, or will it worsen? [Musa] We hope that matters will not reach that point, although there is fear now that matters might get out of hand unless the fighting stops. I do not think--and we in Egypt do not think--that there will be victor or vanquished in this conflict. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Minister Musa, what is your opinion of the start of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho? [Musa] We hope it will succeed. This is a particularly difficult time, and the future of the Palestinian-Israeli relations, the settlement of the Palestinian issue, and progress on the other tracks depend on it. Therefore, we wish our Palestinian brothers success in this endeavor. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, thank you very much and we welcome you as always on the airwaves of the Voice of the Arabs Radio. [Musa] Thank you.
