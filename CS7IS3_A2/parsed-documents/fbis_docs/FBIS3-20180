At the land court the 86-year-old man said that he was not informed about the attack beforehand. The witness, who was brought to the court from prison, did not want to give any further information about the involvement of the Ministry of State Security [MfS]. Former Stasi Lieutenant Colonel Helmut Voigt, who is accused of aiding and abetting murder, had referred to orders which led to passing explosives to German Johannes Weinrich, a member of the "Carlos" terrorist group. Weinrich is considered to be the triggerman of the attack, in which one man was killed. Stasi Agents Kept Silent So far, the court has hardly made any progress in questioning the Stasi agents. Before Mielke, Harry Dahl, former head of the Antiterrorism Main Department, was questioned. However, he suffered from a defective memory. He was able to remember only one detail: He did not give Voigt the order. His superior, Horst Franz, refused to give evidence. Dahl's deputy, Guenter Jaeckel, also claimed that he did not have anything to do with the attack. Despite these meager results, the judges can also rely on something solid, namely on the MfS documents. They say that in May 1983 it was feared that the Carlos group would carry out attacks in order to extort the release of terrorists imprisoned in France. In the following months, there was talk of planned attacks. In June 1983 the "Maison de France" is even mentioned as a potential target. The reports from Voigt's department prove that the Stasi was excellently informed about the group surrounding the internationally wanted terrorist Carlos. It knew of previous attacks by this group on the Paris-Toulouse train, the Paris-Lyon fast train, and the Saudi Embassy in Vienna. It knew Syrian liaison men and was informed about their private lives. Was Syria Involved? On 19 August 1983 the MfS received another important message from Hungary, according to which a certain Al-Siba'i, a "would-be kamikaze" of Carlos' group, was on his way to Berlin. Six days later, according to the prosecution, Al-Siba'i ignited the bomb in the "Maison de France." For Senior Public Prosecutor Mehlis it is clear that "all strings came together" in Voigt's hands. However, the trial does not just raise the question about the responsibility of the MfS. Syria, too, was involved in the bomb attack. Weinrich had not only a Syrian diplomatic passport, Damascus also supported the "Carlos group" with apartments, cars, and weapons. The embassies were ordered to fulfill all wishes of the gang. In Berlin terrorist Weinrich was cared for by Nabil Sharitah, a member of the Syrian Embassy and a man who is a mystery. Even though an arrest warrant was issued for the 43-year-old Syrian in Germany, he gave himself up to the authorities during the trial. Voluntarily, as the diplomat stressed. However, Sharitah did not live up to his boast that he would incriminate Syria. After a visit by Syrian Embassy members, he cleared Damascus: "Syria had nothing to do with that."
