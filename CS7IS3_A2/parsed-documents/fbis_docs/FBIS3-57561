He said that his territory experienced a dire energy crisis. Meanwhile, the federal debt to Khabarovsk territory for the manufactured products and for the seasonal transportation of loads to the northern districts of the Amur region amounts to billions of rubles, said Ishayev. The situation is aggravated by the forced stoppage of local industrial enterprises which cannot make planned payments to the federal budget.
