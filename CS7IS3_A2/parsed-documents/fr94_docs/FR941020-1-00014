FR941020-1-00014 FR941020-1-00003 The impacts of the options considered depend on import levels, the number of certificates issued, possible changes in import practices and the proportion of imported grain that is already identity preserved. Impacts would result from compliance costs for certificate filing, quarterly reporting, and storage and handling costs needed for identity preservation. Market impacts would result from reduced imports and higher domestic market prices. Because of differences among warehouses in storage capacity and involvement in government export assistance programs, it is not clear whether, in practice, costs would be higher or lower under Option 2 rather than Option 3 so costs are assumed to be similar under the two options. The potential impacts of the end-use certificate options considered are summarized below: ␣ 1␣ 1Option 1 1Option 2 or 3 Compliance Costs: Certificate Filing $35,775 to $143,000 $4,450 to $143,000. Quarterly Reporting $39,000 to $117,000. Maximum Storage and Handling $800,000 to $3,900,000. Market Impacts: ($ Million) Producer Income 12.5. Program Costs ^46.5. Buyers' Loss 1 ^62.5. 1Buyers' Loss results from buyers purchasing less grain at higher prices. Reduced program costs and higher producer income would almost offset the increased costs to buyers, for a net impact for Options 2 and 3 of about $3.5 million. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis indicates that the compliance requirements of the program will disproportionately affect small entities. Option 1 would have the least impact because it does not require identity preservation. Regulatory Flexibility Act It has been determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this proposed rule will have an adverse effect on a substantial number of small businesses. The analysis discussing these impacts is available on request from Craig Jagger, at the address and telephone number noted above. The analysis can be summarized as follows: Warehousemen with average annual receipts of $12.5 million or less are considered small entities. Warehousemen in the states of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, Idaho, and Minnesota are most apt to be affected by an end-use certificate program. About 85 percent of the warehousemen located in these states are estimated to be small warehousemen. Of all small warehousemen, only those who import Canadian grain would be directly affected by an end-use certificate program.
