Mr. Gould, who last night resigned as an MP, told the party that if people started to think more kindly of the Tories again then Labour's huge opinion poll lead would "fade away pretty quickly." He was unsure if any of the likely contenders for the Labour leadership would try to put the party on the more radical and positive course that he would have wanted. Mr Gould did not think it was a foregone conclusion that shadow home secretary Tony Blair would emerge the winner. "He is the front runner, justifiably. He is seen as the most voter-friendly of all the candidates. "But it is inevitable that as the contest is joined he will come more in the spotlight and that some of the doubts which inevitably must exist with all the candidates in different ways will arise in his case. "He is young and inexperienced. My view is that he has the qualities to overcome these problems, if problems they are, pretty rapidly once he comes into office," Mr Gould told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Gould believed Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, was the most able of all the contenders. "In the end, I fear that Robin might not quite make it because of a rather unfair perception that he is not `voter-friendly,'" Mr Gould added. Meanwhile, Labour has accused the Liberal Democrats of breaking the campaigning truce which it was hoped the three main parties would observe until after John Smith's funeral on Friday. The Liberal Democrats were holding a news conference today to launch their campaign for the Eastleigh by-election, to be held on June 9 -- the same date as the Euro-elections. A spokesman for Labour said: "We are dismayed by this decision." But a spokeswoman for the Liberal Democrats said she did not think this breached any arrangement. Matthew Taylor, the party's election campaign coordinator, was speaking at the news conference in support of their candidate, David Chidgey.
