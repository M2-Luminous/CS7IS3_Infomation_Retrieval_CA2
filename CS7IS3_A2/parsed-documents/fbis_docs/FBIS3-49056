The section is to be moved from Munich to Warsaw in the spring. "We have nothing to go back to," say the radio employees, to whom the closure of the Munich station is a "betrayal by the Americans" and a "shock." The U.S. Government intends to close down RFE's Munich facility, which has existed since 1952. The Afghan section's electricity supply has already been cut off, and the Hungarian section was closed down on 1 November. The Polish and Czech sections will move to their respective countries, but will continue to be maintained by the U.S. Congress until September 1995. Then they will be privatized. Radio Liberty, serving the former USSR republics, plus the RFE Slovak, Bulgarian, Romanian, Serbian, and Croatian sections, will be moved to Washington or Prague. "The people here lived like in a ghetto," the Polish employees told me. "They spent most of their time inside the station itself, and lived in communal apartment blocks. Many of them never learned German. We have nothing to go back to in Poland." "We hoped that the putsch in Moscow would save us," one of the employees added. Half of RFE's 1,500 employees will lose their jobs as a result of the reorganization. The Poles, almost 100 of them, will be paid until June. But the Warsaw Bureau will only have 15 posts. RFE's Warsaw Bureau, operational since 1990, already prepares 80 percent of the material on Poland. The Warsaw staff are younger, and are not burdened by any emigre past. Their work style is also different -- they report from the streets and interview left-wing politicians, something which RFE veterans frown upon. "The competition for jobs in Warsaw is open to everyone, but will someone who spent years broadcasting from behind a desk ever go into the Sejm with a microphone?" wonders a young reporter from RFE's Warsaw bureau. "RFE's mission was a kind of slow suicide," Jan Nowak-Jezioranski [distinguished author] wrote one year ago. "Its mission was to regain the freedom of the media in Poland, in other words bring about a situation where Western radio ceased to be necessary." According to the latest surveys, only 2 percent of the Polish population listens to RFE.
