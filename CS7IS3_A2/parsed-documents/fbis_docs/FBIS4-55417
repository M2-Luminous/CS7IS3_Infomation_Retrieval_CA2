[Reporter] After the aggressor's unsuccessful attempts to break through our defense lines in the Majevica part of the front, soldiers of the 206th Gallant Brigade, aided by soldiers from Teocak, have captured important hills of Domanica Kosa, Ikovi and Suha Cesma, and are in the immediate vicinity of the TV relay station. [passage omitted] Brave soldiers of the 206th Gallant brigade successfully repulsed all attacks and inflicted high losses in human lives on the chetniks. The remaining chetniks withdrew in panic, leaving scores of their dead behind. Unable to shift the defense lines to their advantage, the chetniks vented their frustration by firing from all available weapons on the free territory, destroying whole buildings in Vitinica, (Cakula), Medjedja, (Kobilici), Kraljevici, (Nezuk), and Zaseok. Some 1,000 highly destructive shells fell on these locations, causing vast material damage. Some civilians were killed and wounded. Despite all this, our defense lines are firm and stable. This was a report from Zvornik by the information service of the 206th Gallant Brigade.
