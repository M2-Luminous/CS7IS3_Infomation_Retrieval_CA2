Writer Criticizes Mubarak's Speech on Muslims PRAYERS AND DEMONSTRATIONS The 11 March issue of AL-SHA'B continues to report Egyptian people's reaction to and protests against the Hebron killings. It devotes pages 1-4 and 7 to lengthy stories of demonstrations and rallies denouncing the Hebron incident, citing speeches by Socialist Labor Party [SLP] leader Ibrahim Shukri and others. Speakers assail Israelis and Americans, denounce the United Nations, call for jihad, and urge severing ties with Israel, expelling the Israeli ambassador in Egypt, and boycotting Israeli goods. An approximately 600-word report on pages 1 and 7 says that Egyptian mosques on the night of the Koran revelation were filled with the worshipers' "imprecations" against the murderer Jews and their supporters; against the murderers of Muslims, the Serbs and Croats; and against "oppressive rulers who failed to support the Muslims or who are involved in the killing of Muslims." The report adds that the largest gathering took place in 'Amr Bin-al-'Ass Mosque, which was packed with over 3,000 worshipers who repeated Koran reader Shaykh Muhammad Jibril's prayers that God might destroy and eliminate the Jews, shake the earth under the Serbs and Croats, and support the mujahidin in Palestine and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Angry slogans of "No God but God," "The Jews are the enemies of God," "Muhammad's army will return," and "Jihad is our course and dying in the cause of God is our wish" were chanted after the prayers. The worshipers urged the rulers to expel the Zionist ambassador from Cairo, recall the Egyptian ambassador from Tel Aviv, and to stop the "criminal" acts of normalization with Israel and the "alleged" peace process. In an approximately 300-word report on page 1, Mahmud Bakri says trade unions, nationalist forces, and Egyptian parties in Dumyat held a huge conference, denouncing the "Zionist massacre of our fellow worshipers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron." The report says the conference affirmed that the Arabs' and Muslims' right will not be recovered as long as we continue neglecting our rights, disregarding God's shari'ah, and silent about "those impotent, treacherous rulers." The conference called for opening the door to jihad for the Muslim youths to enable them to join their brother mujahidin in Palestine and in all Islamic countries. At the end of the conference, the report says, the youths of Dumyat burned the Israeli flag amid slogans calling for jihad and revenge against "those killers." An approximately 500-word report by Nasir Faruq on pages 1 and 7 says a wave of anger prevailed after the Egyptian students began their "blessed uprising" in protest against the Zionist massacre in al-Ibrahimi Mosque. After prayers, worshipers in northern Cairo emerged chanting slogans against "the enemies of Islam, the Americans and Jews, and demanding revenge against the Zionist enemies of God." The report provides detailed accounts of similar protests in other places. The SLP organized a mass rally at the party headquarters in Tanta to denounce the massacre. University students and lawyers also staged demonstrations, calling for severing ties with Israel and staging jihad against the Zionist enemy. Another 320-word report on pages 1 and 7 indicates that the General Assembly of the Engineers Union urged the Egyptian Government to close the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, recall the Egyptian ambassador from Tel Aviv, and halt all forms of dealings with the Zionist enemy. It also called on Arab governments to withdraw the delegations taking part in the "lie" of the peace talks, provide assistance to the Palestinian intifadah, and launch jihad to "liberate Palestine." An approximately 450-word report by Layla 'Abd-al-Hamid on pages 1 and 7 says the SLP's Women's Secretariat organized a seminar in response to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The seminar called for severing relations with Israel, expelling the Israeli ambassador from Egypt, reviving the common Arab market, halting talks with Israel, and lifting the blockade against the Iraqi people. A speaker, Asmahan Shukri, noted the frightening Arab and Islamic divisions and the United States' "domination" of the Islamic world. She says: "The United States is directly responsible for killing and displacing the Muslims in Bosnia, Iraq, Somalia, India, and Kashmir." In an approximately 250-word report on pages 1 and 7 on the state authorities' "campaign of arrests" against SLP members in which 26 members have been arrested to far, the paper says the Interior Ministry escalated its campaign and arrested four others. They include Muhammad Muhammad al-Sunbati and his wife, who, the paper says, was arrested on charges of teaching the town's children the Koran, starting a Koran school, disseminating ideas of extremism among the children in preparation for overthrowing the regime. The report also says that Mrs. Mazaj 'Abd-al-'Aziz, the wife of Muhammad al-Sunbati, was also accused of performing prayers, leading women in mosques, and preaching to them. The report adds that only Mrs. Mazaj has been released but that the other four party members remain in detention. BARUKH GOLDSTEIN IS ALIVE An approximately 140-word report on page one of AL-SHA'B's 11 March issue by Mahmud Babri claims that Barukh Goldstein, the Israeli who killed worshipers in a Hebron mosque, is still alive. The author of the report says: "Important information obtained by AL-SHA'B affirm that Barukh Goldstein, murderer of the worshipers in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque, is still alive and that he has been transferred to a safe Zionist settlement in the wake of the heinous carnage." The information, the report says, indicated that the buried body belonged to another Jewish settler who was killed near the site of the massacre. The report adds: "The information revealed the details of the Zionist plan to carry out the massacre, which was directly supervised by Zionist Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Israeli Army Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq." The author says that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was carried out as a substitute for another massacre designed to be carried out in al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem during the 'Id al-Fitr prayers, planned by Israeli leaders and a Jewish woman settler, Theresa, the mastermind of the massacre. The report indicates that seven Zionists who are members of the Kakh Movement participated in the massacre. LAWYERS ASSOCIATION HOLDS CONFERENCE An approximately 600-word report on pages 1 and 7 says that the Lawyers Association's Egyptian committee in support of the Palestinian people's jihad held a conference in protest against the Hebron massacre, in which many intellectuals, preachers, and "nationalist symbols" took part. Excited young men chanted Islamic slogans denouncing the massacre and the peace talks and demanding the launching of jihad to "liberate Palestine." The conference decided to send protest memoranda to all ambassadors in Egypt and to ask Arab rulers to hold an urgent summit and take firm resolutions against Israel. In his speech, Mustafa Mashhur, Muslim Brotherhood's deputy general guide, said the Jews are the origin of terrorism, which began "when the Jews killed the prophets," and that the Jews harbor "deep hatred for Islam and Muslims." He called for raising young men on the spirit of jihad and keeping up this spirit in the "souls of the youths of Islamic awakening." An Islamic preacher, Wajdi Ghunaym, charged that the Jews were behind the explosions that took place in Egypt and that they spread drugs and AIDS "in our country." He said the only Islamic solution for the Palestinian cause is jihad and urged police officers and men to point their guns at the Jews, not at the demonstrators who protested the massacre. Lawyer Ahmad Rabi' al-Ghazali delivered a speech on behalf of the young lawyers, in which he stressed that "the Islamic creed is the sound and established basis which we should not abandon in confronting the Jews and that it is the spiritual weapon that must not be surrendered." He called for unity among all the nation's Muslims and Christians to "fight the Jews who are the enemies of all religions and races." Another Islamic preacher, Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi, said the Islamic soil is fertile and good to produce young men able to lead their nation. He called for overcoming differences among Islamic factions and said: "Everyone must know that the enemies of Islam, led by the Jews, are working day and night to hit us." The committee moderator Ahmad Sayf-al-Islam Hasan al-Banna said the Hebron massacre is a message for the Muslims to wake up and revert to Islam because "their nations are in danger." WRITER DENOUNCES HEBRON KILLINGS An approximately 500-word article by Mahmud Fayid on page 2 denounces the Hebron killings and calls for ending the negotiations. The writer says this was not the first crime, nor will it be the last because both "the Bible and the Koran say that the Jews are the killers of prophets and are traitors." He adds that "they" are holding negotiations not to return the usurped rights but are negotiating with us to perpetuate the occupation. He notes that the remedy lies in God's shari'ah in raising the nation on jihad against the enemy and that jihad, as in the case of fasting, is a duty and both commandments urge the Muslim not to limit his concern and interest to worldly pleasure but to aspire to the "bliss of the world hereafter." At one point he says: This crime should not drive us to despair. We must realize that it is an enlightenment from God for us to be aware of the nature of the Jews and their treachery so that we may rectify our situation, stop being careless, and stop living in illusions." SLP LEADER SHUKRI URGES ARAB, ISLAMIC UNITY On page 4, AL-SHA'B files an approximately 850-word report on SLP leader Ibrahim Shukri's speeches in Asyut and al-Minya Governorates about the Hebron killings and other topics. Denouncing the Hebron incident, Shukri addresses those who are in line with the United States and Israel, asking them: "What do you say today about the United States, which prevents the Security Council from passing a resolution to protect the unarmed Palestinians from the evils of the Jewish occupier?" He says: "What do you say about the United States' silence over all forms of oppression, persecution, and horrors and liquidation suffered by the Palestinian people? O Gulf Arabs, what kind of normalization and peace are you seeking now that you have given the control over your economic and political affairs to the U.S. hegemony?" At one point, he says that the United States and Zionism have rearranged their priorities after the collapse of communism and that the Arab and Islamic nations topped their "list of hostility." He calls for rebuilding the Arab and Islamic fold to protect the nation's interests in accordance with "God's injunction." SLP OFFICIALS DEPLORE MUSLIMS' SITUATION Page 4 features an approximately 750-word report on an SLP seminar in which participants discuss the Muslims' "weak" situation, note "rulers' inaction," and demand the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador. SLP official 'Abd-al-Hamid Barakat says the Islamic nation has become "an easy prey for its enemies who kill the nation's sons, rape its women, and violate their rights amid the silence of everyone, "the silence of fear and cowardice." Preacher Mustafa Hammad, SLP branch member in al-Minya Governorate, calls for caution against whom he describes "Zionist elements" in Egypt who are fighting against God's religion and urges adherence to the teachings of religion. Another speaker, Islamic preacher 'Abdallah al-Samawi says the young men spend their time watching television that perverts them and destroys religion and morals. He notes: "Thus, some of the criminal Egyptian media contribute to achieving the aims of the Jews, who regard the neighboring nations as donkeys to be ridden by God's chosen people." Our misled youths spend hours watching television, which destroys religion and morals. The television could have been a teacher and enlightener but it is controlled by people who use it to wreck and destroy our youths." WRITER CRITICIZES MUBARAK'S SPEECH ON MUSLIMS In an approximately 2,900-word article on page 5 of AL-SHA'B's 11 March edition, writer 'Adil Husayn criticizes Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' recent book. After reviewing the book, the writer criticizes President Mubarak's recent speech which, in his view, focused on the weak points of the Muslims. The writer says that the speech gave the impression that all evils in today's world emanate from the Muslims. Husayn adds that Islam is a religion of moderation and Islamic civilization has taught all races of the earth the meaning of tolerance but that tolerance for Muslims does not mean surrender and ignorance.
