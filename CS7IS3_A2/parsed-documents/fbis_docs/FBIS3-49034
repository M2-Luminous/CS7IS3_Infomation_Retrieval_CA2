Stamcar and Jani Sever; place and date not given: "Every Story Must End Sometime"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Arms [MLADINA] Following Slovenia's independence a war broke out in Croatia and Bosnia, and Slovenia helped these two countries with arms, too. Decisions were allegedly made at the sessions of the Defense Council. What did you discuss at these sessions? [Kucan] In the presidency and at the Defense Council sessions we actually debated arms within three groups. First, the seizure and purchase of arms for Slovene requirements. At that time Slovenia had to prepare itself even for the most extreme possible outcome. However, the presidency had nothing to do with the purchase of arms. This was the responsibility of the government. Second, we discussed arms when Croatia was attacked. Even before the war in Slovenia, [Defense and Interior] Ministers Jansa and Bavcar at the meeting with their Croatian counterparts wanted to sign a military alliance pact with the Croats. This would have involved us deeper into the Croatian war and Dr. Plut and Dr. Kmecl [presidency members] were both opposed to this. When the war in Croatia started, the defense minister's position was adopted that to assist Croatia was the best defense of Slovenia. We all agreed with it. We also agreed with the stance that Croatia should be helped with equipment and arms held by Slovenia to the extent to which this aid would not endanger Slovenia's defense capability. When the war spread to Bosnia-Herzegovina, we decided to help Bosnia-Herzegovina with the same arguments and on the basis of similar standpoints. Therefore, assistance yes, but on the condition that the defense capability of Slovenia is not endangered. Bearing in mind that at that time the situation in Bosnia, which was not ready for the war, grew very strained, the agreement to facilitate transport to Bosnia via Slovenia was understandable. The last time we discussed this was this January, when prior to the formation of the new government Igor Bavcar, interior minister at that time, briefly assessed the circumstances. He said there were certain indications that an illegal arms trade was going on via Slovenia that could not be controlled. A debate then ensued whether to continue helping Bosnia as a state, although it had practically disintegrated into three parts, fighting among themselves. We adopted a position that all forms of assistance with the exception of humanitarian aid be stopped. [MLADINA] From a distance it appears that matters became complicated over the minutes of the Defense Council sessions, which your office would not forward to the Defense Ministry, and as a result of which for over six months the ministry would not answer questions concerning arms from 27 deputies. The Defense Ministry claims that on the basis of these minutes a line could be drawn between state arms trade and illegal arms trade, in which state officials were involved, and which the Airport affair was all about. Why do you not simply send these minutes to the Defense Ministry? [Kucan] Of course, a little more honesty on the part of the ministry would help the whole matter. All minutes and all materials are stored and accessible to the authorized persons of the Defense Ministry. A claim that the documents are not available to the Defense Ministry and that the latter, therefore, cannot prepare an answer for the State Chamber, does not correspond to the truth. [MLADINA] The difference is perhaps between being able to see documents and studying them for some time. [Kucan] I do not know why reading minutes in the Defense Ministry would be any different from reading them in Erjavceva [location of president's office]. The minutes are simply minutes. Each institution has a duty to protect its archives. There is no obstacle to prevent the documents being available to the people from the ministry for as long as they need them. When, for example, the criminal service of the Interior Ministry requested to see documentation in connection with the investigation of the Maribor airport arms affair, this was always available and the ministry's representatives never demanded to take it away. However, when the investigating judge requested these documents according to official procedure, the office acted the way it was obliged to according to the criminal procedure law. All this is, therefore, sheer manipulation with the public. The documents are available to the ministry. However, another question is whether the ministry really wants to study these documents in connection with the report for the State Chamber. I also consulted the members of the presidency about taking documents out of the office's archive, especially in light of the increasingly widespread practice of misusing highly classified documents, whose first victim was presidency member Ciril Zlobec. Namely, all these minutes date from the time of the presidency's mandate. All members agreed that the documents should stay in the house. [MLADINA] Could one on the basis of these minutes really draw a line between the arms trade with and without the government's blessing? [Kucan] One can conclude from these minutes that a political position was adopted that Croatia and Bosnia should be assisted with equipment as well as arms that Slovenia had at its disposal. One can also ascertain that a political decision that Slovenia would purchase arms for anyone else and then sell them was never made. One can determine who were the people in the Defense Ministry that the Bosnia-Herzegovina representatives should turn to regarding this. [MLADINA] Also the representatives of Croatia? [Kucan] For Croatia this was not envisaged as there were no such problems. Because of the circumstances that emerged in Bosnia, many people presenting themselves as plenipotentiaries of the government or of various ministries were appearing in Slovenia. This caused uncertainty in the Interior Ministry and the Defense Ministry. Both ministries wanted the matters concerning Bosnia to be clarified. Meeting with Izetbegovic [MLADINA] The meeting of the Bosnian and the Slovene delegations in Brdo in the summer of 1992 was also connected to the aid to Bosnia. On that occasion you met with Izetbegovic. What did you discuss? [Kucan] This was happening when the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was in its initial, extreme phase. Just as we were looking for support abroad -- moral and other -- during the war in Slovenia, the Bosnians were also seeking help. In this way separate meetings of the government delegations and a meeting with President Izetbegovic took place in Brdo. The minutes of it exist. Beside myself, Mr. Ivan Oman, Assembly Vice President Vane Gosnik, Mr. Peter Tos from the Interior Ministry, my foreign affairs' adviser Ida Mocivnik, and Marjan Siftar, the chief of my cabinet at that time, also attended the talks that were requested by Izetbegovic. We primarily spoke about the general situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and whether Slovenia could put in a good word for Bosnia-Herzegovina at the diplomatic level and secure aid to this country. [MLADINA] Did you use the term arms? [Kucan] Of course. Izetbegovic primarily spoke about this, saying, if I remember correctly, that the greatest problem was shortage of ammunition. We have repeated our political stance that we would assist as much as we could but that we could not trade in arms for them, which he did not want anyway. We have facilitated the shipments for Bosnia to travel through our country, but we told Izetbegovic separately we hoped that he would not misuse humanitarian cargoes for the shipment of arms, because by this he would compromise us, himself, humanitarian aid, and humanitarian organizations. [MLADINA] How did you agree as to who will take care of that? [Kucan] Concrete decisions were the task of the government, that is to say, the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry. Minister Jansa appointed Mr. Lovsin as a contact person. How the things went from there on I do not know. The presidency has never received a report about this. Meeting With Cengic [MLADINA] It is normal for presidents of two countries to meet and discuss matters, but your meeting with Hasan Cengic is much more obscure. [Kucan] As I have already said, it was not only Hasan Cengic who turned to me, but numerous other people who claimed that they were Bosnia-Herzegovina plenipotentiaries, bringing messages from President Izetbegovic about the situation in Bosnia and about whether we could intensify international diplomatic activity to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Among others, Fikret Abdic, who was at that time a member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, also came to visit me in this role. Because there were several of these people, we demanded, as I have already said, that they appoint an authorized representative to Slovenia, and Izetbegovic's answer to that was that Hasan Cengic was the man. [MLADINA] Some believe that a man becomes a plenipotentiary only when a country in which he is supposed to work has acknowledged his credentials. Has Slovenia acknowledged the status of plenipotentiary to any of the Bosnian representatives who came here? [Kucan] I informed the incumbent ministers that the Bosnians proposed Hasan Cengic as the plenipotentiary. Whether he had formal authority and whether he presented this to those in the Defense and Interior Ministries with whom he discussed concrete aid, I do not know. I myself did not demand this from him. I have held talks with him twice. I told him to turn to Mr. Lovsin, whom the [defense] minister had appointed as a contact person. However, concerning the arms' affair in Maribor, we have now received documents from Bosnia in which prime minister, the defense ministry, and the president say that the Slovene authorities knew that Cengic was the Bosnia-Herzegovina plenipotentiary. To my knowledge, there are three documents that officially confirm the identity of Hasan Cengic. [MLADINA] You have said that three various Slovene state organs have received documents confirming that Hasan Cengic was Bosnia-Herzegovina plenipotentiary, however, the defense minister maintains that Cengic was not authorized. Did the minister see these three documents? [Kucan] One was definitely addressed to the Defense Ministry via the Interior Ministry. I myself received it from there. Also, if they cooperated with Cengic earlier, that is to say, before the discovery of the arms, without asking him for his authority, this means that they actually treated him as a plenipotentiary. A document addressed to the Defense Minister, referring to the meeting in September 1992, provides sufficient illustration. Everything now is just a sheer pretense. [MLADINA] You spoke of the meeting with Izetbegovic at which you also discussed the arms assistance. There is a UN arms embargo, however. You did not think that this could have had consequences for Slovenia. [Kucan] I remember how it was when we were attacked and how frantically we needed and sought help. Also, how grateful I was and will be to [former German Foreign] Minister Genscher for the meeting in Villach and his immediate action, with which he mobilized his colleagues in the European Community to intercede to end the attack on Slovenia. This was my stance when the question arose as to whether we would help Croatia and later Bosnia. The embargo that was passed for the territory of the whole of Yugoslavia was particularly unfair toward the Muslims, because the Serbs nevertheless had contact with their hinterland -- Serbia, they were getting arms from there, the Croats similarly, although with greater difficulty, from Croatia, while the Muslims could not get arms from anybody. I have spoken with numerous people in the world and most of them openly agreed that the arms embargo was unfair. Although I do not advocate war, I know what it means to be attacked in a war and not have arms. If I had to decide on it again, I would make the same decision to assist. Much more than this aid, the world holds against us the fact that we are now so passive toward the war in Bosnia, as if this does not concern us even though the war is raging so close. [MLADINA] You, therefore, think that Slovenia is not active enough in its attempts to resolve the crisis? [Kucan] I do not think that we are the ones who can offer a solution, however, I am not one of those who say that the slightest involvement in this issue would drag us back into the Balkans, of which we neither are nor wish to be a part. We definitely have as many reasons for cooperation in finding a solution for the Bosnian crisis as other European countries that are further away from the crisis, and also the same share of responsibility. Supervised President [MLADINA] Before the Airport affair, you met with Miro Predanic, agent of the Security Information Service, and later with Vinko Beznik, chief of the Slovene special police troops. How did you come meet with them and how did the Defense Ministry find out about it? [Kucan] In the interview for your weekly, Miro Predanic has explained already the content of our talks. He had second thoughts, though, about talking to me in my office. Because he was high in the hierarchy of the Security Information Service, he probably knew why. For me this was a sufficiently clear warning. I met with Mr. Beznik at my request. We discussed the confusion surrounding his decoration. At the proposal of Minister Bavcar, and with the agreement of his successor, Minister Bizjak, Mr. Vinko Beznik was awarded with a decoration. However, he was not supposed to receive it for the same reasons for which Mr. Tone Krkovic [head of special brigade Moris] had returned his decoration [sentence as published]. He explained that this was not the case. Subsequently, I read in the paper that Mr. Beznik was with me and how much time he spent with me. It is, of course, no secret who visits the president. However, it is interesting to note that somebody is supervising and even keeping a log of how many minutes the talks and visits last. I cannot imagine who would have the authority to do this. [MLADINA] If this means supervision, it is obviously analytically supported. Do you suspect any secret service? [Kucan] I do not know whether secret services are involved, however, they definitely do not have the authorization for such a thing. For this reason, in light of the notorious letter by the Civilian Initiative, I have demanded from the incumbent organs that they ascertain whether the statements contained in this anonymous letter are correct. Also, whether an organized group of people exists in the Slovenia that is gathering information about the functioning of the state organs, individual offices, and individual citizens without authorization. I am firmly convinced that a document like the two anonymous letters [both by the Civilian Initiative] cannot be written by one man alone, who would lack a database that can be compiled only in an organized fashion. Who in the country is in charge of this is known, although I believe that too many institutions in Slovenia are responsible for keeping records of personal data, and I am not referring merely to the intelligence and security services. Presidential Visits [MLADINA] Some politicians, not so much Jansa's circle but more Peterle's circle, sport the theory that Slovenia, with a president who is a member of the former [Communist] party, finds it much more difficult to find partners abroad than it would have had with somebody without such a past. [Kucan] I would say that with imprudent partners Slovenia will find it difficult to assert itself in the world of intelligent partners. Today's world is no longer a world of ideologies, but a world of knowledge, arguments, pragmatism, and democracy. Contrary to some domestic politicians, the world recognizes the outcome of the democratic elections. I would also like to say, not without a reason, that I even get too many invitations. The problem is that we have no planned priorities as to how we should carry out these visits and what Slovenia can expect from them. [MLADINA] What sort of priority are you referring to? [Kucan] Priority in the spheres of interest of Slovenia's foreign policy. I agree with a commentary that I have read that my visit to Albania was a lost opportunity. I have asked the government for an opinion on the usefulness of this visit and about who should accompany me. After this visit I see the Slovene possibilities primarily in economic cooperation with Albania. Albania expects this, too. At the beginning of next year we plan to hold a meeting of a mixed Slovene-Albanian economic commission, which will review the implementation of the interstate economic cooperation agreement. There are, of course, other decisions, too, for example, how great is our interest in cooperation with Turkey, Israel, Russia, and so forth. [MLADINA] For the time being we have opted for the Czech Republic and ultimately we are supposed to form a customs union with it? [Kucan] I believe that this is very important for Slovenia. I have also received an invitation from the Czech Republic to attend the spring meeting of all presidents of the Central European states -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Slovenia. [MLADINA] Whom will you take with you? [Kucan] As usual, I will consult the government about this. [MLADINA] The British Prime Minister Major invited successful English managers with him on his trip to India, where they were met by local people of similar standing. [Kucan] When I travel where I was invited I will certainly try to open doors for Slovene companies or support them in their business pursuits. When Czech Prime Minister Mr. Klaus was visiting, I introduced him at the dinner to the directors of the Slovene companies that trade most with the Czech Republic and gave him the opportunity to have talks with them. "Wild" Privatization [MLADINA] Privatization has started in Slovenia and numerous directors are accused of being red directors, that is to say, Udbomafia people [connected to the former State Security Service]. What are your ideas about the property reform? [Kucan] To become the owner of social property in a company is primarily the right of those who have managed it carefully for decades, enlarged it, and sacrificed higher salaries for the sake of investments, technological development, the conquest of markets, the raising of ecological awareness, and training. Regardless of the fact that social justice must be taken into account, we must primarily strive to establish a situation that will allow as much economic effectiveness as possible in the implementation of the law. This is the basic goal of property transformation. However, if irregularities and abuses occur in this process, that is to say, during the implementation of this law, then such wrongdoings must first be proven and perpetrators subsequently punished. It is the juridical organs and the prosecutor that are responsible for this. Indiscriminate screaming about theft contributes neither toward the effectiveness of the property transformation process, nor to supervision and prevention of anomalies, and above all, not toward legal security, which is necessary for effective management. I would rather say that such behavior helps to create unstable circumstances that would suit the restructuring of the legitimate political power in Slovenia and the creation of a front behind which lawlessness could continue. [passage omitted] Kucan's People [MLADINA] Do you have a lobby? [Kucan] It has become very popular to speak about lobbies recently. Not a single modern country functions without what is in Slovenia now understood as a lobby, however, I do not myself have a lobby. Disregarding this, in every society an informal system of acquaintances and connections exists that is based on mutual trust and life experience. Actually, the only question is whether the lobby system functions within the legal framework or whether these acquaintances are being misused for illegal activities. It would be good for Slovenia if we passed a law on lobbying. [MLADINA] Good. You do not have a lobby. So who are "Kucan's people" then? At the end of the day, papers often also publish names, and your men, who appear in the affairs surrounding Safti, Smelt, and others, could simply be enumerated. [Kucan] Following this logic numerous former and current directors would be in my lobby, had I had one. Throughout the years of my political activity I have met with and consulted many of them. For example, about how the political situation in Yugoslavia will develop and such matters that were important for their development and business decisions. Quite a few of those who, following this criteria, would be in my lobby are now in other lobbies where they get much more useful and authentic information about economic, financial, and also other issues, as well as concrete party support. This does not seem unusual to me. They cannot get this support from me. As regards the names that you have mentioned, I would like to say that I only know Mr. Cupin from Safti from my youth, when he was one of the leading activists in the Slovene Youth Initiative in Trieste. I have nothing to do with his business in Safti, regardless of the latest affair and even allegations that I am Safti's owner. [MLADINA] Did you ever meet with Igor Bavcar in Vodnikova 133, the headquarters of Adit, whose owner was also Safti? Namely, Adit director Mr. Platovsek told the agents of the military intelligence service so. [Kucan] No, I did not know where this house was at all and when I found out, I remembered that I passed it when I was still living in Sisenska Street, when I went to Mostec with the children. At that time there was a dunghill in front of that house; it was a farm. The dunghill is gone but it obviously still stinks there. [MLADINA] What about all these statements of Platovsek? [Kucan] I do not know what Mr. Platovsek said to the agents of the VOMO [Military intelligence service]. What I have read of what he said about me and Safti has no real basis of truth whatsoever. I did not meet anyone and I did not forward information to anyone. However, in connection with this I am concerned that Mr. Platovsek said nothing about this to the investigating judge, the criminal police, or the prosecutor, as I deduce from the newspaper articles, but precisely to the military intelligence service. This service is not responsible for the disclosure of such actions as Mr. Platovsek speaks of. If I am to believe the newspapers, once this service had established what criminal activities Mr. Platovsek suspected Safti of, they did not immediately call the police. [MLADINA] Do you believe that this service is not properly supervised? [Kucan] In general I believe that the security-intelligence and counterintelligence services need to be supervised and directed by an authorized organ, in which the state's security concept or the state's protection policy, as determined by the parliament, should be embodied. This organ would at the same time direct the work of these services and supervise them. It cannot be left to the discretion of these services whether they will inform anyone about important security and intelligence information and whom they will inform if at all. Their duties must be clearly determined by the law or on the basis of the law, otherwise temptation will arise sooner or later and they will be abused. It was only the presidency of the republic that proposed the formation of a national security council during the constitutional debate. [passage omitted] Electoral Promises [MLADINA] You were elected president a year ago. From what you promised the voters what did you in your opinion deliver? [Kucan] I do not have great problems regarding this. My slogan was: The work is not finished yet. The process of political and economic reforms in Slovenia and the process of Slovenia's integration in a modern society of peoples and nations are not yet completed. The social policy and transition into a post-industrial society are the components of this. I believe that bearing in mind the circumstances, especially the social situation, unemployment, and the uncertain future for the young people, I would nowadays have an even stronger reason for choosing the slogan I chose then. [MLADINA] It was not an electoral promise, but the coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Slovene Christian Democrats, and the United List was also one of your ideas. What do you think of this coalition now and would you again advocate such a coalition? [Kucan] It is true that I favored such a coalition precisely because of the recognition that the work was not yet over and that we were entering a very demanding phase of the state's regulation and its integration in the international sphere. I was convinced that this would be much easier if the responsibility for this were assumed by the three largest political parties chosen at the elections and if they accepted this as their principal goal. [MLADINA] Did you have privatization in mind and the fact that these three parties will also get the biggest piece of the privatization cake? [Kucan] No, but that they would, within the context I speak of, assume responsibility for the formation of a concept and take care of the legality of the property transformation process. Therefore, that they would invest their efforts for Slovenia and not primarily for their party interests, which are otherwise perfectly legitimate. The coalition is functioning as it is, that is to say, differently from what I expected. And since you ask me whether I would favor such a coalition again, my answer to you is yes, on the basis of the initial positions I spoke of, and no, on the basis of current practice. [MLADINA] And why not in practice? [Kucan] You see yourself how the coalition functions. [MLADINA] Did you hear that the cabinet looked completely different 15 minutes prior to its proclamation, that is to say, that a different defense minister was on the list? [Kucan] They asked me for my opinion and I answered that I advise the present minister. Whether this was decisive or not, I do not know. [MLADINA] Would you now change your mind and decide differently. [Kucan] Yes. [MLADINA] Will you run for president again? [Kucan] No. [MLADINA] Why not? [Kucan] Every story must end sometime.
