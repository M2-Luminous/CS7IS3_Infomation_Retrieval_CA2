A session of the working group to elaborate a model civil code of the Commonwealth of Independent States will be held in the latter part of January in St. Petersburg. Also at the end of January, there will be a roundtable in St. Petersburg of the Interparliamentary Assembly for problems of development of the CIS with the participation of representatives of government bodies on interstate cooperation. Planned for early in February is a seminar on constitutional reforms in the Commonwealth countries. The press service has also indicated that a more important start-of-the-year event will be held in February -- a session of the council of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, invited for which will be all the speakers of parliaments of CIS member countries. It will elect a new chairman of the council of the Interparliamentary CIS Assembly because the powers of the previous chairman -- Russian Parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov -- terminated at the end of last October. Andrey Mazhorov, head of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly press service, stated that the new head of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly will hardly seek this office. If the council's chairman should be elected in accordance with the positions the CIS countries occupy if ranked in Russian alphabetical order (as is accepted in some organizational structures of the Commonwealth), this seat could first be contested by Azerbaijan Parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev. A CIS Interparliamentary Assembly chairman's term of office is one year. The heads of parliament will also approve during the meeting a plan for 1994, and the rules of procedure and the agenda of the next plenary session of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly council.
