SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : In the Federal Register of September 22, 1993 (58 FR 49267), EPA issued a proposal to revoke the tolerance for arsenic acid on cottonseed because the use of arsenic acid on cotton was voluntarily canceled. A previous notice in the Federal Register of May 6, 1993 (58 FR 26975) had acknowledged that existing stocks of Elf Atochem North America and Voluntary Purchasing Groups arsenic acid products could be sold until October 31, 1993, and applied by end users until December 31, 1993. Because use will continue through the end of 1993, all treated raw cottonseed may not clear processing mills and feed markets until July 1, 1995. Therefore, to effect the revocation, EPA proposed to establish an expiration date for the tolerance of July 1, 1995. EPA predicts there will be an insignificant or no economic impact from revoking this tolerance because EPA is allowing ample time for legally treated commodities, i.e., treated prior to December 31, 1993, to pass through the channels of trade. EPA believes that arsenic acid is not used on cotton grown in other countries and imported into the United States. Once the tolerance for arsenic acid on cottonseed is revoked, it will be unlawful to import into the United States any cottonseed treated with arsenic acid. After legally treated cottonseed has cleared the market, residues of arsenic acid resulting from pesticide application are not expected to be detected. Therefore, action levels to cover residues of arsenic acid from past uses of the pesticide will not be recommended. No public comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee were received in response to the proposed rule. Therefore, based on the information considered by the Agency and discussed in detail in the September 22, 1993 proposal and in this final rule, the Agency is hereby revising 40 CFR 180.180 for residues of orthoarsenic acid to stipulate that the 4-ppm tolerance for orthoarsenic acid in or on cottonseed expires on July 1, 1995. Any person adversely affected by this regulation revoking the tolerance may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of any objections and hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. The Agency believes that the domestic use of arsenic acid is limited and will end this year with the voluntary cancellation and termination of the provision for sale and use of existing stocks. Further, its use, if any, on imported commodities is insignificant. Since the tolerance is being revoked 18 months after the last legal domestic use on cotton, impacts are expected to be minimal. For those reasons, pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Regulatory Flexibility Act This rulemaking has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164; 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), and it has been determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses, small governments, or small organizations. The reasons for this conclusion are discussed in the September 22, 1993 proposal.

Dated: January 11, 1994. Victor J. Kimm, Acting Assistant Administrator for Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Therefore, 40 CFR part 180 is amended as follows: PART 180_[AMENDED] 1.

A tolerance that expires on July 1, 1995, of 4 parts per million of combined As 2 O 3 is established for residues of the defoliant orthoarsenic acid in or on the raw agricultural commodity cottonseed.
