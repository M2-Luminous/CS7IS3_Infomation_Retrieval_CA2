FBIS4-13648 "drnes078dd_94005" FBIS-NES-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Leaflet Links Israeli Withdrawal, Cease-fire Hamas Leaflet Links Israeli Withdrawal, Cease-fire TA2104152094 Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew 21 Apr 94 p 1 TA2104152094 Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR Hebrew BFN [Report by Pinhas 'Inbari] [Text] The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads yesterday clarified for the first time that they will stop fighting Israel when it withdraws from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. This is the first time an 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam leaflet has featured such a statement. The belligerent leaflet announces that Hamas is not intimidated by arrests. On the contrary, the recent spate of arrests will inspire it to escalate its struggle. The leaflet warns Shin Bet officers that their fate will be similar to that of No'am Kohen and Hayim Nahmani. The leaflet goes on to point out, however, that the movement will pursue its war on "terrorists Rabin and Baraq" as long as even a single Israeli soldier remains in the West Bank and Gaza. Until now, the leaflets of the military branch of Hamas have always referred to an all-out war, and not to a war until the end of occupation.
