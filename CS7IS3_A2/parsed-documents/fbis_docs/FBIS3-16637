A high-ranking source at the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs told an ITAR-TASS correspondent this today. "This creates quite a serious situation," the diplomat said. In his words, Russia is holding consultations on this matter with other IAEA members. He noted however that there is still some time before the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors, set for 21 March, at which the results of the inspections are due to be discussed. Consequently, the situation could develop in a variety of ways, and the Russian Foreign Ministry will be following it carefully. [passage omitted]
