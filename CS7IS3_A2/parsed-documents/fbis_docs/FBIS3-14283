These observers also agree unanimously that of all the international initiatives to end this conflict that has been raging for more than half a century, the U.S. initiative is the most serious. Despite this, Israel has not met its responsibilities to the peace issue. It has remained captive to its expansionist ambitions, hostile ideology, and greed for occupying land. It wasted two full years of the Washington talks in futile arguments on its security fears, and escalated acts of repression in the occupied Arab territories. It committed the brutal aggression against southern Lebanon on the pretext of these security claims, until it was exposed to the whole world by the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, where the Zionist settlers killed worshipers in God's house, and the Israeli Army completed the brutal massacre by killing other Palestinians who were leaving the mosque. Inasmuch as the international community denounced the heinous massacre, it exerted efforts to save the peace process from an inevitable collapse. UN Security Council Resolution No. 904, although late, has come to contribute to the efforts aimed at resuming the Washington talks and at emerging with tangible results. Syria has responded to the various international endeavors out of its belief that the peace cosponsors are now aware of, more than at any time in the past, the seriousness of the Israeli maneuvering, and of the need for the actual implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions. Peace prospects have narrowed as a result of the Israeli rulers' procrastination and prevarications, and of giving predominance to unimportant things over essential and substantive issues. Although the UN Security Council has provided another opportunity to resume the peace process, Israel's wasting of this opportunity, just as past opportunities, could deal a fatal blow to the U.S. initiative, after which its revival would be difficult. Undoubtedly, Israel's actions in southern Lebanon and the occupied Arab territories, in addition to its procrastination and prevarications, threaten the peace process. Israel's rulers violate human rights, the Geneva conventions, and the UN principles on a daily basis. Israel has been occupying the Arab territories since 1967, confiscating the possessions of the Arab citizens, establishing settlements, and dealing with the Palestinian people very brutally. It does not hesitate to kill children and women. It also confronts the Lebanese people's struggle to liberate their land with raids, shelling, and bombardment from land, air, and sea. Had Israel been concerned about achieving peace, as its rulers claim, It would have managed to render the Washington talks a success, and announced its readiness to fully withdraw from the occupied Arab territories, to implement the UN Security Council resolutions, and achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. What draws one attention is that the Israeli rulers have been shedding tears on the threatened peace since the Hebron massacre. They have not stop making calls to resume the talks. Have they eventually been convinced that the policy of maneuvering and intransigence, which they have been adopting since the convening of the Madrid conference, will not be able to affect the determination of Syria and the Arabs to restore their occupied territories in full, and that peace cannot be established through separate deals, but through the implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions, as well as through full abidance by the essence and bases of the U.S. initiative; namely, the exchange of land for peace? Only a few days ago, Yitzhaq Rabin admitted that there is not much time left, and that Israel must make decisions. However, as usual, he did not explain the nature of these decisions. We have no choice but to remind him that the decision awaited by the whole world, without which there will be no solution or peace in the Middle East, is the full Israeli withdrawal. The Arabs have done everything possible to render the peace process a success. Syria played a distinguished role in reactivating the peace process, a role recognized by the international community. Based on this, Israel alone will be responsible for wasting the new opportunity provided by the UN Security Council resolution, and by the international efforts that have been persistent since the Hebron massacre, if it continues with the policy of maneuvering and prevarication, and believes that it can continue to disdain the power of the UN Security Council and human mind.
