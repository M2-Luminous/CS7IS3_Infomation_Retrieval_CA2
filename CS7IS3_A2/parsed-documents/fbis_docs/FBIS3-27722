[sentence indistinct] Party President Kono, how do you think the group of political reform moderates within your party will react to it? Do you think you can persuade them to accept it? [Hosokawa] I will answer first. I think there are strong voices calling on people, not only in the SDPJ but in all other groups, to restrain their own views and accommodate other views as much as possible. I am fully aware of that. Meanwhile, Mr. Murayama, chairman of the SDPJ, has kept me well informed of the views of the people in his party. I had to ask him to entrust me with the power to make a final decision, and he said that was unacceptable. However, he eventually agreed to give me the power to make a final decision to resolve the issues -- on my own judgment. For me it was a very difficult decision to make. Nevertheless, corporate donations to political funds will be abolished after five years. At least the system will be better than the current one in that it will be more transparent. The agreement clearly states that the donations will abolished in five years. As such, it represents progress compared to the existing system. I agree with you that it has gone backward, somewhat, from the original draft bills, but I would like everyone's understanding on that point. [Kono] All the Diet members of my party share the need to implement political reform. But as far as the question of how it should be done, there have been various views, and consequently there have been many discussions. But with the current special session of the Diet coming to an end, there were also feelings that we must conclude the matter somehow so that we can go on to tackle so many other pending important matters. Though I was also fully aware, on the other hand, of the views of those who think we should be more cautious about political reform. I came to this meeting, which began yesterday evening, bearing all this in mind. To answer your question, I must say I think the prime minister underwent much torment -- or hardships -- in making his decision. I once again pointed out to him the points my party has so long insisted on, and asked him to understand them. After all, agreement would have been impossible unless both sides were willing to make some concessions. I know the views of my party's people because I have talked to so many of them. I am confident the people in my party will accept the agreement. [Correspondent] Mr. Kono, the meeting of the top leaders was held under the mediation of House of Representatives Speaker Doi. What conditions were presented to you in agreeing the meeting? [sentence indistinct] [Kono] House of Representatives Speaker Doi told me she was worried about the state of the Diet -- about whether the Diet, now coming to an end of its session, was meeting expectations of the people. The two of us were called in separately. Speaker Doi noted that the matter needed to be resolved, and presented several alternatives, proposing that we reach agreement along the lines of one of these proposals. It seems Prime Minister Hosokawa received some proposals from Speaker Doi as well. After we had received the speaker's suggestions we decided to meet and discuss them. I think the prime minister should speak as he, too, met the speaker. [Hosokawa] I don't know which of us was called in first, and I did not ask about it. But we were separately called into the speaker's office and given the proposals as I explained earlier. One was on the matter of when the bills should become effective, another was a suggestion to set up a negotiating body to deal with the contents of the bills. Her proposal was on these two points. It was valuable advice which came at a time when things were becoming very urgent. At the time I expressed the hope that, given the situation, she would impress on Mr. Kono the desirability of holding a meeting of top leaders. The meeting subsequently took place. At the meeting, much time was devoted to discussing the question of setting up a negotiating body, as proposed by the speaker. But our discussions were unable to make headway on this, and it turned out that we could accept -- or make good use of -- only the proposal concerning the date the bills become effective. As far as the contents of the agreement were concerned, however, both sides were able to narrow their views in the course of discussions. I reported this to the speaker. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] ...please let me ask a question of both Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. President. [Words indistinct] ...could you describe how your latest decision will affect the future of the ties among coalition parties as well as coalition-opposition relations? [Hosokawa] That is a difficult question. To be honest with you, I cannot make a prediction. [Kono] I think that is a very good question. I cannot yet make a prediction on how effective the political reform bills will be. But as the prime minister said earlier, there are a mountain of difficult issues pending, such as the Japan-U.S. economic talks and the economic stimulus measures, which have a bearing on the lives of the people, and which are still waiting to be resolved. I think, when it comes to defending the quality of life of the people, it will be possible for the LDP to make proposals to the prime minister. We have long experience in running government and, as such, have the capability. [Hosokawa] I spoke of it a little earlier, but when you realize the seriousness of the situation facing the nation now, it is necessary to call a truce in the political war and tackle the economic and other pending issues. As for your question about the future of the coalition government, I agree it is a good question. But, as I said earlier, it is very difficult to make a prediction at this stage. [Correspondent] Mr. Kono, please let me reconfirm some points from my previous question. How does your agreement define the date the bills take effect? [Kono] That is on the paper. [Correspondent] Do you mean the bills are frozen for the time being? [Kono] Please refer to the last two lines of the preface. [Correspondent] I suppose revision of the bills will be discussed during the next ordinary Diet session. How soon, then, before the Diet is ready for that session? [Kono] That is on the paper. Please read what the paper says. The paper says the revision of the bills should be discussed before deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget. Please read it carefully. [Correspondent] My question is for Mr. Prime Minister. Compared to the bills provided by the government, the final agreement is very different from the original plan. I thought the government worked out the original proposal to pursue its ideals and philosophy. Did you forget about your ideals and philosophy when you accepted the drastic revision? [Hosokawa] There may be criticism of my decision. However, as I repeatedly noted earlier, the enactment of political reform bills has been the biggest pending issue of the last six years. Taking into account how the issue affects our economic and foreign policies, I had to change the basic framework of politics taking into account wide-ranging viewpoints. I made my final decision from such viewpoints.
