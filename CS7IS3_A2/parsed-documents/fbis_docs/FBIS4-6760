FBIS4-6760 "dreas078_d_94027" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 South Korea Minister Warns Against Private Military Groups Minister Warns Against Private Military Groups SK2204101094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0647 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204101094 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae declared Friday that the government would never allow the formation of a private grouping within the military. The declaration was contained in Yi's ministerial command letter No. 3 to commanders and staff officers of brigades and above. The missive was entitled "Solidarity and Harmony for Stability of the Armed Forces." The regular personnel reshuffle carried out earlier this month involving top Army posts has rooted out "the problems related to private organizations," the defense minister said. Yi was referring to the April 16 shake-up in which eight Army generals who belonged to "Hana-hoe," a private organization, were forced to retire. Hana-hoe, formed by former President Cho Tu-hwan and his group of Army officers, was instrumental in catapulting Cho into power by helping to stage "a coup d'etat-like" action on Dec. 12, 1979, following the assassination of President Park Chung-he. A kind of old-boy network, Hana-hoe reportedly wielded great power within the military and meddled in the nation's politics under the administrations of former Army generals. But Kim Yong-sam, who was inaugurated as the country's first civilian president in February last year, has systematically purged politically minded members of Hana-hoe and other private organizations in the military. In his letter, Yi said, "if anyone was found to have formed or attempted to form a private organization, he would immediately be picked out and expelled from the Armed Forces. "This basic principle will be applied to all forms of private organizations," he added. All commanders, therefore, should carry out their duties lest any private organization hamper the solidarity or reduce the combat capabilities of the Armed Forces. Officers should make no further attempts to create a private group. Even the term "private organization" should not be mentioned in the military, Yi emphasized. He said all officers, including those who once belonged to private groups, should employ their abilities fully to serve the country and their fellow Koreans. Noting that talk about creating a private organization always stems from unfair promotion practices, Yi said promotions must be based on an officer's ability as seen from three viewpoints -- those of commanders, fellow officers and subordinates.
