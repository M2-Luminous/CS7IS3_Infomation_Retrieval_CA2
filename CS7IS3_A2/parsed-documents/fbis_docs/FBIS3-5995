The editorials have been stepped up since the lifting of the U.S. economic embargo on Vietnam earlier this year. In the latest commentaries, both the party and military newspapers called on Vietnamese to make "the irreversible choice" toward socialism, taking into account "the thoughts of Ho Chi Minh" during this period of opening. The Cold War language since the embargo was lifted earlier this year betrays the government's suspicions of Western influence, as increasing numbers [of] Americans have begun arriving in the country to do business, analysts say. Following closely the actions of its neighbour China, which has been facing US pressure on human rights, Vietnam is emphasizing the primary importance of political stability, and rejects "interference in its internal affairs." "The Vietnamese people recognize the leading role of the party, support political stability as helpful to doing business, and recognize that pluralism and a multiparty system are potential causes of social problems," the SAIGON GIAI PHONG (FREE SAIGON) daily wrote. The leadership is particularly wary of the return of some of the one million "Viet Kieu," or overseas Vietnamese who fled to the United States after the fall of Saigon in 1975. The leaders are eager for the money and business know-how the returnees would bring, but not the political and cultural influences picked up during years in the West, well-placed sources said. The other threat to the regime, the sources said, comes from inside Vietnam itself in the form of Catholic and Buddhist dissidents, other intellectuals, and disgraced former party or military members. The Vietnamese leadership now enjoys less ideological support abroad for its orthodoxy, with only Laos and Cuba left in the traditional communist camp. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrives for a visit next week.
