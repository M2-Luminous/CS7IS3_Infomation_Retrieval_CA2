He studied dentistry in Belgrade, where he achieved notable success as a youth functionary. Upon receiving his diploma, he got a job at the Knin Health Center, but completed his specialization in Sarajevo. To the people of Knin, however, Babic is much less known as a dentist--there is a witness (the name and address are known to the editors) who alleges that Babic accidentally pulled one of his healthy teeth--than as a politician; among other things, he was the party secretary at his health center. He witnessed the disintegration of the LCY [League of Communists of Yugoslavia] as an LCC [League of Communists of Croatia] delegate at its last, 14th congress. Behind the scenes, he opposed Ivica Racan and part of the Croatian delegation, failing to comprehend what they had against Slobodan Milosevic and why they were supporting the Slovenes. He returned to Knin, definitively breaking with the reform faction of the Croatian communists and launching his career as a national politician. Under the supervision of Dr. Jovan Raskovic, Babic quickly became one of the founders of the SDS [Serbian Democratic Party]. He ran for the post of president of Knin Opstina in the first multiparty elections in Croatia in 1990 and was elected. However, he was not satisfied with the results of the elections; the SDS won in only three of the total of 11 Serb opstinas in Croatia. In this way, Raskovic was forced to negotiate with high-ranking Croatian functionaries (it appeared to be a matter of days before he would be officially declared the new Svetozar Pribicevic), and Babic himself conducted some of the negotiations, especially with the ministers in the Croatian Government in charge of the economy. He sought the combination of the northern Dalmatian and Lika opstinas into one community that would be better able to develop. The Croatian side, however, wanting to be done with the communists once and for all, allowed the SDS to repeat the elections in an "antibureaucratic" manner--Zagreb figured that this would satisfy Raskovic, and that he would support them in the inevitable conflict with Milosevic. Throughout the summer of 1990, Krajina teemed with various SDS rallies. Besides Raskovic, Babic was an obligatory speaker. While the former spoke about the Serb soul, the latter dealt with the Serb stomach; while the party chairman met with priests, the president of Knin Opstina set up the party apparatus; while the psychiatrist attended village feast celebrations, the dentist spent endless hours at meetings of activists. Along the way, Babic the pragmatist accumulated various executive functions. At the end of the summer of 1990, the bills finally came due: Dr. Tudjman asked Raskovic to take a definitive stance toward Serbia. The latter was unable to do so, in part because of his personal ties with the SANU [Serbian Academy of Science and Art] and Francuska Street 7, in part because of pressure coming from within his own party. At their last meeting, Raskovic explained to Tudjman why he should not strain relations with Serbs in Croatia too much, providing the legendary explanation: "The Serbs are an insane nation." Then he made two mistakes: He did not inform the SDS leadership of what happened at the meeting, and he left for the United States. The notes from the meeting published by DANAS in Zagreb spelled the end of his political career. Babic pointed out to his fellow fighters, there you have it, Uncle Jovan is good and intelligent, but he is frivolous and naive, and in his absence Babic took over the party. The situation was also more than advantageous for him: Public debate was in full swing concerning amendments to the Croatian Constitution, i.e., the introduction of new symbols (the odious "checkerboard" flag) and the elimination of the Serbs as a constituent nation, as that would be characterized today. In any event, the barricades appeared on 17 August as a Serb reaction to the Croat reaction that the announced referendum on autonomy for Krajina would be prevented "by all means." It seemed that everyone in the crowd that emerged was confused--the Croat policemen sent to remove the barricades, the Serbs at the barricades, the tourists forced to take detours, Dr. Raskovic, and Dr. Tudjman--everyone except Milan Babic. In his capacity as president of the opstina, he declared a state of war on Radio Knin, reported attacks by "Tudjman's special forces," said that he had proof that chemical warfare was being waged, and instructed the population to save ammunition after the victory by the "Red Star" because it would soon be very necessary. All authority in Knin was his now. There were no more serious negotiations with Croatia. Everyone who attempted to negotiate, such as Veljko Dzakula, or the former Assembly deputy Radoslav Tanjga, received Babic's anathema. It was obvious that the president of the SAO [Serb Autonomous Region of] Krajina was doing little at his own initiative; after the 9 March 1991 demonstration in Belgrade, he sent Slobodan Milosevic a letter of support and demanded a settling of scores with "the Draskovicites and students" for the sake of Serb unity. Many regard Plitvice Easter, 1 April 1991, as the beginning of the war in Croatia. The day before, Babic declared unification with Serbia in Korenica, taking the Serbian parliament completely by surprise and showing that dealing with him would not exactly be an easy thing. The open warfare that subsequently broke out put many things on the back burner, until it was "frozen"--by the signing of the Vance plan. In the meantime, Babic had advanced to the post of president of the RSK [Republic of Serbian Krajina], and as such he was the sole master of Krajina. He figured that trade with his state was secure, and to the surprise of everyone, he refused to sign the plan. He was assailed for hours at a meeting of the SFRY Presidency, but he refused to budge. Finally, Slobodan Milosevic was forced to write an open letter calling for his dismissal. The people of Knin remained faithful to their opstina president ("Slobodan, write another letter, we did not understand the first one"), but executors of the deed were found in the persons of Goran Hadzic and Mile Paspalj. Babic was replaced, and his political fate seemed sealed. Babic, treated as a potential rebel, spent the period following his dismissal criticizing the new Krajina leadership and the Vance plan. He let it be known that he had no intention of retreating and that he was prepared to wait. On two occasions he was mistreated: Under unclarified circumstances, in March 1992, officer Zdravko Vranjes fired his gun at his apartment, and in July of the same year a group of unknown policemen beat him up in Benkovac and held a pistol in his mouth. Nevertheless, after a ritual reconciliation with Martic in October 1992 (they had fallen out over the Vance plan), things began to look up for Babic. It also turned out that he had evolved and mastered the political vocation. He is cold-blooded, does not expose himself in Krajina political showdowns, and in general he uses others--the local radicals, for example--to skillfully advance his aims. He is patiently building a party with numerous people who are dissatisfied with the Hadzic team, which is no problem whatsoever under the conditions of everyday life in Krajina. They say that he has changed quite a lot in waiting for his five minutes, but that in one regard he has remained consistent: He will never go back to Croatia, no matter what the price.
