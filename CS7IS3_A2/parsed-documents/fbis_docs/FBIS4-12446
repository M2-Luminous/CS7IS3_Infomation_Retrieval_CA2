In a statement to the AL-JUMHURIYAH correspondent in Khartoum, the Sudanese minister said the economic sanctions on the lofty Iraq are eroding, thanks to the great and historic leadership of President Saddam Husayn. He said the recent Security Council resolution is neither fair nor legal, adding that it is enough to say that France, Russia, China, and some other states did not approve of the final statement. Sabdarat praised the steadfastness of the Iraqi people in the face of aggression and blockade, stressing that there is an unusual chemistry in the structure of the Iraqi people, whose achievements under the siege are greater than under normal circumstances. I do not believe any other people under the same pressure and siege could have achieved what the Iraqis have achieved. The Sudanese information minister said the most important achievement of the Iraqi leadership was that it prevented any fragmentation of the country, as was planned, and that the national structure and unity of Iraq was maintained. He added that the most important achievement of the people of Iraq is their rallying around the historic leadership of President Saddam Husayn. The Sudanese minister said the blockade will collapse now that the Iraqis have quickly adapted themselves to the imposed conditions and developments and become a great giant through their great and historic achievements.
