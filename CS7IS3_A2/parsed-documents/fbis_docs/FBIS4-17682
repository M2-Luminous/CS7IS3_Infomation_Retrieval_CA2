FBIS4-17682 "drsov080_b_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political Issues Yavlinskiy, Zyuganov on Refusal To Sign Accord Yavlinskiy, Zyuganov on Refusal To Sign Accord LD2504192294 LD2504192294 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian at 1625 GMT on 25 April broadcasts an 8-minute report within the "Details" program, during which Sergey Dorenko speaks to Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the Yabloko faction, and briefly with Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, opponents of signing the Public Accord agreement. Zyuganov lists his reasons for not signing the document, which include the fact that he believes the government has lost the trust of the people and that its social policies have failed. Although many parties and movements have signed agreements, there is no guarantee that these agreements will be implemented, he argues. Grigoriy Yavlinskiy tells Dorenko that some 7-8 million people voted for him during the elections. He says that his party believes in stability, but does not believe that signing this agreement will lead to stability. On the contrary, he stresses, it will exacerbate the situation in the long term, as it will separate reformers from anti-reformers. Yavlinskiy says he believes that the agreement should be on more specific issues, such as privatization, social policy, or foreign policy. He expresses his displeasure with the fact that, among the signatories of the document are parties which could not be trusted, such as the Liberal Democratic Party, saying he does not believe their slogans and objectives or their policy, which is fraught with war. Asked if he felt he would be isolated if he does not sign the document, Yavlinskiy responds that this would not be the case. His party cannot take part in matters which it does not believe in. Dorenko sums up by saying that some people will be signing the document in order to stress their closeness to the president, and to help influence decision-making. Meanwhile, the non-signatories will continue the struggle out on the streets, Dorenko concludes.
