All these rumors seem to be supported by a meeting I had a couple of months ago with former General Ruben Dario Paredes at his request. Gen. Paredes was interested in talking to me about his ideas on national security regarding the future protection of the Panama Canal. It goes without saying that I far from share the ideas of the aforementioned officer on national security and that I have never been associated with or served under him at any time in my life. That, however, did not keep me from listening to what he had to say. The PRD was organized as a party under the sponsorship, protection, and support of the military dictatorship to serve as its political arm. The PRD fulfilled this role until 20 December 1989. During the dictatorship, the leaders of the PRD rose to their positions within the party cadres after proving themselves unconditional servants of their military chiefs. Now that the dictatorship they served so submissively has been overthrown, they are trying to discredit me by linking me in some way to their former masters with whom they were closely involved. If the former officers of the defunct Defense Forces wanted to discredit the members of the PRD who are so fearful of them today because of what the former officers know about them, they would not need me. All the former officers have to do is go public with all they know about the activities of their unconditional servants of the past, when they very enthusiastically formed part of the dictatorship which they bent over backwards to serve. The officers who were members of the military leadership know very well and have firsthand information about the stories and adventures of those who served as the civilian instruments of the regime. The best thing that could happen would be for the Panamanian people to find out what really went on. To do this, the former officers do not need my advice or recommendations. I would appreciate your publishing this letter with the same emphasis given the "news" item to which I am referring. Sincerely yours, Ruben Carles, presidential candidate
