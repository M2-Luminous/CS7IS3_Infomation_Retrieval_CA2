He has been elected to Congress for three terms. He is an expert on international economic relations for the opposition. "In my opinion, the pressure exerted by U.S. Ambassadors Terence Todman and James Cheek and Vice President Al Gore to approve the patents law represents a lack of respect," he told LA PRENSA. The former UCR [Radical Civic Union] National Committee executive board international relations secretary believes in Mercosur [Common Market of the South] because "this market is our natural space, and it is the market we must work for." He is very much against the idea of Argentina joining NAFTA: "Argentina's election as a probable NAFTA member was presented as an achievement. From the political point of view the event might have some significance, but from the economic point of view it has no meaning at all. At this time our two countries' trade exchange is minimal. Besides, it is largely favorable to the United States," Storani said. The Radical Party legislator did not like the U.S. Embassy's repeated requests to speed up the approval of a pharmaceutical patents law. "I think the pressure exerted by former Ambassador Terence Todman, who is returning home, as well as by current Ambassador James Cheek and Vice President Al Gore is totally negative. They publicly placed the need to approve a patents law in accordance with U.S. companies' interests as a basic condition. Mr. Carter [not further identified] said the same thing to President Carlos Menem in Chile much more brutally. The least Menem should have done, considering the insolence of this second-class official who was addressing a head of state, is to put him in his place." Storani, however, assured us that he has "always supported the need to change the law, but protecting our interests and without encouraging the monopoly of foreign laboratories, which has had fateful consequences in other countries." "In some cases it is a matter of justice to give something to the inventor. But this gratification should be granted within the framework of a broad health policy," Storani said. "We also must take into account the interests of local laboratories, which are not simply pirates stealing foreign technology." [Bruno] But returning to NAFTA, the government says the national economic interest requires... [Storani, interrupting] Our economic interests are absolutely insignificant. They might be potentially important, but we will see that later. For instance, U.S. producers still receive subsidies, and this is unfair competition affecting Argentine producers. I have the impression that nothing is clear from an economic viewpoint, and I insist our bilateral trade is grossly tilted in favor of the United States. Besides, our exports cannot diversify, and we cannot sell them more manufactured products. [Bruno] Are NAFTA and Mercosur compatible? [Storani] I visited the United States recently. Every single official I talked to said NAFTA and Mercosur are incompatible. Therefore, what [Foreign Minister Guido] Di Tella said about compatibility is incongruous. [Bruno] Let us suppose they really are incompatible, and we have to choose between one or the other. Which one do you think the government would chose? [Storani] If this trend of carnal relations continues, I think the government will chose NAFTA, even though we do not have any economic interest at stake. My position is that our natural space is Mercosur. The fact that today we have economic differences with Brazil does not mean we must leave that path. I would like to participate in both markets, if possible, and even work for what George Bush proposed in the Americas Initiative. [Bruno] What is your opinion on the issue of a common external tariff system between Brazil and Argentina? [Storani] The unification of our different systems is a step in the right direction, without a doubt. But I think the Argentine Government is overacting on the issue of deadlines. We need a gradual process of economic compatibility before our tariff systems can be unified. Instead of establishing deadlines, the government should have established conditions and guidelines. Regarding relations with Brazil, I think first we must look at the development of the process of economic reforms, make our economies compatible, and eliminate our differences. Then we make evaluate progress in these areas and move forward toward unifying our tariff systems. [passage omitted]
