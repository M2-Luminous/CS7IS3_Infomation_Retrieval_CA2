First, administrative constraints have been relaxed somewhat, while the ownership system at state-owned enterprises has not yet been reformed, and the constraints of ownership have not yet taken shape. This has given rise to much disorder. Second, during this period when the function of government is being transformed and the style of effective macro adjustment is changing, all at once certain areas of uncertainty have appeared, leading to some irregular government activities. These circumstances have created "openings," "facilitators," and "accelerators" for the emergence and spread of corruption. Therefore, we cannot say there is no relationship at all between the spread of corruption and the market economy; but we also cannot say that it is the necessary, evil consequence of reforms leading to a market economy. At most, the imperfections in the process of reform toward a market economy have provided corruption with an opportunity to come forth! The crux of the problem is whether the root of corruption is in the market economy or in the old system. This writer believes that the root cause is in the old system. This is a special feature of the corruption problem as it exists in China at the present stage. Mainly, it has the following manifestations: First, state power is marked by direct control over micro-economic activity. The agencies with authority, and even the individuals in charge, hold de facto power of life and death over enterprises and small-scale activities. Enterprises and small-scale activities need administrative approval at every turn; without it, nothing can be so much as talked about. Therefore, making and using connections, doing business through influence, "greasing palms," and "cutting red tape" have become the "standard topics" in economic life. From this, there have arisen all kinds of bad practices, bribery, and the perversion of justice. Second, improper hiring is a major breeding ground for corruption. Interpersonal relationships are complex, leading to tangled webs of interrelations, where "one bureaucrat protects another." In some units, only relatives, or only mediocrities, or only slavish-minded people can be hired. Such bad practices as hiring people related through marriage, forming cliques, and bureaucrats protecting one another have been going on for a long time; the masses have been angry, but do not dare to speak out. These bad hiring practices are both a major manifestation of corruption and a source of it. Third, there is a lack of suitable control over government actions, or even on the exercise of personal authority. There is no objective mechanism for preventing excesses, and no effective system of oversight. This is a major reason why corruption has persisted despite repeated prohibitions against it, and even became more and more rampant. For these two reasons, the original mechanisms of vertical and horizontal supervision have become weak. Moreover, it has been extremely difficult for law enforcement agencies and the media to carry out their functions independently. When the masses have made reports, usually very little has come of it, and it has also invite open or disguised retaliation. Over time, the exercise of authority has become unconstrained and "omnipotent," and when it has become thus corrupted, then it "does as it pleases." Fourth, corrupt activities and corrupt elements often cover themselves with a camouflage or veneer of high-mindedness. Many bad practices, or open corruption, are not only dressed in official garb, but are carried out under the banners of "public spirit," "principle," "guidance," and the like. When something goes wrong, then the corrupt elements can still drag in all sorts of irrelevancies, and shift between soft and hard tactics, plus bringing in exculpations and intercessions from above, until things are hopelessly confused. This concealment in formalities has created the present pattern of widespread, semi-public corruption, and the difficulty of suppressing or striking out against such corruption so that the perpetrators can rest easy, knowing that they are well-protected.
