Today, Prime Minister Bildt was informed about the situation in the negotiations by the Latvian deputy foreign Minister. There is now hope that the last Russian soldier will have left the Baltic countries by 31 August, says Carl Bildt, who has talks with both the Russian and U.S. Governments about the situation in the Baltic countries prior to the summit in Moscow next week. [Begin recording] [Bildt] I assess that it is fairly likely, it is possible to reach such an agreement. Then there are certain remaining problems which will take slightly longer to solve. One such big problem is the major strategic radar station at Skrunda in Latvia. Another problem can be those plants connected to the former Soviet warship base in Paldiski in Estonia, where it might take a longer time to dismantle the nuclear reactors -- there are training reactors for nuclear submarine crews there -- and it is not certain that they can manage that by 31 August. [Reporter Boerje Remdahl] Have these talks a connection with President Clinton's upcoming visit to Moscow? [Bildt] Yes, they have. [Remdahl] In what sense? [Bildt] In the sense that the Americans are also interested in an agreement being reached. And the fact that President Clinton comes on an official visit to Moscow to meet President Yeltsin means that there is an opportunity to take up high-level discussions in a different way than what is normally possible. We have had closer cooperation with the Americans on these questions since I was in United States and met President Clinton in the White House a few months ago. [Remdahl] But is the situation in the talks now such that Clinton's visit to Moscow can be carried through without the Baltic question being an irritation? [Bildt] It is clear that it would be much better if the problem had been solved beforehand, but despite this the visit in Moscow serves as a possibility to clarify the Baltic questions also in the agenda of U.S.-Russian relations, and I know that President Clinton was personally interested in this and that is significant.
