Good evening. You are the spokesperson of the UNHCR in Geneva, so you have information from Gorazde that we may not have. Can you tell me this information about what is happening in that town, that has been surrounded by the Serbs. [Berthiaume] The latest information we received goes back to about 1800. Two shells had struck the building where the employees of the UNHCR are based -- not only them, but also the forces of the UN military observers, as well as a large number of refugees. There are dozens and dozens of refugees in the building, displaced persons, who, I suppose, felt safer in our building, and unfortunately we have had no news of these people since then. [passage omitted] [Amar] Thank you, Christiane Berthiaume, for telling us what is happening in Gorazde. Unfortunately we don't have any pictures, simply because the Serbs are preventing international television teams from filming. No pictures, but we can still give the news.
