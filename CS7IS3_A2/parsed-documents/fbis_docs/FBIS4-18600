FBIS4-18600 "drweu067_h_94012" FBIS-WEU-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 Germany Coalition, SPD Criticize Each Other Over Taxes Coalition, SPD Criticize Each Other Over Taxes AU0604125094 Berlin DIE WELT in German 6 Apr 94 p 11 AU0604125094 Berlin DIE WELT German BFN ["HH"-signed report: "SPD: Waigel Has Lost Perspective"] [Text] Bonn -- The coalition and the opposition yesterday accused each other of incompetence in financial policy. For Joachim Poss, financial policy spokesman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Bundestag group, it is obvious that Finance Minister Theo Waigel "has completely lost the necessary perspective in tax and financial policy." This seems to have also been realized by the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] group, which, according to newspaper reports, is working on a concept that envisages higher excise and property taxes, as well as the introduction of a road-use fee. In contrast, Waigel has stressed that there will not be any further tax increases apart from the reintroduction of the solidarity surcharge in 1995. The Finance Ministry and the CDU/CSU group have not commented on Schaeuble's plans. Waigel criticized the SPD by saying that its government program would hurt medium-sized industry, even though it wants to address "much more strongly" the "justified concerns" of medium-sized industry. This applies not only to the 10-percent supplementary tax, no matter whether it starts at a taxable income of 56,000 German marks [DM], DM50,000, or less, but also to the restriction intended by the SPD for the tax reduction for conversions and sale of business (Article 34 of the Income Tax Law), which would lead to a wave of sale and concentration in medium-sized industry. The higher taxes on profits from the sale of shares in corporations, which the SPD demands, would also lead to a wave of concentration at the cost of medium-sized industry. The disagreement, which was criticized by Poss, is found not only in the coalition but also in the SPD. In contrast to SPD Bundestag Group Chairwoman Anke Fuchs, Poss wants to stick to the solidarity surcharge for 1995, he told DIE WELT. Concerning the tax exemption of the subsistence minimum, which has been demanded by the Constitutional Court, he is working out a model in a work group. Poss understands the constitutional assignment in such a way that the exemption must be implemented in one step in 1996 -- unless Waigel can use the ruling to prove that a step-by-step solution is permitted. From 1991 to 1995, additional burdens resulting from taxes (annual amount) add up to DM68.6 billion and from social security contributions to DM31.9 billion. This does not include the contributions for nursing care insurance. This is stated in a response by the Finance Ministry to SPD Deputy Helmut Wieczorek. It is surprising that the solidarity surcharge, which will come into effect in 1995 and which Waigel recently calculated at DM28 billion, is now estimated at only DM26 billion. The solidarity surcharge, which was levied from mid-1991 to mid-1992, on the other hand, yielded DM28.2 billion.
