At present, Chen Ziming must ask for permission from the authorities concerned if he wants to go out. Wang Zhihong yesterday accompanied her husband back to their home in Beijing. Unlike before, their home was surrounded by more than 10 uniformed and plainclothes policemen. Wang Zhihong said that the present situation of her husband and herself was delicate. Yesterday afternoon, Chen Ziming's mother returned from her son's place. She was deeply worried about her son's health, and asked -- since her son had been allowed to seek medical treatment outside prison -- why the authorities still did not allow him to go out freely. Chen Ziming is now suffering from heart disease, stomach disease, high blood pressure (100-160), and skin disease. According to his wife, except for the skin disease, all the diseases were contracted in prison. The greatest hope of Wang Zhihong is that her husband's diseases will be cured. Chen Ziming is now living with his family, but he still cannot go out and return to society freely. Wang Zhihong was discontent with the fact that her husband had to "ask for permission from the authorities beforehand" if he wanted to go out. She is now negotiating with the authorities in a bid to achieve her husband's freedom. After living in prison for five years, Chen Ziming lost some weight, but he was not dejected at having contracted many diseases. Wang Zhihong said that her husband was in a good mental condition and that the heavy mental pressure was mitigated. "However, the first thing now is to give him medical treatment." Wang also said that they were still facing the pressure from the authorities concerned. Wang Zhihong, who spoke prudently, said that in the current sensitive period, it was inconvenient for Chen Ziming to say anything, but she hoped to express their thanks to overseas readers through this newspaper for their loving care. It has been learned that after returning home, Chen Ziming continued to be under full surveillance by the authorities and could not come into contact with the outside world. In addition, his family was short of money, and they are concerned over their future livelihood. It is said that Chen's mother has formally expressed this concern to the authorities.
