Or, people active in their region, who had been kidnapped by Apo [Abdullah Ocalan] and taken into the mountains, were released upon Apo's command, came down from the mountains, became PP candidates, and became mayors! After Istanbul, Ankara was also lost!... The PP was victorious in Ankara as well. According to the current results, of the 76 provinces, the PP won 27 and the NAP [Nationalist Action Party] eight. Together they received more than 26 percent of the votes. Given the current election system, the meaning of these results "within a suitable geographic distribution" is clear: "The 27 March elections have brought the PP-NAP alliance to power!" When one studies these results, the TPP [True Path Party] enthusiasm over "being the first party" is meaningless. As for the SDPP [Social Democratic Populist Party], it has nothing to say anyway. Therefore, the current TPP-SDPP government "is overshadowed by the PP-NAP alliance." To the aforementioned results, one should also add those in Turkey's three metropolitan areas. The PP won outright in Istanbul and Ankara. If one also adds the case of Burhan Ozfatura from Izmir, who is known to be "a staunch PP man" but who ran in the elections as a TPP candidate, one can say that three of Turkey's key cities are under the control of the PP. Furthermore, one should bear in mind that "the NAP supported the TPP in Izmir" and that Ozfatura won the elections "by consolidating his religious identity through the support of the NAP." Predictions have been fulfilled. The votes cast as a backlash from the suburbs of the metropolitan areas were cast for the PP. The future of these cities is not being determined by their "owners" but by "outsiders" who immigrated to the suburbs. I have been talking to those who have served as mayors in the southeast for the last five years. A most striking reality surfaced in phone conversations I had with them yesterday. "Why was the PP particularly successful in the southeast?" I seek the answer to this question.... One should first clarify a contradiction. The PP has become synonymous with "reaction to the current order," while the PP candidates who won the elections are actually "the guardians of the order!" For example, the new mayor of Kars is from the NAP and is a guard.... The mayors of Cizre, Midyat, Dargecit, and Guclukonak are "PP members who were formerly guards!" Another example is the new mayor of Batman, who "is a citizen who has very close ties with Hezbollah"! There is a contradiction here. When addressing the people, the PP claims to be opposed to the current order, but when it comes to electing its candidates, it "depends on the state." The state is not even aware of this ploy. Some of the candidates were "Apo's guests in the mountains" prior to the elections!... Anyway, most of them are of Kurdish origin.... Once they came down from the mountains, they cooperated with the PP and, through the "Apo-PP alliance," won the mayoralties for the PP. The PP candidates have continuously stated that "they are aware of the Kurdish reality but that they will solve the Kurdish problem through brotherhood and peace within the Islamic framework." The Kurdish reality in the world; "the keys of heaven in the hereafter!" That is what has been promised. Furthermore, the people in the southeast are basically opposed to the following: ANAP [Motherland Party] particularly and the TPP propose eradicating terror "through military measures alone." The people are suffering as a result of this policy. The PP, however, says that it "will put a stop to the bloodshed" and is thus sympathetic to the people. It talks about a solution other than a military one. At this point, in reaction against the other parties, the "TPP and ANAP votes are going to the PP". This is not a casual claim. Gaziantep and Rize are concrete examples. [passage omitted] On one hand, there is the PP-NAP alliance, with some 26 percent of the votes. On the other, there are millions of people "who constitute some 74 percent of the vote and who will have to bow down to the PP-NAP alliance!" Currently, 26 percent are victorious and 74 percent defeated! Who caused this? The very honorable leaders of the TPP, ANAP, the SDPP, the DLP [Democratic Left Party], and the RPP [Republican People's Party] and their administrations! May the election results be auspicious to you honorable leaders!
