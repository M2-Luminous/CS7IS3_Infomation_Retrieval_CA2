Last year, the A and B exchange capacity reached 60,000 and the number of subscribers increased to 30,000, thanks to four months of stepped-up efforts made by the staff members and workers at the Shanghai Municipal Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau. At present, the number of subscribers to the two Shanghai cellular networks totals 44,890.
