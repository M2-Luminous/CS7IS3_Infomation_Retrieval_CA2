In the statement published Tuesday, the bloc pointed out that the president and those close to him needed civil accord for the sole purpose of "doing away with any possibility for society to criticize the official line and therefore allow those who have been granted access to power in any way, but demonstrated their complete incapacity for managing a great country, to remain in power for at least another couple of years, maybe more." The bloc believes civil accord could be achieved through early presidential elections and forming a new government. The bloc called on all political parties and movements, "healthy forces" in all branches of power and the people to support early presidential elections and other related social and state reforms. On the same day, the bloc proposed the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Aleksiy II call on the people to refrain from any political activities on Easter day, May 1.
