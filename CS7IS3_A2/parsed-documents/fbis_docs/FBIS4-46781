Its a tragedy that Pavlychko is not among the deputies that defend Ukrainian independence...." I heard many similar comments on April 22 by the parliament building, and decided to meet with Dmytro Vasylovych Pavlychko, a well-known Ukrainian poet and politician, for a frank interview and discussion. [Ovchar] Why didn't you run for parliament in the Western oblast where a victory was a sure thing, but instead in Chyhyryn? [Pavlychko] It was not my intention to win for the sake of winning. I knew that in Eastern Ukraine it would be difficult to win, but I felt that from a moral point of view it would be more honest to lose in the East than be elected in the West. Of course I wanted to be in the new parliament and had every right to be. Ukraine has made significant progress in international politics and it was in this area that I had the most experience. Nevertheless, elections are an important aspect in developing a new consciousness in our nation, and I decided to run in a region where national consciousness had been most severely oppressed for hundreds of years. The Chyhyryn region is the nucleus of our statehood, a fact well understood by our enemies. For that reason even the mildest display of national pride evoked much more severe repressions than in Galicia. I am referring to the savage executions carried out by the Cheka and NKVD after the fall of the Kholodnyy Yar republic. On March 9 of this year we commemorated Shevchenko at my initiative, the first such celebration after many decades. Someone had to go to Chyhyryn, if only to renew the tradition of celebrating Shevchenko. Having gone to Chyhyryn I also avoided running against people with similar beliefs from Rukh and other democratic parties. This was quite important to me, since I cannot conceive of anything more degrading than a squabble among friends and mutual recriminations. This move avoided confrontation with some of the more hard-headed `fighters for Ukraine'. It made it possible for me to take up a fight for a new way of thinking, for a new way of perceiving Ukrainian history and Ukraine's current situation, and for a new world outlook. This is a struggle that will take a lot of time. True, I lost, but I got a sixth of the votes. The people who supported me are the strongest proponents of reforms, democracy and statehood for Ukraine in the Chyhyryn and Kamyanskyy rayons in the Cherkasy Oblast. Think how much support we--democrats--would have in Eastern Ukraine if we did not spend all our time in the cities and villages of Galicia but went to the Dnieper region, Donbas, and Southern Ukraine. Even if we failed to wins seats in the parliament we would raise the consciousness of hundreds of thousands or even millions of our countrymen! [Ovchar] Recently the press reported that deputy Serhiy Holovatyy hinted that those who found National Rukh have lost their ideals, sold their souls to satan, and now seek cushy government jobs. Referring to you he said "...the Draches and Pavlychkos turned power over to the communists and then joined their camp." Comments? [Pavlychko] Four years ago I was one of Holovatyy's trusted colleagues when the parliament was being formed. I liked that young lawyer very much and it pains me to talk about him now. He acts like a narcissistic, conceited child. His baseless and vulgar attacks on the Ukrainian president are a reflection of his crudeness, and he has accused me, Drach and other deputies of collaborating with satan. This was in connection with the establishment of the Kievan patriarchate, a great achievement in our history. At least we have one independent Christian church. The fact that he is attempting to undermine this very institution suggest that something more is involved, but it is beneath my dignity to devote any more time to him and his base behavior. [Ovchar] Still, why did you select Chyhyryn and not, for example, an electoral district in the Kherson region? [Pavlychko] The first poem I learned by heart was Shevchenko's The Desecrated Grave (Rozryta Mohyla). Shevchenko's Chyhyryn and Subotiv lie at the heart of my being. I had a teacher from Chyhyryn, Anastasiya Leontiyivna Korsunivska. When battles were being fought in Kosmach between the UPA [Ukranian Insurgent Army] and NKVD [People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs] batallions, and in Yabloniv you could hear the explosion of grenades and other munitions, she was teaching us history in the eight grade. She taught us names of the cossack hetmans, colonels and haydamaks with the full knowledge that at that very instance the followers of Bandera were dying for our freedom while serving in units named in honor of the Doroshenkos, Hamaliyas, Charnots, Zaliznyaks. In the summer of 1952, after graduating from the university, I lived for several weeks in Borovytsya with my friend O. Shchyrytsya. My stay in that village--the home of otaman Pavlyuk--has been etched into my memory forever. I covered the Chyhyryn region on foot and still have friends in the villages dating back from that time. Then and later I visited Subotiv, Medvedivka, Stetsivka and other villages in that sacred land. I chose Chyhyryn because I feel close to it and know it quite well. Because I love this old cossack capital I founded the "Fund for the Restoration of Hetman B. Khmelnytskyy's Residence in Chyhyryn" long before I even thought of running for a deputy. [Ovchar] What will happen to this fund now? [Pavlychko] I will continue to serve as president of this benevolent organization. The fund has its articles of organization and a bank account at the Ukrinbank in Kiev. I will do what I can to see to it that it continues to grow. Chyhyryn and the worldwide Ukrainian community will celebrate the 400th anniversary of birthday of Hetman Khmelnytskyy in December, 1995. B. Khmelnytskyy was the founder of the Ukrainian state in cossack times. Without his accomplishment it would be hard to imagine a drive to independence and a sense of national dignity in our people. His oath to the tsar was as much a diplomatic maneuver as was his oath to the Polish crown before the final liberation of Ukraine from Polish nobility. Much too late I. Mazepa attempted to carry out Khmelnytskyy's plans. As a symbol of Ukrainian independence Chyhyryn will attract more and more people, and I see a great and happy future for it. But for now it is a destitute and unhappy city. The nuclear power station remains unfinished and thousands are unemployed. What can be done to save the qualified workers capable of providing Ukraine with the energy it needs but who don't have the opportunity to exercise their skills and expertise? I have gotten in touch with Western investors about the frozen Chyhyryn nuclear power plant and will continue with these efforts. [Ovchar] What was the main reason for your defeat? [Pavlychko] The primary voter here is a villager, a collective farm worker. I met with them, but not in mass meetings or clubs, but largely with working brigades. In other words, with small numbers. The major political force here is the head of a collective farm. These types agitated against me for their candidate, I. Vasyura, the head of the Khoduliyiv Collective Farm. They are the feudal lords whom the farm workers fear to offend because they are completely dependent on them economically. It is a hard life. The majority of the farm workers are older people and retirees and they fear the collapse of the collective farms. Who is going to take care of them then? Who is going to supple them with the necessities of life? A private farmer? They don't trust him. And they're right! I think a different approach to farm reforms would be more suitable than the one advocated by the parliament. I had to make peace between collective farm workers and private farmers in Lubyanky in the Ternopil region. Transferring large measures of land to private hands will mean social conflict in the village. Everyone in a collective farm realizes that they will not get as much land in the future as is now being granted because there simply won't be enough land. The collective farm worker will regard the private farmer as an enemy until all the land is privatized and the amount of land in one's possession is determined by market forces and individual abilities. But my realistic--in fact, pro-collective farm--program was not heard, and I was presented as an enemy of the collective farm. All those who were bad off in the collective farms and whose condition had deteriorated even more voted against me. In addition, all those philistines for whom the collective farm is now a paradise because there is no higher authority to order them around or punish them also voted against me to preserve their status quo. [Ovchar] You said the villages are made up of old people. But aren't younger people returning because life there is now easier than in the cities? [Pavlychko] Very few are coming back, and the villages are dying out. In Stetsivka fifty people died and two were born in 1994. If the young people who left the villages don't come back our chornozem will soon be covered with weeds. Consequently, farm reforms are an absolute must to save our people since the collective village is dying out. The Moscow-type of `developed' socialism created such disparities between the village and the city that we now have no choice but favor villages over cities to attract young people there to enjoy a more comfortable lifestyle that is closer to nature. This will require new laws and reorientation of national goals. [Ovchar] How do you feel about the elections in general and what do you think the new parliament will be like? [Pavlychko] I have no tragic prognoses. The elections were held in the midst of nostalgia for times when bread was cheap and human dignity had no value. The state took care of its slaves and provided food while trampling on human, national and civil rights. These elections, particularly in Eastern Ukraine, are reminiscent of the rebellion that Moses encountered while leading the Israelites out of Egypt to the Promised Land of Canaan. This too will pass and there is no going back. The majority of the new deputies are not party members and are not disposed to turn Ukraine back into a colony of an imperial system headed by Zhirinovskiy or Zyuganov. I have confidence in the new deputies and hope that political ambitions and differences between the parties will be set aside so that we can proceed with economic reforms. We need a new government that will increase our exports and income, reverse the outflow of dollars earned by our people, balance the budget and introduce the hryvnya. I am against presidential elections since they are unconstitutional. Kravchuk agreed to limit his term to four years rather than five, which means that presidential elections can be held in December of next year. Until we decide who is to hold executive power--the president or the prime minister--and until the parliament is at full strength and all the local elections and other problems that have troubled us are settled, a presidential election would lead to economic instability and discord. [Ovchar] I would be remiss if I did not inquire about any new literary endeavours in your life? [Pavlychko] Chyhyryn means a lot to me and in my free time I have written a cycle of poems entitled "Chyhyryn" which I would like to offer to the readers of LITERATURNA UKRAYINA. (The poems are published below--Eds.) [Ovchar] Do you have any comments on the article by Yu. Badzo "Let's Not Commit Suicide for Nothing," recently published in LITERATURNA UKRAYINA? [Pavlychko] That was a new democratic manifesto not limited to the democratically oriented parties. We have no `government party' and Ukrainian communists are not a new creation. However, many of the old members of the CPU were secretly for independence. The democratic forces must cooperate with the individuals who have no party affiliation, i.e, the mythical `government party', since our main objective is the preservation of our statehood. Only an independent Ukraine can guarantee social justice, and independence requires consolidation of all of our citizens. [Ovchar] What will you do now that you are 'free'? [Pavlychko] Be involved in literature and politics, same as before. You can work at statehood without being a deputy. As a member of the Democratic Party of Ukraine I will strive to unite the various small democratic parties into a single, solid political organization, otherwise we will fall prey to individual ambitions and lose our statehood, as has happened before in our history. [Ovchar] What do you mean by a single political organization? [Pavlychko] A political party. At the Khust conference I had advocated transforming Rukh into a political party. My proposal was not supported and Rukh fell apart into a number of parties. There were other reasons for that too--leaders that could not find common ground. The tragedy lies in the fact that our divisions were not along political lines but as followers of different leaders. I think the time has come for these leaders to step down since their activities are placing our national independence at risk. We could then unite the democratic organizations with Rukh into a powerful political entity that could promote Ukrainian statehood. The present leaders must be made to realize that their time is up. [Ovchar] The elections also revealed flaws in the election laws because of all the irregularities. What are your views on this? [Pavlychko] To put it gently, the election law is not very democratic. Anyone can run as long as he and his wife and children can get 300 signatures on a petition. In addition, a candidate that lost in one district cannot run in another even if drafted. Another major mistake is that elections were not carried out as they were in Russia, where half of the deputies were elected from political parties according to a proportional system. In that case individual candidates are elected as well as representatives of certain political viewpoints. However, our parliament passed a law to preserve itself at any cost. We had to vote for 450 deputies although we don't need such a large number of parliamentarians, and do so under a majority system. [Ovchar] Thank you for the interview and the discussion and, despite all the setbacks and problems, I wish you much success in your future literary and political activities.
