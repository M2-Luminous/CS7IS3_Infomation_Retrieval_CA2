He also announced that the government is considering imposing penalties when one of the parties refuses to negotiate an agreement. The labor minister appeared yesterday after the Congress [of Deputies] had given its approval to the labor reform in order to explain that the government had kept its election pledge to carry through this law, which he said is the only law possible right now. "It is a reform," he stated, "which goes no further because it would be impossible to apply, and if it fell short, it would be impossible to apply." Grinan admitted that the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] has had to yield to the demands of some groups such as Convergence and Union and the Basque Nationalist Party in some aspects of the labor reform, although he emphasized that "the amendments which have been introduced have improved the original text and served to achieve greater consensus." "The labor reform," he stressed, "is basically what the Socialist government wanted." The minister showed himself very optimistic about the fall in unemployment recorded in April -- 24,810 people -- and stated: "I will not say that we are in a stage of growth, but that the economic trend has changed, and we must consolidate this period of revival in order to proceed to recovery, which will be more effective if we introduce structural reforms capable of creating jobs." He pointed out that the reforms pending are a single law containing all the changes introduced in unemployment benefits, a vocational health law, and the reform of the INEM. Nevertheless, he made it very clear that the government does not intend to approve the strike law for the present, although it was also included in the PSOE's election program. Grinan did not hesitate to cite the labor reform as one of the factors which have helped revive the labor market, since "it has especially helped the hiring of groups with difficulties." He referred to the outcome of the first labor reform measures to be introduced -- the forms of hiring approved by decree law in January -- and disclosed that 75,000 apprenticeship contracts were registered up to 30 April, mostly with pay exceeding the Interprofessional Minimum Wage, and 40 percent with young people who have not completed Basic General Education. The labor minister cited one of the essential aspects of the labor reform -- collective bargaining -- and emphasized that the aim is to give labor relations between the social agents a priority role. He therefore called on employers and trade unions for an effort to "make profitable" the negotiations and end the year with the creation of net employment. On this point, he announced that the government is considering the possibility of imposing penalties when any of the parties refuses to negotiate, contrary to the ethical principle of the "duty to negotiate" contained in the Workers' Statute.
