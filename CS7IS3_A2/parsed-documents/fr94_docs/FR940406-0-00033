FR940406-0-00033 FR940406-0-00002 (i) The Board states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used, that the information requested is intended for use solely in conjunction with affirmative action; and (ii) The Board states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that refusal to provide it will not subject the employee or applicant for employment to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part. (5) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the medical condition or history of the employee or applicant for employment shall be kept confidential except that: (i) Managers, selecting officials, and others involved in the selection process or responsible for affirmative action may be informed that the employee or applicant for employment is an individual with a disability; (ii) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary accommodations; (iii) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where appropriate, if the condition might require emergency treatment; (iv) Government officials investigating compliance with laws, regulations, and instructions relevant to equal employment opportunity and affirmative action for individuals with a disability shall be provided information upon request; and (v) Statistics generated from information obtained may be used to manage, evaluate, and report on equal employment opportunity and affirmative action programs. (e) Physical access to buildings. (1) The Board shall not discriminate against employees or applicants for employment who are qualified individuals with a disability due to the inaccessibility of its facility. (2) It shall be the policy of the Board to comply with the provisions of the Rehabilitation Act, the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 et seq. ) and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12183 and 12204). (f) Reassignment. When a nonprobationary employee becomes unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position even with reasonable accommodation due to a disability, the Board shall offer to reassign the individual to a funded vacant position at the same grade level, the essential functions of which the employee would be able to perform with reasonable accommodation if necessary unless the reassignment would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the Board. In the absence of a position at the same grade level, an offer of reassignment to a vacant position at the highest available grade level below the employee's current grade level shall be made, but availability of such a vacancy shall not affect the employee's entitlement, if any, to disability retirement pursuant to any retirement plan in which the employee is enrolled. If the Board has already posted a notice or announcement seeking applications for a specific vacant position at the time the Board has determined that the nonprobationary employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position even with reasonable accommodation, then the Board does not have an obligation under this section to offer to reassign the individual to that position, but the Board shall consider the individual on an equal basis with those who applied for the position. (g) Exclusion from definition of ``individual with a disability'' _(1) Illegal use of drugs. (i) The term ``individual with a disability'' shall not include an individual who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, when the Board acts on the basis of such use. The term ``drug'' means a controlled substance, as defined in Schedules I through V of Section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812). The term ``illegal use of drugs'' means the use of drugs, the possession or distribution of which is unlawful under the Controlled Substances Act, but does not include the use of a drug taken under supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other uses authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or other provisions of federal law. This exclusion, however, does not exclude an individual with a disability who:
