FBIS4-35303 "drnes104_j_94032" FBIS-NES-94-104 Daily Report 29 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Basindwah Rejects Charge of Trying To `Impose' Unity Basindwah Rejects Charge of Trying To `Impose' Unity JN2905110594 Amman AL-ASWAQ in Arabic 29 May 94 pp 1, 13 JN2905110594 Amman AL-ASWAQ Arabic BFN [Report by Nasir 'Arif in Sanaa] [Text] Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah has asserted that the criticism by some people of the legitimate Yemeni Government and their accusations that it is trying, through war, to impose Yemeni unity by force are null and void and lack objectivity because unity has been maintained since 22 May 1990, when a document on merging the Yemeni people was signed. In an exclusive statement to AL-ASWAQ, the Yemeni foreign minister added that everyone should realize that the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] continues to work, through war, to impose secession and destroy the Yemeni unity. Thus, it is high time for all our Arab brothers to realize this fact, and they should not ignore the presence of a constitutional legitimacy stemming from the results of the 1993 elections. Basindwah added: This being the case, no person inside or outside Yemen is allowed to violate the Yemeni people's will as expressed through the polls. He ruled out the possibility that the Yemeni crisis would be discussed during the meetings of the foreign ministers of the Nonaligned Movement which will be held in Cairo, unless the discussion of peoples' internal affairs has become a general right for anyone. On whether the YSP would succeed in consolidating the secession of the southern part of Yemen, the Yemeni foreign minister said this is no longer possible, especially since the Government forces, in addition to controlling three important governments in the center of the former southern part of Yemen, have managed to impose a complete siege on the places housing the leadership of the YSP secessionists. He added that the leader of secessionists is now fully aware that his project cannot be implemented; otherwise, he would not have fled from Aden to Hadhramaut. If this leader finds himself besieged in Hadhramaut, he will flee outside the country, he added. Basindwah ruled out the possibility that the fighting raging in Yemen will have future negative repercussions on the border issues in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf for the simple reason that the fighting can in no way whatsoever turn into a long-term civil war. With regard to the message that the Yemeni Government is reportedly awaiting from the south, Basindwah said: In fact, we are not awaiting any message from the Socialist Party. However, what should be cautioned about here is the fact that the unionist elements in this party should show courage and condemn the secession decision made by 'Ali Salim al-Bid if they really care for preventing further bloodshed and destruction in Yemen; otherwise, their silence will be interpreted as recognition of this secession declaration. Asked about his expectations regarding the fate of the Yemeni crisis, Basindwah said: "The truth is that the legitimate forces belonging to the Government will succeed in imposing their control on all Yemeni territory. At that time, the legitimate leadership will undoubtedly open dialogue with the unionist forces, whether in the Socialist Party or in other parties." Basindwah asserted that the legitimate leadership no longer needs to storm Aden, knowing that the decision to enter it was contingent upon the issuance of a political decision. Now, however, we bet that the citizens of this city will definitely not allow the secessionists to inflict havoc on them. Therefore, I expect that all the sons of Aden will soon arrest the leader of secessionists and his clique, Basindwah said. [In a similar interview published on pages 1 and 20 of Amman SAWT AL-SHA'B in Arabic on 29 May, Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah states that he is carrying a message from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to Egyptian President Husni Mubarak. The message, he adds, deals with recent Yemeni developments. Basindwah categorically denies that his visit to Cairo is aimed at meeting with certain YSP leaders there.]
