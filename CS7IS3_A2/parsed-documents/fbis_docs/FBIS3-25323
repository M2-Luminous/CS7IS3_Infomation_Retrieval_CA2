Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo had said Nihia is training 1,000 men to fight Renamo if it wins the upcoming October elections. Ngonhamo said those men were being trained in area [poligono] number two, in Nampula District. Addressing Mozambican reporters at Nampula airport this morning, Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo added that Nihia had tried to train a riot police force on the outskirts of the city of Nampula with the aim of intimidating people during the elections. [passage omitted] The reporters asked Ngonhamo to discuss in depth Nihia's alleged involvement in the training of men to destabilize the Mozambican peace process. [Begin Ngonhamo recording] [words indistinct] the 1,000 men who were in area number two. Mr. Nihia was controlling that group. On 2 February, Mr. Nihia met with those men in area number two. It was not the provincial commander who met those men. It was not Mozambique Armed Forces Chief of General Staff Hama Thai or General Tobias Dai who came from Maputo to see those men. It was not some other commander, like Defense Minister Mr. Chipande, for instance. Instead, it was Mr. Nihia. Why was that? [words indistinct] can it be that Mr. Nihia was involved in a political ploy when he met those 1,000 men in area number two? Did he go there to convince them to join Frelimo and vote for it at the upcoming elections? (?This is the) truth. What was being dealt with at that camp was plans to destroy the peace process. Mr. Nihia told those soldiers that they would not have to go into assembly areas, they would stay put in that area, Frelimo would pay them well and they would get good accommodation and food until the elections had been held. If Renamo should win, those men would take up positions and attack the Renamo government. That is precisely what happened to that group of 350 men. There was no police commander controlling that group. Such a police commander may have been there as a subordinate to Mr. Nihia, who was responsible for the training of those men. [end recording] It has not been possible to get Nihia's response to Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo's latest accusation, because (?Nihia is still) in Maputo. Ngonhamo said that this morning he went to (Mupila) assembly area, in Zambezia Province, where he found that his men were very keen to join the future national army. He also noted that his men were facing salt shortages. This afternoon Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo went to Nacala to inspect the training ground for the special forces. Noting that 62 Renamo men are already in the city to take part in that training, Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo added that the other men will be there by tomorrow. Renamo and the government are each supposed to provide 300 men to the Special Forces Battalion.
