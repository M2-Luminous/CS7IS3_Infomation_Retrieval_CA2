This letter explains the Peruvian Government's economic policy for 1994 within the context of the Extended Fund Facility that was approved by the executive board on 18 March 1993. The development of the economy in 1993 was in general much better than was expected in the program's projections. It is estimated that the real GDP has increased by 7 percent, double what was estimated in the program's objectives, while net international reserves increased to approximately $265 million when compared with the program's goal of $195 million. Fiscal and monetary discipline has permitted a reduction in inflation from 57 percent in 1992 to 39.5 percent in 1993, and to a rate of 27 percent per annum during the second half of 1993. All the program's goals to December 1993 have been complied with, with the exception of the accumulation of delays with official creditors that was canceled on or around 9 February 1994. 2. The 1994 economic program has the intention of continuing with the reduction of inflation to between 15 and 20 percent, and of increasing the Central Bank's net international reserves by $151 million within the context of a real growth in the GDP of between 4 and 5 percent. The government will increase structural reforms in order to improve efficiency and increase national savings by providing the base for a sustained growth and for the viability of the balance of payments. In order to complement these internal efforts, the Peruvian Government will ask its creditors for a reduction in the balance of the foreign debt and its servicing in such a way that it will be viable with foreign accounts. The government will intensify its efforts to reduce poverty, improve the health, education, and other services of the population, and its efforts to consolidate the country's pacification, which is essential for the program's success. 3. In order to achieve these objectives, the public sector's primary surplus (prior to the income from privatizations) will in 1994 be increased to 0.6 percent of the GDP (up from 0.1 percent in 1993), which represents a significant advance that will help in covering the cash interest payments after the debt has been reduced. The public sector's consolidated deficit will be maintained at under 2.3 percent of the GDP, and will be fully financed with external resources. Efforts will be increased to increment tax income to finance the programmed expansion of public investment, social programs, and national security. 4. The government plans to achieve an increase in its current income from 10.5 percent of the GDP in 1993 (11.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993) to 12.1 percent in 1994. Any lack of achievement in this respect will be made up with additional tax measures. It is hoped that the tax reform that was implemented in December 1993 will bring in additional income equivalent to 0.4 percent of the 1994 GDP; it also expands the tax base and simplifies the tax system; and it is hoped that it will give continuity to the 1992 tax reform. The government will continue to expand the tax base. In will require an overall adjustment for inflation in order to estimate the value of assets that are subject to the minimum income tax of enterprises and for the payment of income tax in 1994. No new tax stability contracts will be signed that grant specific tax benefits to enterprises. The government will motivate voluntary resolutions of the contracts that were signed in the past. The government will not create new free trade zones. 5. Within the context of deregulation measures aimed at promoting privatization, the prices set in November 1993 for oil by-products at the refinery (Petroperu) [State Petroleum Agency] were comparable to international prices, while the prices for consumers were deregulated. Payment of royalties by Petroperu and by private contractors, as well as the special rate paid by Petroperu to the Public Treasury--that is, 7.5 percent of its domestic sales--will be maintained at least until the end of 1994. These changes are expected to generate additional revenues that will account for approximately 0.4 percent of the GDP in 1994. Other utility rates will continue to be adjusted pursuant to the established target rates in their specific regulatory systems. 6. Revenues will also increase as a result of improvements in the area of tax administration (Sunat) [National Tax Administration Superintendency], especially through new control systems implemented this year that include: a) a system of collecting taxes through banks; b) a roster of taxpayers (RUC) [Centralized Taxpayer Registry]; c) a system of control of the use of credit resulting from the General Sales Tax (IGV) by exporters; d) a system of cross-checking tax information concerning individual companies, their main suppliers and purchases, and their import statements; and e) an expansion of the system designed to verify compliance with their tax payments by the 7,000 leading taxpayers. The simplification of the tax system implemented in December 1993 will also contribute to improving efficiency in collecting revenues, including the new system of fixed payments that are not entitled to fiscal credit (RUS) [Simplified Tax System] [Regimen Unico Simplificado], which replaces the IGV and income tax, which will incorporate a large number of small taxpayers. With IMF technical assistance, Sunat has developed a plan to strengthen auditing and monitoring mechanisms and has completed an evaluation on evasion of IGV payments. Sunat will implement the revised version of the Tax Code that was promulgated in December 1993, which markedly increases its auditing powers and further simplifies administrative procedures. The revised Tax Code also strengthens the Fiscal Tribunal. Sunat will provide funds to improve the tribunal's operations. There will be two chambers specialized in hearing tax lawsuits, and it has been established that the Economy and Finance Ministry will be able to increase the number of these chambers, if necessary. 7. During 1994 the National Customs Superintendency will continue with its personnel training program and will extend its automated system to all of its offices nationwide. New legislation will be submitted to Congress during the first half of 1994 to fight smuggling more intensively, by meting out stiffer sanctions and by investing Customs with greater powers to deal with criminal cases in direct coordination with Sunat. Like the Fiscal Tribunal, the Customs Tribunal will consist of six chambers, though this number could be even higher. 8. The fiscal program incorporates the use of $250 million, in cash revenues from the privatizations to be undertaken in 1994, to supplement current revenues in order to finance social investments and the government's structural reforms. Moreover, up to one-fourth of proceeds from privatizations that exceed the aforementioned amount can be earmarked--with the help of the World Bank and the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank]--for projects having a high social rate of return, especially in the construction industry, highway maintenance, and infrastructure in rural areas. The ceiling for these endeavors is $626 million. The remaining amount will be deposited in a Treasury account at the Central Reserve Bank. Funds from this account may be used for paying debts that pay a high interest rate, or to prefinance loan disbursements for projects approved by the World Bank or the IDB with agreement to reimburse. The government pledges to follow the programs closely to ensure that their objectives of stabilization and growth are met. 9. Total expenditures by the nonfinancial public sector (excluding interest payments) will rise from 10.8 percent of GDP in 1993 to 11.8 percent in 1994. The expansion of capital outlay--which will lay stress on infrastructure development, social programs, and structural reforms--accounts for most of the increase. Expenditures from the social emergency scheme (including outlay by the National Compensation and Social Development Fund, Foncodes) will increase from 0.6 percent of GDP in 1993 to 0.8 percent of GDP in 1994. This program, together with other expenditures in social programs amounting to approximately 3 percent of GDP, will especially target the following areas: nutrition, primary health care programs, and education, to alleviate poverty in rural areas and in those areas that have been hardest hit by terrorism and drug trafficking. The central government's payroll and spending on defense are expected to increase at a faster pace than GDP because of salary arrears going back to 1993; readjustment of civil servants' salaries, which are still low compared to those in the private sector; and expenses in the ongoing effort to consolidate the pacification of the country, to rout terrorism, and to combat drug trafficking. 10. The Central Reserve Bank will continue to make every endeavor to meet the program's targets concerning inflation and the balance of payments. During 1994, the Central Bank's net domestic assets will remain unchanged, and there will be no net domestic credit to the overall nonfinancial public sector. The Central Bank's net international reserves will increase by some $151 million. The fiscal deficit will be eliminated thanks to the reduction in compensation for minimum reserve requirements in foreign exchange in November 1993 and fresh revenues stemming from Treasury interests on the capitalization of the Central Bank in May 1994. The Central Bank will try not to reduce minimum reserve requirements in domestic currency, and will grant discounts only in cases of transitory liquidity problems. The growth of the monetary base will be limited to 20 percent this year. 11. During 1994, the government will continue to implement a floating exchange rate policy. It is estimated that the recent reduction in compensation for minimum reserve requirements in foreign currency, together with the programmed fiscal position, will reduce capital flows and ease off pressure on the appreciation of the currency in 1994. The Central Bank will follow developments in the exchange market very closely, and if circumstances make it necessary to step up foreign competitiveness, the government will be willing to effect a greater fiscal adjustment than the one envisaged in the fiscal program. 12. The 1994 program is fully financed, taking into account the debt relief by the Paris Club in May 1993 and the payment postponement of debt obligations to other creditors. Peru has reached bilateral agreements with most of its creditors listed in the minutes of the agreement with the Paris Club in May 1993, and will seek to soon end negotiations with the remaining creditors. Peru has started negotiations with the commercial banking sector, and it is hoped that these negotiations will end in a voluntary reduction of the debt and the servicing of the debt by late 1994 or early 1995. Agreements to reschedule the debt have been reached with certain creditors, and in 1994 Peru will start contacts with other private and bilateral creditors that do not belong to the Paris Club, with the purpose of exploiting other ways to normalize financial relations. The government hopes that the possible agreements with the commercial banking sector and other creditors will significantly contribute to settling Peru's balance of payments and its fiscal creditworthiness. Peru's high debt ratio compared to its GDP, and the exceptionally high amount of interest in arrears, will have to be taken into account for these agreements. Within the context of the privatization of public enterprises, and as part of a strategy regarding the amount of the debt and its servicing, the government has included a scheme for converting the debt into investments, allowing all its creditors to use debt notes for this purpose. In order to continue improving the Peruvian foreign debt, the program limits the medium- and long-term foreign public debt (which is different from the debt with multilateral organizations and that contracted in the form of concessions) contracted in 1994 to $300 million, and the increase in the short term debt to $25 million. No delays in payment to international financial institutions nor to the Paris Club creditors are expected. 13. During 1994 and early 1995, the remaining public enterprises, of various sectors of the economy, will be privatized. The Cerro Verde mining company and the telecommunication companies (CPT [Peruvian Telephone Company] and Entel [National Telecommunications Enterprise]) were sold in early 1994, and the other mining company (Centromin [Central Peru Mining Enterprise]) will be put up for sale around May. There are plans to put a commercial bank (Interbanc) up for sale by June 1994. Moreover, during the second half of 1994 the Peruvian Government will offer for sale 60 percent of the Electro-Lima [Peruvian State Electric Power Enterprise-Lima] generating and distribution network, the Minero-Peru [Peruvian State Mining Enterprise] refinery in Cajamarquilla, part of Petro-Peru [State Petroleum Agency], and part of the fishing company Pesca-Peru [State Fishmeal and Fish Oil Production Agency]. As is stated in Paragraph 12, in February 1994 the government issued regulations on the use of the mechanism to convert the debt into investments in the case of the privatization process. The use of this debt conversion system will be allowed in specific cases when the privatization process faces greater difficulties. 14. Through the application of the new Banks Law promulgated in October 1993, in 1994 the National Superintendency of Banks and Insurance Companies (SBS) will continue to enhance sound regulations by intensifying the inspection of banks, seeking a policy that will handle the problem of dubious bank assets, and promoting the capitalization of the financial system. By late 1994 all provisions for bad credits and credits that lack guarantees will be required. A special SBS unit will place all risk debtors at the same level. The SBS will also focus all its efforts on improving the handling of information and its human resources with technical assistance from the IDB. 15. The government promulgated a new statute for the Bank of the Nation in January 1994, and its restructuring is expected to conclude around September 1994, in accordance with the guidelines recently agreed upon with the World Bank. As the agent of the Treasury, bank operations will be restricted to the management of public accounts, and will not include commercial operations with the private sector or interbanking operations. The Popular Bank branch in Bolivia was privatized in November 1994 [as published] and the liquidation of the Popular Bank is expected to be completed in December 1994. The liquidation of the remaining assets of the development bank will also be concluded in December 1994. 16. The creation of the Private Pension System in June 1993, as an alternative to the public pension system, is expected to contribute to the increase in overall savings in the economy. A new Superintendency of Private Pension Fund Administration was created to regulate the funds. The regulations in this area will continue to be improved as necessary. The Peruvian Institute of Social Security will only provide health services, and therefore it will restructure its personnel in accordance with its new functions established in 1994. The Social Security Normalization Office (ONP), which will begin operations in June 1994, will gradually take over responsibility for the operation of the public pension system. The pension payment will be financed with a transfer of about 300 million soles from the Treasury in 1994. 17. The government will continue to liberalize and simplify the trade system. The list of products subject to the 25 percent tariff rate was reduced even further in 1993, leaving less than 2 percent of the value of imports at this tariff level. The objective is to unify all tariffs at 15 percent by 1995. A timetable was reached with the IDB, within the context of the Sectorial Loan for Trade, to gradually reduce the surcharge on agricultural products with the objective of eliminating it by July 1997. The government will conclude the privatization of the National Enterprise for Industrial Marketing (ENCI) by December 1994. In addition, the trade negotiations with the Andean Group have concluded satisfactorily. Agreements are also being negotiated with other countries, like Argentina, Chile, and Mexico, to reduce trade barriers. Peru has signed the Uruguay Round agreement. 18. The government will strengthen its policies to reduce poverty as an essential element for consolidating the pacification program and the substantial progress made in stabilizing the economy. In 1994, Peru began a global program of social stabilization which will coordinate efforts in the areas of education, health, nutrition, justice, and job creation with its own resources, donations, and funds from multilateral institutions. For this purpose Peru has asked for technical assistance from the IMF and the IDB to implement the programs against poverty, within the context of a general follow-up to the policy and management of public spending. 19. During 1994 the government will continue its efforts to increase educational coverage and quality. These efforts will be concentrated on decentralizing education and introducing a direct budget appropriation system for schools based on the number of students. A pilot plan will be carried out during 1994, in an attempt to cover between 100,000 and 150,000 elementary school students. 20. Substantial progress was attained during 1993 to make the labor market more flexible, through the proclamation of a law that allows several kinds of labor contracts, a flexible position regarding job security, and which regulates the collective labor bargain process with the purpose of minimizing labor disputes. The government will propose a new Labor Code that will consolidate and harmonize the existing laws, with the purpose of further reducing the strict norms of the labor market according with the new 1993 Constitution. The arbitration procedures will be revised in order to expedite labor dispute settlements. 21. The government believes that it is necessary to substantially improve its knowledge of the macroeconomic situation in order to better analyze and plan the economic policy. Many of the recommendations made by the IMF monitoring mission during its March/April 1993 visit have already been implemented. The government has established a permanent interinstitutional committee made up of high-ranking officials from the Economy and Finance Ministry, the Central Reserve Bank, and the National Institute of Statistics and Information Science, to help adopt coordinated measures to improve the macroeconomic statistics of each sector and to promote a consistent statistical methodology among all sectors. The government will likewise take action to improve the compilation of national accounts and to correct deficiencies in the Consumers Price Index and in the GDP deflators, with technical assistance from the IMF. 22. The government considers that the policies described in this letter are appropriate for attaining the objectives of the economic program, and it will adopt any additional measure appropriate for this purpose. The Peruvian Government and the IMF will hold periodical meetings according to the policy on such meetings, as specified in our 18 March 1993 letter. Before the end of August 1994, and every three months from then onward, the external financing of the economic program will be reviewed until a satisfactory agreement is reached, as specified in our 19 March 1993 letter. The execution of the economic program described in this letter will be revised together with the IMF before the end of August 1994. The evaluation criteria of the program are described in Charts 1, 2, and 3. The evaluation criteria for 1995 and the calendar for future revisions of the economic program will be established not later than 15 March 1995. The IMF will maintain at the disposal of Peru the funds of the Expanded Financial Facilities Agreement. Peru may use these funds, if necessary, to finance debt restructuring programs; Peru will also be able to ask for an increase of the funds of said agreement, according to what is established by IMF norms in these cases. Respectfully, Jorge Camet, Minister of Economy and Finance German Suarez Chavez, President of the Peruvian Central Reserve Bank
