Among 355 returned students, 81 are doctorate degree-holders, according to China's embassy in France. Some 5,000 Chinese students have been sent to study in France at public expense since reform and opening to the outside world started. To date, over 3,000 of them have returned to China, constituting 60 percent of the total number. The embassy's education counsellor in France said that the policy of the Chinese government on supporting students studying abroad, the encouragement of their returning to China and their free coming and going had won the understanding and cooperation of most of the Chinese students studying abroad. Those in France said that the policy indicated the state's kindness and trust in making it possible for them to choose various ways to serve their motherland. They also held that returning to China would fully exploit their talents in view of the new economic situation in China. Compared with China, the ongoing depressed European economy and particularly the rapid increase in the number of unemployed in France made it difficult for Chinese students there to get suitable jobs while the immigration laws recently issued by the French government made such problems as residence and social insurance for foreign students there unsettling, adding another reason for the increase in the number of Chinese students returning home.
