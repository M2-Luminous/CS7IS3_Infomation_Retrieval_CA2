Gro Harlem Brundtland and her fellow prime ministers from Sweden, Finland, and Austria have their sights set on a joint meeting with the Parliament's elected representatives. The meeting is expected to take place in Strasbourg on 19-20 April. The timing of this obvious and unorthodox charm offensive on the part of the applicants has not been chosen by chance. For the meeting will take place immediately before the Parliament is timetabled to approve the outcome of membership negotiations on 4 May and give the decisive go-ahead for EU enlargement. Some 260 of the Parliament's 518 members must vote "yes" to new members. The aim behind meeting the European Parliament deputies is to increase pressure on them so that they do not slow down EU enlargement. By their mere presence the applicant nations' prime ministers will also signal their interest -- not something which today's EU members lavish on the Parliament. "A stroke of genius from the applicants," one source at the Parliament told AFTENPOSTEN. [passage omitted]
