[Qassis] Good morning. [Al-Miliji] The pressing question now is: Will the PLO resume the negotiations with Israel before the resolution providing for international protection in the occupied Arab territories is implemented? [Qassis] The Palestinian side has posed certain conditions for the resumption of talks. They are more than just the so-called international protection mentioned in the recent resolution. There are other things that relate to the Israeli practices at the hands of the occupation troops and the settlers, as well as the presence of settlements in densely populated areas. All these things need to be tackled before negotiations can resume in a meaningful way. [Al-Miliji] But efforts are now under way to bring the PLO back to the negotiating table. How far have these efforts gone? [Qassis] According to the information I have, indeed efforts are under way, but the Palestinian man in the street wants to see compliance with the Palestinian requirements before talks resume. Negotiations for the sake of negotiations is not a Palestinian demand. We want negotiations that can lead to positive results in terms of resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and recognizing the rights of the Palestinian people. There were problems at the talks even before the Hebron massacre, and the massacre has exacerbated things further and there is now more determination than ever regarding the need to tackle the settlement issue properly. [Al-Miliji] But a delay by the PLO in resuming the talks could waste what the PLO has gained from its talks with Israel. [Qassis] What has been gained so far from talks with Israel is such that if we were to lose it, it would not really amount to much. [passage omitted] [Al-Miliji] How did the Palestinian masses receive the recent Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre? [Qassis] With indifference. This is because the resolution did not tackle the core of the problem. [Al-Miliji] But it called for protection for the Palestinian people? [Qassis] This is not the first time the Security Council has passed a resolution. What counts in the end is getting significant protection, not monitoring. We do not want somebody to monitor and write reports, we want people to prevent the recurrence of such a massacre. This is what is needed. If the implementation of the resolution meets this requirement, the Palestinian people will receive it positively. But the people cannot be enthusiastic about just the text of a resolution; we want the resolution to be implemented in a meaningful way. [passage omitted] [Al-Miliji] There are reports about renewed clashes in Hebron; could you tell us about them? [Qassis] For more than 24 hours, the occupation troops besieged a densely populated Palestinian area and it was bombarded. [Al-Miliji] What for? [Qassis] Of course we are not in Hebron and do not know if what the Israeli radio and press are saying is true or not. However, homes were shelled with military weapons, such antitank weapons, and I believe four young Palestinian men were killed. In the meantime, the occupation troops broke into hospitals and terrified children and old people. A pregnant woman was martyred. Such Israeli practices leave no room for optimism regarding the ongoing talks. [Al-Miliji] Finally, has the Security Council resolution met your aspirations? [Qassis] The answer is no. [Al-Miliji] The PLO is between a rock and a hard place: either to resume the talks, which may anger the Palestinians in the territories, or not to resume the talks and thus delay the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. What about that? [Qassis] The PLO is the leadership of and part of the Palestinian people. The PLO does not handle the situation from the standpoint of pressure from the Palestinian public, because the PLO represents the Palestinian man in the street. It adopts positions that suit the Palestinian interests. There is real doubt about the worthiness of a peace process that does not tackle the settlements problem. The Palestinian masses' position on this issue does not differ from the PLO's. This is a Palestinian position being expressed by the PLO, which represents the Palestinian people. [Al-Miliji] So could we say that the Palestinian decision is not to resume the talks before the necessary protection is secured for the Palestinians inside the territories? [Qassis] This is up to the PLO leadership in Tunis to announce. I am just telling you what the situation is as we see it here among the Palestinian masses. We have requirements, and we take these requirements seriously. They are not made just to score points. It has been said that peace and the settlements cannot exist side by side, and this has been proved to be correct. We always said that, and now we see it clearly right in front of us. [Al-Miliji] Thank you Mr. Nabil Qassis. [Qassis] You are welcome.
