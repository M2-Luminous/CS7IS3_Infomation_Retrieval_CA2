There were several thousand close relatives, friends, students, artists, film makers, theater people, writers, journalists, academics, and people of all occupations and conditions. The Garidi Cemetery could not hold them all. Sadness furrowed faces that we had previously seen only as friendly and welcoming. Weariness could be seen on their shoulders. "At every funeral we ask ourselves the same question: who will be next?" said one of them. Another person replied: "You don't have to ask that question anymore; he is among us here!" "As in the case of Tahar Djaout, Belkhenchir, Boucebsi, and so many others, targets are chosen on the basis of integrity, goodness, modesty, and freedom of thought. Along with the bullet's physical impact, the desired psychological impact is discouragement, fear, and dispersal. But it is the opposite that is being produced." All around us, determination could be seen in the hardening faces and the looks exchanged. "We are paying a high price for the freedom to think when we pay with the lives of the best among us. History will recall that our freedom to meet was exercised first in cemeteries and, especially, on a day in March when the stupendous artist Mohamed Racim and his wife were murdered," said one intellectual. "It's like shooting clay pigeons!" said one academic. "We are not going to remain defenseless. Fear currently exists in only one camp. There is no way that it is going to stay there forever. Arm yourselves!" His neighbor corrected him: "Let us arm ourselves!" Ahmed Asselah, a discreet and peaceable man, was not sparing in the encouragement he gave artists through his presence at previews of art exhibits, photographic exhibits, theatrical and movie premieres, musical concerts, and other types of entertainment. And everyone from that world had come to pay their last respects. But there were also people who had known him only by name and others who had not heard of him before he was killed but who came to pay him tribute in a show of solidarity.
