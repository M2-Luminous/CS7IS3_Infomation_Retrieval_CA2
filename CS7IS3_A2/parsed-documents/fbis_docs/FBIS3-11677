With the exception of the Radical Cause Party and National Convergence, which are studying the AD proposal, the various legislative wings feel the special powers law will help us gain time in coping with the economic crisis, so long as the scope of the special powers law covers all solutions. [Begin recording] [Movement Toward Socialism Deputy Gustavo Marquez] We believe that given the country's emergency situation as a result of the crisis in public finances and the treasury, it is fully justified to grant these powers to President Caldera so he will urgently issue the tax laws -- with which we are all familiar inasmuch as those drafts were presented to Congress --so it will be possible to significantly reduce the fiscal deficit. [Social Action Party Deputy Nelson Chitty La Roche] That is the only reason AD and the rest of the country should be interested in expediting that process. In other words, we need to gain time. But I do not know if we have gained much time with the banking law, the stamp tax, and the judicial tariffs law, all of which were issued through the special powers granted to former President Velasquez. All of those measures are now being studied and will probably be modified and revised. Consequently, there are various issues that we must think about and decide upon. First we must consider the urgency of the legislation, something we do not deny. On the other hand, Congress can provide the best treatment a law needs. The Executive Branch is not meant to legislate in general but to implement laws. [AD Deputy Pedro Tabata Guzman] The government has introduced a package of tax or fiscal measures known as the Sosa Plan. We must carefully study the many laws included in the plan, which could take no less than 60 or 90 days. Therefore, given the thorough analysis that this law package requires and the urgent requirement the government has for a legal instrument -- a very responsible instrument -- and after having spoken with all political forces, we submit for the consideration of the Chamber a special powers law that will allow the government to act rapidly and find a solution to the huge problems that all Venezuelans face. [end recording] The various representatives of the parliamentarian wings said they were surprised at AD's proposal of a draft special powers law.
