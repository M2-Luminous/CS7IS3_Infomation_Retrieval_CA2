But at a North Ossetia Security council sesion Akhsarbek Galazov, chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet, stated that "a number of instructions which North Ossetia is now being obliged to fulfill were not examined at all at the Nalchik conference." In the opinion of local observers this divergent interpretation of the documents adopted in the capital of Kabardino-Balkaria is connected with the forthcoming 16 January elections of the North Ossetia president. If the public finds out that a representative of North Ossetia has nonetheless approved the final document in Nalchik, he will lose support among voters..
