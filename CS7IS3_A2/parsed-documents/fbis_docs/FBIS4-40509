We are facing a Rubicon: Either for Ukraine or against it," this is how newly elected leader of the democratic association "Ukrayina" Dmytro Pavlychko characterized the present political situation in the country. He also pointed out that National Democrats are challenged by two main tasks: To see to it that representatives of anti-Ukrainian forces do not win in the presidential elections and to try and gain victory in the run-off elections of 112 Ukraine's people's deputies on 24 July 1994 in order at least to slightly change the alignment of political forces in the Supreme Council. According to D. Pavlychko, a coordination council of chairmen of political parties has already been created. However, it has not yet worked out a single approach as to whom of the presidential candidates to support, but has already resolved not to provide any support for the programs of [presidential candidates] L. Kuchma or O. Moroz. With regard to the run-off elections, said D. Pavlychko, 73 democratic candidates have been agreed upon and nominated. "It would be good if at least one-half of that number win," said the "Ukrayina" leader.
