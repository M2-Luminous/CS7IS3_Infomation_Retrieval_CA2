FR941103-2-00016 FR941103-2-00013 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Computer Matching Program; Notice AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Notice_Computer matching between the Department of Education and the Department of Justice. Section 5301(a)(1) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (now designated as section 421(a)(1) of the Controlled Substances Act (20 U.S.C. 862(a)(1)) includes provisions regarding the judicial denial of federal benefits. Section 5301 authorizes federal and state judges to deny certain federal benefits (including student financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended) to individuals convicted of drug trafficking or possession. In order to ensure that Title IV student financial assistance is not awarded to individuals subject to denial of benefits under court orders issued pursuant to section 5301, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education implemented a computer matching program. The current computer matching agreement expired on September 5, 1994. The Department of Education must continue to obtain from the Department of Justice identifying information regarding individuals who are the subject of section 5301 denial of benefits court orders. The purpose of this notice is to announce the continued operation of the computer matching program and to provide certain required information concerning the computer matching program. In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;503), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines on the Conduct of Matching Programs (see 54 FR at 25818, June 19, 1989), and OMB Bulletin 89&hyph;22, the following information is provided: 1. Names of Participating Agencies The Department of Education (ED) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). 2. Purpose of the Match This matching program is designed to assist ED in enforcing the sanctions imposed under section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;690). 3. Authority for Conducting the Matching Program Under section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, as amended (21 U.S.C. 862), ED must deny federal benefits to any individual against whom a federal or state court order has imposed a penalty denying eligibility for those benefits. Student financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA) is a federal benefit under section 5301 and ED must, in order to meet its obligations under the HEA, have access to information about individuals who have been declared ineligible under section 5301. The President's Denial of Federal Benefits Implementation Procedures of August 30, 1989 direct DOJ to act as the clearinghouse for federal agencies. While DOJ provides information about section 5301 individuals who are ineligible to the General Services Administration (GSA) for inclusion in GSA's List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs, DOJ and ED have determined that matching against the DOJ data base would be more efficient and effective than access to the GSA List. The DOJ data base has specific information about the Title IV, HEA programs for which individuals are ineligible and has more complete identifying information about those individuals than does the GSA List. Both of these elements are essential for a successful match. 4. Categories of Records and Individuals Covered A. Department of Education Records Federal Student Aid Application File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0014): Composed of records of students applying for federal student financial assistance under Title IV of the HEA. The social security number and the first two letters of an applicant's last name will be used by ED for the match. B. Department of Justice Records Denial of Federal Benefits Clearinghouse System (DEBAR) (OJP&hyph;0013): Contains the names, social security numbers, dates of birth, and other identifying information regarding individuals convicted of federal or state offenses involving drug trafficking or possession of a controlled substance who have been denied federal benefits by federal or state courts. This system of records also contains information concerning the specific program(s) for which benefits have been denied. The Department of Justice will make available for the matching program the records of only those individuals who have been denied federal benefits under one or more of the Title IV, HEA programs. 5. Effective Dates of the Matching Program The matching program will become effective 40 days after a copy of the agreement, as approved by the Data Integrity Board of each agency, is sent to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget, or 30 days after publication of this notice in the Federal Register , whichever date is later. The matching program will continue for 18 months after the effective date and may be extended for an additional 12 months, if the conditions specified in 5 U.S.C. 522a(o)(2)(D) have been met. 6.
