First of all, FRAPH demanded the formation of an ad hoc government. The leader of and spokesman for this organization convened the legislators to an urgent meeting of the National Assembly to fill the executive vacuum before 9 May, the date of the closing of the current parliamentary session. Let us listen to Emmanuel Constant: [Begin Constant recording] We firmly believe the nation must meet in national assembly so the executive vacuum can be filled as soon as possible; but in any case, before the parliamentary vacuum planned for 9 May. The Haitian nation must be endowed with an ad hoc government during this period of crisis, which is particularly exceptional. The National Assembly has the duty to adopt a law of consensual policy, a sort of guiding plan for a provisional government in charge of managing the Haitian crisis, and able to integrate development projects using our own resources that will be proposed by legislators for their respective constituencies.
