The Army's planned 66.5 billion-forint 1994 budget is only enough to maintain the current level but not to carry out serious development. Some 90 percent of this amount will be spent on daily operational expenses, Colonel Gyorgy Paszto, leader of the Defense Ministry's Defense Management Main Department, said after President Arpad Goncz signed the Defense Law on 23 December and, at the same time, the government had accepted the regulation on its implementation. In connection with this, Lajos Erdely pointed out that in the 1994 budget it is envisaged that the Army would acquire 8 billion forints in income from the sale of stocks, army barracks, and similar buildings. It will be very difficult to achieve this, Erdelyi said. Although in 1994, in real terms, the Army will dipose of a sum which is more than 2-billion forints more than in 1993, financial problems are anticipated because of inflation and the tasks that will be new in 1994. Erdelyi found it especially worrying that the amount that can be spent on material and technical development has decreased to a minimum level. For 10 years, the Army has been unable to ensure the supposedly ideal 60 percent to 40 percent maintenance and development ratio. In 1994, less than 5 percent of the 66.5 billion forints will be left for development; the change of the Army uniforms is also included in this. The financial problems are made worse by the running costs of the 28 Russian MiG-29 aircraft that were included in the system at the end of the year, the planned launching of air force officer training in Szolnok, and the previous commitment to set up a Hungarian UN training base, Erdelyi said. In 1994, U.S. military industrial enterprises will deliver 113 complete electronic Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) systems to the Hungarian air-force. As is known, Parliament earmarked 1.1 billion forints from the budget for this purpose in 1993. According to the plans, the specialists of the U.S. air-force will fit the equipment on 28 MiG-29, nine MiG-23, 65 MiG-21, and 11 Su-22 aircraft. The prototypes on the various types of aircraft have already been set up and tried out. In addition to this, the suppliers will also fit four Russian-type land-based location systems with "questioning equipment." Putting these in position will probably begin mid-1994. According to the NAPI VILAGGAZDASAG, a deal that is part of a U.S. Government program will amount to some $12.7 billion.
