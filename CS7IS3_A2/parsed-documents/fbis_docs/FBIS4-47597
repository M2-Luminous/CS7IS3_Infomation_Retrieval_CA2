Guided by a Wise Budget'': ``Both To Abound and To Suffer Need''] [Text] After describing the overall situation of the state of affairs at the Russian Academy of Sciences and making a brief survey of the scientific results of the year, I. Makarov dwelt on the work of the presidium of the RAS. During the year under review the presidium heard 16 departments. In the end many positive results were obtained. First of all the departments made an analysis and outlined means of improving their activity. Priority directions of scientific research were formed, redundant or obsolete subdivisions of scientific institutions were eliminated, and the subdivisions, which conduct mainly applied research, were converted to cost accounting. The process of getting rid of unnecessary personnel and themes, which is natural under these conditions, is taking place. The institutions, which have been linked into the ``technological chain,'' are seeking new forms of organizational interaction, for example, in the form of joint institutes, as the Institute of High Temperatures of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Earth Physics, the Institute of Chemical Physics and others have done. And nevertheless the problem of structural changes at the academy is still far from its solution. In examining the discussions of the work of the departments in aggregate, it is also possible to note several oversights. In my opinion, financial and economic analysis did not take its proper place in their work. The questions of the specification of the content of the academy charter from the standpoint of the interests of the departments and of its coincidence with the new conditions and the problems of social relations in scientific collectives were practically not touched upon. In accordance with the instructions of the general meeting the presidium of the RAS devoted daily attention to the search for additional sources of financing. During the year under review they invested many billions of rubles in scientific research of the RAS. In connection with the development of the independence of the regions it seems to me that the expansion of research in their interests has considerable prospects. Practical confirmation of this is the ``Science for Moscow'' and ``Moscow for Science'' programs. They made it possible to obtain additionally from the city budget approximately R1.5 billion. Moreover, Moscow granted the institutes breaks on the fees for electric power, heat, water, and sewer service and on the rent for premises. The city obtained from the academy the science-intensive technologies it needed. Of course, by earning additional assets, we, on the one hand, are contributing to the preservation of the creative potential of the academy. However, this process is distorting the structure of our potential. A larger and larger portion of it is switching to exclusively applied spheres or to enterprise. A question arises: What factors are now decisive in determining the real priorities in the basic directions of research at the RAS: The notions of the scientific community about priorities or the financial receipts from extrabudgetary sources? And there is more. Should the system of priorities in effect in our country of the distribution of state budgetary assets by directions of research take into account the receipts from extrabudgetary sources? It seems to me that we should find the answers to these and similar questions in the process of joint discussions before we are faced with the fact of the disappearance of basic research at the academy. The patent law protection of our scientific product is playing an important role. Owing to patent protection (and until 1990 the academy maintained abroad from 800 to 1,000 patents) we obtained every year appreciable amounts of hard currency. For example, $130,000 were spent on the patenting of three inventions relating to fianites (a development of the Physics Institute imeni Lebedev), while the payments from foreign firms under agreements came to $12 million. The change starting in 1991 of the procedure of paying expenses, which are connected with the patenting of inventions, and the lack of a centralized monetary fund of the academy led to the significant decrease of the amounts of foreign patenting at the RAS. During the year under review the institutions of the RAS received just 26 foreign patents, while the revenue from the sale of licenses came to only U.S. $36,000. Fundamental changes in the patent and licensing policy of scientific institutions and the RAS as a whole are necessary for the conversion of scientific and technical achievements into a commodity, including an export commodity, and the formation of a stable source of currency receipts, and we are working on this. In spite of the difficulties with financing, such a form of the obtaining of knowledge and the exchange of experience as scientific conferences, meetings, symposiums and schools is being restored in the life of our scientists. During the year under review more than 100 such measures were implemented. This year the institutes and scientific councils have planned to implement 200 measures. I will recall that until the sharp decrease of their number in 1992 more than 400 meetings, conferences and schools were held annually. I cannot but speak about the RAS-UNESCO contract ``The Basic Sciences in Russia,'' the implementation of which was rated highly by the leadership of UNESCO. During its fulfillment the conducting of scientific research of an international scale, the giving of assistance in the establishment of the Scientific Center of Computer-Integrated Systems of the RAS, the practical study of talented young scientists at leading world centers, and much else became possible. In concluding the discussion of the results of the work in 1993 and stating the fulfillment of many items of the decrees of the general meeting, it is impossible not to note that a number of important decisions remain unfulfilled. It has not been possible to complete the formulation of the concept of the activity of the academy under the new conditions. Thus far a system of the examination of the activity of academic scientific institutions has not been established. A fund for the support of young scientists has not been formed at the RAS. I would not want to exaggerate the importance of the concept of the RAS under the new conditions, but it would be unjust to understate it. The existence of a concept always testifies to an intelligent approach to one's own activity, which, as you know, never hurts. We have the charter of the RAS. But let us see whether it is that form of representation or not. Does our charter give, even if at the fundamental level, answers to questions that arise in life: What forms of work with the property of the RAS are permissible for us, and what ones are not; what objects of this property can be privatized and how in the process of privatization should the interests of the academy be reflected; what forms of entrepreneurial activity are permissible in our community; under what conditions can a person hold an administrative position at the academy and be an associate of it, and under what ones can he not; should the assets that are earned by institutions, which receive state budget financing and use the fixed capital and creative potential of the academy, be redistributed in the academy and thus support priority directions of scientific research; finally, one should also think about the moral and ethical principles in the life of our community. In the charter there are neither answers to nor principles of answering such questions. They are also not present in other standard documents. About the fund of young scientists. It seems to me that such a fund is more than necessary. If our talented young people instead of thoughts about basic problems rush about in search of means of survival, they will find means in the end, but what a price for science! Given the decrease of the amounts of state budget financing of the RAS I think that now a single solution is possible--to establish the fund of young scientists by means of deductions of the institutes and commercial structures attached to the academy. I ask you to express your opinion on the listed sources of financing of the fund. The position of the directors of our institutes is especially important here. Winding up, I will dwell briefly on questions of the interaction of the academy with the leadership of the state. Our scientists took a direct part in the work of many governmental commissions and committees of the former Supreme Soviet, now the State Duma, and made a substantial contribution to the solution of domestic and international problems. Examining from an unbiased standpoint the life of the academic community, it is impossible not to note that this life was painted with the entire rainbow of colors. And the people, who are trying to depict it only in black or only in rose color, are hardly correct. It appears that the ancient biblical wisdom, which was formulated in the epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Philippians, is becoming a guiding one for us: ``I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.'' The main thing was done. Given the support of the RAS on the part of the leadership of the state, the government of Moscow and the international scientific community we were able during the year under review to preserve the creative potential of the academy and to achieve good scientific results.
