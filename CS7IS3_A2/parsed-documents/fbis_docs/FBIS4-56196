He said it is wrong to follow this course at this time because NAFTA is still quite new and the three countries involved are just starting to obtain benefits from the trade pact. He also told EL FINANCIERO that this sector had decided not to enter into any trade commitments until it received guarantees that the treaty would benefit the industry. He also noted that current negotiations with Venezuela and Colombia are "stalled" because the Venezuelans have asked that the policy on the origin of goods be made flexible. This situation has cast doubts that the treaty will only benefit those countries that signed it. Interviewed at his office, Arturo Garcia admitted that NAFTA, which was signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, includes a provision that the signatories can request the accelerated elimination of tariffs on a number of products as part of the regular treaty regime. The chemical industry, however, is not willing to give up the advantages it achieved in the NAFTA negotiations. Garcia recalled that with the treaty, the industry obtained a 10-year moratorium on tariff elimination on almost all its products because the sector proved it required a transition period to reduce its tariffs to zero, and "this was accepted by all three parties." What the industry will do, he said, is offer the United States and Canada a list of products whose tariffs can be eliminated immediately because these were not included in NAFTA and are not produced in the country. It has to be very clear, however, that the chemical industry will not ask any tariff be eliminated on products in response to the document. "We will only offer, for their acceptance, a few highly specialized products that we do not have in Mexico." The industry's position is firm: Let the text of the treaty remain as it was negotiated. Referring to the negotiations with Costa Rica and Chile, as well as those with the United States and Canada, Garcia said the chemical industry is very pleased with these talks because the policy on origin of goods was accepted in those talks. Unfortunately, he added, negotiations with Venezuela and Colombia have encountered problems because of the chapter that covers rules on origin. Those two countries want this chapter to be weak or very flexible, and this does not guarantee that goods from those industries in which Mexico is competitive will flow to those two countries.
