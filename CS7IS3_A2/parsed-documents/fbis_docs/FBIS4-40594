He then criticized the movement to impose sanctions, saying that the international community should not isolate North Korea. Energy Minister Mikhaylov explained his understanding of the attitude of North Korea, which rejected IAEA inspections, saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is making excessive demands on North Korea. On the current state of North Korea's nuclear arms development, he said as follows: [Begin Mikhaylov recording] I believe that North Korea does not have nuclear weapons. It will take them from 10 to 20 years, even if they begin producing nuclear weapons right now. [end recording] [Begin Kobayashi recording] Russia is opposing the movement in the United States and other countries to impose sanctions against North Korea. Foreign Minister Kozyrev said that no prior consultations had been made with Russia regarding concrete proposals on the sanctions. However, the foreign minister's opposition and Energy Minister Mikhaylov's recent remarks reflect their twisted feelings that Russia is being treated lightly. Russia is saying that not isolating North Korea is a better approach. This is the outcome of such a stance, and is Russia's appeal and advice to the international community. [end recording]
