FBIS3-30452 "dreeu023__a94010" FBIS-EEU-94-023-A Document Type:Daily Report 3 February 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Foreign Ministry on Possible Zhirinovskiy Visit AU0202201294 Prague CTK in English 1738 GMT 2 Feb 94 AU0202201294 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague Feb 2 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry Legal Department today told CTK that a visit of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to the Czech Republic cannot legally be prevented beforehand. The statement says that Zhirinovskiy is the legally elected deputy to the Russian State Duma and is thus entitled to have a diplomatic passport of the Russian Federation. A new agreement on visa-free relations between the Czech Republic and the Russian Federation will change nothing in the position of holders of diplomatic passports. It points out, however, that holders of diplomatic passports just like all other foreign visitors should abide by Czech law. Zhirinovskiy, Russian ultra-nationalist and chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) which gained a victory at the Russian parliamentary elections in December, is currently travelling Europe. In an interview with REUTER he said that "the Czech Republic will lose Moravia soon and only Prague and a few breweries in which the beer will turn bitter will be left of the Czech Republic." Tomas Hoffmann, a Prague solicitor, said today that Zhirinovskiy could come to the Czech Republic without any invitation. However if he were to violate the law he could be prosecuted in any way as any other citizen who violates the legally protected interests of the Czech Republic. According to experts, the State Attorney's Office should deal with Zhirinovskiy's statements and should consider whether or not Czech laws were violated by these statements. Given the fact that Zhirinovskiy is a member of the parliament of a foreign state, who although he is travelling privately, uses diplomatic protection, the matter appears to be very delicate. If the State Attorney's Office were to take a preventative stand on Zhirinovskiy's remarks now, it would mean preparing for a visit and possible statements aimed against the Czech Republic and its interests.
