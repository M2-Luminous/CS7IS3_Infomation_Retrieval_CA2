Speaking before the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee Monday, Yi said that "the joint denuclearization declaration has virtually been nullified in a sense and it will be a delicate problem how to handle the issue." He said his government would spend much time and energy examining how to handle the validity of the declaration in light of "nuclear independence." "We are now at the point where we have to study seriously how to handle the issue of validity of the declaration in case it was nullified, rather than just (get obsessed with) a vacuum (left by the nullification)," he said. "We will face a situation in which we will be compelled to discuss this problem for at least several months, or perhaps until next year, from a new angle," said Yi, who is also minister of the National Unification Board. On the surface, the deputy premier's remarks can be viewed as a clear indication that the Seoul government intends to review the inter-Korean declaration on the denuclearization of the peninsula signed on Dec. 31, 1991. Earlier, Yi said that if it was internationally confirmed that North Korea possesses "not just one but even one-half of a nuclear weapon," the denuclearization declaration would be regarded as nullified. After he made that remark, Yi told reporters it was meant as"a message not only to North Korea but to the United States as well. " Speaking to the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, Yi further clarified his purpose in making the remark. He said he had directed his statement at those in the United States, including Defense Secretary William Perry, who have said the international community would probably have to overlook North Korea's possession of one or two nuclear bombs. Senior South Korean Government officials said the deputy prime minister's statement should be viewed as an unequivocal message to the United States that "Seoul would never accept a policy that allows North Korean possession of a nuclear weapon." Yi's statement should be taken as an expression of the Seoul government's firm position that North Korea must be stopped from acquiring nuclear weapons at any cost, rather than merely as an expression of Seoul's intention to reconsider the declaration. As evidence, Yi has always spoke by adding such conditional clauses as "if North Korea possessed nuclear weapons," or "if Pyongyang continues to maintain the nuclear reprocessing plant," and so on. In other words, if North Korea gave up its nuclear weapons program, there would be no need for reconsideration of the inter- Korean denuclearization declaration.
