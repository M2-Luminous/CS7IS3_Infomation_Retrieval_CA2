The main contents are as follows: --According to the enterprise law regarding Sino-foreign joint operations and relevant laws and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises can only export the products they produce themselves and import such machinery, equipment, raw and semifinished materials, spare parts and components as they need for their own production purposes. In addition to having approval of the relevant quarters in accordance with the provisions, they must not purchase or act as agents for the products of another enterprise nor must they import commodities for sale or exchange on the mainland. --Where products exported by foreign-invested enterprises require export licenses, they must be approved by MOFTEC and their annual export volume must not exceed the licensed fiscal export plan. No foreign-invested enterprise is allowed to purchase export licenses from a foreign trade company for export purposes. If such a deal is discovered, the buyer and the seller will be penalized. --Foreign exchange earned by the Chinese side of a Sino-foreign joint venture or cooperative enterprise should be settled and turned over to the higher authorities in strict accordance with relevant regulations. It is necessary to prevent some foreign-funded enterprises from retaining foreign exchange by exporting through the foreign-invested enterprises they have set up. --When setting up, examining, and approving the establishment of foreign-invested enterprises, all localities should continue to make it an important point to set up product exporting enterprises, encourage and support enterprises to earn more foreign exchange by increasing exports, to attain a balance of foreign exchange income and expenditure, and to increase gradually the numbers of homemade raw and semifinished materials and spare parts and components exported.
