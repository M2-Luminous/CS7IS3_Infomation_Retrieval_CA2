Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said China believes bilateral relations are extremely important, especially trade ties. She made the remarks at a press conference in Beijing with visiting EC Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan. They presided over the 13th session of the EC-China Joint Committee and the eighth bilateral ministerial-level talks over trade issues. Brittan, who is in charge of the EC's external relations and trade policies, reaffirmed the community's support for China's re-entry into GATT but urged the mainland to further liberalize trade. "We admire China's remarkable progress towards the creation of a market economy," Brittan said yesterday. "The EC will support and welcome China's continued economic reforms." He continued: "China's re-entry into GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) would be of great interest worldwide." During the talks, the two sides have agreed to discuss the liberalization of non-tariff measures in China. The first meeting will take effect in March in Geneva within the framework of the GATT Working Party on China. Brittan's remarks came a week after Dorothy Dwoskin, the U.S. assistant trade representative, announced her country's support of China's reentry into the world trade body. Their remarks will be in China's favour when the GATT Working Party on China convenes its 16th session in Geneva in March, local analysts said, for the two represent major GATT contracting parties. Wu said her talks with Brittan were conducted in a "frank, friendly and down-to-the-earth fashion." "We've reached consensus on a wide range of issues and agreed to tackle the remaining ones in the future in a positive manner," she said. She described her talks with Brittan as paving the way for future bilateral cooperation. She pointed out that the EC has become China's second largest import source after Japan. The two sides have engaged in bilateral economic cooperation in agriculture, environmental protection and other areas. Also yesterday, the EC announced it will finance the establishment of the China-Europe International Business School in Shanghai this year. The two sides did not discuss the EC's quota restrictions on Chinese exports, which has been a major problem in bilateral trade. In another development, Wu Yi said Britain's inability to cooperate over the Hong Kong issue would likely hurt Sino-British trade, which had surged 86 percent over 1992 last year. But Brittan said China must extend non-discriminative measures to all EC members.
