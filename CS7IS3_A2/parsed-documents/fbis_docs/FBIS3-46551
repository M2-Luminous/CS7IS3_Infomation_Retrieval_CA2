Today our people are welcoming the new year overflowing great pride and faith of brilliantly advocating and adhering to socialism of our own style amid rigorous trials. Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and people, delivered a historical New Year address to all the people on the occasion of the new year, 1994. In the New Year address, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song proudly summed up the results of last year's struggle of firmly adhering to the fortress of socialism of our own style through the might of single-hearted unity, and presented militant tasks that our party and people must adhere to in the new year. The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address is a beacon brilliantly elucidating the future of our people, who are accelerating the general onward march of socialism of our own style, an immortal program calling on the whole nation to carry out the sacred cause of the fatherland's reunification, and a militant banner that vigorously takes the initiative in the independent cause of our era. The respected and beloved leader's New Year address is currently inspiring all the party members and workers with faith and fighting spirit of the invincibility of the cause of socialism of our own style and is vigorously imparting them with the responsibility to achieve a new victory by single-heartedly uniting around the party and the leader. In 1993, our party and the people vigorously displayed the justness of the independent revolutionary line and the might of the chuche Korea through the might of single-hearted unity. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The year 1993 was a historical year that vigorously displayed the justness of our party's independent revolutionary line and the might of the chuche Korea. Last year our party and people resolutely smashed [chitbusyoborigo] the vicious challenges and aggressive maneuvers of the enemies and honorably defended the dignity and security of the socialist fatherland. This was the greatest victory achieved by our party and people last year. Last year our country was in an extremely acute situation. The imperialists and reactionaries isolated and suffocated our Republic and strengthened unprecedented offensives in the fields of politics, economics, military, and diplomacy to crush [apsal] our socialist cause. Our people vigorously launched into the struggle to safeguard the nation's sovereign rights and revolutionary gains as one by bearing in their hearts the indomitable faith and will given by the party and the leader and successively achieved victories in the political and military confrontations with the enemies. Last year's struggle clearly showed that nothing can squelch the resolute will and faith of our people, who are moving toward the one road of chuche with firm faith only in their party and their leader. Thus, 1993 will be brilliantly recorded in our people's revolutionary struggle history as a year of victory in our party's revolutionary line and as a great year of victory of single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses. The last year of the Third Seven-Year Plan was brilliantly decorated by achieving great progress in all fields of socialist construction. This was an important achievement fulfilled by our people last year. Our people resolutely overcame great difficulties and barriers facing economic construction, increased the productive capacity of our chuche industry on the whole during the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan, further strengthened its self-dependence, provided a solid basis in agricultural production to achieve bumper crops forever, and built many monumental creations elucidating the era of the Workers' Party. Today, the communist virtue of helping and guiding each other throughout the society and sharing joys and sorrows is beautifully blossoming, and all the people are enjoying a worthwhile and happy life without any social uneasiness. This is a clear manifestation of the superiority of socialism of our own style. All the victories and results achieved in the revolution and construction last year by our people are a brilliant fruition of the wise leadership of the party and the leader leading our revolutionary cause toward the ever-victorious road under the banner of the chuche idea. The leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] is a banner for the victory of socialism of our own style and a fundamental source for the prosperity of chuche Korea. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, with deep insights into the prevailing situation facing the revolution, have presented sagacious strategies and tactics in a timely manner and led the entire party and all the people to new exploits and victories. Having an iron will and belief and firm fidelity to revolutionary principles are important characteristics of the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. When the fatherland and revolution were faced with stern trials and when a touch-and-go situation prevailed, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander, took the resolute self-defensive measure of declaring a state of semi-war in the entire country and had all the people and the entire Army meet the enemy's antirevolutionary offensives head-on by launching revolutionary offensives. He also vigorously led all the people to the grand onward march to glorify the 40th anniversary of the victory in the fatherland liberation war as a grand festival of the victors. The fact that we won a victory last year in a fierce confrontation to defend the country's destiny and the nation's supreme interests is unthinkable apart from our party's firm belief and incomparable boldness. Outstanding wisdom, scientific insights, and a tested organizational capability are important features of our party's leadership. Last year, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il released "Abuses of Socialism Are Intolerable" and numerous other documents and, thus, further developed and enriched a theory on building chuche-oriented socialism and clearly elucidated the road of the socialist cause of our era. He presents revolutionary economic strategies to comply with actual requirements for socialist construction, enhances the militant functions of party organizations of various levels, scores new upsurges in economic construction, and organizes and mobilizes the entire party and all the people by using powerful militant slogans. His extraordinary leadership in the party is matchless. Recalling the struggle of last year when we brought about the most brilliant victory amid the sternest trial, we have come to cherish deep in our hearts the indomitable belief that as long as the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has an iron will and tested leadership, leads us, we can win a fight with any enemy and complete building socialism of our own style to the end. The New Year 1994 is a year of revolutionary change in which socialist construction will enter a new stage of development and a year of worthwhile struggle in which the entire party, the entire country, and all the people must stand up to score revolutionary great upsurges in all fronts. In hearty response to the militant call of the party and the leader [suryong], all party members and workers must continue making innovations and advancements in the spirit of Chollima spurred on by the speed of the nineties and, thus, make the New Year 1994 a historic year of change in revolution and construction in our country. The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We must consolidate and develop our achievements in socialist construction and win greater new victories. By so doing, we must glorify the popular masses-centered socialism of our country and more highly fly the banner of chuche socialism. The international environment facing our revolution today is still complicated and tense, and we are building socialism amid a tense confrontation with the enemy. In compliance with the prevailing situation and the demand for the development of our revolution as the great leader elucidated in his New Year address, we must thoroughly implement the revolutionary line of independence, self-sufficiency, and self-reliant defense; vigorously carry out the three revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- and, thus, further strengthen the country's political, economic, and military strength. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy put forward at the 21st plenary session of the Sixth Party Central Committee is a most just and revolutionary line for consolidating the nation's self-reliant economic foundations and for further upgrading the people's living standard in keeping with the demand of socialism. When this strategy is thoroughly implemented, the superiority of our-style socialism will be more vigorously displayed and we will occupy a new stronghold for offensive. This year we should continue to firmly adhere to agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy. This year, which marks the 30th anniversary of publication of the socialist rural thesis, we should vigorously carry out the struggle to accomplish historic tasks of rural thesis and should effect a new turn in development of the rural economy. Thus, we should fulfill the lofty target of grain production set forth by the party without fail. At the same time, by vigorously accelerating light industry revolution, we should register great innovations in the production of consumer goods and should develop external trade in compliance with changed circumstances. For us to vigorously accelerate the nation's overall economic construction by developing agriculture and light industry, we should direct strength at coal, electric power, and metal industries, and should find a solution to the problem of rail transport. For us to successfully carry out economic construction tasks facing us this year, we should vigorously wage the struggle for increasing production and conservation in all domains and units as a mass movement. At the same time, economic guidance functionaries should carry out economic organizational work and production command in compliance with the demand of the party's economic strategy. By upholding the party's cultural revolution policy, intellectuals should devotedly struggle to effect a new development in all domains of socialist cultural construction. This year we should further strengthen the nation's defense capabilities by upholding the leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander. All the people and officers and men of the People's Army must be fully prepared politically and ideologically, militarily and materially, to deal with any contingency on our initiative, and must establish a social climate of regarding military affairs as important and assisting the People's Army whole-heartedly. What is most important in vigorously pushing ahead with revolution and construction at present is to further strengthen the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses and to highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. Single-hearted unity and self-reliance are imperishable, glorious traditions of our revolution, as well as the banner of victory. The history of the Korean revolution is the history of single-hearted unity and the history of self-reliance. With the strength of single-hearted unity our people have broken through harsh trials and opened up a brilliant road of victory and with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance we have overcome all difficulties and brought about great changes in the revolution and construction. Today our single-hearted unity has been firmly consolidated with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as its center. The ever-victorious indomitable road of the socialist cause is in the firm ideological and moral unity with the party and the leader based on will and principle. All party members and working people should hold the leader [yongdoja] in high esteem with the sense of loyalty and should actively defend and protect him. They should regard the ideas and lines put forward by the leader [yongdoja] as most just ones and should thoroughly implement them under any condition and circumstance. Thus, we should consolidate the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks, which has been firmly cemented rock-solid under the leadership of our party, and with the strength of such unity, we should vigorously push ahead with the socialist cause of our own style. Self-reliance and arduous struggle are traditional spirits of the struggle of our people, who are carrying out the revolution and who are a revolutionary banner for successfully building socialism of our own style. "Let us accelerate vigorously the general march of socialism in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude." This is the call of our party and the militant slogan our people must uphold today. When we advance by upholding this slogan, we can tenaciously defend and protect our-style socialism by crushing various challenges and disturbance maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries. We can resolve all problems raised in the socialist construction with our own strength under any condition, no matter how difficult. Just as in the postwar Chollima great upsurge period, we must more highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and must effect a new upsurge in socialist construction by breaking through all difficulties. To reunify the country without fail in the nineties and to hand over the reunified fatherland to future generations are the supreme tasks of the nation. The principles and line of our party and the government of the Republic to establish a unified state in the manner of confederation based on one country and one state and two systems and two governments remain unchanged. All Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas should firmly unite as one, transcending the differences in ideologies, systems, and religions under the banner of the 10-point program of great unity of the whole country and should subjugate everything to the cause of national reunification. We should smash at every step aggressive and interfering maneuvers of outside forces with the strength of unity of all people who want reunification and want to live under democracy with patriotism. As members of the Korean state, those who have strength, knowledge, and money, should make characteristic contributions to the cause of national reunification with strength, knowledge, and money respectively. Thus, this year we should open a new phase in the struggle for national reunification. The United States and its followers should look straight at today's realities in which the spirit of national reunification is being enhanced higher than ever before, and should act with discretion. They should discard the anachronistic way of thinking to handle the Korean issue from the standpoint of strength. Pressure or threat will have no effect on us; such an attempt may invite catastrophe, far from finding a solution to the problem. The imperialists are now blustering on the international arena by vociferating about the end of socialism, but they cannot arrest the people's aspiration to independence, sovereignty, and socialism, nor can they turn back the trend of history. In the new year, just as in the past, we will unite with socialist countries based on the principle of independence, and will make active efforts to unite with nonaligned countries. We will develop good neighborly relations with the capitalist countries that respect our nation's sovereignty. Upon hearing the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address, our people's revolutionary zeal and spirit of struggle are very high. All party organizations should aggressively carry out the organizational and political works to brilliantly achieve rewarding tasks in the new year. Party organizations at all levels should infiltrate the New Year address made this year by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song deep into party members and working people, and should vigorously organize and lead them to the struggle to accomplish tasks put forward in the New Year address. Our revolution is an ever-victorious indomitable revolution that advances with the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song as its vanguard and by following the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. We have loyal people and one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary Armed Forces who are firmly rallied behind the party and the leader [suryong]. We also have a mighty self-reliant socialist national economy that enables us to survive with our own strength under any circumstance. A political and ideological offensive, an economic blockade, and a military threat by the imperialists and reactionaries, cannot block our people's advance forward. Although our people's struggle today is arduous, it is a glorious and sacred struggle for prosperity and development of our nation and for the future of mankind. Let us all more vigorously fight to accomplish the socialist cause of our own style in firm unity with the party Central Committee headed by the respected Comrade Kim Il-song by upholding the banner of the chuche idea.
