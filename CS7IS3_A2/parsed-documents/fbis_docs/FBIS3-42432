A. Merimskiy; continued; see VOYENNO-ISTORICHESKIY ZHURNAL, No 10, 1993: "Kabul-Moscow: War to Order"] [Text] Introduction or Invasion? After undergoing treatment at the Kislovodsk sanatorium I returned to Moscow with my wife. The train arrived at Kursk Station near midnight. As we stepped out of the car we were met by an officer I didn't know, who told me that Army General S. F. Akhromeyev was expecting me. Just a few minutes later I was at the General Staff. After inquiring after my health and apologizing for my "kidnapping" at the station, S. F. Akhromeyev went on the business part of our conversation. It essentially boiled down to this. The Afghan government had approached our country's leadership several times with an insistent request to introduce Soviet troops into Afghanistan. The motives were as before--to place state facilities under protection, thus freeing the Afghan Army to fight the rebels. This matter was resolved positively. Agreement was reached that the Afghan side would make a radio announcement to all the world about its request. A mobilizational exercise had started in the Turkestan Military District, in the course of which the field administration of the 40th Army, the 5th and 108th motorized rifle divisions, and an army contingent of combat and rear support units were being deployed at wartime strength. In general, a force grouping was being created for introduction to Afghanistan. A small operational group headed by S. F. Akhromeyev was go there to provide assistance in resolving mobilizational matters. I was appointed his deputy. Colonels A. K. Kotlyar, M. M. Mordas and B. Ya. Rogontsev were assigned to the group from the Main Directorate of Combat Training. I was surprised by this turn of events. Had the situation in Kabul really grown worse? The mass media, after all, had been reporting steady development of the April revolution, its support by the people, and a successful struggle against the counterrevolution. So what happened there? I reminded S. F. Akhromeyev that after our military delegation returned from Afghanistan we had submitted a report to the Minister of Defense in which we clearly stated that it would be unsuitable to introduce our forces into this country. In addition, we emphasized that the freedom-loving Afghan people would not condone intervention from outside, and cited a number of facts confirming this conclusion. As an example when our Military Advisor made a casual remark to the Commander of an Afghan Army regiment, the reply was this: "We didn't ask you to come here. Go back to your own country, and we'll sort things out ourselves." "The situation in the country took a dramatic turn for the worst after Amin assumed unshared power," S. F. Akhromeyev explained. "Repressions assumed mass proportions, by which the existing regime compromised itself, and conditions under which Amin might be overthrown by the counterrevolution had been created." "But isn't it true that Amin isn't the first, and probably not the last ruler to be deposed in Afghanistan?" I noted. "That's all so," S. F. Akhromeyev agreed, "but the Americans could come in together with the counterrevolution, and that would be extremely undesirable. In addition our relations with China, which supports Pakistan, are strained. And the situation in Iran isn't clear. It was in this situation that the question as to what we were going to do arose. "The position of the General Staff was unequivocal--don't introduce any forces. When we were given the question of troop introduction for preplanning, we prepared a report to the Ministry of Defense. It indicated that extremely weighty arguments would have to support such a critical decision as introducing troops into a foreign country, and all the more so an Eastern country, and that we didn't have such arguments. "Of course the leadership feels that our forces would stay in their garrisons and defend the existing regime against attempts to overthrow it from without, while inside the country the Afghan Army would deal with the rebels, and we would soon leave. Of course, it was more likely that our prestige and international position would be undermined. Moreover, grounds would appear for accusing the Soviet Union of aggression. But an order is an order. Although let me say once again that the General Staff is opposed to introduction." "So what are we preparing the division for--introduction or invasion?" I asked. "For both the former and the latter," was the reply. In the morning of 14 December 1979 our group took off by air to its base in the city of Termez. S. F. Akhromeyev was delayed in Moscow until evening. We were met at the airfield by 40th Army commander Lieutenant-General Yu. V. Tukharinov and Army Military Council Member Major-General A. V. Taskayev. Immediately upon our arrival at headquarters the commander informed us of the progress in mobilizing. Deployment of the army field administration, and of the combined units and units, was proceeding uneventfully. Rear Service units and subunits were mobilizing somewhat more slowly. A large quantity of motor vehicles had to be replaced. The fact is that during annual mobilization training, enterprise directors held back new high-capacity vehicles for themselves, sending small and even unserviceable vehicles to the forces in their stead. Understanding the difficulties of civilian organizations, the unit commanders shut their eyes to this. But the same situation was recurring even now, when the mobilization was for real. The district's air force units had already upgraded to full combat readiness, and had regrouped to frontier airfields. S. F. Akhromeyev flew in to Termez by evening and reported that Amin had been deposed, and that Yaqubi was unruffled by this. No changes had occurred in the situation in Afghanistan. This communication didn't relieve the tension completely. Knowing a little about Afghanistan, I didn't exclude the possibility that events could develop unpredictably. When I asked who was taking Amin's place, Sergey Fedorovich replied that he know nothing about that. Our group's work plan was updated on the basis of the information we received. I was ordered to supervise preparation of the 5th Motorized-rifle Division in Kushka, which was under the command of Major-General Yu. V. Shatalin. A group of officers under S. F. Akhromeyev remained in Termez, where it prepared the army's field administration and the 108th Motorized Rifle Division. It should be said that by the time of our arrival the administration of the 40th Army, which was under Major-General L. N. Lobanov, was basically manned by district staff officers and generals, and it was already a fully competent and sufficiently coordinated organism. Our work basically consisted of providing assistance to commanders in developing teamwork and coordination in the subunits, units and combined units after their mobilization, and hammering staffs together as administrative bodies. Our task was made easier by the fact that district officers were already working in both garrisons, and we were able to unite our efforts immediately upon arriving in the division. Let me emphasize that the deployment and preparation of the forces proceeded almost overtly. Official directives were received soon after. Their essence was that in accordance with a treaty of friendship with Afghanistan, and at the request of its government, Soviet forces were being introduced into the country to render assistance in combatting external aggression. No other goals were being pursued. As soon as the external interference ceased, Soviet Forces would be withdrawn from the country immediately. These explanations were perceived with understanding by the personnel. On 19 December 1979 S. F. Akhromeyev telephoned me to say that he had taken ill, and was flying to Moscow. He also reported that as it turned out, no action was taken against Amin, but Afghan Army units had been raised to higher combat readiness, and troops had occupied all key positions in Kabul. The idea flashed through my mind right away that if this were true, then introduction of our troops into Afghanistan would mean war. This is probably why the command opted to deploy one more motorized rifle division. But these forces were still not enough to wage war. When I asked whether this information was dependable, Sergey Fedorovich replied that it needed confirmation. I gained the impression that he wasn't receiving sufficient information from Moscow either. I was ordered to temporarily take charge of the work of the operational group. I took off for Termez, leaving Colonel L. K. Kotlyar as the senior officer in the garrison. There was one question I couldn't get an answer to in preparing the troops for introduction into Afghanistan: What is this going to be -- introduction or invasion? At first glance there may appear to be no difference in the meaning of these two concepts. But actually the difference between them is enormous. An invasion is the entry of the armed forces of one state into the territory of another without the consent of its leadership. Naturally the invading forces encounter not only the armed resistance of the other side, but also the enmity of the people. Usually such actions end in major military conflicts or war. Introduction is entry of the forces of one country into the territory of another with the consent or at the request of its government. The conditions under which the introduced forces remain in the country are totally different in this case. The situation was unclear because a conclusive agreement had never been reached between the governments of the two states at the official level. Nonetheless, I thought that this would be a troop introduction, or that our forces out remain where they were. After all, conducting an invasion by the forces of two or three divisions would be absurd. Of course there was also a third variant--they could announce an introduction, but actually carry out an invasion. This variant would have been the most undesirable, and I would say that it would have been adventuristic and knowingly calamitous. During our work we became persuaded that the timetable indicated in most mobilization plans for making the units ready was unrealistic--the time allowed was extremely short. Moreover the absence of a program for developing teamwork and coordination disconcerted many reserve officers, especially platoon commanders. We were compelled to develop the needed program right during mobilization, but we had too little time at our disposal. I communicated all of my remarks and proposals based on the mobilization personally to Chief of General Staff Marshal of the Soviet Union N. V. Ogarkov. He listened to me attentively, and asked my to put everything I said in writing. Later on most of our proposals were updated as the mobilization plans were revised. In the evening of 23 December I reported the readiness of the divisions to march to Chief of General Staff N. V. Ogarkov once again. The Marshal informed me that introduction of our forces was tentatively planned to begin in the second half of 25 December. The 108th Motorized Rifle division and only the reconnaissance group of the 5th Motorized Rifle Division were to be committed. The army staff would remain where it was. For the moment the 40th Army would consist of the 5th and 108th motorized rifle divisions and the 860th Separate Regiment of the Central Asian Military District, which was to begin moving out the next day. The 56th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade was to remain for the moment at the disposal of the district. The mission would be announced tentatively tomorrow in the second half of the day. In the course of the following day we once again checked the readiness of the 108th Motorized Rifle Division to march. An order to replace the division commander came in at a totally inopportune moment. I suggested to General Yu. P. Maksimov that General K. A. Kuzmin should lead the division into the area assigned to it, and then transfer it to the new commander--Colonel V. I. Mironov--after that. Yuriy Pavlovich agreed with me. In the second half of 24 December General of the Army V. I. Varennikov (who was the Chief of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff at that time) telephoned to say that the Chief of the Operational Administration of the Afghan Army would arrive in Termez today with a group of officers. The purpose of his trip was to carry out joint reconnaissance in order to determine the stationing areas of the Soviet forces in Afghanistan more precisely. The Commander of the 40th Army was ordered to meet the delegation and conduct negotiations with it. There was no recommendation for me to meet with it. Why all of this secrecy, I didn't know. The arrival of the Afghan military delegation inspired the confidence that agreement had been reached on introduction of our forces into Afghanistan. I knew Lieutenant-General Babadzhan, chief of the Operational Administration of the Afghan Army's General Staff, from previous meetings. He assumed this post upon going over to the side of the revolution. He had difficulty in handling his duties, and he displayed no business qualities. He behaved very cautiously. He agreed unquestioningly with all recommendations of our advisors, but he took no steps to carry them out, finding excuses one out over every ten times. Consequently Babadzhan's visit was certainly not on his own initiative. He would have come only with the permission of Chief of General Staff Major Yaqubi, who was wholly devoted to Amin. This was the situation that persuaded me that agreement on introducing--let me emphasize introducing--our force into Afghanistan had been reached between the governments of both countries. At 0200 on 25 December I reported to Marshal of the Soviet Union N. V. Ogarkov by high-frequency telephone: "The 108th Motorized Rifle Division is ready to march. We are awaiting receipt of the mission and the time to move out. Please consider that we will require 6-7 hours to deploy a bridge. We have worked out all of the details with the Afghan Army delegation." "A directive is now being drafted, and after it is signed by Defense Minister D. F. Ustinov it will be sent to the district," reported N. V. Ogarkov. "To set you in the right direction, let me give you a brief synopsis of it. The internal political situation in Afghanistan is complex, and it is getting worse. At the request of the country's government our forces are being introduced into Afghanistan in order to stabilize the situation, to free the Afghan Army from protective functions, and to switch it over to fighting the counterrevolution. "The force grouping to be introduced includes the 40th Army (the 108th and 5th motorized rifle divisions, the 860th Separate Motorized Rifle Regiment, the 56th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, the 353d army artillery and 2d surface-to-air missile brigades; the 103d Airborne Division and the 345th Separate Airborne Regiment; the 34th Combined Air Corps). In addition the 201st Motorized-rifle Division from the Central Asian Military District will be advanced to the Kabul sector, and the 68th Motorized-rifle Division from the Turkestan Military District will be advanced as reserved to the Kushka sector after mobilization. (Soon after introduction, the army artillery and surface-to-air missile brigades and the separate missile battalions of the two motorized rifle divisions were withdrawn from Afghanistan.) "Concurrently with the start of the advance of the 108th Motorized Rifle Division, the following will land at these airfields: Bagrame--the 3d Battalion of the 345th Airborne Regiment; Kabul--the 103d Airborne Division under the command of Major-General I. Ryabchenko. Aviation will remain in place for the moment." The Army Commander and the Division Commander were immediately informed of this, which made it possible to finish loading all of the gear into motor transport without haste, to once again clarify the march computations and the route of travel, to assign the missions to all the personnel, to clarify the goals of our introduction, and to form up the columns of march ahead of time. On the morning of 25 December I telephoned N. V. Ogarkov to report that we were set to cross the state border at 1500 Moscow time (1700 local). Army Commander Yu. V. Tukharinov was conducting reconnaissance together with the Afghan delegation at this time. I was at the District Commander's office when he turned to me and reported. "As soon as we landed in Kunduz we went to see Abdullah Amin, the older brother of the Head of State, who was responsible for the northern provinces of Afghanistan. He was sitting as it his desk when we entered. He didn't rise to his feet, and he didn't even greet us. He gestured for us to sit down on the couch. The discussion concerned the disposition of our forces. He had been informed of their proposed introduction into Afghanistan and their stationing in the country's north. Abdullah named several places which I had found to be unsuitable during my inspection. I would like you, Comrade Commander, to allow us to set up our camp after first coordinating this matter with local authorities." After some thought, Yu. P. Maksimov gave such permission. At the scheduled time the forward detachment of the 108th Motorized Rifle Division and the forward echelon of the 103d Airborne Division crossed the state border into Afghanistan on land and in the air. Throughout the entire night of 25-26 December 1979 we monitored the advance of the division. In the morning of 26 December Colonel B. Ya. Rogontsev, who was traveling together with the division staff, reported that two regiments had reached their designated areas 1.5-2 hours ahead of schedule. The march was proceeding normally. Many of the inhabitants came out to greet our columns. When they halted, men and boys came up to the vehicles, displaying a certain amount of interest and friendship. Yes, that's the way it was. The fact that the situation changed later on is another matter. But at the time of introduction of our forces a certain faction of the people displayed goodwill and cordiality. Colonel Rogontsev then reported that the highway shown on the map was nonexistent in the Tash Kurghan-Kunduz section. Its construction had not yet begun, and in its place was a continuous stretch of dunes. Consequently, the units that were to be located in the city of Kunduz took a detour 120-150 kilometers long. After reporting the situation to Moscow I left for the airfield, where I met S. L. Sokolov, who had flown in from the capital. He said that the introduction of our forces was the subject of much debate in the leadership of the Ministry of Defense. There were opinions both pro and con. When the final decision was made, leadership of this operation was assigned to Sokolov. On the following day the situation in Kabul changed dramatically. The so-called "second phase" of the April revolution began, marked by assassination of the former Chief of State Amin, Babrak Karmal became the Head of State, the Prime Minister, the General Secretary of the PDPA [People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan] and the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. In order to stabilize the situation in the capital the 108th Motorized-rifle Division entered it at 1930, while the 5th Motorized-rifle Division was given the mission of crossing the state border at 0100 on 28 December 1978 and moving in the direction of Kushka, Herat and Shindand. The second day's march was much more difficult than the first. This was explained not only by the presence of Salang mountain pass on the route, but also by the absence of maps among platoon commanders. A road section of around 100 km over the pass was especially dangerous. The road iced over at night. Wheeled equipment skidded on the upgrade, while tracked vehicles slid on the downgrade. Ventilation in the tunnel was designed to accommodate one vehicle at a time, but these were continuous columns of armored equipment with diesel engines. Because of the high density of fumes the drivers had to put on gas masks; even so, the division was able to enter Kabul on schedule. The operational group of the staff of the 40th Army assumed full control over the two divisions and the two units that entered Afghanistan. As for what the "second phase" of the revolution was, and what its content and direction were, no one could give an answer. The mass media quickly seized upon this terminology and blared it out without revealing its essence. Then they soon stopped talking and writing about the "second phase" of the April revolution as suddenly as they started. After the 108th and 5th motorized-rifle divisions were dispatched and control over them and other units that had entered Afghanistan was transferred to the operational group of the 40th Army, our group concentrated its efforts on combat coordination of the 201st and 68th motorized-rifle divisions, which finished mobilizing and drew up to the state border. On 4 January 1980 our group, which consisted of 18 persons headed by Marshal S. L. Sokolov, flew into Kabul. We were met by a real Russian winter--bright sun, a great deal of snow, and 15-20 degrees of frost. We were met at the airfield by the new ambassador F. A. Tabeyev, Afghan Defense Minister Lieutenant Colonel Mohammad Rafi, Member of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council Abdul Kadyr, the new Chief Military Advisor Lieutenant-General S. K. Magometov and other officials. We drove straight from the airfield to the embassy. F. A. Tabeyev, formerly the First Secretary of an oblast committee in the Tatar ASSR, had just recently arrived in Afghanistan, and therefore he was not fully informed on the situation, but he estimated it to be complex and acute. The Ambassador noted that the country's new leadership was in a developmental stage, and that it required aid, although attempts were already being made to infringe upon the rights of PDPA members of the Khalk faction. This announcement caught our attention. Could it be that the reverse process was about to begin, in which the Parcham faction, which was now in power, would enjoy a privileged position while persecution of the Khalk faction would begin. All statements by the ambassador, and especially his conclusions, were categorical in nature. It felt as if a person who had become accustomed to ruling was talking. Prior to his appointment as ambassador, Tabeyev enjoyed the reputation of a highly placed career party worker, possessing enormous power in the republic and having grown accustomed to unquestioning fulfillment of his directives. He was internally convinced that he would handle his new duties successfully. In short, in Afghanistan Tabeyev continued to feel himself to be more an oblast committee secretary that an ambassador. On that same day S. L. Sokolov, the Ambassador and I were received by B. Karmal. He met us very warmly. Approaching S. L. Sokolov, he inquired after his health, expressed pleasure in our arrival, and invited all to sit down. He was extremely gracious in his manners, but a certain cautiousness could be sensed. The discussion was general--I would even say introductory. B. Karmal talked basically about the difficulties he encountered upon assuming the post of head of state, and about the kind of aid that would be desirable from our country. It was evident from everything that the new head of state had not yet acquired confidence, and was only starting to familiarize himself with the numerous duties imposed upon him. Sergey Leonidovich--a heaven-sent diplomat--steered the discussion very competently, directing it into the needed channel. He emphasized several times that our forces had been introduced into Afghanistan to provide moral support to the country's leadership and to exert a psychological influence upon antigovernment forces. The troops could take the most important state facilities under their protection, and free the Afghan Army to fight the rebels and to strengthen national rule. If necessary they were ready to provide assistance to Afghan subunits and units in personnel training and in preparation for combat activities. As far as concerned supplying arms, combat equipment and military property to the Afghan Army, this issue had to be resolved at the government level. In the evening we talked with generals and officers from the Administration of the Chief Military Advisor. Information received from them indicated that the new leadership of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan had in principle been recognized by the officer corps of the Afghan Army, even though it wasn't in control of the situation in the country yet. After introduction of our troops, counterrevolutionary forces became more active in a number of regions, and especially in the country's northeast. Cases of attacks upon lone vehicles of ours had already occurred, and the first injuries and deaths appeared. Antigovernment demonstrations were conducted in Qandahar. Many corps, division, brigade and regiment commanders who were members of the Khalk faction of the PDPA were replaced by officers from the Parcham faction. This act evoked discontent among officers from the Khalk faction, because it made them uncertain about the future; hence their inertia and indifference toward their official duties. Various panicky rumors began spreading widely through the army, and many believed them, because no official denials followed in the forces. The morale of the personnel declined significantly, and educational work was put on hold. The information was not reassuring. S. L. Sokolov emphasized that advisors with the troops were essentially working under combat conditions. This required great courage on their part. It is a great credit to them that they prevented conflicts between Afghan and Soviet forces upon introduction of the latter into the country. At the end of his statement Sergey Leonidovich noted: "I would like to turn special attention to the impermissibility of drawing Soviet forces into the armed conflict with the rebels, and that their functions are to be entirely different, as I already said." In the morning of the following day we met with the Defense Minister of Afghanistan. Lieutenant Colonel Mohammad Rafi had about him the look of independence and, at the same time, modesty. S. L. Sokolov informed him of the work we had done, and of the plans for this next two days; he also offered an estimate of the state of affairs in the army, and expressed his hope that it would improve. It must be said that in terms of the experience of his previous work and his level of military knowledge, M. Rafi was not ready for his position as defense minister. Moreover, his personality didn't stand out in the officer milieu. He was unknown, and it was difficult for him to count on the support of the officer corps. But to be fair, Rafi did not overestimate his strengths, and he did not build any illusions. Even so, he was unable to master his new responsibilities, and at the end of the year he was relieved from his position under the pretense of sending him to a Soviet military academy for training. During our meeting the minister said little--he did more listening than talking--and in conclusion he said: "The Soviet Army's experience is a model for us of how we need to defend our motherland. Without your assistance it would be difficult for us to accomplish this task in short order. I am laying high hopes on Soviet military advisors. They are very conscientious, and we value their work highly. Please give me whatever help you can in mastering these new responsibilities of mine as quickly as possible. We will accept all of your recommendations gratefully." Immediately after this meeting we flew to Qandahar, and on the following day to Bagram, Herat and Shindand, where we spent some time with three Afghan infantry divisions and with units of the 5th Motorized-rifle Division under the command of General Yu. V. Shatalin. What we saw was not pleasant. For practical purposes the Afghan divisions did not exist as a single whole. Subunits were significant distances apart from one another, and they lacked communication not only among themselves but also with the staffs of their units. The local government authorities didn't look any better. Having no contact with the provincial centers and the capital, they were left to their own devices. Telephone communication was disrupted by rebels throughout almost the entire country. The population received information on the situation in the republic from the mouths of the clergy, who were mostly opposed to the revolutionary transformations. A visit to the Afghan 20th Infantry Division in Bagram left an especially depressing impression. The 4th Artillery Regiment, an infantry battalion of the 10th Infantry Regiment, and two battalions of the 31st Infantry Regiment had gone over to the rebels as a sign of protest against introduction of our forces. Only 60 officers out of 130 and around 100 of 1,300 enlisted men were left in the 31st Infantry Regiment. Only the 24th Infantry Regiment, located in Faizabad 200-250 km away from the division headquarters, was still combat worthy. It was our conclusion that the division had ceased to exist as a fighting unit. I had occasion to visit these garrisons during my first visit to Afghanistan. Comparing the situation of 2-3 months ago with the present, I noted a dramatic worsening. The officers were in confusion. One of the causes of low morale was universal replacement of senior commanders by oft-unprepared personnel who were loyal to B. Karmal. The apathy and inertia that spread among the personnel were intensified even more by all kinds of panicky rumors. It was obvious that action had to be taken not only against the rebels but also chiefly against the army's demoralization. Of course the situation could not but cause concern in S. L. Sokolov, and he felt it necessary to share his ideas once again with Defense Minister M. Rafi. The meeting was held immediately upon our group's return to Kabul. Sergey Leonidovich acquainted the minister with his estimate of army affairs, after which he said: "The current situation in the army needn't be considered to be hopeless. The state has sufficient strength to oppose the rebels. In my opinion the main task of the ministry today is to reinforce order and organization in the army, and ensure unquestioning support of the country's new leadership by it. "We feel that the time has come to activate the armed struggle of the army against the rebels. After all, they won't be able to put down the counterrevolution by sitting in their garrisons." "Comrade Marshal," M. Rafi turned to S. L. Sokolov, "I would like to take advantage of your graciousness and ask you to allocate a few forces from the Soviet troops to fight off rebels from the 20th Infantry Divisions's artillery depots together with Afghan subunits. They are located in the population center of Narin, where an artillery regiment that had gone over to the enemy's side is deployed." "We'll help you," replied S. L. Sokolov, "we'll assign one or two Soviet subunits to joint actions. But I feel that the return of the artillery depots is only part of the mission. After all, not all subunits of the artillery regiment went over to the rebels. We need to restore its combat worthiness by relying upon subunits that have remained faithful to the revolution. In addition, you will probably need to provide assistance in restoring local bodies of government. By the way, the subsequent situation in the country may require joint actions of us in a number of cases. We need to prepare for this. It would be right for us to take joint steps right now to establish friendly relations between the personnel of our armies." We subsequently met on several occasions with the Afghan Minister of Defense to resolve the most diverse issues, and in each instance there was full understanding of the existing problems on his part.
