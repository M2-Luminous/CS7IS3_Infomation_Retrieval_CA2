In Matanzas, Jordan pointed out that it is inadmissible that there are farmers who so far this year have not delivered a single quintal of agrarian products. Jordan stressed that the people's food supply is inviolable and that whoever has arable lands and production agreements with the state is obligated to fulfill the terms of the agreements. Jordan added that more severity will be imposed against farmers who fail to deliver, and if necessary, firm application of measures provided for in the Agrarian Law will be used. Finally, Jordan announced that the government is considering levying a tax on fallow lands.
