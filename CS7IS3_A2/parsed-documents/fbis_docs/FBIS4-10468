The Cubans, 53 men, including three doctors, 16 children, and 14 women, had sailed from Cuba on 6 April and stopped at (?Grand Cays) Island for food and fuel. Nevertheless, once they sailed from the island, the boat (54 meters long) developed a mechanical failure and went adrift until dawn Sunday when it entered Mexican waters. On Monday the boat was towed to Islas Mujeres. The 83 Cubans will remain on board until immigration authorities decide what to do. It is estimated this will take three days. During this time the Cubans will be held on board under detention and will not be allowed to go ashore.
