FR940720-0-00129 FR940720-0-00010 Issue 20: The Rio Grande silvery minnow is not a distinct species. It is just a local population of the Mississippi silvery minnow. The Service should consider conducting studies for two years on the species' taxonomy. Response: The Service has taxonomic information that verifies the Rio Grande silvery minnow as a distinct species. The Rio Grande silvery minnow is recognized by the American Fisheries Society, which is considered the scientific authority for the names of fishes, as a full species (American Fisheries Society 1991). Cook et al. (1992), using starch gel electrophoretic methods, found that phenetic and phylogenetic analyses corroborated the hypothesis that H. amarus is distinct at the species level from H. nuchalis and H. placitus , with which it was previously grouped. Issue 21: The Service has not conducted in-depth studies to determine the number of silvery minnows that exist in the Middle Rio Grande Valley and associated drainage ditches. The species may be doing well without protection of the Federal government. Response: Since 1987, studies have been conducted to document the population of Rio Grande silvery minnows in both the Middle Rio Grande Valley and its associated irrigation and drainage ditches from Velarde to Elephant Butte Reservoir, New Mexico. These studies have shown that very few Rio Grande silvery minnows survive in the drainage ditches. The listing is based, in part, upon the extirpation of the species from about 95 percent of its historic range. The species was once thought to be one of the most numerous fish in the Rio Grande. In 50 fish collections made between Bernalillo and Elephant Butte Reservoir between 1987 and 1988, the Rio Grande silvery minnow was the second most abundant species, comprising 18 percent of the total fish collected. From 1989 to 1992, 56 collections were made in the same area and only 3 Rio Grande silvery minnows were collected. During that period, the Rio Grande silvery minnow went from being the second most abundant native fish species to the least abundant native species (Platania 1993). The Service believes that without the protection afforded through Federal listing, the species is likely to become extinct. Two native Rio Grande fish species have already become extinct. Issue 22: The fish exist in stretches of the river that have been subject to drying for at least 50 years, but have disappeared from areas where there has been instream flow for the past 50 years. Response: The Service agrees that the species has persisted in reaches of the river that have experienced seasonal drying during the past 50 years and has been extirpated from reaches where there has been continual flow during the last 50 years. In the past, during periods of extremely low flow, the species survived in areas where irrigation water returned to the river, in seepage and leakage pools located downstream of irrigation diversion dams, and, prior to construction of Cochiti Dam, in the canyon reach of the Rio Grande upstream of Cochiti. Prior to the construction of irrigation and flood control dams in the southwest, it was not unusual for portions of major rivers to become dry during periods of drought. During these drought periods, native fishes would retreat to canyon reaches where permanent water existed. After the drought ended, they would re-inhabit the reaches of river that had formerly been dry. There was a constant expansion and contraction of fish populations. Construction of mainstream dams prevented this movement and may have contributed to the extitirpation of downstream populations of native fishes. The reasons for the extirpation of the species from continual flow reaches of the river are not known but probably relate to factors other than flow. Changes in species composition, flow regimes, and water quality could all have been causative factors in the decline of the Rio Grande silvery minnow from these areas. Even in those areas where the species presently persists, its abundance has been substantially reduced (Platania 1993). Issue 23: Listing is not necessary because of existing protection that is afforded the species by the requirements of the Coordination Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and other habitat protection regulations, such as section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Any activity that could affect the habitat of the species would have to undergo these reviews, including the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District's work on its structures. Such work could not be done with impunity. Protection is also provided to the species because of its listing as endangered by the State of New Mexico.
