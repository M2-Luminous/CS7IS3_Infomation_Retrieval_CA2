Opposition sources in Aden see this as a major blow to the signs of relaxation which some thought were recently beginning to appear as the cabinet held meetings in Aden at the invitation of Prime Minister Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. Informed sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the trucks were carrying arms from the north and were intercepted by southern military units on the desert road linking the governorates of Shabwah (in the south) and Ma'rib in the north. In the ensuing exchange of fire seven soldiers were killed outright on both sides and the southern forces seized three trucks. Three other trucks managed to turn back, but three are still missing. The sources emphasized that this incident, which occurred yesterday, was quickly contained by the Military Coommittee, which is continuing its tour of Shabwah Governorate in the course of its plan to end military moves on both sides. Political sources in Aden have stated that the cabinet, which met in Aden yesterday for the first time after a three-month suspension, formed three committees: One to study security matters, one to prepare constitutional amendments, and one to study the requirements of the Dialogue Committee and help it play its role of controlling the organs that will implement the Pledge and Accord Document. The sources regard the measures taken by the government at yesterday's meeting to be a violation of the provisions of the Pledge and Accord Document. [passage omitted] Opposition sources in Aden said after the annoucement of the government's formation of these committees that what had happened was "the first clear violation of the Amman agreement" and that it was not up to the government to form a constitutional amendment committee because that was within the jurisdiction of the Dialogue Committee.
