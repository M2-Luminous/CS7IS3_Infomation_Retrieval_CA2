The French units are based in Goma and Bukavu at the Zaire-Rwanda border, from where they have been making incursions into Rwandan territory since this afternoon. A third base is in Kisangani, where French Army planes are stationed. In all, 2,500 troops have been mobilized today. A security corridor has been established from Goma to evacuate the 8,000 Rwandans trapped in (Assiengoungou). France has given assurances that its troops will not go as far as Kigali. According to French Defense Minister Francois Leotard, the mission is strictly a humanitarian and not a peacekeeping one. The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], however, is opposed to the French intervention. The front says France is using Operation Turquoise as an alibi to give the Rwandan Army a helping hand. The Rwandan interim government thinks the French intervention should cover the entire territory. According to a communique issued by the Rwandan Embassy in Kinshasa, the priority concerns for this humanitarian action should be to break the war trend which these hardened firebrands are bent on pursuing and ensure security conditions which would enable displaced people and war victims to get out of the mental and financial distress resulting from the continuation of hostilities, which RPF sponsors are staking on. The communique further stated that it is absolutely urgent for Rwandans to get out of this tragedy and for the international community to get mobilized and respond effectively to the people's distress calls. It also stated that the cease-fire is constantly being violated by this indisciplined group under the command of officers who thirst for power and blood and who had moved up in rank in Uganda in the Army of, quote, the former rebel, Museveni.
