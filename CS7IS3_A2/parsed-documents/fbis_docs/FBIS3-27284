Speaking at a public occasion tonight, NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY [XINHUA] Hong Kong branch Director Zhou Nan said that the future of Hong Kong is after all in the hands of the great Chinese people including Hong Kong compatriots. He reiterated that with the backing of the powerful motherland and the support of all the people in the country, we will surely overcome all the man-made obstacles on the course of progress to secure a smooth transition and guarantee long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. Zhou made the above remarks while reviewing the recent Sino-British relations in his speech. He said that we sincerely hoped that China and Britain could reach an agreement on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong on the basis of the "three conformities". He said that the Chinese side had made its utmost efforts in order to reach an agreement with the British side. However, the good will of the Chinese side and Hong Kong compatriots did not come true, he said, adding that the responsibility totally lies on the British side. In his speech delivered at tonight's reception party held by the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch to celebrate the Lunar New Year, Zhou Nan also reviewed the recent development of the relations between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. He said that the relationship between the two areas in the past year had become ever closer, adding that the booming economy of the Chinese mainland had enabled Hong Kong to retain its continued economic growth at a fairly high rate. This, he said, had fully revealed that the stability and development in the Chinese mainland is the most solid foundation for prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. He expressed his firm belief that the economic and trade relationship between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, together with exchanges and cooperation in the other fields, will enter a new stage in the coming new year. Over a thousand people including local public figures from all walks of life in the territory such as leading businessmen Ann Tse-kai and Henry Fok Ying-tung, both of whom are also vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended tonight's grand meeting.
