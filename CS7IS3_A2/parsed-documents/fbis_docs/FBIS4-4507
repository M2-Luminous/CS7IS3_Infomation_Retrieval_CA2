Obtaining cooperation from Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Hosokawa tried to persuade the ministries and agencies concerned, including the Ministry of Finance [MOF], to accept the ideas. Because of opposition by bureaucrats, however, it is said that Hosokawa was forced to give up all of his ideas and to delay formulating a program. This was disclosed by a government source. It seems that the prime minister's leadership will be tested again before formulating the final measures in June. According to the source, the prime minister reportedly firmed up his original ideas while listening to the opinions of nongovernment figures -- including Yotaro Kobayashi (chairman of Fuji Xerox Co.), who acted as chairman of the Japan-U.S. businessmen's meeting, which was held in February immediately after the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit talks. It is said that the prime minister firmed up his intention about 13 March to include the following macromeasures in the package: 1) adding 100 trillion yen to the public investment plan; 2) announcing a cut in income and resident taxes to be extended beyond 1995; and 3) reducing the current-accounts surplus to 2 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the future. The source said that Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister; Hiroshi Kumagaya, minister of international trade and industry; and other ministers supported the prime minister for a while. However, the MOF opposed the public investment and tax cut plans because nothing had been decided about obtaining alternative sources of revenue. As for the self-imposed goal of reducing the surplus, the Economic Planning Agency and other ministries changed their minds and took a negative stand toward this. On 24 March, the prime minister asked Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura to visit the nine ministries and agencies to persuade them to support the prime minister's intentions. However, the attitude of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] toward Takemura was cold. A top MITI official complained and said, "Does the prime minister think that the issue will be settled simply by the chief cabinet secretary making a round of visits?" After this incident, close associates of the chief cabinet secretary quickly changed their minds and began to express negative opinions, saying, "It seems that the United States does not want us to carry out an additional increase in public investment." After all, the government decided on 29 March to delay making decisions on increasing public investment and continuing tax cuts. The government barely managed to include in the package a plan to reduce the current-accounts surplus to 2.8 percent of GDP. Reportedly, an MOF source bragged: "Members of the Prime Minister's Office were reluctant to give up on their ideas. You can understand how the Prime Minister's Office was isolated." However, this series of recent events unexpectedly revealed the fact that the prime minister was at the mercy of the bureaucrats of MITI and the MOF. President Clinton once said that Japanese bureaucrats "control Japanese politics."
