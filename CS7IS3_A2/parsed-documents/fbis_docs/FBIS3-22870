When will there be a danger of another maximum credible accident a la Chernobyl? Rogoshin: The 20,000 incidents included a number of serious violations that led to the shutting down of entire blocks in nuclear plants, but also included very many minor administrative mistakes. Most of the facilities that had to suspend operations have resumed working. However, there were a few facilities that had to be closed once and for all. For example, there were the two reactors at Krasnoyarsk 26, which produced plutonium for nuclear weapons. Their operation violated all environmental and safety norms: They were cooled with water from the Yenisey, which was then released back into the river without going through any kind of purification process. As a result of this practice, the entire river has suffered serious environmental damage. We have also reduced the operation of the IR-8 research reactor at the Moscow Institute for Energy and Technology to a minimum. The institute lacks enough supervisory personnel to guarantee that the reactor functions safely. The shortage of specialists is becoming an increasingly serious problem. Sitnikova: According to your report, safety regulations are disregarded by every fifth employee. Why is that so? Rogoshin: The causes are primarily economic. The highly qualified specialists who work in "secret nuclear towns" earn less than the cleaning women who work for the Moscow subway. That is why fewer and fewer young people want to complete the complicated and lengthy training. Personnel are becoming less and less motivated. Over the past few months, their salaries have only been paid out with lengthy delays. To put it simply and bluntly, they feel humiliated. However, nuclear power stations lack money in every area: There is even a shortage of new fuel elements. Some power stations have only enough reserves to last a few weeks. Half of Russia's new nuclear power stations are operating at half their capacity to avoid shutting down because of a lack of fuel elements. Can one talk about raising safety standards under these conditions? No, that is impossible. Sitnikova: Which nuclear facilities do you consider to be particularly dangerous? Rogoshin: Safety at nuclear power stations is not the main problem. Following the Chernobyl catastrophe, nuclear power stations attracted particular attention from the public and government. However, the situation is much worse at other facilities: uranium mines, facilities for enriching uranium, plants producing nuclear weapons, storage facilities for nuclear waste. For a long time, no one bothered about these facilities. Many of the facilities come under the authority of the Defense Ministry and there were never any state inspections. Today, however, these are the very facilities where the most violations occur as well as the most dangerous violations. The risk to the population and the environment is growing. Sitnikova: However, the Defense Ministry is reluctant to allow the authorities to inspect those facilities. Rogoshin: The Defense Ministry is sabotaging the decrees issued by the Russian president. In accordance with those decrees, our agency is responsible for overseeing nuclear facilities throughout the entire country irrespective of the ministry that they come under. The situation is completely absurd, after all, the president is also the commander in chief of the Armed Forces. Sitnikova: Is there any reliable information on the military complex at all? Rogoshin: Yes, many of our experts previously served in the Armed Forces, and some even held the rank of admiral and general. They know very well how serious the situation is. In the past, the Navy came some way to meeting our requests, and we were permitted to take part in their inspections. However, after we had criticized safety standards on a few occasions, we were excluded. Today, we receive some information through personal channels. Officially, however, we are denied entry to military bases. On the basis of what we know, the safety risks are particularly high at those facilities where nuclear weapons are stored. Sitnikova: There are more and more reports in Russia about radioactive substances being stolen. How great is the danger that nuclear warheads will also begin to disappear shortly? Rogoshin: I think that we Russians are capable of everything, and that, unfortunately, also includes the theft of nuclear weapons. That is why for a long time now we have been calling for a uniform system of state supervision of all strategic facilities in the country. Once again, the military does not want to go along with that. On the other hand, in the civilian field, an agency was recently formed to oversee nuclear power stations. I hope that will at least rule out serious thefts of highly-enriched uranium and plutonium. As for the press reports, those are mainly about the theft of beryllium, zirconium, and slightly enriched uranium. Even if one had the appropriate technology, it would not be possible to build a nuclear weapon using those elements. Sitnikova: Can you rule out the possibility that there are enough highly-enriched materials on the Russian black market for the production of a bomb? Rogoshin: I cannot rule out anything. Three containers of highly-enriched uranium, which was intended for use in submarine reactors, have disappeared from the North Sea Fleet base. That would suffice for the construction of a bomb. We cannot establish what has happened to the containers. Sitnikova: What dangers are posed by the recruitment of Russian scientists by nuclear threshold countries? Rogoshin: There are serious dangers. We are not only talking about specialists from secret nuclear towns. Every highly qualified physicist who has worked in a nuclear facility knows how to build a bomb. Everything else is only a question of fissionable material and the appropriate technology.
