The ruling it adopted back on 18 January 1993 found in favor of the action brought by the Dniester Regional Bank against the Moscow Goznak printing factory. The latter was requested to carry out its obligation to ship the Dniester money coupons manufactured by it in accordance with a paid order. The introduction of Dniester money coupons is regarded as a temporary and purely economic measure helping to stabilize the position with cash until a general agreement with Moldova has been reached, Grigoriy Marakutsa, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the unrecognized Dniester Moldovan Republic, explained to a NEGA correspondent. Its implementation, however, has been stopped by Russia -- not without some pressure from Chisinau officials, informed sources say. The 24 May session of the Supreme Soviet of the Dniester Moldovan Republic that discussed the debts problem adopted an appeal to the Russian president, the Federation Council, and the State Duma with a request to positively resolve the question decided long ago by the Russian Federation Court of Arbitration.
