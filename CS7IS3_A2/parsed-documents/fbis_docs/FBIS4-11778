He said that this claim was "unfounded and aimed to undermine the KDP and its leader." The Qatari News Agency [QNA], citing the Jordanian paper AL-BILAD, said yesterday that the Baghdad government would appoint Barzani as "governor general of the Kurdish autonomy region in the north of the country." The paper cited what it called "informed Arab sources" as saying that the Kurdish leader would "return to Baghdad within 10 days at the latest to settle in his country permanently." Muhsin Dazha'i, Barzani's personal representative and member of the Executive Council of the opposition's Iraqi National Congress [INC], told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that "the report was fabricated at the instigation of the Iraqi Government and some tendentious people." He added that "its aim is to undermine the party and its leader and create confusion, suspicion, and friction among the Kurdish people, the Kurdish parties, and the Iraqi opposition forces in general." An official of the KDP's European Bureau in London has also denied the report, describing it as "sheer lies." Hani al-Fukayki, deputy chairman of the INC Executive Council, accused the Iraqi intelligence services of trying to "confuse the Iraqi opposition, the Arab states, and the United Nations by spreading rumors and lies such as that report." He added that "Saddam's local and regional intelligence services have made up that false report in order to harm Barzani who, along with other brothers, is leading the struggle in the homeland against Baghdad's dictatorship and despotism and for the creation of a united, federal, democratic Iraqi state."
