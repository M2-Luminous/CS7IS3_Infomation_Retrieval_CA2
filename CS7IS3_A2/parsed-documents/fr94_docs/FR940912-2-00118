SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Public Service Company of New Mexico currently has a water service contract (USBR Contract No. 14&hyph;06&hyph;400&hyph;4831) with the Bureau of Reclamation for an annual use of 16,200 acre-feet of water from Navajo Reservoir, in San Juan County, New Mexico. The contract water is diverted from the San Juan River near Waterflow, New Mexico, via a weir and backwater pumping system. Water is stored in a small reservoir at the San Juan Generating Station. The existing water service contract was executed in 1968, amended in 1977, and expires in 2005. The Bureau of Reclamation is the lead Federal agency to ensure compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act for the proposed action. The Public Service Company of New Mexico has requested the Bureau of Reclamation to initiate the environmental scoping process and prepare the environmental document. The Bureau of Reclamation is initiating the scoping process now to allow sufficient time to identify and resolve (1) environmental concerns, and (2) any issues affecting any assets held in trust by the Federal government for Federally recognized Indian tribes or individual members of Federally recognized Indian tribes insofar as those concerns or issues are relevant to the proposed water service contract renewal and extension.
