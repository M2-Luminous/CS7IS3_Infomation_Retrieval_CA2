Written by Professor Liu Yan and Professor Yang Shizhao of the Zhou Enlai Research Office of Nankai University in Tianjin, the book presents a large amount of historical data to show many of his pioneering practices and theories during the periods of new democratic revolution and socialist revolution. They include the strategy for the Chinese revolution to surround cities from the countryside, an important part of Mao Zedong Thought, which could be seen from many of his speeches during the agrarian revolution when he served as a principal leading member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Zhou Enlai died on January 8, 1976.
