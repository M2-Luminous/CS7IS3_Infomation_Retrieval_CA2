During U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Russia, Boris Yeltsin came out for Russia's full participation in the program. According to President Yeltsin, it is possible for Russia to join NATO, but only together with all former allies of the East Bloc. We asked Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk whether possible access to NATO by Russia would not undermine Western security guarantees to our country. [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] Nobody is going to give full guarantees. We have to strive after them, this is obvious. The statements by President Yeltsin, however, well, they vary in tone and they are not always consistent. Still, I think that Clinton achieved a lot. If Yeltsin accepts the participation in the Partnership for Peace, it means that we can feel a little safer -- if these intentions are genuine. No security system without Russia or, even worse, against Russia would be either permanent or safe. That is why I receive the statement favorably. We will see how it is going to look in practice.
