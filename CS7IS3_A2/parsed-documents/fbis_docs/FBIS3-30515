At a joint meeting with the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] Club of Deputies, the coalition partners want to accommodate SDL demands and thus achieve the submission of a single draft amendment. As Prime Minister Meciar noted, the only issue of dispute between the government-sponsored draft and the SDL deputies' draft is the combining of government posts with positions in the National Property Fund (FNM). Asked when the talks with the SDL Club of Deputies would be held, Vladimir Meciar replied: "Who knows? They may be under way already." As SDL Chairman Peter Weiss told SME shortly after the conclusion of the coalition talks, so far he had not received any official offer for talks with the coalition on the amendment to the law on large-scale privatization. As for the SDL's own draft, they stick to their positions. Weiss said that it was unacceptable and unconstitutional to combine government posts with FNM posts and that he did not see any possibility of reaching an agreement on this point. At their talks yesterday, the coalition representatives returned to the nonacceptance of the so-called law on [bilingual] signposts [by Slovak Parliament on 28 January]. According to Vladimir Meciar, the government can submit it again to parliament for another discussion in six months at the earliest. As Vladimir Meciar reported further, the coalition partners dealt with the existence or nonexistence of the so-called SNS National Democratic Club [of SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak] in the National Council of the Slovak Republic. According to the HZDS chairman's words, the HZDS upholds the opinion that it signed the coalition agreement with the SNS Central Council, which is the partner for the HZDS. This partner announced that there exists only one SNS Club of Deputies, so the HZDS has no doubt as to who its coalition partner is. SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak told SME in this context that, during the coalition talks, he had advised Vladimir Meciar to read carefully what he signs. According to Cernak, the coalition agreement was signed by two legal entities--the HZDS and the SNS. Ludovit Cernak confirmed that the existence of the SNS National Democratic Club had been a subject of the coalition talks. The participants did not arrive at a final stand, however, because, according to Ludovit Cernak, a meeting of coalition partners is not a forum that is entitled to assess the founding of the SNS National Democratic Club. As he went on to say, in this context, the promise could be heard from the other participants that, if members of the SNS National Democratic Club gave up their SNS membership, the establishment of the SNS National Democratic Club would be respected. The SNS chairman rejected this offer. He said that he would continue to participate in the coalition talks in line with the decision of the SNS Central Council.
