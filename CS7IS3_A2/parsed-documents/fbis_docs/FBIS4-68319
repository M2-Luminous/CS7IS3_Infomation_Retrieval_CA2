And apparently it was because the logic of life itself -- especially the life of the recent difficult years -- prompted the two republics to search for a solution in a more intimate integration and strengthening of friendly ties. Perhaps one of the most important document signed by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev was the Treaty on Broadening Further the Cooperation and Integration Between Russia and Kazakhstan. Specifically, it lays the foundation for cooperation in areas such as economics, culture, and law. Also extremely important are the Agreement of Strategic Nuclear Storage Facilities Temporarily Located in Kazakhstan, the Treaty on Military Cooperation, the Memorandum on the Basic Principles for the Resolution of Issues Associated With the Civil and Legal Status of Citizens of Kazakhstan Living in the Russian Federation and of Citizens of Russia Living in Kazakhstan. In all, more than 30 documents were signed. As we also expected, some problems arose in connection with the resolution of the issue of the fate of the Baykonur Cosmodrome. But there, much was done by those working on the joint agreement during the preparatory period of the delegation. And although the last word was still with the presidents, the changes they inserted into the agreements on the status and conditions of use of Baykonur and the city of Leninsk turned out to be insignificant. The cosmodrome, under development for many years during the time of the Soviet Union and from which the first launch was made, on 4 October 1957 -- as well as from which the first cosmonaut, Yuriy Gagarin, lifted off, on 12 April 1961 -- remained under lease to Russia. The term of the lease is 20 years, with an extension of 10 years. The Russian side maintained its position on Russian citizens -- military servicemen of the Military Space Forces of the Russian Federation -- staying at the cosmodrome and servicing it. The lease price: $115 million a year. The director of the Russian Space Agency, Yuriy Koptev, had this to say about that: the Russian-Kazakh agreements reached in Moscow acknowledge Russian jurisdiction over the cosmodrome. That means that the Russian citizens and military servicemen will live under Russian law. With the Baykonur lease, we emphasize once again, both sides win, the citizens of both republics win. As for the people in shoulder boards, who, by the nature of their activity, are used to following strict regulations and clear laws, these agreements -- including the Treaty on Military Cooperation -- are particularly important to them. And what they say is that the period of uncertainty in Russian-Kazakh relations is behind us. That, like it or not, all of us have to swim together to the new shore under the rubric of "cooperation." That the popular wisdom that say that one old friend is better than two new ones is right.
