Joan Spero, U.S. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs, made the call in her talk with Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama at Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's official residence. During the 45-minute talk, Spero said she understands well that Hosokawa has been focusing on political reform but demanded that Tokyo work to produce favorable results of the bilateral trade talks once the domestic task is completed, the official said. Pinpointing priority fields in the negotiations, including automobiles and auto parts and the Japanese Government procurement of U.S. equipment, the U.S. under secretary reportedly sought Tokyo's efforts to achieve progress in such fields. Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton are scheduled to meet in Washington on February 11 and assess progress in the framework talks. Hatoyama voiced hope the bilateral negotiations will be successful with efforts from both sides, the official said. Saying the Japan-U.S. trade talks should be two-way talks, Hatoyama also reportedly told Spero that Tokyo is opposed to the setting of numerical targets to measure the openness of Japan's markets. The deputy chief cabinet secretary also noted that the Japanese Government cannot promise anything out of its reach in the talks on the opening of its markets, the official said. Spero responded that Washington is only insisting on setting "quantitative and qualitative indicators" to gauge improvement in U.S. access in Japanese markets, the official said.
