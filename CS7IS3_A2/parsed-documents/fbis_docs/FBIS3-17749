Meshkov ruled that Crimean conscripts serve only on Crimean territory. On Friday, Bizhan visited Sebastopol to meet with the command of the Ukrainian Navy and the Crimea's Military Commissar. He denied the Crimean authorities the right to make decisions on drafts to the Ukrainian armed forces. But he said the order, by which the Ukrainian Defense Minister allowed up to 20 percent of the Crimean draftees to serve on the peninsula, remained in force and those who could motivate their desire to stay to serve in their home region, would be allowed to stay. Also on Friday in Sebastopol Bizhan met with the Russian Navy's chief-of-staff Admiral Selivanov. According to Bizhan, several senior officers of the Russian Navy arrived in Sebastopol without coordinating that move with the Ukrainian leaders. Addressing the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, Bizhan said his Ministry wanted to take stock of the Fleet's property and study all the angles of that problem before preparing an agreement on the transfer of the Fleet under Russian command in payment for the fuel debt Ukraine was running with Russia. Preparatory work could show, said Bizhan, it would make no sense for Ukraine to sign that kind of an agreement with Russia. On the other hand, Moscow saw the problem as practically settled and was willing to discuss in detail the transfer of the Black Sea Fleet under its command. In Bizhan's view, Moscow was violating a number of earlier agreements. Russian symbols were used by the Fleet and the decision was disregarded that the Fleet's vessels be manned in equal proportion by Russian and Ukrainian sailors. According to Bizhan, 810th Marine brigade, with base in Sebastopol, was manned exclusively by Russian citizens. If it was recognized as all-Russian, the brigade would have to be removed, without delay, from Ukrainian territory.
