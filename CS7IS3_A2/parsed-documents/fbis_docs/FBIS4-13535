"What's going on in Egypt is very danagerous because violence breeds more violence and deprives people of their stability and deepens feelings of hatred among citizens of the same country," warned the IAF and the NAF in an open statement to the people of Egypt and Egyptian political parties and unions. The two parties agreed that the "destructive" violent crimes committed by extremists in Egypt will lead to the destruction of Egypt's economy and freeze any development plans in that country, rendering it vulnerable and prey to "opportunists' claws." "We as Islamists are pained by what is going on, and we call upon the Egyptian Government to deny the current situation and initiate negotiations with the parties concerned to try and contain this problem," said Hamzah Mansur, AIF Lower House spokesman in a telephone interview with the Jordan times on Sunday. The deputy added that it was the responsibility of all Egyptian nationalists to exercise pressure on their government to seek the best interest of the people. The Egyptian Government, he added, "should have enough common sense to realise that it is time to talk to citizens," in order to pinpoint the reasons behind these "daily massacres" and study the circumstances that prompted the outbreak of violence. In the joint statement, the IAF and NAF accused the Egyptian Government of dictatorship. It said the Cairo government does not give other parties the freedom to express their opinion or move under the country's legal umbrella, which, added the statement, causes frustration among the masses. The two parties also accused the U.S. and Israel of escalating the violence in Egypt by steering away from that country's attempts at reform because they (the U.S. and Israel) realise that Egypt is the heart of the Arab World, and instability there would obstruct developments in the Arab World. Mr. Mansur said that the IAF and NAF are using the media as their means of communication with Egypt's people as, he explained, the Egyptian's political parties' situation does not allow for immediate contact. He added that if their Saturday statement causes a positive response from nationalists and Islamists in Egypt, the IAF and NAF will be "more than glad" to offer help by sending a delegation to Egypt to assist in establishing bridges of communication between conflicting parties there. The IAF and the NAF warned of the seriousness of the situation in Egypt and said that it could be "contagious." "Therefore, it is the duty of every devout Muslim and Arab to do whatever possible to help end this bloodshed in order to secure a decent living for the next generations," concluded the joint statement.
