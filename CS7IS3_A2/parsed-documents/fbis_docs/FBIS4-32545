What happened to the "eight" who were the main protagonists in numerous affairs and subsequent police cases? We have a variety of collages of police cases, scandals, and affairs. One of the most disrupted institutions of the system, the first to be hit by the so-called new democratic changes, was, unquestionably, the police. Even the most superficial study of the situation that has developed over the past three to four years would reveal the existence of politics in all areas of Macedonian governmental affairs. A look at the work of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] would show that, once again, the police were one of the most extensively discussed items on its agenda, judging by the heat generated by the debates and various accusations. What is now clear is that the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVR) has still not attained the quality expected by the Macedonian public. It should be nonpoliticized and party-neutral, with the sole task of maintaining peace and order in the state, protect the citizens and, naturally, their property, and above all, treat equally all subjects of the state, regardless of their party, political, or ideological affiliation. Internal quarrels, power struggles, and, above all, divisiveness unquestionably remained the main features of that ministry. Even the latest actions taken by Pavle Trajanov, the former deputy minister for operational activities of the MVR, related to open charges that some government departments had become involved with organized crime, and the cover-ups and denials issued by his boss, Minister Ljubomir Frckovski, most clearly indicate the insurmountable split within the Macedonian police. Actually, one way or another, such relations are part of the history of the MVR. As a Starter, the Eight The first known police affair took place in 1989-90. It is referred to as "the case of the eight." It was eight high-ranking police officials who promoted the use of the then-existing primary organization of the League of Communists in settling matters with the Republic's internal affairs secretariat, which brought to the surface a number of machinations, abuses, and distortions in the work of the police authorities. The group consisted of Pavle Trajanov, Slobodan Bogoevski, Stanoja Bogev, Grozdan Cvetkovski, Aleksandar Dinevski, Mile Ilievski, Bedjet Bedjeti, and Jovan Caminski. Bearing in mind the fact that Aleksandar Andonovski, the former secretary, reacted to their initiative with a repressive measure (all of them were suspended), they made their demands and views public. Initially the Belgrade media and, subsequently, the Macedonian press actively discussed the arguments of the initiators and, as we know, at that time the "case of the eight" was also considered by the highest party and state Macedonian bodies (the Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia and the Central Committee of the Communist League of Macedonia). Vasil Tupurkovski and Petar Gosev were actively involved in dealing with that matter. They threw their full support to the "rebels," as a result of which changes were made in the then police leadership (Republic Secretary Andonovski and his deputy Kompyanov were replaced). However, no real change occurred in the structure of the service. Quite interesting in this context is the subsequent fate of the eight, for in a number of areas it was precisely they who were the main protagonists in police investigations. They achieved their real "rehabilitation" during the period of pluralism, following the appointment of Jordan Mijalkov (who tragically died in an accident on 19 December 1991) as minister of internal affairs. Trajanov and Bogoevski were appointed to the highest possible positions of under secretaries of public and state security, respectively. Bedzet and Bogoev were given deputy positions; Cvetkovski was appointed director of the Security Cadre Training Center. Ilievski was made councilor, while Dinevski and Caminski were given command positions. Essentially, the first case was the suicide of Mile Ilnevski in May 1992, which was caused, according to subsequent reports, by emotional disturbance. Still, the unofficial version of the event was that the reason for this nervous illness which led to Ilnevski's suicide was triggered by his awareness that his home telephone had been tapped on the instruction of his former "fellow fighters," headed by Bogoevski, and suspicions that he too had been involved in the then affair of the "bomb throwers" in Veles. The second case, which bore all the marks of a real police-political scandal, took place in August of that same year, under the "management" of Aleksandar Dinevski, the head of the SDB [State Security Service]. The official police version was that official documents were found in Dinevski's possession, which he had passed on to the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity]. At the news conference which took place on that subject, he accused the MVR of illegal tapping of telephones, including that of the VMRO-DPMNE. Subsequently, Dinevski became a member of that party and today is member of its leadership in the Cair township in Skopje. All that remained of this entire scandal was the Duvlo case (repeatedly raised in the Macedonian Parliament), and the frequent subject of party influences in the police. Meanwhile, immediately after Dinevski, Jovan Caminski, one of the "eight," left the police. He was transferred from chief to private counsel. Today he is in private business. It is believed that he is too has ties with the MVR, with one of the former "eight," Pavle Trajanov. Are the Police Becoming Politicized? Of the former compact group of "rebels," only Trajanov and Bogoevski were left in leading MVR positions. They actually controlled the entire police organization. That is precisely why the public was quite surprised to learn that the public security under secretary was made deputy minister for operative affairs (November 1993). In the police hierarchy, this is a very high rank. Trajanov himself said at that time that he was surprised by the government's decision and that the reasons for this act, in his view, lie elsewhere rather than the official statement of the minister that it was a matter of routine cadre rotation in anticipation of the reorganization of the MVR and the elimination of the position of assistant secretary. It was public knowledge that this was the result of reliable information provided to the press concerning the then topical affair of the "all-Albanian paramilitary force." Along with this, the claim was made public that Trajanov was replaced because of his closeness to Petar Gosev's Democratic Party. The latter view became topical once again after Trajanov's statement to NOVA MAKEDONIJA, dated 12 March 1994, to the effect that some government ministries had become involved with organized crime, which excited the public once again. The government held a meeting on this subject and its views were presented at a news conference by Minister Ljubomir Frckovski, who distanced himself from the statements of his assistant and asked the latter to back up his claims by citing criminal charges within a "reasonable period" of about 10 days. The five or six criminal activities described by the MVR Operative Affairs Department apparently were not considered a sufficient argument by Frckovski. On his suggestion, therefore, on 4 April last, by removing Trajanov from the government, he was once again transferred (without any explanation) from the function of assistant minister to senior adviser, which, in terms of police terminology (and practice) is the last position to be held prior to retirement. What gives a political slant to this entire case is the fact that Trajanov's statement according to which the government was involved in organized crime, issued immediately before the elections at district 103 in the Skopje area, was exploited to the utmost by the Democratic Party in its electoral campaign, while at the television duel on the A-1 television channel between Aleksandar Tortevski (Democratic Party) and Nikola Popovski (SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia]), the latter directly accused Trajanov of acting together with Gosev by supplying his party with confidential police data (unequivocally related to the Dinevski case). The ex-assistant minister rejected this claim as groundless and tendentious slander, emphasizing his initial statement that organized crime has penetrated the executive branch. Regardless of the final resolution of this case, it is obvious that internal upheavals and disagreements within the MVR are continuing, along with questions related to the involvement of individual cadres in party affairs. The process of conversion of that ministry is, obviously, not an easy one. This is quite clearly taking place in connection with a variety of political pressures and influences. Still, this phenomenon clearly stands out among other numerous political-police affairs, scandals, and events. From "Cavern" to "the Twenty" The study of the case may lead to a general relative group classification. The first group would include the purely political police cases ("Tavern," "Blue Bird," and "Bulgarian Tracks"), which were debated twice in the Assembly. In the first case they were considered as specific agenda items; the second time they were within the context of the question addressed at Minister Frckovski. The second group of political scandals could be described as "professional" or as a "criticism of MVR actions." This includes the "Radolista," "Radovis," "Kuklis," "Bit Pazar," and "Djorce Petrov" cases, which were also extensively and lengthily debated in the Macedonian Parliament and about which one could stress as a characteristic feature the fact that, one way or another, daily political activities were the main actual reason. The third type of affairs, again involving the MVR, could be described as one of "status" or "interministerial." This includes, above all, the confrontation between the ministry and the defense department (the "military camps" case) and with the government's customs department on the subject of levying some customs fees. Actually, the fourth group consists of purely internal political scandals that pertain mostly to the abuse of police professionalism, involving theft and corruption among the police. Starting with October 1991, with the "600,000 German marks case," as a result of which one commanding officer and one chief of a political precinct were suspended, and ending with the latest cases in Sveti Nikol, Kocani, Tetovo, and Bitola, where, as a result of customs dealings or engaging in black marketeering and resale, most police chiefs were fired, the MVR has been a permanent topic of discussion. The case of the December 1992 "twenty" which was brought up in the first months of this year is special for not belonging to any group but being something entirely separate. It resembles the case of the "eight" not only because it is, once again, a question of the work of state security personnel but also the data submitted to the highest authorities in Macedonia indicating major deformations and abuses in the statutory and legal functions of the MVR. In this case, however, there was no conclusion to this prototype, which ended only as a case that did not result in major upheavals within the ministry. In discussing the link between the police and politics, Dr. Djoko Tozi, professor at the public security faculty in Skopje, pointed out that this is a complex problem, after the system essentially based on the political police, known in the past as the "militia," broke down. According to him, this system favored the police and the state authorities and institutions and implemented its policy mainly with their help. With the breakdown of socialism, Dr. Tozi points out, our police made a serious attempt at changing itself. The way things are now, however, it is totally unable to get rid of politics. Those in power who openly claim that they absolutely oppose the politicizing of the police are engaged in a political farce, for, according to our interlocutor, the ruling party or class cannot implement any one of its objectives without having any influence on the police or in the army. It is the general rule for countries in a state of transition that the first battle for power leads the parties to concentrate on taking over the police. This is taking place in our country as well, Tozi claims, in the course of which several scandals or events emerge. This is a classical effort on the part of some parties to take over the field of internal affairs. In his view, one of the clearest examples of this was the conversion of a high police official to the VMRO-DPMNE. We are familiar with other types of deals and even with the skillfully created crisis by the government among the coalition parties themselves in putting their own people in leading positions in the police, as was the case of the conflict between the LP and the SDSM. Some parties insisted on having their own people in key positions within the ministry, such as deputy secretary or assistant. All of this, as Dr. Djoko Tozi insists, is the result of a still undefined type of society and undefined relations within the parties and their programs, and the fact that they are still in the phase of structuring and developing their social base. Within such an undefined status of the parties and an overall lack of stability, it is normal to strengthen the role of the police. That is why there is no scandal, affair, or case, according to our interlocutor, in which the police are not directly or indirectly involved. All it takes is to look at the "Tavern," "Blue Bird," "Kuklis," "Radovis," and others, according to Tozi, characterized by the fact that politics is the most important of their features. These are, first of all, political, and only then police cases, categorically claims the professor at the security faculty. Considering that the purpose of the MVR is, above all, to protect the interests of the citizens, these examples clearly prove that they are working as a function of politics. Most simply stated, we are facing a political struggle for power within the police which, according to Tozi, as a rule protects those who are in power. Today the political police are not all that obvious, and it cannot be as it was in the period when all had to think alike, although, generally speaking, we cannot say that we have a depoliticized police, Tozi stresses. Its framework from the past remains and this is quite evident, Dr. Djoko Tozi and others said. The Issue of Objective Factors According to Dr. Borce Davitkovski, docent at the School of Law in Skopje, several reasons contribute to the strengthening of the authoritative or repressive agencies of the state, most noteworthy among which are the police and the army. To begin with, the aspects and trends of authoritarian and repressive rule and behavior, familiar over the past 45 years of development of Macedonia, have still not disappeared. According to Davitkovski, in addition to these agencies this may be seen in all other political factors, for there is a constant search of traitors to the people and the state or else of enemies of the Macedonian cause. These are recurrences of the old system and in this case it is more a question of a mentality or a way of behaving. I claim that in the next 50 years as well this will be reflected also in the attitude of the administrative authorities and the other activists, our interlocutor insists. The second reason, according to Davitkovski, is the factor that there is no true opposition in Macedonia, which in the present parliamentary structure would be realistic, and would act as a real shock absorber of the current political powers. On the contrary, Davitkovski categorically claims that we have a so-called double opposition: one within the parliament, which itself holds an inferior position, and a second within the government, which manifests itself only when it deems suitable. Such major factors provide a particularly fertile soil for strengthening the role of the police. The third and perhaps most important reason is the fact that in Macedonia there still has been no operational definition of the constitutional stipulation governing the division of powers. No amortization instruments between the legislative, executive, and judiciary have been provided for. Even within the executive authorities, Dr. Davitkovski says, no laws govern relations among its agencies. Taking into consideration the fact that no law has yet been passed on the administration of the state, the administrative authorities and the police work on the basis of rules of the past, based on the principle of the unity of power and not its separation, the logical result of which is the domination of the executive over the legislative authority and, within this framework, the domination of the state organs, including the police. Adding to this the fact that the judiciary, which relies on the police, has still not been structured, that same police assume a dominant position and objectively are in a position of being in charge of matters outside their jurisdiction, Dr. Davitkovski says. The fourth major reason, in his view, which objectively determines the superiority of the police over the other social areas, is the process of their internal depoliticization. The people who work in the MVR, Davitkovski stresses, have been trained on the basis of a different system and a different way of acting. Therefore, they cannot lose overnight their way of thinking and acting. This will take a long time, along with the democratic evolution of the entire society. The fact in which the views of Dr. Djoko Tozi and Dr. Borce Davitkovski coincide is the basic concept on the appearance, organization, shape, and way of work of the depoliticized police. This, according to them, means establishing the principle of absolute professionalism in the work of that body. [Box, p 16] Dr. Djoko Tozi, Professor at the Public Security Faculty in Skopje There Still Is Fear of the Police A specific situation has developed in Macedonia. The police, which at the time of the withdrawal of the former Yugoslav People's Army were the only armed Macedonian component following the independence of the state, were also one of the most privileged institutions. As the only organized force during what may have been the most critical period for Macedonia, the police acquired great authority and a high reputation. However, after the proclamation of independence of the state and the restoration of pluralism, and the numerous political-police affairs and scandals, once again the ordinary people experienced the old fear and mistrust of the police. A most common example is the following: Three weeks ago, in a television debate with the minister of internal affairs, the greatest number of viewers who asked questions insisted on remaining anonymous. What does this prove? Is this not an example of the reservation which the people still feel when it comes to the police? That is why I claim that the restoration of reciprocal trust is a duty, a historical process of the depoliticization of the police. [Box, p 16] Dr. Borce Davitkovski, Docent, Law School in Skopje A Democratic Police Acts Automatically Let us take France as an example. In that country the minister of police may be a socialist, a communist, a Christian Democrat, a fascist, or a neofascist. To the police itself this is not all that important, for the police know their work: to protect the constitutional and legal order in France and the human rights and freedoms. Regardless of whether communists or fascists are demonstrating, the police stand aside. However, the moment the demonstrators threaten private property or the safety of the citizens, break a shop window, or beat up a passerby, the police act mercilessly. This is automatic. The police are not interested in whether the demonstrators may be ideologically supporters of their minister. That is precisely why we must see to it that our police are properly trained, expert, and professional with clearly defined obligations. Unfortunately, we are still waiting for this.
