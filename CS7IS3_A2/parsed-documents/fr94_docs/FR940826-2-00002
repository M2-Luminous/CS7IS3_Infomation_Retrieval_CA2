FR940826-2-00002 FR940826-2-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service Information About Filing Fees For Reparation Complaints Under The Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This document gives notice to the public of the requirement that filing fees and handling fees be paid when informal and formal reparation complaints are filed under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA), as required by the enactment of Public Law 103&hyph;276. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: J.R. Frazier, Assistant Chief, PACA Branch, USDA, AMS, F&V Division, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2095&hyph;So. Bldg., Washington, D.C., 20090&hyph;6456, 202&hyph;720&hyph;4180. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Public Law 103&hyph;276, signed by President Clinton on July 5, 1994, requires a filing fee of $60 for each informal complaint, and a handling fee of $300 for each formal complaint filed under Section 6(a) of the PACA (7 U.S.C. 499f(a)) during fiscal years 1995 and 1996. Therefore, a $60 fee must accompany each informal complaint filed on or after October 1, 1994, through September 30, 1996, before it will be considered a valid complaint, processed, and investigated by the agency. Informal complaints received without the fee will not toll the nine-month statute of limitations set by Section 6(a) (7 U.S.C. 499f(a)). Pursuant to 7 CFR 47.3 of the Rules of Practice under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930, upon receipt of the informal complaint and the filing fee, the Director of the Fruit and Vegetable Division of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) will cause such an investigation to be made as, in his or her opinion, is justified by the facts. If such investigation reveals that no violation of the act has occurred, no further action shall be taken and the person filing the informal complaint shall be so informed. In the alternative, pursuant to 7 CFR ยง47.3(b)(2), the Director may attempt to effect an amicable or informal adjustment of the matter. If this attempt fails, the complainant may elect to proceed with a formal complaint pursuant to 7 CFR 47.6. In addition to the filing fee, the complainant must submit a handling fee of $300 at the time of filing a formal complaint. A copy of the formal complaint will not be served on the respondent until the $300 handling fee is paid. Counterclaims filed under the PACA are considered new formal complaints and must be accompanied by the $300 handling fee before they will be considered filed and served on the opposing party. In determining the amount of damages incurred by an injured party, the Secretary will include the amount of the handling fee as additional damages. All payment instruments for fees shall be made payable to the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and shall be deposited by the Agency into the account of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act Fund. Filing of both informal and formal complaints will continue to be accomplished by providing the informal or formal complaint, accompanied by the appropriate fee, to the Director of the Fruit and Vegetable Division of the AMS as prescribed in 7 CFR ยง47.3 and ยง47.6 of the Rules of Practice under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. Delivery of the complaint and fee to a regional office of the PACA Branch of the Fruit and Vegetable Division is deemed to be delivery to the Director of the Fruit and Vegetable Division. If a payment instrument is dishonored, the complainant will be allowed seven days to replace it with a cashier's check or a certified check or the complaint proceedings will be terminated. Dated: August 22, 1994. Kenneth C. Clayton, Acting Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21089 Filed 8&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P
