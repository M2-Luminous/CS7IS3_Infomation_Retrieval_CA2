The flag consists of six colors: red, green, blue, white, black, and yellow, and is in the form of a green letter Y lying on its side. The two short legs of the Y are on the left hand side of the flag with the space between them colored black. The Y is surrounded by a yellow band. The top section of the flag is red and the bottom part blue. The ANC's [African National Congress] chief negotiator, Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, said the choice of a design had been an earnest attempt to promote unity and reconciliation. The TEC decided that the Call of South Africa and Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika [God Bless Africa] would both serve as national anthems during the transitional period.
