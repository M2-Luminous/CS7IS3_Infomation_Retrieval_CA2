An important reason is that no bankruptcy mechanism has been established. As a result, enterprises which should go out of business are still operating, enterprises which should be invigorated cannot be invigorated, and factors of production which should be reorganized remain stagnant, all causing idleness and a waste of resources and hampering the improvement of overall economic returns. To escape this predicament, there is a need to establish a bankruptcy mechanism which conforms with the socialist market economy so that the suitable survive, the inferior disappear, and the superior develop. This will help ensure the rational allocation of resources and promote healthy economic development. For this reason, LIAOWANG has invited three academics from the State Economic and Trade Commission who have participated in revising the Bankruptcy Law to express their views from different angles. Their views are full of insights and are thus worth reading. [End editor's note] Present Situation and Difficulties Should Be Clearly Acknowledged-- by Di Na [3695 1226] According to incomplete statistics, all levels of people's courts have handled 948 bankruptcy cases since the formal implementation of the Bankruptcy Law on 1 November 1988. Of this, enterprise bankruptcy cases handled in the last three years account for 86.36 percent, standing at 818. This development trend indicates that the old structure's role is gradually weakening in harboring old enterprises and that a bankruptcy and elimination mechanism which corresponds with the demand of the market economy is taking shape. Its main characters are as follows: Bankrupt Large- and Medium-Sized State Enterprises Are Increasing Surveys in Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Sichuan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces suggest that there have been medium-sized state enterprise bankruptcy cases in these provinces. These bankrupt enterprises' assets exceed 10 million yuan each and the ratio between their assets and liabilities is 1:2.5 or 1:3.63. The asset liquidation rate is over 40 percent in the three southern provinces but is a little lower in northeast China. Each of these enterprises has more than 1,000 employees and the largest has almost 3,000; retired personnel account for more than 20 percent of the total number of employees and the highest was 43.13 percent. Following the increased reform impetus, large and medium-sized state enterprises which have incurred losses for a long time and do not have much hope of survival are beginning to go bankrupt. Unlike small collective enterprises, whose bankruptcy only has a superficial bearing, the bankruptcy of large- and medium-sized state enterprises involves structural adjustments, asset allocations, debt repayments, employment, social relief, and other problems of a more profound and extensive nature, such as the strict implementation of policies. Obviously, there are more problems in handling these bankruptcy cases. In Most Cases Debtors Apply for Bankruptcy The Bankruptcy Law provides that both creditors and debtors may apply for bankruptcy. But a survey indicates that almost all bankruptcy cases are filed by debtors. This suggests that the debtors have improved their understanding of protecting their legitimate rights and interests by legal means. Comparatively speaking, because enterprises lack the necessary covert system, it is difficult for creditors (except for banks) to know an enterprise's credit situation, so they do not know how their rights and interests have been damaged. In addition, because the liquidation rate of bankrupt enterprises is unlikely to reach 100 percent, creditors are generally unwilling to apply for bankruptcy. Subjectively and objectively, this has reduced the possibility of creditors applying for bankruptcy. To provide legal protection for creditors, it is imperative to establish an enterprise bankruptcy warning system. The Greatest Creditors Are Banks As "fund allocations have been replaced by loans," enterprises' funds mainly come from bank loans, thus banks have become the biggest creditors. Since the introduction of banking system reform, specialized banks have become commercialized and are assuming sole responsibility for profits and losses, as financial enterprises operate. Therefore, banks themselves will also face the problem of removing their burdens. According to an estimate by the state specialized banks, of 2,400 billion yuan in credit funds, almost 400 billion is dormant, accounting for 16.7 percent. About 60 to 70 percent of bank credit funds come from citizens' deposits. If losses are too serious, this will affect the banks' reputation and even endanger social stability. Therefore, a policy must be cautiously worked out in full consideration of the banks' capacity. Moreover, the introduction of bankruptcy will help the banks to free themselves from their predicament and reduce losses to a minimum. In this sense, bankruptcy also serves as a kind of protection for creditors and is a practical choice for banks to protect their legitimate rights and interests. In addition, in raising funds through various channels, some enterprises have opened accounts with many banks and engaged in duplicate mortgaging; the department in charge of enterprises instructs some enterprises with a good reputation to act as sponsors for enterprises with a bad reputation to obtain bank loans, or otherwise the department itself acts a sponsor, causing a number of bankruptcy cases to be linked to sponsorship. Obviously, it is imperative to improve the relevant mortgage and sponsorship policies in implementing the Bankruptcy Law. When an Enterprise Announces Bankruptcy, the Government Is Ready To "Pick Up the Corpse" An enterprise should abide by the law when announcing its bankruptcy, but in the current situation it is difficult to fully abide by the law. Therefore it is often the case that "bankruptcy is combined with merging." Namely, before an enterprise announces its bankruptcy, the government will appoint another enterprise to merge with or buy it, and all levels of courts have taken this as a precondition in handling bankruptcy cases. A survey indicated that assets under bankruptcy are hard to enliven and even harder to convert into cash. No one cares about buying a bankrupt enterprise's special equipment, big buyers are not willing to buy its general-purpose equipment, and small buyers cannot afford this equipment, so it becomes a scrap of iron if dismantled, and banks find it difficult to assess prices. A bankrupt enterprise sets prices for its factories and equipment and asks a bank to accept them in kind, but existing policies do not allow the bank to deal in these factories and equipment. If the bank wants to authorize a company to deal in these factories and equipment, no go-between is available ; if it wants to auction them off, there is no auction center. Finally, the government has no alternative but to buy them. In providing jobs for employees of bankrupt enterprises, most local governments are still acting as "mothers." Providing jobs for bankrupt enterprises' employees is carried out administrative means: Either the government assigns these employees to other enterprises or the department in charge and the labor (insurance) department share the responsibility to provide jobs to these employees. On this issue, local governments do not know what to decide: If they assign these employees to other enterprises, this will trample on those enterprises' autonomy in recruiting employees and goes against the Regulations on Transforming State-Owned Enterprises' Operational Mechanisms. If they do not assign the employees, they will ask mayors for help, because the labor force market is not yet mature. The situation is a little better in South China, where many city or prefectural authorities convert assets under bankruptcy into cash and provide each employee with 15,000 to 20,000 yuan if they want to look for a job themselves. If there is an enterprise willing to accept the employee, money will be provided to the recipient enterprise. A survey indicates that more than 90 percent of such employees are willing to accept this method. Practicing bankruptcy and establishing a bankruptcy mechanism are important issues which are inevitable in the course of deepening reform and forming a modern enterprise system. However, viewing the current bankruptcy situation, it is quite hard to practice bankruptcy and form a bankruptcy mechanism. Policy research on bankruptcy should be aimed at the following four points: First, relief for employees and their job arrangements. Providing relief for employees and rearranging jobs for them are the most difficult problems state-owned enterprises face after bankruptcy. Recently, the government pointed out that after an enterprise announces bankruptcy, the money derived from asset transfers and auctions should first be used for employee severance pay, transfers to other jobs, training, and basic livelihood. Transferring and auctioning assets will help resolve relief funds for employees after bankruptcy. Practice has proven that the government cannot wholly take care of a bankrupt enterprises' employees. These employees should be given jobs in a decentralized way in accordance with the "Regulations on Placement Arrangements for State Enterprises' Surplus Staff Members and Workers." Namely, surplus employees should be treated as job-awaiting personnel according to society's capacity. During the job-awaiting period, they are entitled to job-awaiting insurance, and if this is not possible, cash converted from the bankrupt enterprise's assets should be used for placement arrangements. To reduce repercussions in society, the department in charge will be responsible for providing relief and making placement arrangements for a bankrupt enterprise's employees before the social insurance system is improved. Many methods can be used to resolve the reemployment problem of bankrupt enterprise's employees, such as transferring them in an organized way, allowing them to participate in overseas labor service, recommending them to other enterprises, providing for themselves by engaging in production, and looking for jobs by themselves. Second, definition of a bankrupt enterprise assets. Whether or not a bankrupt enterprise's land, welfare facilities, and employee-raised funds should be listed as assets under bankruptcy is an important question. When an old state enterprise goes bankrupt, the net value of its fixed assets is very low, what is valuable is generally its land. Whether or not its land should be listed as an asset under bankruptcy can be determined by how the land was obtained. To put it more specifically, if the land utility rights were obtained by compensatory means, the land should be listed as an asset under bankruptcy; if not, the land should in principle not be listed as an asset under bankruptcy but should be returned to the government to encourage other units to buy the whole bankrupt enterprise. The bankrupt enterprise's schools, kindergartens, employees' dormitories, and other welfare facilities should in principle not be listed as assets under bankruptcy. These schools and kindergartens will be recovered by the government after being converted into cash, dormitories should be sold to individuals or housing departments to clearly separate management from ownership, employees involved in fund raising will be reimbursed as creditors or shareholders. Third, mortgaging assets under bankruptcy and converting them into cash. Many enterprises have mortgaged their assets as security to obtain bank loans. The Bankruptcy Law provides that "assets mortgaged as security do not fall into the category of assets under bankruptcy." Therefore many localities have pointed out that if the bank does not give up its priority entitlement to compensation, the enterprise actually has nothing to declare bankrupt for. A survey indicates that the mortgage rate of many bankrupt enterprises' fixed assets is as high as 100 percent. When an enterprise faces bankruptcy, it may not be able to pay bankruptcy expenses because it lacks adequate assets to pay. This is a difficult problem to resolve in practicing bankruptcy. In addition, some bankrupt enterprises are located in remote regions and their utility is low. It is hard to convert their assets and land utility rights into cash. Fourth, sponsor-related responsibility. How to handle sponsor-related bankruptcies is another problem in practicing the Bankruptcy Law. Because the practice of sponsorship is not standardized, in particular administrative sponsorship is quite common, we should consider classifying sponsors' debt repayment obligations. 1) Administrative sponsorship provided after the promulgation of the State Council Office's "Circular on Banning Administrative Institutions From Acting as Sponsors in Economic Activities" on 23 February 1993 must all be nullified. 2) A unit acting as an administrative sponsor which has become a legal person entity is responsible for the loan repayments it has committed to. 3) If a unit acting as an administrative sponsor and which remains an administrative institution cannot afford the loan repayments it has committed to, a financial department will repay the loan or, if necessary, money will be deducted from the institution's wages and administrative expenditure as punishment. Removing Ideological Obstacles--by Zhang Delin (1728 1795 7207) Since the introduction of reform and opening up, many people have gradually improved their concept about bankruptcy. On 2 December 1986, the National People's Congress Standing Committee formally ratified the "PRC Enterprise Bankruptcy Law (for trial implementation), which came into force on 1 November 1988. But so far, the bankruptcy concept has not taken deep root in people's minds and no bankruptcy mechanism has been established. There are many reasons, but for now it is important to remove ideological obstacles. Bankruptcy Is Not a "Unique Practice Under Private Ownership" For a long period we have linked bankruptcy to the nature of ownership and have regarded bankruptcy as an inevitable product and even a unique economic phenomenon of private ownership or the capitalist system and that it has absolutely nothing to do with the socialist system. As a matter of fact, bankruptcy is an inevitable product of competition under commodity economic conditions; whenever there is commodity production and commodity exchange, bankruptcy will occur in the course of this production and exchange. Bankruptcy is linked to the commodity economy and its relevant competition system, not to the nature of ownership. China is establishing a socialist market economic structure. Bankruptcy and the need to establish a relevant bankruptcy system are the demands of a market economy. The problem now is not whether or not bankruptcy and the establishment of a bankruptcy system are necessary but how to practice bankruptcy and establish a bankruptcy system which conforms with reform targets and current national conditions. Practicing Bankruptcy and Establishing the Bankruptcy System Are Positively Significant Theory and practice in a modern market economy have proved that a competitive market economic structure is the most efficient mechanism and system for resource disposition in the modern human society. Bankruptcy is an outcome of competition and is also the beginning of a new round of competition. Generally speaking, a bankrupt enterprise is an enterprise with improper management and administration which is falling behind and should be eliminated. Allowing the deserving to survive, eliminating the inferior, and developing the superior is where the vitality of economic development lies and is also a symbol of social progress. Therefore practicing bankruptcy and establishing a relevant bankruptcy system have important bearings on deepening state enterprise reform, on forming a modernized enterprise system, on establishing a competition mechanism, and on optimizing the allocation of social resources. Practicing Bankruptcy and Establishing a Bankruptcy System Are Needed To Establish a Modern Enterprise System A review of state-owned enterprises' operations in China suggests that only a small number of them are operating normally, quite a few of them lack vitality and operate with low efficiency, and some even find it hard to continue operations. How should these state-owned enterprises free themselves from their predicament? In terms of target formula, there is a need to establish a modern enterprise system. In other words, there is a need to establish an enterprise legal person system which corresponds with a modern market economy and large-scale socialized production, a limited liability system, and a relevant organizational system and management system. In terms of implementation measures and detailed methods, the process of introducing a new enterprise asset system as well as its responsibility, organization, and management systems is a process of establishing a bankruptcy system. Loss-incurring state enterprises should have their assets reorganized and systems updated through bankruptcy. In this sense, the process of reforming state enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system is also a process of establishing a bankruptcy system. In other words, without bankruptcy and a relevant bankruptcy system, it will be very hard to establish a competitive microfoundation or macromanagement structure. Bankruptcy Is an Economic Activity in the Course of Competition and Is Also a Legal Activity Which Proceeds in Strict Accordance With Law In a sense, the process of practicing bankruptcy and establishing a bankruptcy system is a process of formulating a relevant legal system. Therefore, to promote the establishment of a bankruptcy system in China, a bankruptcy law should be formulated which conforms with national conditions. China already has a bankruptcy law for trial implementation, but it takes the "planned commodity economy" as its structural objective. Therefore, it is imperative to revise this bankruptcy law by taking the socialist market economy as its structural objective. Apart from observing laws of the market economy in general and absorbing and referring to foreign countries' successful experiences and practice in legislation, we must base ourselves on national conditions in revising the Bankruptcy Law. The bankruptcy system has gradually taken shape in foreign countries in the course of free competition. This is not entirely the same as China's background and economic environment in which its bankruptcy system is being formed. In pronouncing state enterprises' bankruptcies, we are facing knotty problems such as how to distinguish between management and ownership, how to straighten out the relation between creditors and debtors, and how to establish an unemployment and social insurance system. The settlement of these problems requires the Bankruptcy Law to provide general stipulations and our formulation of detailed methods and procedures. In addition, because many state-owned enterprises face or are engaged in bankruptcy, it is necessary, in the course of practicing bankruptcy and through trial implementation, to gradually form a bankruptcy system which conforms with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and national conditions and which also converges with international practice. Ensuring the Establishment and Operation a Bankruptcy Mechanism by Legal Means--by Zheng Yang [6774 2799] The nucleus of the bankruptcy system is that an enterprise is entitled to a legal person's property and independent operational rights; more importantly, it is required to undertake operational risks and perform its social responsibility. For this reason, we should strengthen the legal concept, learn how to apply the Bankruptcy Law, promote and ensure fair competition between enterprises, and develop the superior and eliminate the inferior to maintain good market economic order. Efforts should also be made in the following three aspects: In Legislation: Bankruptcy Legislation Should Be Strengthened Along With the Improvement of the Bankruptcy System A bankruptcy law is the general way of legally standardizing bankruptcy procedures and adjusting bankrupt enterprises' legal relations. A bankruptcy law is quite important to deepening China's enterprise reform, protecting creditors' and debtors' legitimate rights and interests, and establishing a socialist market economic structure. The existing bankruptcy law in China is the "PRC Enterprise Bankruptcy Law (for trial implementation)" promulgated on 2 December 1986 and formally implemented on 1 November 1988. At that time, it portrayed enterprise reform as well as social and economic development, but the situation has changed and many new problems have arisen since. In practice, we have not effectively enforced the Bankruptcy Law, nor has our efficiency been high in handling bankruptcy cases. This has seriously affected our efforts to protect creditors' and debtors' rights and interests. Therefore in this new situation, it is imperative to formulate a new bankruptcy law suitable for all enterprise legal persons, to comprehensively clarify the legal aim and basic principles of this new law, and to provide stipulations on creditors' rights and creditors panels, assets under bankruptcy and their management, bankruptcy documents and applications, handling of bankruptcies, court jurisdiction, conciliation and rectification, bankruptcy pronouncements, bankruptcy liquidation, and legal responsibility. This will enable the new bankruptcy law to conform with socialist market economic development, to fully refer to and absorb the essence of foreign bankruptcy laws, to converge and coordinate with international practice, and to effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of creditors and debtors. To properly implement the new bankruptcy law and fulfill the expected targets, detailed implementation regulations should be announced as soon as possible after the promulgation of the new bankruptcy law so as to strengthen this new law's practicality and integrity. In the meantime, the social insurance system should be improved along with its legislation. The social insurance system basically comprises these five aspects: social relief, social insurance, social welfare, social assistance, and medical care. In connection with this, there are five legal provisions, including providing material relief for staff members and workers who have special difficulties; the raising and use of social insurance funds (such as providing relief for elderly people, patients, unemployed people, and so on); and legal responsibility. These legal provisions will help maintain social stability and fairness and are indispensable to the market economy. Propaganda and Education: Propaganda and Education on Bankruptcy Law Should be Strengthened and the Concept About Bankruptcy Should Be Improved Due to the prolonged influence of the planned economy, many people have belittled the role of the bankruptcy system and some do not even know what bankruptcy and the Bankruptcy Law are. Therefore, bankruptcy legal knowledge should be popularized and propagated so that the concept of bankruptcy and elimination will take deep root in the people's minds. In this case, everyone will be able to reduce their mental obstacles to understanding enterprise bankruptcy, improve their concepts of bankruptcy, take precautions against bankruptcy, and prevent the emergence of bankruptcy. Thus enterprise operators and employees are required to have a sense of crisis or a concept about bankruptcy so that enterprises will move ahead with enterprising spirit, improve their management, produce better economic results, strengthen their ability and adaptability in the course of competition, and prevent themselves from going bankrupt. In addition, when there is an application for bankruptcy, the relevant department should try to reach a conciliatory agreement with creditors so that self-rectification can be carried out for revitalization. In Law Enforcement Bankruptcy Law Must Be Seriously Implemented To Protect Legitimate Rights and Interests The normal operation of the market economy not only relies on legislation but also requires strict law enforcement. In this respect, the most important point is to improve the quality of relevant personnel and foster a number of professionals well versed in handling bankruptcy issues. In the meantime, research into bankruptcy crime must be taken into serious account. Bankruptcy itself is not a crime, but in a bankruptcy case, some debtors infringe on creditors' legitimate rights and interests by illegal and deceptive means. As a result, conciliation or bankruptcy cannot be carried out fairly or smoothly. If the case is serious, it may constitute a criminal offense. A policy should be worked out to deal with it. In short, law enforcement ability should be improved so that the implementation of China's Bankruptcy Law can be secured and actual results achieved.
