This bulletin confirms guarantees stipulated by law for deposits up to 4 million bolivares, an amount that covers all the claims [nominas] these banks have received. Private commercial banks, which will provide the funds to make payments to depositors, have not made a decision yet on the purchasing of bonds to be issued by Fogade. Representatives of the banking sector expressed their surprise yesterday over the government decision to intervene eight financial institutions. During a joint news conference, (Jose Monzi Izquierdo), president of the National Banking Council, and Juan Tomas Santana, president of the National Banking Association, said they do not agree with the decision, because the executive did not inform them. (Izquierdo) asked for justice and fairness for employees and depositors of the intervened banks. Meanwhile, Santana said he does not disagree with the decision to intervene the banks, but he resents not being informed. Representatives of the banking sector reiterated that once they receive the government's explanations on the case, the financial sector will voice its official position. Meanwhile, according to Congress President Eduardo Gomez Tamayo, the executive must give the public extensive explanations on the intervention of these financial institutions. Tamayo has said the prevailing circumstances of this sector are unsavory and alarming, because the fate of depositors has not yet been determined. The Congress president has said the parliamentarian blocs are refining details to discuss constitutional reforms. In another turn of events, the Chilean Government has offered financial counsel to our country to overcome the crisis triggered by the intervention of the eight banks. Chilean President Eduardo Frei has made this offer to his Venezuelan counterpart, Rafael Caldera, who met with Frei to discuss topical issues. The Chilean counsel could help our country a great deal, because Chile experienced a similar financial crisis in 1983, when the military regime intervened five private banks and closed two others. The cost of the Chilean bank intervention amounted to up to $4 billion-worth of subsidies. These five banks owe $3.5 billion to the Chilean Central Bank.
