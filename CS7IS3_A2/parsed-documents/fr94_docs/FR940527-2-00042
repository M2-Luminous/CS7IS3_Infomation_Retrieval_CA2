FR940527-2-00042 FR940527-2-00038 [Project Nos. 2396, 2397, 2399, and 2400&hyph;001_Vermont] Central Vermont Public Service Corporation; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment May 23, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the applications for subsequent license for the constructed and operating Pierce Mills, Arnold Falls, Gage, and Passumpsic projects, located on the Passumpsic River in Caledonia County, Vermont, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the four projects. In the DEA, the Commission's staff evaluates the potential environmental impacts that would result from the continued operation of the projects and concludes that relicensing the projects with appropriate enhancement measures would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Any comments should be filed within 45 days from the data of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix Project No. 2608 to all comments. For further information, please contact Jim Haimes, Environmental Coordinator, at (202) 219&hyph;2780. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
