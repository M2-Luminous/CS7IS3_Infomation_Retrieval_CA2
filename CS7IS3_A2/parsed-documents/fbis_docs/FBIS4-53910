The deputy prime minister said that the Central Bank now has assets of more than 100 billion ringgit and that its international reserves have risen to 90 billion ringgit. According to Anwar, this is the first time in the history of the Central Bank that assets and international reserves have reached such a strong position. He said the international reserves can cover the country's imports for eight months. Anwar, who is also minister of finance, defended the Central Bank's reputation before the House of Representatives in response to criticism by opposition chief Lim Kit Siang, who had submitted an emergency motion concerning the 5.7-billion-ringgit loss sustained by the Central Bank in foreign currency transactions last year. In 1992, the Central Bank also lost 9.3 billion ringgit in foreign exchange transactions. House of Representatives Speaker Tan Sri Zahir Ismail permitted Kit Siang's motion to be discussed for one hour beginning at 1730 hours. The DAP [Democratic Action Party] leader was permitted to speak for 30 minutes, and Anwar, as representative of the government, was also allocated 30 minutes for discussion. "Seeing that this motion concerns a specific subject, is in the public interest, requires haste, and falls under Standing Orders 18(3), I permit this motion to be discussed," Zahir said, which was received with desk slapping by the other opposition members. In presenting the motion, Lim said the minister of finance needs to explain this matter (the losses), seeing that the minister last year gave a guarantee to Parliament that he himself would examine the Central Bank's foreign exchange transactions. In discussing the motion, Anwar said that are only five central banks in the developing countries that can compete with the performance of the Malaysian Central Bank. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also acknowledges the strong position of the Central Bank. "Our international reserves are almost twice as large as the foreign debt," he said. In fact, Anwar said, the Central's Bank's performance is much better than when it was under previous finance ministers, such as in the days of Tun Tan Siew Sin and Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. "In 1967, when Tan was minister of finance, all of the Central Bank's international reserves disappeared in a moment when the British Government revalued the pound sterling. "When Tengku Razaleigh managed the country's finances between 1981 and 1984, the Central Bank suffered a loss of 9.5 billion ringgit in supporting the value of the ringgit 'to protect its image.' "No commotion was made over those losses, however," Anwar said. The deputy prime minister said that compared with Central Bank management in the past, the present Central Bank management is more honest and responsible. "I could describe all the faults that the Honorable Lim Kit Siang sees in me," Anwar said, to which government supporters responded by slapping their desks. Although the Central Bank is a part of the government, he said, the principle of the independence of the Central Bank is unshakable. "The government and the minister of finance set a framework of policy, but daily management for achieving those policy objectives is the authority of the Central Bank," he explained. Anwar guaranteed that the Malaysian Central Bank will no longer be involved in any foreign currency exchange transactions. He said he had directed that such transactions be stopped as soon as it was learned in the middle of last year that losses had been suffered in those transactions. "Since then, the Central Bank has gradually terminated all forward positions it took in transactions in 1992 and early 1993. "Since then, there have been no futures market currency transactions by the Central Bank," he said. The losses caused Central Bank Governor Tan Sri Jaffar Hussein to resign his post and take early retirement. Jaffar resigned on 31 March and acknowledged that the losses were his fault. Anwar said that although he was willing to accept criticism in connection with Central Bank losses and Jaffar's resignation, such criticism must be fair. All parties must acknowledge the strength of the bank's financial position. "I do not intend to defend existing weaknesses, but to reject and denigrate the Central Bank is absolutely unfair," he said. As for Jaffar's situation, Anwar said he was a successful Central Bank governor and was respected in the region and throughout the world. "His services and contributions were great and significant, but he steadfastly agreed with the principle of responsibility. "In fact, he had asked to resign when the 9.3-billion-ringgit losses were announced last year, but I rejected it because I felt Jaffar needed to resolve the problem first. "If he had resigned at that time, the new governor would have been forced to make a new report on the losses, and that would clearly have complicated the matter," he said.
