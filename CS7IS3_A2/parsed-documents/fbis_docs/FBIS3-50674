Referring to the National Police, Ruben Dario Carles said that 75 percent of its members are still the same as during the past regime, a situation that should have instituted a purge. He added that the task the Police Academy is performing must be encouraged. In addition, Carles believes that it would take an entire afternoon, if one were to decide to prepare a list, to establish the exact number of government workers who claim to work despite low productivity levels. The Morena presidential candidate said that during the next few days the other political parties that support his candidacy will make their respective announcements. Carles also said that he is unaware of what direction the parties that make up the ADOC [Civic Democratic Opposition Alliance] will follow. According to Carles, "I do not know where they are headed, but I do know I am going straight ahead." Upon arriving in Chiriqui, the Morena candidate was cheered by a numerous crowd of well-wishers during his tour along 3 November Avenue, the main commercial street in the City of David.
