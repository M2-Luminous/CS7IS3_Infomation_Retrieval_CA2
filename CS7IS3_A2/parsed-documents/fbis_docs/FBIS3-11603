We raised our weapons and our faces to tell the usurping government that we are tired of so many lies. They have sold us a big farce all these years. Now they want to crown it with a humiliating peace. We don't want it; we have known that peace for over 500 years. We know what it costs and the scant benefits it reaps for our territory and our people. Those who were never here now want to come to our mountain, to buy us with handouts in exchange for leaving our brothers of other lands and colors. They want to buy our struggle and our blood with remnants of justice, handouts of liberty, and promises of democracy. We want to greet you, we the smaller and faceless ones, we want to ask that since you are there in front of the arrogant palace of the usurper and the bad government, to please tell them that the Zapatists do not sell themselves. The Zapatists do not betray anyone and do not surrender. Explain what it is to be a Zapatist to the bad government. Clear up their doubts; cry out with us to tell all the truths; take up our voice, brothers, to speak to all Mexicans. Tell them that to our will for peace the supreme government responds with war signals, that it raises lies to our truths, that it continues to arrest us unfairly, that it continues to fill its prisons with Indians, that bloodletting continues in our territory. Brothers, the government lies! It continues its war against our cause. The whiteness of their hands is false, because it is stained with the blood of our brothers. Indian brothers of these Mexican lands, poor peasants who are rich in honor and dignity, accept this step of ours so far from the cities and laurels, receive our greetings, fill your hearts with our song. Hear us brothers, we speak from the mountains. Take your voices to those who have nothing. Let all of the Mexican territory rise up. Greetings, brothers of CEOIC! Greetings, Indian brothers! Greetings, Mexican brothers! Liberty! Justice! Democracy! Respectfully, from southeastern Mexico, the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command of the EZLN. Mexico, March 1994. [Signed] Rebel Subcommander Marcos
