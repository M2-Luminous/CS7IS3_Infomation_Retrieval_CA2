Enough of all the talk, election promises, and verbal attacks. It's time to vote. But when super election year 1994 kicks off on 13 March with the Lower Saxon Landtag election, the parties will leave their starting blocks on a very unequal basis. What is certain is that only the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] has been able to maneuver itself into a favorable starting position. But only because the Republikaner, following a good start, have gone into a tailspin, and the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/ Christian Social Union], as well as the Alliance 90/Greens, are almost still in their starting blocks. At a time when the importance of fundamental party concepts for deciding the outcome of elections is declining, when confidence in authority has been lost, when CDU and SPD become interchangeable, and the percentage of hard-core voters who will remain loyal to a particular party is dropping, likableness and the political climate take on additional significance. The party on top, prestigewise, suddenly seems to be in much better shape than would follow from its share of the voters. Personal Liking Will Be Decisive Particularly the easily influenced, politically disinterested, and indecisive voters base their decision on the form of the day. As many as 5 percentage points of votes gained or lost can easily be the result of the political mood. And this mood is, if anything, favorable for the SPD at the moment, while being unfavorable for the governing coalition in Bonn. Forty-nine percent of those polled see Scharping's party [the SPD] in front in February 1994, only 18 percent the CDU/CSU. The approval rate of the Republikaner has clearly gone down. Prior to the onset of the election marathon, Schoenhuber's amorphous scare slogans become ever less entrancing. The FDP [Free Democratic Party], but also the Alliance 90/Greens, have been fighting a headwind for some time already. The state of low esteem of the Union parties has now lasted almost three years. Scharping, on the other hand, following the loss of esteem caused by the Engholm resignation, has gradually brought his party back to smoother waters. But the SPD's passable form of the day still seems to be based more on the contrast that it presents to the mistakes of the Union than on the high esteem in which the opposition party in Bonn is held. Only a little less than half the people entitled to vote (46 percent) consider it capable of taking over the government. A majority (55 percent) is still dissatisfied with the challengers. All signs seem to point to a basic position of the electorate, viz. that he who does nothing also runs no risk of doing anything wrong. That could be risky, however. It took only three months following the 1990 election for the standing of the Union parties to drop into the cellar. The SPD had a similar experience after the Engholm affair, but it recovered just as quickly. Although 63 percent, more than at any time since mid-1991, expect to see a red-green election victory, the SPD, by the time of the election, can still run into difficulties to the extent that the Union parties succeed in demanding that the SPD take a clear position with respect to personalities and its program. Voters Frightened Off It is the coalition question which will most likely become the acid test for the SPD. The majority of voters currently prefer above all the grand coalition which is so highly unpopular in SPD circles. SPD supporters, on the other hand, want a red-green coalition, a model for governing which not even 20 percent of those entitled to vote support. The SPD will preserve its competence for having a decent plan to deal with unemployment, currently the most important political task, only as long as it does not have to give consideration to the probable coalition partner Alliance 90/Greens. Regardless of the SPD's decision in the coalition question, a large number of voters and sympathizers will be frightened off in any case. Change Remains Permanent The more the election takes on the characteristics of a protest election, the greater will be the prospects for success of the little parties. There have been increased indications since February, however, that repudiations of the established parties have decreased in number. More and more people are realizing that many splinter parties have little more to offer than nice-sounding words. Accordingly, the number of nonvoters has been going down continuously since the beginning of the year. At this point, only every tenth German still feels that the Republikaner pursue "democratic" goals. Without a solid voter base in the west, the chances of the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] remain doubtful. Only a party along the lines of the "Instead" [Statt] Party could spring a surprise. But here too the percentage of Germans belonging to the broader circle of sympathizers of this party has declined from 60 to 30 percent. As of the beginning of 1994, only 16 percent of Germans are still dedicated supporters of their party, and, seven months before the Bundestag election, not even 50 percent know yet how they will vote. Against this background, there is still room for migrations of the electorate. For that reason, in election year 1994, the slogan of the political parties at this low point in the political atmosphere is, as never before: Nothing is more permanent than change. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dream Coalitions of the Voters(in percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |CDU/CSU with SPD |26 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |CDU/CSU with FDP |17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |CDU/CSU with the Greens |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |CDU/CSU with Republikaner |2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |SPD with the Greens |19 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |SPD with FDP |12 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |SPD with Republikaner |2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |No answer |18 Source: Emnid | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
