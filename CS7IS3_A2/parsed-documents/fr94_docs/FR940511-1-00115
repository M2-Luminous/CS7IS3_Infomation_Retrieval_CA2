FR940511-1-00115 FR940511-1-00016 Section 3821.3‚ê£Requirement for filing statements of assessment work. This section is amended to add the maintenance fee as a fee payable when complying with annual requirements under part 3820. Subpart 3826_National Park Service Areas. This subpart was also rendered inoperative by the Act of September 28, 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1901 et seq. ), which closed and withdrew from all forms of mineral entry and appropriation all lands and units of the National Park System. The authority for administering the mining claims and sites located within the units prior to September 28, 1976, has been transferred to the National Park Service. Access to and operations upon mining claims and sites located within the units of the National Park System are now governed by 36 CFR part 9, and subpart 3826 would be removed in this rule. Subpart 3827_King Range National Conservation Area. This subpart will be removed because it is duplicated in subpart 3809. It became effective in April 1976 to implement the surface management requirements of the Act of October 21, 1970 (84 Stat. 1070), which established the King Range National Conservation Area. Section 5 of that Act required that all activities occurring pursuant to the General Mining Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq. ) be managed to prevent environmental damage and provide for reclamation. Subsequent to the April 1976 rule, on October 21, 1976, FLPMA was enacted. Section 302(b) of that Act required that all public lands be managed to prevent undue or unnecessary degradation from activities on them, including activities under the General Mining Law of 1872. Section 602 of FLPMA expanded the boundaries of the King Range Conservation Area. Subsequently, regulations were promulgated at 43 CFR subpart 3809 in November 1980 regulating all mining activities on public lands under the administration of the Bureau. These regulations in subpart 3809 duplicate subpart 3827 in form, content, and requirements. Therefore, the regulations in subpart 3827 would be merged with subpart 3809, and subpart 3809 would be amended to include the King Range Conservation Area, under the same criteria as currently apply to the California Desert Conservation Area. Since enactment of FLPMA, the BLM has received no Plans of Operations for mining in the King Range Conservation Area lands. It has been determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The BLM has determined that this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental review pursuant to 516 Departmental Manual, Chapter 2, Appendix 1, Item 1.10, and that the rule will not significantly affect the 10 criteria for exceptions listed in 516 DM 2, Appendix 2. Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1508.4) and environmental policies and procedures of the Department of the Interior, ``categorical exclusions'' means a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and that have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency and for which neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The Department also certifies that this document will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). The fee may represent an economic consideration for a small, marginal operation that does not qualify for an exemption under the rule. However, most small operations would qualify. A small entity that holds a valuable mining claim will not be deterred by the annual fee, and many of them will qualify for an exemption. Most marginal claims were already abandoned in 1993 upon promulgation of the regulations implementing the Act of October 5, 1992. As required by Executive Order 12630, the Department of the Interior has determined that the rule would not cause a taking of private property. The requirement that a modest fee be paid to hold or maintain an existing unpatented mining claim, mill or tunnel site constitutes a reasonable regulatory burden, and it will have no effect on a claimant's possessory interest in or enjoyment of his or her claim or site as long as he or she complies with the requirement. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. The provisions for collection of information contained at 43 CFR parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850, and subpart 3809 have previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned clearance numbers 1004&hyph;0104, 1004&hyph;0110, and 1004&hyph;0114. Information collections for parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850 were consolidated under clearance number 1004&hyph;0114 in the July 15, 1993 rulemaking (58 FR 38186). As this rulemaking removes obsolete or inoperative sections of title 43, Code of Federal Regulations, and extends the previously enacted Act of October 5, 1992, and implementing regulations published on July 15, 1993, this rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
