FR940721-0-00063 FR940721-0-00014 The agency has therefore decided to simply specify that if the U.S./Canada and major foreign source percentages add up to more than 100 percent, the foreign source percentages are proportionately reduced to the extent necessary to bring the percentages down to 100 percent. The U.S./Canada percentage is not changed. The agency believes that this is the more important of the two items of information for consumers, and the method for determining the U.S./Canada percentage, unlike the methodology for major foreign source percentages, is explicitly set forth in the statute. Since section 210 provides a specific methodology for determining the U.S./Canada percentage, the ยง583.7 procedures have the limited purpose of providing a method for calculating the extent to which the remaining percentage is attributable to foreign countries which individually contribute at least 15 percent of the parts content, and the specific percentage attributable to each such foreign country. Given that the U.S. and Canada are treated together in determining the U.S./Canada content, the agency agrees with Ford that they should also be treated together in making determinations under ยง583.7. Beyond that, however, NHTSA believes that since the statute does not specify a particular method for making the country of origin determinations for item two of the label, and given the limited purpose of these determinations, manufacturers should be permitted greater flexibility. The agency is therefore specifying that, in making country of origin determinations for item two of the label only, manufacturers may use the greatest share of value approach or any other approach that is used for customs (U.S. or foreign) purposes, so long as a consistent methodology is employed for all parts and so long as the U.S. and Canada are treated together. NHTSA notes that regardless of what approach a manufacturer selects for making country of origin determinations for item two of the label, it will have no effect on the specified U.S./Canadian content of a carline. Assume, for example, that an outside supplier provides equipment with 65 percent U.S./Canadian content. Under the roll-up, roll-down provision, the equipment is considered 0 percent U.S./Canadian for item one of the label. Under the greatest share of value approach and possibly under other approaches, the equipment would be considered U.S./Canadian for item two of the label. However, this would merely mean that the equipment does not show up in the percentages attributable to Japan, Germany or some other foreign country in the item two calculations; it would never be reflected as U.S./Canadian on the label. NHTSA does not agree with the specific approaches recommended by Ford and Chrysler. The agency believes that both approaches are unnecessarily complicated. The agency also notes that the Ford approach would result in country of origin determinations being made on a very small percentage of value for items with substantial, but less than 70 percent, U.S./Canadian content. 5. Procedure for Determining Country of Origin for Engines and Transmissions (Section 583.8) As discussed in the NPRM, the fourth and fifth items on the label, the countries of origin for the engine and transmission, are also determined separately for each vehicle, instead of on a carline basis. The information needed to make these determinations also needs to come from suppliers. Section 210(f)(12) states that the ``country of origin'' of an engine or transmission is the country that contributed the greatest percentage of dollar value to the engine or transmission, based upon the purchase price of direct materials received at the individual engine or transmission plant. It also states that the U.S. and Canada are to be treated separately for determining the country of origin. Thus, the country of origin might be the U.S. or Canada, but could not be U.S./Canada. NHTSA explained in the NPRM that the term ``direct materials'' is not defined in section 210 of the Cost Savings Act. The agency referred to similar terms in the CFTA to assist it in defining the term, and tentatively concluded that the term ``direct materials'' refers to the items (i.e., the materials) that make up the final good (either an engine or a transmission), but does not include the ``costs'' (i.e., items such as labor) that go into assembling the final good. Those ``costs'' are not ``materials.'' Further, they are not ``received at the individual engine or transmission plants.'' (Emphasis added.) NHTSA therefore concluded that, in calculating the country of origin for engines and transmissions, the country to which the engine or transmission is attributed is that country in which the greatest percentage by value was added, based on the purchase price of all equipment that makes up the completed engine or transmission. In addition, the country of origin calculation is based on the purchase price an engine or transmission supplier pays for all equipment it receives at the plant at which the engine or transmission is assembled into a completed unit. Based on the language in section 210(f)(12), costs incurred once the engine or transmission supplier has received the equipment at its engine or transmission assembly plants (e.g., labor costs, depreciation of equipment, insurance, etc.) are not permitted to be taken into account for purposes of determining the country of origin of an engine or transmission. The agency recognized that some engine/transmission suppliers may produce their own equipment that is integrated into the fully-assembled engine/transmission. NHTSA requested comments on whether such ``on-site'' production should be treated similarly to on-site production at a manufacturer's final assembly point, i.e., by including all costs related to the production of such components, including labor. The agency stated that under such an approach, for engine suppliers, production that occurs on-site prior to the point at which the engine parts are assembled to the engine block would not be considered ``engine assembly,'' and non-parts costs would be taken into account in determining the value of the engine in order to determine its country of origin. After that point in the process, assembly and other non-parts costs would be disallowed. For transmission suppliers, production that occurs on-site prior to the point at which the transmission parts are assembled in the transmission casing (or transmission housing) would not be considered ``transmission assembly,'' and non-parts costs would be taken into account in determining the value of the transmission in order to determine its country of origin. Again, after that point in the process, assembly and other non-parts costs would be disallowed.
