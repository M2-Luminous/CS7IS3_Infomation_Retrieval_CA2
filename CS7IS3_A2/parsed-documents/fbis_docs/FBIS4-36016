The source described the reports disseminated by the secessionist gang that Iraqis are participating in the fighting as false, fabricated, and misleading allegations. This gang has repeated such fabrications and lies to mislead public opinion and gain some Arab and international parties' sympathy, said the source. The responsible source added: It is not new to see this gang repeating such false allegations on the presence of Iraqis or others. Yesterday, the television, which is controlled by this gang, showed Sudanese nurse Salah Muhammad Fadlallah and claimed that he is a pilot fighting at the side of the forces of unity and legitimacy. This allegation was exposed when the gang presented the documents of this person who was kidnapped by the members of this gang from his work site in one of the medical centers in the Lahij Governorate. This person, who has been working as a nurse in Yemen for the past five years, was shown on the television as a pilot.
