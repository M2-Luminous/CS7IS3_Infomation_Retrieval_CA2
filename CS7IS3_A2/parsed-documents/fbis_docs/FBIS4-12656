FBIS4-12656 "drnes070dd_94006" FBIS-NES-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Spokesman: Sealing Off Jerusalem `Danger' to Peace Spokesman: Sealing Off Jerusalem `Danger' to Peace LD1104192094 Algiers Voice of Palestine in Arabic 1702 GMT 11 Apr 94 LD1104192094 Algiers Voice of Palestine Arabic BFN [Statement issued by official PLO spokesman -- read by announcer] [Text] The city of Jerusalem, the capital of the Palestinian people, has been isolated and besieged for several days where roads leading to it have been closed, its national institutions have been prohibited from carrying out their activities and a siege of terror has been imposed around worship sites. These measures were taken to make changes on the ground and to force its people to flee after the Israeli authorities closed doors of meting out their means of living in their faces and preventing them from reaching their workplaces, using the Afula incident as an excuse while ignoring their incompetence in dealing with the Hebron massacre and its aftermath when settlers committed more killings against Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza strip, an act in which the Israeli army participated. This serious incident falls within a known framework of policy practiced by the Israeli government entailing mass punishment of the Palestinian people following the acts of violence -- which cannot be avoided or controlled as long as this government gives settlers a free reign to kill and carry out acts of violence and terrorism, and as long as it does not cooperate in eradicating explosive hotbeds through the peaceful process, starting with moving settlers from Hebron. Such a measure would calm sentiments and prove its rejection of the horrific massacre and killings by settlers and the army while hundreds of worshipers prayed in al-Ibrahimi mosque and which spilled over into the West Bank and Gaza strip. The PLO sees in that Israeli policy, which escalated the collective punishment measures to the extent of resorting to importing tens of thousands of Asian laborers, as being a source of danger and threat to the whole peace process. Accordingly, the PLO, while rejecting the Israeli policy, is concerned to make the international community and Security Council states stand up to these dangerous Israeli practices. It urges the cosponsors -- the U.S. and Russia -- to intervene to relieve the suffering, oppression, and killing of the Palestinian people, and to save the peace process. Events and incidents have proved that security precautions, however big and severe, will not succeed in stopping violence and crime. In the end, every party would be able to make bloody penetrations which would complicate matters. Accordingly, the PLO sees that the latest Israeli measures are pushing matters into a path which run in the opposite direction to the peace process. The inflexible parties in the Israeli government have found their chance to destroy this process, a matter which will drag the region into conflicts, bloody and violent events, thwarting all dreams of security, stability and peace. We call on the international community, particularly the American and Russian cosponsors, to intervene and put a stop to the total massacre of our Palestinian people in the occupied territories -- which affects the core of their daily lives ranging from the attack on their sanctities and institutions, to starve them, confiscating their means of living and preventing them from moving around. These measures are harming all Palestinian sectors, especially the health sector.
