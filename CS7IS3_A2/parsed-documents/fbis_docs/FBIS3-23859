Such are the prices for medicines for the common cold in pharmacies of the capital today. But what about people with more serious maladies? Where are they to get this money during the times of this wild market and the merciless prices of medicines? After all, even the most ordinary No-Shpa now costs R3,000-4,000, the stomach preparation Festal--28,000, Nootropil for improving the memory--26,000, Moditen, a preparation with a psychotropic effect--R40,000, and the antitumor preparation Ziniristin--R117,000. There are even more costly medicines--for the antitumor preparation Litoksantron they are asking more than R2 million. Are such prices always justified? State controller-price setters, conducting planned inspections throughout the country, state: There are now too many people in Russia wanting to line their pockets at the expense of those who are ill. The most expensive medicines in our country are imported. State procurements through imports used to be subsidized from the budget and the prices were relatively low. Now the subsidies have been abolished. The state regulates only the level of the trade markup, but the price asked by Western firms or buyers is determined by supply and demand. Many of the former domestic medicines have become imports. Plants on the territory of the Soviet Union specialized in particular kinds of medications. Now more than two-thirds of these plants are outside the Russian Federation. In order to put a stop to energetic people who make a business out of pharmaceuticals and thus to protect the population from arbitrary prices, the government has adopted a decision to regulate prices of medicines. The rules of the game are very simple: Domestic manufacturing enterprises must deliver medicines to wholesalers at a price no more than the production cost plus 30 percent. In turn, pharmacies have been ordered to sell the preparations to the population at no more than 1.5 times the wholesale factory price of the producer. It is only possible to verify the correctness of the price in each specific case. It sometimes happens that at neighboring pharmacies the prices for the same medicine differ severalfold, but there can be quite legitimate reasons for this. After all, although domestic producers also work "under scrutiny" of the state, with a restriction on profitability, they still purchase raw materials at free prices, including through exchanges. Therefore batches of one and the same medicine from one and the same plant, even if they are produced only a couple of days apart, can have completely different factory wholesale prices. According to the law the penalty for exceeding the trade markup is paid by the pharmacy--the last link in the commercial chain. It most frequently happens that the pharmacies are left with the last little bits of the total markup. As a result it turns out that this trading point is not able to pay its expenses. The majority of pharmacies in the country operate at a loss and local administrative organs have to cover their costs. But since the local administration does not always have enough money for this, the real prices of the medicines in pharmacies frequently exceed the amounts of the established markups. When it comes to the northern and remote regions of the country that are accessible only by aircraft, this is a special problem. Transportation costs of delivering medicines there sometimes turn out to be several times higher than the factory wholesale price of the manufacturing plant. Local authorities must deal with this problem as well. For example, the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Komi, arbitrarily and with the consent of its Supreme Soviet, permitted them to apply free trade markups of an average of up to 300 percent. And the government of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), conversely, established and introduced fixed retail prices for 260 kinds of medicines. This means that in Yakutia pharmacies are subsidized from the local budget. But Yakutia and Komi are special regions, the local authorities are not asleep at the wheel there, they have the situation under control. It is another matter when individual pharmacies apply arbitrary trade markups without permission and thus profit from those who are suffering. For example, BAZL, a small enterprise that is a limited liability partnership from Bratsk in Irkutsk Oblast, when selling medicines applied an arbitrary trade markup of from 200 to 1,500 percent. As a result, in just a half year the total excess of prices amounted to more than R2 million. As was discovered as a result of a state inspection, the Zelenograd pharmacy from a satellite city of the capital by the same name sold the medicine Novopassit at 23 times the wholesale price, and pharmacy No. 422 from the same population point "gladdened" the buyers of the preparation Nikodin by exceeding the factory wholesale price as much as 29-fold. An inspection of one-tenth of the Moscow pharmacy network showed that 70 percent of the pharmacies are violating the law by applying trade markups in excess of the maximum level. As a result of this the population was overcharged more than R16 million. There is no doubt that the pharmacies, like the producers of the medicines, are having to return their illegally obtained profit and are being fined in the same amount. The deliberate raising of the trade markup by the pharmacies is only the most primitive of all the possible financial tricks. Much more clever machinations can occur in any of the links of the trade chain, including at the level of the intermediary-wholesalers. For example, the joint venture Panta-Vitamin was created in July 1993 in order to sell products of the Moscow Endocrine Plant. This plant was one of the founders and, a month later, by August, 82 percent of all the products produced by the plant were sold through the joint venture. By raising the prices of medicines over such a short period of time the schemers from Panta-Vitamin were able to overcharge the pharmacies a total of R2.5 million, the wholesalers--R176.4 million, and private individuals--R29,200. In addition to the fine the price controllers made the Panta-Vitamin joint venture pay R357.8 million into the budget. Machinations are also possible against a background of privatization and the founding of "fake" joint-stock companies. The manager of pharmacy No. 477 in the city of Zelenograd, N. Suvorova, and her accomplices, illegally, without consent from the Moscow Government, decided to change the organizational-legal form of the institution entrusted to her, forming the Central Pharmacy joint-stock company. At the same time the energetic manager founded another joint-stock company, on the same premises, but with a different name--Vitafarm. The business was organized, as it were, simply but tastefully. A one-sided "exchange" of goods took place between these joint-stock companies. Central Pharmacy, receiving medicines that were in critical short supply with subsidies from the budget, turned them over to Vitafarm--and here they were not shy about jacking up the prices as far as they would go. True, frequently the pharmacies had to violate the law by not requiring their suppliers to indicate the prices of the manufacturing plants in the payment documents. This happens when medicines that are in critically short supply are offered to them by exchanges or intermediaries working with foreign goods. They give only their final price. And what they pay the manufacturer for the goods--this is their trade secret. Frequently the medical workers themselves try to feather their nests from medicines, operating according to the principle "what they do not know will not hurt them." How do prescription medications end up in the bags of those people who are selling them directly at the doors to the pharmacies? There are plenty of "loopholes" for underhanded people. What ways of lowering the cost of medicines are suggested by experts from the former Russian State Committee on Prices? They think that it is undoubtedly necessary for the state to monitor the prices of manufacturing plants and the level of markups for the trade network. Fines should be imposed not only on enterprises and organizations that violate the price-setting procedure but also on specific officials who contribute to these violations. This right has been granted to organs for monitoring prices by the Law of the Russian Federation "On Making Changes and Additions to Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation in Connection with Clarifying Liability for Illegal Trade." Specialists recommend that the pharmacies switch to direct deliveries of medications from the production plants--but this is difficult right now, especially in outlying areas. The fact that the pharmacies do not have enough of their own funds to purchase medicines and the high cost of bank credit are also unsolved problems. Until we manage to beat inflation we will remain far away from the ideal system of prices for medications that exists in developed countries. There prices of medications are fixed--this is linked mainly to medical insurance. The cost of the medications included on the "insurance list" is balanced between supply and demand. There is no doubt that at this point our state is capable of helping purchase medicines only for disabled persons, veterans, and other underprivileged citizens by granting them the opportunity to obtain medicine free of charge or with a considerable rebate. But this certainly does not mean that anybody can take advantage of our problems to feather their nests.
