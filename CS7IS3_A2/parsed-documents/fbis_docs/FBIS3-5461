Because China's economic development is impossible without additional seaports, China has long envied those on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, it is now becoming more interested in the Tumen River Development Program. The land routes of North Korea, barriers to freight transportation in northeastern Asia, will be opened by Chinese pressure. As a consequence, the unification of Korea may occur. Korea should construct many more seaports and meet neighboring countries' wishes. Korea without numerous seaports is a useless country. When one looks at a map of Asia or the world, one can find something that one may overlook when viewing a map with only the separated Korean peninsula. This is the geopolitical and geoeconomic importance of the Korean peninsula. The Yellow Sea is a huge gulf and a harbor situated in east-northeastern Asia. The Koreans live on a continental bridge, linking the continent with the ocean. The Korean peninsula is what one calls a gateway to the continent and a base for managing the ocean. It is such an important region geopolitically that communist and capitalist powers came into conflict with each other to produce the tragic 38th parallel. [passage omitted] China relies on coastal transportation to move freight which exceeds the capacity of its roads and railroads. The total 1992 Chinese freight transportation volume was 650 million tons. Some 280 million tons, including 4000 tons of transit freight, were import-export freight and 350 million tons were domestic coast-to-coast transportation freight. If Chinese ship freight volume grows at this pace, it will exceed more than 1.5 billion tons in 10 years. The problem is that Chinese harbors do not have the capacity to receive that much freight volume. This is why the Korean peninsula is regarded as being of great value. Because the waters of the Chinese harbors are mostly shallow due to the earth and sand flowing out from the Yellow River, big ships cannot enter and leave the ports. Therefore, despite 21 open ports, all harbors except for Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou are of little use. [passage omitted] Of the 1.5 billion tons of ship freight in 10 years, even if 1 billion tons are barely managed at its own harbors, for the rest of the half billion tons China must get neighboring countries' harbors (of South Korea, North Korea, Russia, and Japan). If neighboring countries do not lend harbors (though this is unlikely), China's economic development can be stopped. Therefore, China now desperately seeks harbors. As a part of such efforts, China, after winning over the UNDP, planned the Tumen River Development Program. [passage omitted] If this region becomes a free export zone, China will get a long awaited ice-free port in the Japan Sea. North Korea, wanting to take this opportunity to acquire foreign currency, made it clear they would like to take part in the Tumen River Development Program at the Pyongyang Conference in the springs of 1992 and 1993. [passage omitted] On 19 December 1992, China, negotiating directly with Russia, leased Zarubino harbor for fifty years. And China agreed to lay a railroad between Khraskino and Hunchun for Russia and also get operating rights for seventy years. These events embarrassed North Korea very much. Wanting to yield to none, North Korea agreed to lease to China the eastern Chongjin harbor as well as Rajin and also to immediately begin improving the railroads and roads between Hunchun of China and Rajin. Judging from this, the construction of Fangchuan harbor that China first announced, was nothing but a rumor. Its real aim might have been a strategy to get the right to use Chongjin, Rajin, and Zarubino harbors. The reason China first negotiated with Russia and not North Korea on the lease of Zarubino harbor was because the stubborn North Korea dragged the negotiation out for too long and requested the utility rate of Chongjin harbor at three times more than the current international price. As China reached an agreement first with Russia, North Korea, in its confusion, made repeated concessions to China's demands, even sharply cutting the utility rate of the eastern Chongjin harbor. As of result, North Korea played into China's hands. Among the three northeastern provinces of China, Liaoning is the only province with its own harbor. In China every province is a separate unit and autonomously controls its own economic activities. Therefore, Heilongjang and Jilin Provinces, which have no harbors of its own, lease of Dalian or Tianjin harbors and are often times deprived of priority use of these harbors by Liaoning Province. For that reason, these two provinces are enthusiastic about getting the right to use new harbors in the Japan Sea. China has to develop and use the Sonbong and Chongjin harbors of North Korea as well as Zarubino and Rajin harbors. If China expands these four harbors, it will be able to transfer 30-50 million tons of freight per year. The Japanese Government only furnishes funds and then maneuvers behind the scenes. It lent $50 million to the Maruichi Company, a private enterprise, and let this company take part in the development of Zarubino harbor. The Japanese Government trading with China is creating an opportunity to stimulate the backward economy of its coastal regions in the Japan Sea. Giving long-term credit to China matters little to Japan. The problem of the northern four islands still remains unsolved between Japan and Russia. The Japanese Government is not in a position to take an active part in the development. So it has let Niigata Province independently participate in the development program. Only if Japan lets its local government act independently in the development program, will it bear fewer funds to support the UNDP. After the development of these harbors in the Japan Sea is completed, Japan, second to China, will make a profit on the harbors. It is because most of the freight in these harbors are transferred to Japan. Of course, China will be the country receiving the most benefit. Because of poor ground transportation, China has to pay a great deal of money and time to transport its freight from Jinlin and Heilongjang provinces to Guangdong Province in the south. Because China can save much money and time transporting its domestic freight through Zarubino harbor, it is likely to make much use of this harbor in the future. As Seoul is geographically situated behind Inchun, and Beijing at the rear of Tianjin, so Hunchun is situated behind Zarubino, Rajin, and Sonbong. Because Hunchun is likely to grow tremendously in the future, the foreign enterprises that have applied for investment in Hunchun already numbers about 260. Of these, about 160 enterprises are South Korean and the rest are Japanese or Hong Kong among others, they say. Such a trend is expected to continue to increase hereafter. For a while, the land price of Hunchun rose as fast as that of Kangnam District, Seoul. Mongolia, which has no harbor, of course, received the program with open arms. [passage omitted] China involved the UNDP and let the Tumen River Development Program attract international attention. China made the countries concerned -- China, Russia, North Korea, South Korea, Mongolia -- agree to jointly manage the golden triangular zone. Also, China obtained a lease of harbors under a bilateral agreement to with Russia and began construction work there, and even obtained harbors in North Korea. We cannot help but praise China's foresighted scheme and its paving the way for the future. Hunchun is one of the regions where many Korean people live. For this reason, South Korean enterprises should make inroads there. It is obvious that by South Korean enterprises making inroads into Hunchun would politically be a help to the unification of Korea, as Hunchun is situated behind North Korea. Negotiations between North Korea and China which have carried on for three years did not yield good results. If China comes to an agreement through the UNDP, it will readily be able to acquire development funds from the World Bank and enjoy the advantage of joint management of the harbors. Therefore, China will continue to carry on the negotiations through the UNDP. South Korea could also reduce, through the UNDP, North Korea's excessive response to its strategy toward the North. Even if this region is open under a bilateral agreement as well as an agreement involving the UNDP, South Korea should help the development program to succeed. South Korea's strategy should not be one favorable only to its own land, but one favorable to all of northeastern Asia. Only if South Korea does so will it win recognition and be held in high esteem by neighboring countries. Like many of South Korea's enterprises which make inroads into Hunchun of China, it should participate in the construction of Zarubino harbor as a long-term strategy. That will of itself pave the way for South Korea to take part in the program to develop North Korea. Let us return to the main subject. If China's development of harbors does not make progress as fast as the freight volume increases, it will utilize Zarubino, Chongjin, Rajin, and Sonbong harbors for its exports. But it will utilize the South Korean harbors as the temporary storing places of imported freight and its dependence on South Korea's harbors will increase day by day. Accordingly South Korea should invest in the construction of harbors for not only its own freight but of all of northeastern Asia. Without its harbors, South Korea will become a useless country. If South Korea does not construct many harbors, it will eventually lose its huge interests because the main marine transportation companies of the world will utilize Japanese harbors even if they are a little distant. Because Pusan and Inchun harbors are so saturated, South Korea is constructing a harbor at Kwangyang Bay. Aside from these two, some suitable places for harbors are found in the neighborhood of the South coast including the Kohung Peninsula. The Kunsan harbor, when newly developed, is expected to possess great value. The invested capital in the construction of harbors will be returned in 10-20 years. In steadily carrying out such public works requiring huge capital, a provisional organization such as the present social overhead utility planning team in the Blue House is insufficient, and instead a special organization such as a maritime ministry should be set up. Even if South Korea serves as an intermediate base where we store some of China's imported freight and transfer it to small ships, there is also another problem. First of all, the cost of labor in South Korea is expensive. Although China has 17 harbors where small ships of less than 10,000 tons can enter, there will often be times when freight to be shipped off to China piles up for a long time at our harbors due to China's increasing domestic ship freight. Loading, unloading, and storing expenses in such circumstances will become a primary factor in raising the costs. Therefore China will make efforts to take its freight as soon as possible in order to save expenses. There is an only way to settle this problem. North Korea must clear the way. China has no choice but to request North Korea clear the way so that the railroads can be connected from South Korea's harbors to China. If freight being imported to the northeastern three provinces of China is transported overland via North Korea from South Korea, much more expenses could be saved. In this case, China will come to realize North Korea is an obstacle to its economic development and will command North Korea clear the way. Since Russia democraticized, North Korea has no ally to turn to but China. How could North Korea not clear the way? Even for China's part, it has no choice but to take any measure because the ups and downs of China's economy depend upon this issue. Eventually North Korea will come to clear the way as China demands. Accordingly the interchange between North and South Koreas will be a mode that freight, truck drivers and train operators will begin. Once a road is opened up, it will become wider and more people will pass through day by day. Before such things happen, North Korea will realize that it has been driven into a corner, unless it changes. The major premise of such exchanges is that South Korea must construct more harbors. Increasing ship freight, limited harbor capacity, shallow coastal water and disadvantageous natural surroundings of China are the primary factors in raising South Korea's land value. If South Korea constructs more harbors, it will not only increase its national interests, but will let China demand that North Korea clear the way, and eventually the roads between the North and South will be open on their own.
