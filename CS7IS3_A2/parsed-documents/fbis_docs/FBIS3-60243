It is interesting to note Sarwono's suggestion that the identity of those responsible for polluting the environment be revealed in the newspapers. He said it is only proper that the names of these businessmen or industries be identified clearly and not just by their initials. The minister said this is one of the steps the Environmental Impact Management Agency will take at its next national working meeting on the clean river project, and will be implemented next year. Minister Sarwono stressed that the press should not hesitate to reveal in detail the names of industries that are not concerned about the environment, or whose products and technology endanger the lives of their workers. He added that it is not sufficient for the press to publish their initials. He reiterated that if the press is confident that their information is accurate, they should not fear any resulting legal charges, because they will definitely win the case. We say that the minister's suggestion is interesting because this is something new for our national press. Based on the principles of the journalistic code of ethics observed by members of the PWI (Indonesian Journalists Association), all journalists should honor an individual's privacy and not violate the principle of presumption of innocence [preceding three words in English]. This code of ethics is clearly spelled out in the PWI's journalistic code--an individual should be regarded as innocent until a decision is issued in court. The Indonesian press is required to honor its journalistic code of ethics as stipulated by the PWI statue. The press should use wisdom and tact before it reveals the full name and identity or publishes a photograph of any person. One of the code's rules relates to the presumption of innocence, which requires the press to refrain from indirectly accusing a suspect of committing a crime or revealing his or her full identity until he or she is convicted in court. This is guaranteed in the PWI's journalistic code of ethics under Section 8 of Law No. 14/1970. We feel that it would be very difficult for the national press to violate the code of ethics, the law, and the order that are the basis of their profession. There has never been a case where journalists have been charged in court for reporting inaccurate information and ordered to pay an exorbitant amount to the plaintiff in damages. In view of recent cases where people felt defamed by press reports and pressed for legal charges against the journalist concerned, we also find that some journalists are being blackmailed and an unbelievable amount of money is being extorted. The PWI, as a professional organization for journalists, has thus far been able to impose discipline and enforce its journalist code of ethics for reporting on the national press. Addressing the 19th PWI Congress in Bandar Lampung from 2 to 5 December, Information Minister Harmoko reminded the PWI and its honorary board members of their unflinching obligation to uphold justice, defend the people's interests for the sake of the law, and take disciplinary action against members who violate the journalistic code of ethics. We fully understand Minister Sarwono's objective in saying that the identity of industries proven to have caused environmental pollution should be revealed in the press. Such transparent reporting would force businessmen to be more serious about producing products and following production processes that do not harm the environment. But if the press reveals the identity of the industry causing industrial pollution, and at the end of the trial the court cannot convict the industry because of lack of evidence, who can guarantee that the publication in question will be free from countercharges and demands for compensation?
