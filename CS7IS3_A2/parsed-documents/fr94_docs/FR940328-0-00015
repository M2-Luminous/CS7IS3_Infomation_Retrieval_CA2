ACTION: Notice of withdrawal of final rule. SUMMARY: On November 4, 1993 (58 FR 58784), the Department published a final rule that states that until such time as HUD approval may be obtained, the PHA or IHA must not take any action intended to further the demolition or disposition of a public housing project or a portion of a public housing project without obtaining HUD approval under 24 CFR parts 970 or 905, respectively. This final rule, which establishes an ``intent'' standard to the August 17, 1988 interim rule currently in effect, was to become effective on December 6, 1993. On December 6, 1993, a notice was published to delay the effective date of the final rule from December 6, 1993, until February 4, 1994. On February 4, 1994, another notice was published which further delayed the effective date of the final rule for an additional 60 days. This notice withdraws the November 4, 1993 final rule. The August 17, 1988 interim rule remains in effect. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is withdrawn as of March 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William R. Minning, Director, Policy Division, Office of Management and Policy, (202) 708&hyph;0713. The telecommunications device for deaf persons (TDD) is available at (202) 708&hyph;0850.

Withdrawal of Final Rule On November 4, 1993, at 58 FR 58784, the Department issued a final rule regarding required and permitted actions that a PHA or IHA may take prior to approval of an application for demolition or disposition of a public or Indian housing project or a portion of a public or Indian housing project. The final rule had an effective date of December 6, 1993, and a notice was published in the Federal Register on December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64141) that delayed that effective date until February 4, 1994, because serious concerns had been expressed about the impact of some of the provisions of the final rule on residents and resident organizations. In the spirit of cooperation, the Department further delayed the effective date of the final rule for an additional 60 days by publication of a notice on February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5321), so that further review of this rule could be conducted. The Department, after further consideration, now believes that the Department can better serve all parties concerned with this rule by receiving public comments before issuing this rule for effect. Accordingly, the final rule published on November 4, 1993 (58 FR 58784) that amended 24 CFR parts 905 and 970, is withdrawn. The Department will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking in the near future. Authority: 25 U.S.C. 450e(b); 42 U.S.C. 1437aa&hyph;1437ee, 1437p, and 3535(d). Dated: March 15, 1994. Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7156 Filed 3&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4210&hyph;33&hyph;P
