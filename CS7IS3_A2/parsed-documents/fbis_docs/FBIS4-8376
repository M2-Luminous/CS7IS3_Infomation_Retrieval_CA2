We do not learn from the quite extensive article who specifically stands behind this initiative. The address, a post office box in Trnava, does not reveal much. What does the front actually offer us? To build on the "traditions of healthy patriotism and Christian ethics." The aim is to "make the political and economic leadership of the state respect the interests of the nation and protect its freedom.... On no account do we intend to stand idly by and watch the cryptocommunists in parliament and in the Slovak Government sell our homeland to the political-criminal underworld and the international mafia." The SNF will be against foreigners being given jobs in Slovakia and foreign-made goods penetrating our market. The SNF calls for a "morally pure government, supported by a potent Army, the police, and voluntary units of armed citizens in the style of the National Guard." Hidden behind the anonymous post office box in Trnava are thus new armed units that want to defend this nation, whether we want it or not. Does this not remind you by chance of some organizations from Slovak history, about which a judge of the Slovak Supreme Court recently said that these were "good organizations, which were only misused by politicians"? Who will misuse the SNF?
