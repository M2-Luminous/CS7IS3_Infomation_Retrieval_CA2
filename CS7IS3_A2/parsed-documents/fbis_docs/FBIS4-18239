The United States do not regard the reason for failing in trade with these two countries to be their own, possibly not quite competitive, product range; but they consider it to be these countries' alleged closing of their markets to U.S. products. It is, therefore, hardly surprising that U.S. Trade envoy Mickey Kantor calls the Japanese proposals to open the markets in 11 key areas "a half-finished job." In Kantor's view, the Japanese prime minister's proposals are not sufficient to dissipate Bill Clinton's reservations. What is more: Tokyo's concessions have not been enough to resume the suspended negotiations. But Kantor is giving Tokyo another chance: "We are not disappointed. The Japanese Government has called the proposals a first step, we consider them improvable." The current suspension of U.S.-Japanese talks shows that neither threats of trade sanctions, nor top-level meetings, such as the unsuccessful meeting between Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, can bridge the gap. The reason is the different starting point of the two adversaries. The United States wants to open Japanese markets forcefully -- not only for its own benefit, but for the good of other nations as well. Washington feels it has been kept waiting too long by Japan; for instance when former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, threatened by being voted down already, conceded the U.S. President's framework agreements at the July 1993 Tokyo World Economic Summit, which his successor Hosokawa did not want to keep. But when Tokyo finally takes a small step forward -- this is how the Americans see it -- the slight progress is offset by setbacks in other areas, or it is not put into practice at all. This explains Clinton's unfriendly reaction to Hosokawa's proposal, which the prime minister personally presented to the President, who is vacationing in California at the time. Clinton's cool reply: The Japanese market will be "carefully examined." But perhaps the two adversaries will benefit from a break for contemplation while the talks are suspended. Kantor's way of negotiating is somewhat hectic anyhow. The U.S. trade envoy always wants too much at once. He gives the impression of constantly being pressed for time. For Kantor the talks with his Japanese adversaries are a very important experience. What is unfortunate for the United States is that the trade envoy's learning process is harming domestic industry.
