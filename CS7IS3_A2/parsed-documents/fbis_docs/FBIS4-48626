The movement was created in reaction to acts of violence perpetrated by Tuareg rebels against members of the black community in northern Mali. The community has, therefore, decided to assume responsibility for its own security. Boubacar Guidado Toure, a spokesman for (Ganda Koi), elaborates on the objectives of the movement: [Begin recording] [Toure] The movement is not meant to harass or harm the people, but to restore peace in northern Mali because the government is incapable of restoring peace there. Since the signing of the national pact, no day has gone by without attacks taking place or vehicles being taken away from their owners. Each time we are told that the perpetrators of those acts are armed groups. We know that plans for these attacks are hatched here in Bamako. We have, therefore, created the movement to stop such attacks. We will use the same means the rebels are using. [Unidenfied correspondent] What do you mean? [Toure] I mean that we are prepared to take up arms and fight them. [Correspondent] So, do you have weapons? [Toure] Yes, we have weapons. [end recording] Meanwhile, officials of the Unified Movement and Front of Azaouad [MFUA] say they do not understand the real motivation behind the creation of (Ganda Koi), but stress that they are prepared to fight those who will attack them. Speaking to our correspondent Djibrill Mbodj, MFUA spokesman Ag Alhassane denounced any attempt likely to plunge Mali into civil war. [passage omitted]
