FBIS4-29855 "dreas120_d_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-120 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 South Korea Government: `Stern Warning' Against Strike Government: `Stern Warning' Against Strike SK2006020994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0150 GMT 20 Jun 94 SK2006020994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- The government issued a stern warning Monday against a move by locomotive engineers and subway workers to stage a nationwide strike next Monday. In a joint statement by the home, justice, labor and transportation ministers, the government said any attempt to stop the country's railways and subways "cannot be pardoned." If Chonkihyop [The National Council of Locomotive Engineers], a private group of locomotive engineers having no collective bargaining power, does not drop its strike plan, the government will have no choice but to take strict legal action, the joint statement warned. The locomotive engineers' strike, if staged in spite of the government's announcement over the weekend of a package of measures to increase wages and improve working conditions for railway workers, would be considered an anti-social act, it said. The statement came in response to the move by Hyundai and Daewoo workers and some "unregistered" labor unions, such as Chonnodae (The National Council of Union Representatives) and Chonnohyop (The National Council of Labor Unions) to strike in sympathy with the strike by locomotive engineers and subway workers. In a related development, the Seoul subway workers union said Sunday it had dropped plans to launch a "work-to-rule struggle" Monday in view of the resulting inconvenience for passengers. But the union warned that if its demand for a 14.5-percent wage rise was not accepted, it would go on strike starting at 4:00 a.m. next Monday as announced earlier.
