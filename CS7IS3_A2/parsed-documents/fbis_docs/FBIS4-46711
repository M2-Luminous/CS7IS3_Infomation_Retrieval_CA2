On 9 June 1992 a crowd of refugees from South Ossetia surrounded the residential settlement and military base "Philipp Holzmann," which was being built at the ninth kilometer of the Vladikavkaz-Beslan highway for military units being withdrawn from Germany. Military guards opened fire to kill, but were immediately overrun by the mob. On that day 12 122-mm self-propelled artillery systems (SAS) were taken from the military base and driven under the Ossetian flag through Vladikavkaz. At night the situation in the North Ossetian capital was to all practical purposes not under the control of the authorities and law enforcement organs. On 10 June South Ossetians seized the Vladikavkaz garrison's central base, from which ammunition for SAS and submachine guns were carried away in KamAZ trucks. No one even attempted to stop this deadly convoy on its way to South Ossetia. During that time a nonstop rally was being held in the city, the participants demanding the resignation of North Ossetia Supreme Soviet Chairman Galazov, Prime Minister Khetagurov, and Minister of Internal Affairs Kantemirov... It was at this time that the head of the South Ossetian Government, Oleg Teziyev, was arrested on the territory of North Ossetia--to be precise, on the Vladikavkaz-Alagir highway. A spetznaz group blocked the Mercedes and captured together with Teziyev a bodyguard and two Russians. The latter did not have a chance to make use of submachine guns and a TT handgun. Literally several hours before the capture of the South Ossetian prime minister some local residents had been arrested in Prigorodnyy Rayon; in the trunk of their car was an AKM [modified Kalashnikov automatic rifle] and a suitcase full of money. At the very first interrogation the arrested testified that they had just bought the weapon from Teziyev; a serial number check showed that the AKM was from consignments stolen from the warehouse at the "Philipp Holzmann" base. Thus, the North Ossetian (that is, Russian) procuracy initiated criminal proceedings against Oleg Teziyev, on charges of organizing an armed attack on a military installation and illegal arms trading. Teziyev and his companions were kept in a Vladikavkaz preliminary investigative facility for more than a day. During that time practically all North Ossetia's highest officials experienced pressure from the southerners. A group was already being readied in Tkshinvali which was supposed, according to one of its members, to "smash this Vladikavkaz--and Galazov with it--into pieces." Then Teziyev was let go, with an apology. Now he is under arrest again. An entrepreneur from North Ossetia, Oleg Teziyev got the job of head of South Ossetia's government almost by accident. It appears that the People's Front of South Ossetia's design was to bring a northerner into this job during one of the hardest times for South Ossetia and, thus making a national hero out of him, return him later to Vladikavkaz, this time as a potential leader of North Ossetia. According to confidential information, the job of South Ossetian prime minister was first offered to Sergey Tabolov, director of North Ossetian Humanitarian Sciences Research Institute, but he refused. After which somehow Oleg Teziyev came on the scene on his own. Despite a certain popularity the energetic prime minister enjoyed in South Ossetia, to a large extent he remained an outsider in Tskhinvali. He got practically all his connections and contacts from National Front leader Alan Chochiyev. It was also the latter who recommended to Teziyev his closest aides and advisers--for instance, Minister of Defense Valeriy Khubulov, OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments] commander Vadim Gazzayev, and others. Later, however, it somehow was forgotten that the initiative for all these government appointments and parceling out some or other authority came from Alan Chochiyev rather than Oleg Teziyev, who during this period became easy prey for the National Front's personnel policy. In Tskhinvali, Teziyev was mostly engaged in arms purchases and arming South Ossetian armed formations. In this respect he managed to establish within a short period of time relations with the Russian military, including with those who make the principal political decisions. Seriously speaking, the South Ossetian "victory" in the war with Georgia was the result of Teziyev and his retinue's unprecedented activism. Over a very short period of time South Ossetia received enough arms to withstand a Georgian offensive. After the cessation of military operations in South Ossetia, Teziyev's activities practically fully shifted to Moscow. A system of commercial enterprises was set up in the Russian capital, financed illegally with the money South Ossetia received as a result of division of the all-Union budget. The plan was for these structures to supply South Ossetia with all it needed: arms, foodstuffs, basic necessities, and cash (banking operations with South Ossetia had been suspended, and therefore people in Tskhinvali had not been paid wages for months--there was no cash in rubles, and Georgia had dropped out of the ruble zone). These commercial structures were headed by Moscow Ossetians--mainly relatives of National Front leader Alan Chochiyev. In setting up and financing these operations, Teziyev, acting on behalf of the Alagir company, trusted Chochiyev's proteges enough not to ask for receipts; later this led to an endless series of score-settling involving professional "enforcers." Teziyev's absence from Tskhinvali and his operations with large amounts of money created a situation where some field commanders began to demand guarantees that Teziyev would in fact work in their interests. Teziyev offered as a guarantee of his "loyalty" his older son Teymuraz, who was placed to serve in the Tskhinvali OMON on the promise of this unit's commander, Vadim Gazzayev, to take care of the junior's safety. In reality, Teymuraz Teziyev was a hostage, and the degree of his safety was defined not by Gazzayev but by the National Guard commander Alan Dzhioyev, nicknamed "Parpat." It was he who later took Teziyev Jr. in his car out of the OMON base and demanded from the prime minister billions in cash in exchange for his son (this information was supplied by the prime minister's former aide, Ye. Krutikov). Teziyev's son was let go for a ransom of a hard-to-pronounce amount. Most of the participants in this drama are no longer alive: Vadim Gazzayev was killed on the doorstep of his house by a gang of marauders, and Alan Dzhioyev was shot to death at the OMON base by its new commander, Siukayev. Nevertheless, this story, which has been kept secret for a long time, demonstrates very well the degree of criminality of the military and political leadership of South Ossetia. Field commanders, most of whom engage without any qualms whatsoever in drug trafficking in Georgia, racketeering in North Ossetia and Moscow, kidnapping, and reselling stolen cars, openly extorted money from Teziyev. He became nearly the sole channel for the flow of arms and cash for some armed formation in South Ossetia. Oleg Teziyev moved to Moscow for good in the spring of 1993, together with his close associates (among them, those known to the investigation are Aleksey Tkachuk, a former officer of the Pskov Airborne Troops Division [PATD] and the commandant of the city of Tskhinvali, and Tskhinvali resident Atsamaz Alborov). In addition to commercial activities, they were buying arms from PATD officers and, through the same criminal group (about 30 persons), smuggling arms from Estonia. The scale of activities of South Ossetian arms traders is evidenced by the fact that heavy armaments were being sold to Teziyev almost openly--in Saransk and Syzran the South Ossetian prime minister managed to buy several dozen units of armored equipment, and in Pskov negotiations were underway regarding purchases of "Igla" air-defense systems (the Soviet equivalent of the "Stinger"). Sales of a considerable quantity of armored equipment and arms to South Ossetia had been authorized by major political figures in Moscow, which gives the investigation the flavor of an impending scandal: The Teziyev affair may become the largest trial on corruption and illegal financial machinations on the part of some high-ranking officers of the General Staff, the Airborne Troops command, and members of the president of Russia's staff. Oleg Teziyev and Aleksey Tkachuk, who was arrested in Aprelevka in suburban Moscow, also are being charged with racketeering. This charge came as a result of score-settling among Moscow commercial operators of Ossetian descent, whose companies were illegally financed by Teziyev. Some of them (for instance, Valeriy Kaytulov, head of the Kadeshk and Bezopasnost companies, who currently lives in Toronto) accused Teziyev and his retinue of racketeering and officially asked for MVD assistance after they had been forced to "account" for their activities to Oleg Teziyev, who had financed them. A tense situation also developed around Alan Chochiyev, former leader of the National Front of South Ossetia, who, in his own words, "withdrew from politics and learned to make money in Moscow." There is information that it is he--the former ideologist of South Ossetian independence--who had initiated a number of illegal financial operations which nearly bankrupted Teziyev and brought considerable profit to commercial operators--Chochiyev's relatives. At this point the investigation believes that Chochiyev is in the United States. Oleg Teziyev was probably the key figure in the course of military operations in the fall of 1992 in North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon. Several days before the bloody deportation of Ingush from Prigorodnyy Rayon, then Prime Minister of South Ossetia Sergey Khetagurov and Aleksandr Dzasokhov went by helicopter to Tskhinvali and talked to Teziyev about "protecting Ossetia from Ingush." The South Ossetian brigade was distinguished by exceptional cruelty, which had developed in southerners over the years of bloody war of attrition with Georgia, marauding and plunder in Ingush villages. Actually, their northern brothers also got a taste of it... They were commanded by the same Alan Dzhioyev ("Parpat") and Minister of Defense Valeriy Khebelov. Oleg Teziyev was in Vladikavkaz, where he was "working" with Russia's representatives, in particular, Georgiy Khizha, who later stated that he was not aware of a single instance of marauding on the part of South Ossetian volunteers." At the same time Oleg Teziyev represented a serious danger for the North Ossetian government which disliked him. Vladikavkaz permitted the southerners to carry out the "march of foreign-made cars"--a mass transfer into South Ossetia of cars commandeered in Prigorodnyy Rayon, while Galazov at the meeting of the North Ossetian Supreme Soviet thanked the southerners for "brotherly help." Teziyev personally, however, remained dangerous as a man who quite easily could lay claim to high positions in the government of North Ossetia. There are several versions regarding Oleg Teziyev's current arrest. In reality people of his rank or caliber almost never get investigated or arrested--the sponsors and the unique connections that permit them to conduct extremely risky and profitable operations with arms and illegal financing of commercial structures are just too strong. According to one, Oleg Teziyev was "surrendered" by Moscow businessmen of Ossetian descent who held a grudge against him. In particular, information that enabled the investigation to charge Teziyev with racketeering and illegal financing of commercial organizations was found during a search of the premises of the Kadeshk and Bezopasnost companies in the area of the Aviamotornaya subway station. According to another, Teziyev's arrest was the result of a battle in the Russian Government between several groups oriented in their activities on the shadow economy side of Russia's Caucasus policy. It is anticipated that the "Teziyev affair" will lead the investigation to high-ranking members of the president's staff and the government, against whom actually this whole game is being played. According to still another version, Teziyev's arrest was almost an accident, a corollary to improper behavior on the part of Aleksey Tkachuk; this explanation is hardly worthy of attention, however. One way or another an end has been put to the activities of a criminal group engaged in illegal arms sales, racketeering, and financing of commercial enterprises (including a number of banks in Moscow and Vladikavkaz), creating illegal armed formations, and organizing mass disorder. FROM THE EDITORS: Mountain people have this saying: "When a man rushes too fast toward the smell of shishkebab, he may find upon arrival that the smell comes from donkeys being branded..." In the Caucasus, wisdom and criminal lack of restraint have existed side by side since time immemorial. This may perhaps be why it became a suitable location of action for "script writers"--the powers that be--writing cynical and frightening scenarios of interethnic and other armed conflicts. Because for centuries war has been a method of political struggle and material enrichment. A. Basayev's article is an attempt to "figure out" the authors through the performers. We are ready to provide the same opportunity to those who have in their possession information and their own vision of the situation in other "hot spots" of the former USSR. Because we are dealing with an already-established blueprint for committing crimes against humanity. And it appears that this blueprint works without fail in Georgia, Abkhazia, the south of Russia, Tajikistan. Without fail--and with impunity.
