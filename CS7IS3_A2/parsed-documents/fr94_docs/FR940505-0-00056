FR940505-0-00056 FR940505-0-00016 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;12; Amendment 39&hyph;8895; AD 94&hyph;06&hyph;09] Airworthiness Directives; Teledyne Continental Motors (Formerly Bendix) Magnetos AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule, request for comments. SUMMARY: This document publishes in the Federal Register an amendment adopting airworthiness directive (AD) 94&hyph;06&hyph;09 that was sent previously to all known U.S. owners and operators of Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) (formerly Bendix) SC&hyph;20, SC&hyph;200, and S&hyph;1200 series magnetos by individual letters. This AD requires inspection to determine if capacitors that may have an intermittent open circuit condition are installed in magnetos, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable capacitors. This amendment is prompted by reports that TCM produced and delivered magneto capacitors that have the potential for an intermittent open circuit condition that may exist between the internal through-lead and the p-lead stud terminal. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent possible injury or death to ground personnel due to a non-grounded magneto. DATES: Effective May 20, 1994, to all persons except those persons to whom it was made immediately effective by priority letter AD 94&hyph;06&hyph;09, issued on March 9, 1994, which contained the requirements of this amendment. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May 20, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;12, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299.
