He was a former Russian ambassador to the United States. How can the State Duma influence the formulation of Russian foreign policy? More from our parliamentary correspondent, who interviewed Vladimir Lukin. [Unidentified correspondent] Primarily, under the Constitution, the State Duma shall or shall not ratify international treaties concluded on behalf of the country. The State Duma also approves of the foreign policy articles in the budget. Besides, under the Constitution, the State Duma will agree upon Russia's ambassadors to foreign countries' appointments and withdrawals. We shall see to it that these responsible posts are filled with the persons who can respectfully present Russia's interests, said Vladimir Lukin. When asked to respond if he had shared the viewpoint that the Russian Foreign Ministry paid insufficient attention to the Asia and Pacific region, he said that this is exactly so. A foreign policy is first and foremost the accomplishment of specific results, significant to the country concerned. From this point of view, our Asiatic policies do leave much to be desired. He goes on to say that Russia's foreign minister, Andrey Kozyrev, is to visit China shortly. I wish his visit could produce good results. And in his final remarks, Vladimir Lukin stressed that we would need specific accomplishments in the foreign policy we pursued, and this would relate not only to China, but to other Asian countries as well.
