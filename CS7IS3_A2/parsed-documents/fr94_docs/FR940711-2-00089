SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Great Lakes Human Health Effects Program is authorized under section 106, Subsection 118(e) of the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act of 1990 [33 U.S.C. 1268(e)(3)], and Sections 104(i)(5)(A) and (15) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) [42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(5)(A) and (15)]. Provisions of the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act of 1990 require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in consultation with ATSDR and the Great Lakes States, to initiate a research program and submit a report to Congress assessing the harmful human health effects of water pollutants in the Great Lakes basin. The ATSDR Great Lakes Human Health Effects Research Program focuses on populations that have been identified as having a higher risk of long-term adverse health effects from exposure to Great Lakes contaminants in fish. They include Native Americans, sport anglers, urban poor, and fetuses and nursing infants of mothers who consume contaminated Great Lakes fish. In FY 1992, ATSDR awarded nine research grants designed to investigate and characterize the association between the consumption of contaminated Great Lakes fish and potential long-term adverse health effects. The draft ATSDR annual report for FY 1992 describes the Great Lakes Human Health Effects Research Program's strategy, and the research activities and status of the nine awarded grants. Dated: July 1, 1994. Claire V. Broome, Deputy Administrator, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.
