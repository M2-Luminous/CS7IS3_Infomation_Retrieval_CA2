Those demands are the logical consequences of the ostrich policy and shady deals that this problem has engendered since the end of the sovereign national conference. Second, all the demands made by the armed rebellion should be examined in the strict respect for the provisions of the 26 December 1992 Constitution, whose guarantor is the president of the Republic. Third, in the face of the armed rebellion's determination to continue its repeated deadly attacks, we urgently call on the government to take all the appropriate measures to ensure the security of people and goods throughout the country. Fourth, and finally, we condemn and call for an end to all the maneuvers, manipulations, and other machinations from inside and outside aimed at partitioning Niger. In this regard, we urge the president of the Republic to assess the historic, political, and legal significance of the oath he took before God as well as the Niger people and therefore assume all his responsibilities.
