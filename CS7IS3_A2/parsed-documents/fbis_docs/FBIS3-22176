The World Health Organization, however, reported that this number is only 2 percent of the overall number of cases, which totals 185,000. The organization added that 30 percent of these cases are fatal. Herbicides forbidden in other countries still are in use in Brazil, including paraquat, which is used in sugar cane plantations. This substance causes lung fibrosis, in addition to several other serious illnesses. These cases will be reported during the Second National Congress on Workers' Health, which will be held in Brasilia next month. Causes of job injury also will be discussed in the congress. From 1979 to 1988, more than 46,000 workers died in Brazil while 26,000 others suffered injury. Experts from the Ministries of Health, Labor, and Social Security and several other organizations will attend the congress. They will present proposals for the establishment of a policy safeguarding workers' health and ensuring better supervision by the internal commission in charge of preventing job accidents.
