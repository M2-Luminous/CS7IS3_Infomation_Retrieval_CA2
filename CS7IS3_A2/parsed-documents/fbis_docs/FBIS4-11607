This organization, which controls narcotics and psychotropic drugs worldwide, is linked to the United Nations. Carlini was chosen on 19 April during the third round of elections and was appointed World Health Organization representative at the INCB. He disputed the position with representatives of the PRC and the Philippines. He will be installed in Vienna during the second half of the year. Carlini has a well-defined line of action and wants to urge Brazil to comply with the international treaty terms that force countries to report on their production, import, and consumption of drugs that affect the brain and create addiction, such as morphine byproducts and psychotropic substances. Carlini criticized: "For three years, Brazil has been sending incomplete reports to the INCB or not sending reports at all." Brazil has never before been represented on the INCB (which comprises 13 members with 5-year mandates), but has signed the 1961 and 1971 conventions that establish rules to control drug circulation worldwide. Carlini said: "I will press the Board to adopt a firmer position regarding Brazil." Carlini is a psycho-pharmacist and a professor at the Sao Paulo Medical School. He founded the Brazilian Center for Information on Psychotropic Drugs and has published nearly 200 papers on controlled drugs.
