Hamas did not deny that this Islamic personality is currently in Tunis, but emphasized that Sa'id Bilal was fired from the Muslim Brotherhood and has no links with Hamas. Hamas said Bilal's invitation to Tunis was made within the framework of 'Arafat's preparations to detonate a media bomb by announcing the participation of this person in the Palestinian authority. Hamas recalled how 'Arafat had given Palestine National Council [PNC] membership to five Islamic personalities, and then reports said that they were Hamas representatives in the PNC. Hamas added 'Arafat wants to repeat the same tactic now and allege that Hamas is with the Palestinian Authority. [passage omitted]
