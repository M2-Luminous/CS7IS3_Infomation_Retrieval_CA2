Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-26Jan94-Russia Cabinet Reshuffle Weakens Reformers, Leaves Confusion SUMMARY The new cabinet named on 20 January after several delays as well as repeated and apparently difficult talks between President Boris Yeltsin and Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin is less reformist than the pre-election cabinet, with radical reformers Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov gone and more conservative leaders- -Chernomyrdin, First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets, and Deputy Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha--now running the show. Despite signs that Sergey Shakhray and Aleksandr Shokhin would be purged for their attacks on Gaydar's Russia's Choice party during the election, they remained in the cabinet, at least as ministers, while several Russia's Choice leaders left. The new cabinet appears to be a compromise between Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin and only a temporary fix since some posts--such as first deputy premier and finance minister--remain vacant and no one was added to the cabinet to replace those who were dropped. END SUMMARY The shift toward conservatism evident in the new cabinet is a considerable departure from initial post-election assurances by Yeltsin, Gaydar, and apparently even Chernomyrdin to stay on a reformist course. Yeltsin set the reorganization in motion with a 23 December edict ordering Chernomyrdin to prepare a plan to revamp and reduce the cabinet (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 28 December 1993) and a 10 January edict reducing the number of deputy premiers, reorganizing ministries, and apparently dropping state committees from the cabinet (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 January)--see background section. With the reduction of posts, it was likely that some reformers might be dropped from the cabinet, but in his first post-election news conference Yeltsin stated that "Gaydar stays" and "so does the policy that he is pursuing" (Ostankino TV, 22 December 1993). On 13 January Yeltsin personally ensured that prominent reformer Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State Committee for Managing State Property, would remain in the cabinet by reappointing him deputy premier by presidential edict (ITAR-TASS, Russian TV, 13 January). Gaydar himself stated that he would not resign as long as he "felt we are pursuing a sensible course" and cited Chernomyrdin's assurances that there would be no revision of the government's program (Interfax, 29 December 1993). Despite this, Gaydar on 16 January sent Yeltsin a letter of resignation as first deputy premier and minister of the economy, complaining that decisions harming reform had been recently adopted over his objections (Interfax, 16 January). This was followed by Deputy Premier and Finance Minister Fedorov's 17 January ultimatum that he would not accept reappointment unless Deputy Premier Zaveryukha and Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, whom he accused of opposing reform, were removed (Interfax, 17 January) (See Box). Gaydar's resignation and Fedorov's ultimatum threw plans to announce a new cabinet into turmoil. Yeltsin began urgent talks with Chernomyrdin, and on 18 January they spent six hours discussing the makeup of the cabinet (Radio Mayak, 18 January). Chernomyrdin held to his favorites, Soskovets and Zaveryukha, and would not concede to Fedorov's demands (Izvestiya, 21 January), although he did not object publicly to Yeltsin's preemptive reappointment of Chubays. But, as Shokhin publicly stated, the president and premier "have different views" on accepting Fedorov's demands (Interfax, 20 January). Although the president has final power over cabinet appointments, (See Note) he apparently did not or could not persuade Chernomyrdin to add more reformers or meet Fedorov's demands. The list of cabinet appointments announced on 20 January failed to include the key posts of first deputy premier and finance minister and appeared to leave some other posts unfilled also. (Note) According to the new constitution, he appoints deputy premiers and ministers "on the proposal" of the premier (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 December 1993). Some Reformers Remain Without Gaydar and Fedorov, the cabinet loses the two strongest voices for economic reform and tight money, but some reformers still remain. Radical reformers Chubays (deputy premier and chairman of the State Committee for Managing State Property), Viktor Khlystun (agriculture minister), and Russia's Choice leader Andrey Kozyrev (foreign minister) remain, while Shakhray and Shokhin, who have been pushing more moderate reform, gave up their posts as deputy premiers but retained ministerial posts, Shakhray as minister for affairs of nationalities and regional policy and Shokhin as minister of the economy. Moreover, Chubays and Kozyrev have publicly declared that the new cabinet does not necessarily spell the end of reforms (Russian TV, 18 January; Interfax, 24 January). The retention of Shakhray and Shokhin presumably reflects Chernomyrdin's desires more than Yeltsin's. Shakhray and Shokhin split with Gaydar, formed the Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES) to run against Gaydar's Russia's Choice during the election, and began criticizing Gaydar for pushing overly radical reform. PRES leaders trumpeted their support for and closeness to Chernomyrdin during the election. After the election Yeltsin dismissed PRES leaders Aleksandr Kotenkov (as State-Legal Administration head) and Sergey Stankevich (as councillor), and it appeared that he would drop Shakhray and Shokhin from the cabinet in displeasure at their splitting his reform team and contributing to the reformers' election defeat. Interfax on 31 December 1993, for example, reported that the removal of Shakhray and Shokhin was "virtually settled." But instead, Russia's Choice leaders Gaydar, Fedorov, Vladimir Shumeyko (who left as first deputy premier after being elected Federation Council chairman), and Ella Pamfilova (who resigned as minister after Gaydar, Russian TV, 16 January) have left the cabinet, while the PRES leaders remained. Zaveryukha's retention as deputy premier for agriculture presumably similarly reflects Chernomyrdin's support and also the strength demonstrated by Zaveryukha's Agrarian Party in the election and in the newly organized Duma, which elected Agrarian leader Ivan Rybkin speaker. Zaveryukha has been at odds with Gaydar and Fedorov over monetary policy, attacking them for blocking sufficient funds for agriculture. Fedorov made Zaveryukha's removal a condition for accepting reappointment as finance minister, arguing that Zaveryukha was resisting reform (Interfax, 17 January). Implications The cabinet announced by Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin is becoming more of a coalition, with PRES and Agrarian leaders now having equal weight with Russia's Choice leaders. However, its current composition is apparently only a temporary fix as various factions jockey for position, and decisions still have to be reached on the key posts of first deputy premier and finance minister. Chernomyrdin, strengthened by anti-reform election returns, will probably pursue a more moderate reform course, balancing reforms and anti-inflationary measures against demands supported by Soskovets and Zaveryukha to protect industry and agriculture. Background on the Cabinet Restructuring Yeltsin's 10 January edict cut the number of first deputy premiers from three to two and deputy premiers from six to two, expanded the number of ministries from 20 (two others--for press and information and for security--had been abolished on 21 and 22 December) to 23, and cut the number of state committees from over a dozen to nine. The edict listed 67 ministries, state committees, committees, services, agencies, departments, and inspections, but did not indicate which have cabinet status (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 January). A 30 September 1992 Yeltsin edict had clearly specified that ministers and state committee chairmen belong to the cabinet but heads of committees, services, and other agencies do not (Vedomosti Syezda Narodnykh Deputatov Rossiyskoy Federatsii i Verkhnovnogo Soveta Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 15 October 1992). The new constitution, however, declares that the cabinet consists of the premier, deputy premiers, and ministers, with no mention of state committees (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 December 1993). Despite the constitution's definition, Yeltsin subsequently gave Nikolay Golushko, head of the new Federal Counterintelligence Service, the rank of minister (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 24 December 1993) and the new Federal Border Service the status of a ministry (ITAR-TASS, 30 December 1993), and despite his own edict's limitation of deputy premiers to two, three were appointed, as Yeltsin insisted on Chubays' reappointment. The 10 January edict's lack of clarity over exactly who is in the cabinet and who is not is producing confusion, according to commentator Eduard Gonzalez in the 13 January Izvestiya. He noted, for example, that State Committee for Managing State Property Chairman Chubays is still deputy premier but his committee is now apparently outside the cabinet. Gonzalez concluded that the edict is ambiguous and "everyone can, if he wishes, interpret provisions of the edict to his own satisfaction." While the structure of ministries and other bodies is clear from the 10 January edict, the precise membership of the cabinet is not, and though the appointment of several cabinet members was announced on 20 January, most have not been formally reappointed. In fact, Yeltsin's 20 January edict was titled "The First Changes" in the makeup of the cabinet (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 22 January). Some additional ministers--such as Yuriy Kalmykov and Viktor Danilov-Danilyan--were clearly visible in television shots of the first post-shakeup cabinet meeting on 21 January, indicating that they remain in the cabinet. But the agencies and individuals in the cabinet are still only partially clear as of 24 January.

Box Fedorov's Resignation Although Fedorov announced his resignation on 17 January and Yeltsin's 20 January edict on cabinet changes dropped him as deputy premier (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 22 January), Fedorov's status was not finally resolved until 26 January. In addition to the 18 January meeting, Yeltsin held another session with Chernomyrdin on 24 January, which news reports said was to discuss the cabinet's makeup (Interfax, Russian TV, 24 January). Chernomyrdin afterward denied they had discussed the cabinet (Radio Rossii, 24 January) but indicated Fedorov's status was still up in the air, saying that Fedorov's resignation had not been accepted, that Fedorov still continued to hold his post "for the time being," and that it was up to Yeltsin to decide on Fedorov (Russian TV, ITAR-TASS, 24 January). According to Chernomyrdin (Radio Rossii, 24 January), Fedorov must decide whether to join the cabinet--although presumably only as finance minister and without attaining his demand for the removal of Zaveryukha and Gerashchenko. In the meantime Fedorov had escalated his demands, insisting now that the finance minister must have the status of first deputy premier, not just deputy premier (Russian TV, Interfax, 24 January), apparently hoping to gain a stronger position to use in fighting off inflationary cabinet decisions. Finally on 26 January Yeltsin met with Fedorov and accepted his resignation after Fedorov declined to join the cabinet unless his conditions were met (Ostankino TV, ITAR-TASS, 26 January).
