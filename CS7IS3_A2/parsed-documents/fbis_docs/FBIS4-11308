Miguel Alfonso, official spokesman of the "The Nation and the Emigrants" Conference convened by the Foreign Ministry, said the first working session of that meeting resulted in a rich exchange of opinions following the special speech by National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon. The basic proposals of over 200 emigrants attending the meeting included the need to definitively end the U.S. blockade against the island, as well as what they called the "legal limbo" in which some emigrants find themselves regarding citizenship. The visitors voiced their concern that the community residing abroad could become some sort of hostage in the existing dispute between Cuba and the United States. They also expressed interest in the details of measures that may be adopted by the National Assembly in the next special session. The legislative body was convened for 1 May, culminating an analysis of the country's financial situation that extended down to the rank and file with the holding of the so-called worker's parliaments held in over 80,000 work centers. According to Alfonso, another issue about which participants requested information was the potential for the emergence in Cuban society of corruption following certain changes made in light of the country's complex economic situation. The emigrants expressed their desire to contribute as much as possible toward solving transitory economic situations in the country as well as in developing the democratic system.. Responding to questions from the plenum, Alarcon highlighted the risks of introducing an element of division in the nation with the possible introduction of a multiparty system and stressed his support for the single party system in accordance with the current situation. Regarding the issue of citizenship, the conference spokesman explained that Alarcon briefed participants about the Complementary Law, currently under review, and its possible discussion at the Assembly in a relatively short time. The National Assembly president also offered a broad explanation about the existing legislation to participate in the Cuban electoral process, which requires one to live in the country for the last two years in order to vote, run for office, or be elected representative. Alfonso noted the atmosphere of mutual respect at the meeting and the interest of emigrants in the future of their country, which was demonstrated by the participants' words of patriotism. With the arrival of new guests, the number of participants rose to 210, 156 of which came from the United States and the other 54 from other countries. After the debate, Abel Preto, president of the Union of Writers and Artists, gave a speech entitled "Culture, Cubanhood, and Cubanism," which was followed by a question period and an exchange of opinions. Tomorrow morning, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina will speak about immigration issues, another interesting topic for Cubans who live in several nations on different continents.
