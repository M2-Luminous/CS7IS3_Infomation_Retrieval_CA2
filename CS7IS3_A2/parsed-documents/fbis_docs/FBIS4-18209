The debate on electing speakers -- the first item on the agenda when the 12th legislature sits for the first time, April 15 -- was sparked by rumours, later strongly denied, that Forza Italia and the National Alliance favoured centrist reformer [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni for the Lower House speaker's job. The rumour, said Forza Italia spokesman Antonio Tajani this evening, "is without any basis in fact." National Alliance Secretary Gianfranco Fini, in joking mood, told journalists that "I would like to wait until the day after tomorrow before formally presenting Segni: then the Italian people will know it is an April Fool's trick." Forza Italia chief Silvio Berlusconi, in an impromptu press conference this afternoon, agreed that "the concept will be of people from the majority parties," while Marco Taradash, the Pannella List-Reformers member considered close to Forza Italia, said "the speakers offices...must return to the governing parties." For Francesco Speroni, the Senate whip for the Northern League, the opposition should not only be kept out of the speakers' chairs, but should not be allowed to head permanent parliamentary committees either. "As the League sees it, the winners get things now, and the losers will get things next time if they win," he explained.
