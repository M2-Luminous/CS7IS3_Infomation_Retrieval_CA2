Our correspondent Gulsafa Ahmadova interviewed the Iranian Ambassador to Azerbaijan 'Ali Akbar Nahavandian for our program: [Ahmadova] In his address to the nation, the republic's president, Geydar Aliyev, called on international organizations and neighboring states to express their firm stance and views on ending the recently intensified aggression by Armenia. [Nahavandian] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Yes, both sides asked for the views of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Islamic Republic of Iran has exerted efforts on this issue and, as you will remember, our foreign minister, Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati, has worked hard on this case. Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi visited and held talks in Azerbaijan, Armenia and this region for a month. But regrettably, at that time certain forces both in Azerbaijan and Armenia were waging a political struggle against their own people and used the sacrifice the people's lives and their countries' stability for their own political interests. And so those endeavors got no results. There would have been fewer losses had there been peace two or three years ago. This war should end peacefully, but it should be a just peace, that is, these aggressive forces should withdraw from the territory they have occupied. I think that violations of borders and changing of geographical boundaries should definitely not take place in our era. Therefore, from the very first day the Islamic Republic of Iran has opposed this aggression, issued many statements against it, announced its firm position on it, and proposed to constrain this aggression. It will continue doing so.
