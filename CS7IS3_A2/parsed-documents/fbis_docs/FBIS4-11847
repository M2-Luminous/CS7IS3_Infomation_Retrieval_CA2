The delegation is composed of Major General 'Uzi Dayan, Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami', Brig. Gen. Tzvi Stauber, and the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser Yo'el Singer. Military sources told our correspondent Karmela Menashe that the major obstacles in the discussions with the Palestinians have been removed and Israel can now meet the original timetable. Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, one of the Fatah leaders in the Gaza Strip, told Qol Yisra'el this morning that the violent incidents in the Gaza Strip were unconnected to the progress made in the peace negotiations. In his opinion, once the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdraws and the Palestinian police force assumes responsibility for maintaining public order, the police will impose their authority on the entire Palestinian population, including the members of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement].
