USABC will invest a total of $33 million over the next two years in the thin-film lithium polymer battery. Hydro-Quebec has concluded a contract with Yuasa Corporation for the joint development of a next-generation thin-film lithium battery. The potential has emerged of Yuasa joining indirectly in USABC's development project. Under the contract, 3M will provide thin-film lithium polymer to Hydro-Quebec, which will then laminate the film and make the final product--the lithium battery. Argonne National Laboratory will handle performance testing of the prototype battery. Lithium batteries have energy density nearly three times higher than the lead batteries presently used in electric vehicles, but there are safety problems. Safety is said to increase when the batteries are made thin-film ones. In the United States, California, New York, and other states are requiring that 2 percent of all automobiles sold by each car company, beginning with the 1998 model year, be electric vehicles. Yuasa reached an agreement with Hydro-Quebec in January 1992 to develop jointly by 1998 a lithium polymer battery.
