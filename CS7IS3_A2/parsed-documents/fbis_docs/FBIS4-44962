The text of a concluding statement issued from the conference follows: The International Conference on War Crimes and the Blockade's Violations of Human Rights in Iraq met from 5-8 February 1994 in Baghdad. It built on the work of the nongovernmental organizations, societies, unions, and associations that are interested in human rights (and the legal and social issues related to them). Their undertaking obeys the call of similar nongovernmental organizations and societies that work in the legal and social fields related to human rights in Iraq. Representatives of the human rights societies and the societies interested in children, representatives of lawyers' unions and jurists' societies and unions, representatives of cultural and religious societies, and Arab and foreign journalist foundations met together for this noble goal. Likewise, various personalities from the Arab and Islamic world, and all the other parts of the world, attended for this goal. In addition a large number of Muslim and Christian religious people from various countries of the world attended. The business of the conference was arranged around three basic topics. These topics were the objects of dialogue and elaborate discussions that lasted four days so that the participants could study the papers of the [conference's] work and deliver treatises and commentaries on them. The conference began its work on 5 February 1994 with a legal discussion by international law experts of a research paper that a duly-qualified Iraqi committee wrote entitled "Crimes and Violations of the United States and its Allies Against Human Rights in Iraq." The subject of this paper was the fundamental theme of the participants' discussion throughout almost the entire conference. A work session was dedicated to this topic on the first day of the conference's work. Mr. Ramsey Clark, the former American Attorney General, was chosen to lead these sessions, and Dr. Nazar al-'Anbaki was chosen to report the business of the conference. Dr. Muhammad al-Duri presented the Iraqi paper referred to above. Mr. Ramsey Clark delivered a commentary at the start of the session in which he reported that the American war crimes were committed based on the decisions of the Security Council. For this reason, he demanded that the United Nations system be amended. He criticized the Security Council, saying that it became a tool of the war. He demanded of the participants that they remember and carry in their hearts the memory of the thousands of Iraqis who were martyred as a result of the criminal activity undertaken by the United States. He pointed out that he exposed these crimes in his book, The Fire This Time, which is a testimony of the war crimes and the blockade on the Iraqi people. He reported that the blockade does not just kill soldiers, rather it also kills children and, therefore, it is a comprehensive weapon of destruction because of its destructive effects, which are equivalent to the use of nuclear weapons. He demanded that the elimination of their use be worked toward and that a limit to their use be set, and a limit be set to the obstacles imposed on Iraq, because they continue to represent an enduring crime against humanity. He said that he would be happy to listen to the viewpoint [from the perspective] of international law in this conference. After the presentation and discussion of the Iraqi paper, the participants unanimously agreed that the military attack that began the morning of 17 January 1991 began a continuous chain of enemy military actions against Iraq. These actions were taken by the United States and its allies. In view of its purposeful goal of destroying the civil, industrial, and economic structures in Iraq, with no military justification for it, and in view of the concentrated use of weapons and the dreadful, senseless bombing that killed thousands of civilians, the United States and its allies have been committing war crimes that have resulted in immense violations of law. Likewise, its bombing and destruction of inhabited civil defense shelters in which hundreds of women and children and old people fell victim and in which Iraqi soldiers were buried alive on the battlefront, are, by its own description, willful, deliberate, and planned violations that are considered living proof of war crimes. The conference eventually led to a confirmation of what was said in the experts' paper--that the United States violated the rules of international humanitarian law that relate to the protection of civilians during times of armed struggle, and that they broke the Geneva Conventions. Specifically, they broke the third convention relating to the protection of prisoners of war in the field. This resulted in the bad treatment of the Iraqi prisoners, as is represented in their willful abuse, humiliation, attempt at debasement, infliction of bodily and psychological injury, or killing. The documents, reports, and studies presented for the purposes of this conference bore witness to this. The conference also eventually led to confirmation of the responsibility of the United States and its allies concerning violations of the principles of the law of war relating to the styles and methods of killing in two basic respects: The first relates to the choice and expansion of bombing targets that are forbidden by international law--such as civilian leaders; grain and seed depositories; electric energy sources that are needed for health and human services; drinking water networks; military targets that are close to civilian centers, without previous warning; civilian and military hospitals; places of worship; and cultural antiquities. The second relates to the use of prohibited weapons such as spent uranium bombs, vacuum bombs (fuel-air bombs), cluster and fission bombs, and incendiary napalm bombs. All of these are forbidden weapons. Use of these weapons violates the intent of the 1925 Geneva protocol and is considered a violation of the protocol's regulations on prohibition or restriction of the use of forbidden weapons. This protocol is attached to a 1980 agreement on prohibition and restriction of certain traditional weapons that can be considered excessively harmful. In addition, the use violates the regulations of the First Protocol of 1977, the additional addendum to the Geneva conventions of 1949 concerning the victims of war. Concerning the crimes of the blockade, the participants in this conference criticized the tyrannical and harsh method with which the blockade against Iraq was imposed and applied, which represents an unparalleled precedent. Speaking specifically, after Iraq carried out the decisions of the Security Council, in spite of their severity and injustice, continuing to impose the blockade is for political, not legal reasons. Therefore, it is inconsistent with the decrees of the United Nations Charter. And, the use of the blockade as a means of political pressure is a new method in international relations the essence of which is the subjugation of the international organization's decisions to the selfish policies of a powerful, controlling state, which uses its imperialist, tyrannical power to terrorize the member states. The United Nations follows the logic of compliance with the will of the United States and grants it the legal cover required, or that it is forced to follow, toward Iraq, in compliance with the wish of the United States of America. The participants in the conference, in adopting the point of view of the totality of the legal and factual arguments that the international law experts' paper contained, came to the conclusion that continuing the blockade represents rightly a crime of collective annihilation. It represents a crime of collective annihilation by causing deficiency in food, medicine, and health supplies and the prevention of Iraq from using its frozen assets in the international and foreign banks and financial institutions, and enormous number of deaths among children, especially infants, pregnant women, the elderly, and the chronically ill, who are in need of certain types of medicine, as United Nations sources themselves confirmed as well as other neutral sources, and as some of the participants in this conference witnessed with their own eyes. The persistence in this situation is a violation of international humanitarian law; of the international commitment to economic and social rights; of the agreement of the rights of the child, which the United Nations set up in 1989 and which became valid in 1991; and of the principles of the international declaration for human rights. In addition it is a violation of the rules of international morals and of the requirements of the general human conscience. The participating experts found that continuing the blockade raises the problem of responsibility of the Security Council itself and the credibility of the United Nations. The Security Council, which is responsible for maintaining peace and international security, is exceeding its jurisdictional boundaries by randomly devoting all its efforts to fabricating justifications and groundless reasons for continuing the blockade. The blockade continues in spite of Iraq's compliance with the conditions imposed on it by the Security Council. Therefore, they properly interpret this insistence as racist, and one that pays no attention to the tragedy and the suffering that the blockade has caused to a deep-rooted civilized people that has shared in a distinguished way in building human civilization. This situation is considered a violation of the provisions of the Charter, which is built on the foundation of respect for equality in rights among peoples. Human rights organizations, lawyers' unions, nongovernmental societies, and humanitarian organizations presented, on the first day of the conference, their position on the crimes and violation confirmed by the legal experts. They attributed the crimes and violations to the United States and its allies, a topic that was an object of elaborate discussions in the 6 February session, which was headed by Mr. Amin Shaqir from Jordan. Dr. Safiyya Safwa spoke and many participants commented, and the discussion eventually led to the support and confirmation of what was said in the main paper of the [conference's] work presented by the international law experts. The second part related to the effect of the crimes of the blockade on human rights, whether appling in particular to the legal aspects mentioned in the paper or relating to interpretation and factual attestation of the dangerous effects that have arisen by continuing to impose the blockade, for three years and in a severe way, and what have arisen from it in terms of continual deterioration in the social life, living conditions, and health, cultural, and environmental conditions that continue to threaten the basic, precious means of human subsistence. The participants in this conference expressed their resentment and their anger at the continued insistence on violating the Iraqi people's right to precious life. They registered their condemnation of the policies and positions that some of the governments are still taking, particularly the governments of the Western alliance under the leadership of the United States regarding the economic embargo imposed on Iraq and their continued pressure on the Security Council to prevent its taking another serious look at its decisions (in accordance with which the economic embargo was imposed) with the goal of eliminating them or abolishing them completely in order to end the justifications for them. They also expressed their astonishment at the size of the damage that touched the family life of the Iraqi family and social relationships in general as a result of the loss of infants and children and heads of large families due to a deficiency of food and medicine, as the number of deaths among children demonstrate and according to the official statistics accompanying the documents presented in the conference, and the psychological suffering and grief arising from that. Part of the conference was dedicated to the Muslim, Christian, and Sabean religious men. This session was opened on 7 February. Dr. Ibrahim Zaid al-Kilaani was chosen to head this session. A group of religious men representing the Christian and Mandean Sabean religions and all their sects in Iraq and the Arab countries, traveling from Islamic and foreign countries, spoke. They all expressed their agreement that the procedure that imposes the blockade on the Iraqi people is illegitimate because the divine books do not allow starving people or killing them unjustly, or humiliating them, abusing their generosity, or distinguishing between them and their fellow nationalities because of race, religion, language, or color. They cited in their studies and their contributions texts from the Holy Koran and from the Old or New Testaments or the sayings of the prophets that urge human beings to have love for their human brothers and [to practice] brotherliness among the sons of the human race and prevent humanity's oppression of its human brothers, whether in their life, their money, their power or their faith. They all, without exception, criticized the tyranny of America and its oppression of those peoples and governments of the world that refuse to subject their will to the will of the United States Government. This is what they are undertaking against the people and the leadership of faithful and struggling Iraq that practices brotherliness among the religions and respects all religions on the principle that all the faithful are brothers. Likewise, they registered their condemnation of war crimes that America and its allies have committed against the long-suffering and fighting people of Iraq. The speakers and participants made sure to extend greetings to the great people of Iraq and their leader and symbol of their solidarity, President Commander-in-Chief Saddam Husayn, who endures, along with his people of Iraq, all this injury because of refusing to follow the wish of foreign powers and, in particular, his rejection of the imperialist American control over the destinies and riches of the Arab nation. This injury is a result also of his rejection of [the United States'] devotion to humiliating the countries of the South and causing them to miss the opportunity to achieve advancement and growth and mastery of science and technology, intending to maintain their backwardness and exclusion from opportunities for growth and to put obstacles in front of them by the tyrannical power that it possesses and the ability to pressure, based on this power. Likewise, all the participants made sure to express their pleasure with the Iraqi miracle of constructing, building, and restoring, by its own abundant capabilities and by total dependence on itself, what the war destroyed. They considered the experience of Iraq in confronting the destructive effects of the war that the United States and its allies launched against them, in spite of the blockade [already] imposed on it, an unrivaled example to be followed, in addition to its being an indication of the vitality of the Arab nation, its steadfastness, and its capacity for confrontation [of problems] and endurance. Before the end of the conference's business, in the session just before the concluding one, the participants decided to form three drafting committees, for each of the three main issues that were discussed to make recommendations concerning each of the three issues in light of the working papers and participants' contributions. The three committees met on the evening of the 27th in the south hall of the al-Rashid hotel in which the proceedings of this conference are taking place jointly with their curriculum. They noticed that most of the participants' suggestions were primarily founded on the ideas that the international law experts' paper mentioned. Since these suggestions were interconnected, the drafting committees considered the arrangement among themselves in order to prevent repetition, and they found that the participants in the conference decided unanimously on the following joint recommendations: 1. The issuance of statements of affliction and a verdict of guilty expressing the participants' disapproval of the war crimes and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law caused by the blockade on Iraq. No legal or legitimate justification is found that permits the United States and its allies to impose this kind of tyrannical blockade and to continue to impose it in spite of the human tragedy that has been caused by it. It is considered a crime against humanity that is worthy of a verdict of guilty and of consequences and of setting in motion the rules of international responsibility that are appropriate because they are a basis for Iraq to demand just and comprehensive compensation for the damage caused by the violations of international humanitarian law and the adjoining laws of war, as a result of enemy war-like actions. 2. The demand and urging of the human rights organizations and societies working in the legal, political, and religious fields to undertake individual and collective efforts to make known in their countries the war's and blockade's crimes and to pressure their governments and build international public opinion to demand a lifting of the blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. The existence of this method will bring all the peoples eager for their independence and their sovereignty face to face with it. It is practiced now against the people of Iraq with severity and is practiced in differing degrees against other countries in the Third World as a means of political pressure on the political organizations that do not defer to the wishes of the robbery of the United States of America and its allies. 3. The call of the legal and people's nongovernmental organizations for the issuing of publications and periodicals and undertaking active media efforts that disclose to public opinion in their countries the size of the material and significant human damage that has touched the people of Iraq and the accomplishments that their effort and struggle have built over decades. These media efforts should also make clear the dimensions and effects of the blockade and the lack of legitimacy of its contining. The dimensions and effects of its being imposed in this arbitrary way--which is rejected by the general human conscience--and that it shamefully violates the rules of international humanitarian law should also be made clear. The legal experts' paper should be authorized as a basis for this movement and working towards spreading it. 4. The call for the accounting of the people responsible for the war crimes that were committed against the people of Iraq as a result of the significant violations of the allied Western states' war operations led by the United States of America and, in particular, the political and military leaders that gave the orders to bomb inhabited shelters and bury alive Iraqi soldiers in their places, to attack civilian centers and residential concentrations, to launch blind attacks and not take the necessary precautions to guard against civilian casualties, and to practice a type of crime of continuous, collective annihilation resulting from the insistence on continuing to impose the blockade in a way that expresses its imposers' contempt for the simplest human values. These violations are also witnessed in the leaders' lack of mindfulness of the human casualties that befell the Iraqi people, especially with respect to the deaths of children as a result of the deficiency in food or loss of medicine and as a result of the United States' and its allies' declaration as states devoid of divine religions. These religions reject unequivocally what they undertook in using inhuman methods that the divine laws do not consent to, by a blockade in medicines and food imposed on the people of Iraq. Usually, that is a groundless criminal action against God and against humanity. 5. The undertaking of an effective and influential action towards the United Nations directly, its specialized agencies and their centers and offices in all the states, without exception, by way of memoranda, meetings, and the expression of objection to their negativity towards what the people of Iraq have endured as a result of the blockade and the creation of the economic embargo, which was based on the decisions of the Security Council. It has lost all the groundless justifications that it was based on. The powers active in the United Nations system began to use the agencies of the international organization to execute their illegitimate policies at the expense of honor, bread, freedom, and human rights in the countries that oppose procedures of this kind, as a result of the United States' pressure on the international organizations because its uniqueness or isolation as a single power controlling the international system. 6. The revelation and exposure of the double standard followed in international politics and the exploitation of the United States and its allies of human rights as a means of political pressure or for encouraging divisive tendencies, threatening the sovereignty of states, and working towards their crumbling on ancestral or denominational grounds. Also, assuring the exposure of the sabotaging role that the United States undertakes in the international system's present situation and exposing the Zionist influences that push the United States in this direction. 7. The formation of committees from the nongovernmental Arab and international organizations to undertake voluntary work that aims toward making clear the justice of the issue of the Iraqi people on the condition that the Arab organizations carry the responsibility for pursuing the implementation of this suggestion and they outline and put in place the methods of planning and pursuit among themselves. 8. Working toward the arrangement of an international day of solidarity with Iraq in its ordeal, including a general strike or any other method that expresses effective solidarity with the people of Iraq and its leadership, with the vocational and labor unions, and the other nongovernmental organizations arranging it and mixing conferences and festivities with it. 9. The declaration of rejection of discrimination in the treatment of human rights issues and the exposure of the evil intentions that the United States has striven to fulfill against Iraq through the exploitation of this issue for the sake of fabricating justifications for the continuance of the blockade, and its expansion and exploitation in taking possession of Iraq's sovereignty and the unity of its lands by impeding Iraq's practice of its sovereignty and imposing blockade zones in its north and its south, which is considered a scandalous interference in its internal affairs that patently violates Paragraph 7, Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, being inconsistent with the right to self-determination of the sole Iraqi people and their right to choose their political and economic system without mandate or decree or foreign interference reminiscent of decayed imperialist methods. In conclusion, it is appropriate to mention that the participants in the international conference, concerning the war crimes and violations of the United States and its allies against human rights in Iraq, concluded the business of their international conference after ratifying the concluding report and approving the recommendations and statements of the verdict of guilty attached to this report in the closing session, which was held in the hall of the al-Rashid Hotel with the attendance of all the participants, at 1900, Tuesday, 8 February 1994, corresponding to 27 Shaban 1414 of the Hijra.
