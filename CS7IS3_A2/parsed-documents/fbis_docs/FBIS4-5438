The chief justice noted the appeal had rested on two grounds. The first ground of appeal is that the district judge erred in deciding that paint was regarded as an indelible substance under the Vandalism Act. Chief Justice Yong said the act indicates plainly the parliament's intention that all acts of vandalism committed with paint be punished with caning. There is no evidence anywhere to subject all such acts of vandalism to this sort of test of indelibility, which Fay's counsel had suggested. The chief justice said the law clearly states an act of vandalism committed with paint, whether with one type or another, attracts a mandatory minimum of three strokes of the cane. On the second ground of appeal, Fay's counsel had said the district judge should have called for pre-sentence probation report. Chief Justice Yong said the court had been given the discretion to decide rehabilitation for young offenders when balancing the concerns of society. He is satisfied the district judge had fully considered all mitigating factors listed by Fay's counsel, including his youth and plea of guilt.
