Of the total, 7.23 billion yen will be set aside for a project to improve railroad transportation. The project aims at supplying equipment necessary to expand Druzhba station at the border with China which serves as the base for material transportation, and to repair and improve the track. Another 5.74 billion yen will be for a project to tackle air pollution from the Ekibastuz thermal power station in northern Kazakhstan, the officials said. The project aims at installing electric dust collectors and denitrification and desulfurization equipment at the power station. Despite the use of coal for thermal power generation, sufficient environmental preservation measures have not been taken in Kazakhstan since it became independent with the breakup of the Soviet Union, they said.
