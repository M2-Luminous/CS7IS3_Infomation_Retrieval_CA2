This was made clear yesterday by chief of the Defence Force, General Georg Meiring. Addressing a group of journalists at the SANDF Headquarters, Gen Meiring said because the SANDF "did not have the money to maintain such a large permanent force" it would, through rationalisation, have to maintain the same size of the force as it was at present, which, in effect, meant a reduction of 30,000 people. He said because the non-statutory forces' recruits to be incorporated into the SANDF still needed a lot of training, it was not foreseen that people would be "put on the street within a few months or even a year's time." The bridging courses of the new recruits to prepare them for reincorporation into the SANDF would be overseen by a British military assistance team, which will arrive in the country within the next few days. This whole process would take about three years, Gen Meiring said, and would, among others, include the selection of recruits who would after initial training qualify to join the SANDF as permanent force members.
