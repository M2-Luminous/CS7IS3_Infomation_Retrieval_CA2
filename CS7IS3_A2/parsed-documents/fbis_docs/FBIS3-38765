It must do this in order to play a more active role in European security policy and improved defense cooperation, said a working group from the Netherlands European Movement. The Netherlands did not agree to participate in the French-German Eurocorps, but Minister Ter Beek did not rule out joint exercises. In the long term, the Defense Ministry will be appointed as an observer at the French-German Eurocorps. The working group, which is led by the member of the European Parliament, CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] J. Penders, who released the report today, wants troops from the yet to be created German-Netherlands army corps and the already existing British-Netherlands amphibious force to be brought together into two new Eurocorps, which, in addition to their NATO duties, would form a European force. In the second half of next year, the Netherlands will take over the presidency of the WEU, the Western European Union, which is a political and military cooperative association of nine European countries. According to the working group, that would be a good time to table proposals for a large European force, which would be the symbol of a more powerful European security policy and military cooperation. The troops should be at the disposal of the WEU, which, under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty on a common foreign and defense policy for the European Union, has the task of giving form to the new European security identity. According to the working group, it has become easier to develop a European force now that the NATO summit agreed to its own European security effort, in which there is talk of individual but not of separate efforts. The working group also devoted attention to the eastward enlargement of NATO and indicated that the accession of new members would be a long process. "In general it was acknowledged that the West can only have a marginal influence on the balance of power in Russia. Therefore, nobody can accurately say whether a policy of supporting President Yeltsin can be followed," says the report. The working group considers to contact countries of the former Soviet Union and the other members of the former Warsaw Pact.
