The UDI is one of the member parties of the Union for the Republic and Democracy [URD], which broke away from the USOR leadership, accusing it of being driven by Tshisekedi's party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress [UPDS]. The URD considers that the USOR, to which it still belongs, will be henceforth divided into two camps, a moderate one, which it represents, and a radical one, driven by the UDPS and its followers. Kibassa Maliba also announced that the USOR and its allies supported the call for a ghost city demonstration on 27 May. This event is aimed at the "defense of the Transitional Constitution," according to Lambert Mende, information minister for the Tshisekedi government. An initial call to turn Kinshasa into a ghost city was made yesterday morning by the Innovating Forces of the Sacred Union, one of the hardline groups in the USOR "to confirm their confidence in the prime minister-elect". Until this morning, the URD had not made its position known concerning the call for a ghost city operation, or concerning the defection from the UDI.
