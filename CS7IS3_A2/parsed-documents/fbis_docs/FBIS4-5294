The plan is aimed at actively supporting efforts to standardize industrial products in Asia, which has become the center of the world's growth; at launching measures for Asia to create international standard specifications, and at using revised JIS as a guide to maintain the transparency of trade. To clarify its policy to give importance to consumers, the ISTA will consider abolishing standards which attach too much importance to manufacturers. The agency is to formulate a draft plan for the review by the end of April. After being discussed by the Japanese Industrial Standards Committee (chaired by Isamu Yamashita), the plan will be included in the eighth five-year products standardization program, which is to come into effect in fiscal year 1996. The main pillars of the revision will be: 1) internationalization; 2) a shift of importance to consumers; and 3) the flexible adjustment of JIS to new processes such as multimedia technology. Japan has tried to internationalize its industrial standards primarily through adjusting them to those of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). However, because ISO is composed mainly of European countries, only 20 to 30 percent of JIS have so far been adjusted to ISO standards. Meanwhile, it is considered certain that many new products will be developed in Asia, a region with a strong momentum of growth, and various problems will crop up concerning new standards. The government plans to actively participate in the work to establish international standards by such means as promoting standardization mainly in Asia and strengthening efforts to have the ISO approve Asian standards as official ones. This month, the government started discussions on the establishment of a system to promote standardization with the ASEAN Association for Standardizing Quality Control (ACCQ) [acronym as published], which is composed of six Southeast Asian nations. With reference to Japan's know-how, they will work out their own five-year programs for the promotion of standardization and will carry them out beginning April 1995. Japan will also work to establish standards for such products as hearing aids and walking sticks, which are essential to living in an aging society and for a rich life. There are currently no standards for them. On the other hand, it will abolish standards established to promote exchanges of parts between manufacturers, and those for mature products such as sewing machine parts whose shapes are not expected to diversify any further.
