Western governments, however reluctant to act, now believe they have no choice. Before a decision is announced, it is well to consider what is at stake. We have always argued against full-blooded intervention in the former Yugoslavia: first, because it seemed impossible to define attainable military and political objectives; and second, because the principal burden and cost would fall upon Britain and France, in the absence of the will or the means for effective participation by other major powers. We have also urged that political leaders should not damage the credibility of either NATO or the United Nations by indulging in empty threats against the Serbs which they have no intention of making good. Yet, in the event, most Western leaders, including President Clinton and, some months ago, Mr John Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, have succumbed to the temptation to appease public sentiment with strong rhetoric. The Serbs have repeatedly called their bluff, by ignoring vague threats of international action and continuing their brutal assault on Muslim enclaves. Serb defiance of Western pressure has indeed been damaging. If, at some time in the future, other foreign powers, including Russia, feel minded to take aggressive action abroad, why should they heed Western warnings to halt or face the consequences? Western policy towards Yugoslavia has represented the very negation of deterrence. There will often be a good case for non-intervention, as we believe that there has been in Bosnia. But there is never a case for threatening intervention, then failing to make good that threat. And so to the vexed immediate issue, of possible NATO air strikes against the Serbs following the hideous events in Sarajevo on Saturday. Those most eager for such action are, essentially, seeking to use Western firepower to punish the Serbs for their actions, rather than in pursuit of a coherent long-term strategy. We would argue that it is undesirable to use NATO forces merely for punitive purposes. Yet the cost to Western credibility could become disastrous if every United Nations resolution and NATO threat were to be set at naught. At the recent NATO summit, the organisation's political leaders committed themselves to offer the UN whatever degree of military support was necessary to maintain the UN's humanitarian mission and to safeguard the designated UN enclaves in Sarajevo and elsewhere. Thus far, nothing whatever has been done to make good those promises. Now, it must be. As we argued last week, if the UN's humanitarian missions in Bosnia are to continue at all, the necessary degree of force must be used to make them viable. There is a real risk that forcing open roads and driving back Serb artillery by use of ground forces and air strikes will escalate the struggle, and embroil UN forces -- including those of Britain -- more deeply than ever, and at painful cost in casualties. But the alternative, of allowing the world to see that the promises of the West's combined political leaderships are worthless, is even less acceptable. The West's commitment in the former Yugoslavia should remain strictly limited. But such as it is, it should mean what it has said. If the presidents and prime ministers of NATO's member nations find the Bosnian entanglement intractable and embarrassing, it may at least teach them how unforgivable it is to indulge in rhetoric in international affairs to placate domestic opinion, without the will to act upon it. As a result of such rhetoric, compounded by the awesome power of television to influence public sentiment towards simplistic views of intractable problems, it has now become necessary to embark upon a dangerous and possibly foolish course, as the only means of maintaining the credibility of the international community.
