Speaking to journalists after the over two-hour meeting, Boross said the informal conversation concerned the transfer of governmental affairs, and did not cover the coalition talks between the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ). He handed a list of bills and proposed resolutions not yet passed by Parliament to the party heads, and asked the MSZP and SZDSZ leaders to select those they wish to adopt, because the government will withdraw the others. At the talks, the prime minister offered to propose the president of the republic dismiss the radio and television vice-presidents, after it became clear to him that the new cabinet wishes to see a new leadership at the two media. On Thursday [16 June], Boross will put at the parties' disposal the privatization files, a report on state commitments, the balance of external and internal debts, and ministry reports on affairs in progress.
