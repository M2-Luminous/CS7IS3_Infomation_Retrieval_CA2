The interim president of the organization, Mr. Patrick Msibi yesterday said: "In a research which was carried out by the organization from March 1993 to December of the same year, we were able to get hold of tangible evidence to the effect that a confrontation is looming in Swaziland." He said the research also revealed that the forces concerned have since targeted some structures which they want to destroy. These include schools and bridges. He would not name the organizations, but mentioned that they are known. He said the view of Monare is that to most Swazi people who are not satisfied with the current political situation whose foundations were laid by the Vusela [greetings) committees, the negotiation chapter for politics has ended. "Our feeling is that this confrontation could be avoided in the interest of the right to life, property, and economic stability." He mentioned that most countries attain utmost respect for rights through the barrel of the gun. "We feel that Swaziland could be a good example by avoiding this confrontation peacefully," he said. A comment from the police with regard to this claim was not available as senior officers were reported held in a meeting yesterday.
