Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis made the above statement, arguing that nothing at the National Council meetings remains secret. However, in an attempt to lessen the pressure from AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] and EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] for an immediate convening of the National Council -- a view shared by DIKO [Democratic Party] Parliamentary Representative Tasos Papadhopoulos -- the president has decided to call the leaders of the four parties participating in the National Council to hold separate meetings for a "discussion of the latest developments in the Cyprus issue." Yesterday, the president met DIKO Chairman Spiros Kiprianou and today will meet Democratic Rally Chairman Ioannis Matsis, AKEL General Secretary Dhimitrios Khristofias and EDEK Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis. DIKO Chairman Kiprianou told O FILELEVTHEROS that during the meeting they had a general discussion of the latest developments concerning the Cyprus issue with special reference to the confidence-building measures and the reports of the UN experts on these measures. Kiprianou stressed that DIKO categorically rejects the proposed confidence-building measures and added that the reports of the UN experts give another, clearer picture of how dangerous these measures are. Kiprianou added that the president had told him that he is not committed by the reports of the UN experts, and that he will wait for the response of the Turkish side on the three documents of the UN secretary general on the confidence-building measures. For its part, EDEK followed the call of AKEL's General Secretary Khristofias Monday and repeated its demand for the immediate convening of the National Council, "so that the institution does not become obsolete" and questioned whether we can reach a solution without discussing the issue. EDEK claims that the confidence-building measures constitute a solution much worse than the current situation because they provide for two separate states, and have our own signature on it. EDEK's statement notes that the UN experts' report gives a vivid picture of how destructive the confidence-building measures are. It also notes that: "Instead of realizing the decline that our national issue has undergone, the government continues to declare that it is ready to accept the confidence-building measures and that the only remaining issue in order to begin the dialogue is the Turkish side's acceptance. How can the government follow this line despite the opposite position being taken by all parties?" [passage omitted]
