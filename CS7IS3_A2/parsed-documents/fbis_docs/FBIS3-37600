The event did not take place and the speech was postponed until 24 February. Sergey Filatov, leader of the Presidential Administration, gave your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent the reasons for the postponement: "First, Boris Nikolayevich does not feel well and, second, there have been many telephone calls from the leaders of the territories asking for the dates of the president's speech and the enlarged session of the government, which was scheduled for 25 February, to be brought closer together. Otherwise they would have to fly to Moscow too often," Filatov explained. The head of state's state of health is no trifling matter: It gives rise to a host of rumors and suppositions, and it is the prerogative of the attending physician to dispel them. However, it could be suggested that the ailment was most opportune. It enabled the president to take a time-out from the Bosnia crisis and postpone the explanations with parliamentarians on that matter. Recent events in parliament show that mutual relations between the president and the State Duma are becoming strained. It is too soon to talk of a conflict, but.... After some reflection the president cast doubt on the legitimacy of the lower chamber speaker's election. In reply the parliament almost denounced the Belovezhskaya Forest agreements (they were 30 votes short). And as previously promised it created a parliamentary commission to investigate the events in Moscow in September-October last year. Only 46 people voted against this (in other words, it was also supported by deputies from Russia's Choice). Unlike the criminal investigation instituted into the mass disorders on 3-4 October, the results of the parliamentary investigation will carry a political assessment. It may be variance with the Prosecutor's Office investigators' findings. So a return to this question (albeit at the level of parliamentary hearings) is hardly what Boris Yeltsin wants. The parliamentarians decided to move from the City Hall building offered by Yeltsin to one of three other places: the White House, Staraya Ploshchad, or...the Kremlin. "How practicable is this decision?" I asked the initiators of the idea. "We will elevate the document to the rank of a law," Anatoliy Lukyanov replied. Whether this influenced the president's team or not is hard to say, but Sergey Filatov came to the latest session of the Duma Council (a body which includes the leaders of the factions and the speaker) and offered the lower house of parliament the former USSR State Planning Committee building on Okhotnyy Ryad Street where the Russian Federation Economy Ministry is presently located. The Council agreed, but whether the Duma will agree is another matter. The building is in need of capital repair which could take as long as the deputies' entire term of office. There is a reason for the parliamentarians' show of autonomy. The Duma clearly does not like the bit-part which Boris Yeltsin has assigned to it. At the moment mutual relations are typified by the unsophisticated formula: "I adopt the decisions, you ratify them." The deputies' factions received the text of Russia's treaty with Georgia the very day before the signing, when there was no longer any point in discussing it. They had missed the boat. Hence the problems with ratification.... The president's moves always take deputies by surprise. The Duma does not have 20 people to set out the Boris Yeltsin's position on this or that question, let alone lobby for his ideas. But what about Russia's Choice? It is distancing itself increasingly from the president. Added to that is the clear absence of factional discipline. Burdened by their political weight, many of the Russia's Choice people are steering clear of routine parliamentary work. This is clearly visible from the balcony -- from the right, crew-cut ranks of the Communists, the Cgrarians, and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. From the left -- the preserve of People's Choice -- the vast open spaces of empty seats. What is the point of lobbying there?
