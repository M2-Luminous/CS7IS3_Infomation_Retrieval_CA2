They kept us for 68 hours in a cell deep under the ground without electricity, in the middle of urine, on a cement floor, without food and blankets. We have been beaten with batons," said the socialist deputy Moikom Zeqo in a statement made yesterday to Albanian TV. The deputy Zeqo and the chairman of the Party of the National Unity, Mr. Idajet Beqiri, were arrested two days earlier in Montenegro accused of illegal entry into the country. The accused have denied the charge. After a staged trial in Montenegro, the two Albanians were sentenced to twenty days in prison, which was reduced to ten days upon appeal. Mr. Zeqo has addressed a protest against the acts of Montenegro police to the European Parliament, President Clinton, and the People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania.
