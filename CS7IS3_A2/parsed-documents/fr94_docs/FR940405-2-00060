FR940405-2-00060 FR940405-2-00035 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Supplemental Final Environmental Impact Statement (SFEIS) Availability Notice is hereby given that the General Services Administration (GSA) has prepared a Supplemental Final Environmental Impact Statement (SFEIS) documenting the effects associated with the following project modifications: •Changes in the housing program for the new Federal Courthouse and Federal Office Building, which resulted in travel characteristics and were different than those assessed in the DEIS and FEIS. •Changes in the new Federal Buildings design due to the preservation of a portion of the ``African Burial Ground.'' The new Federal Courthouse and Federal Office Building are currently under construction on sites bounded by Worth and Pearl Streets, adjacent directly east of the existing New York County Courthouse (site of the new Federal Courthouse), and the block bounded by Broadway, Reade, and Duane Streets, and Elk Street (site of the new Federal Office Building). As part of the analysis, certain significant adverse impacts were disclosed and mitigated if possible. Such significant impacts include: •Significant traffic impacts at proximate intersection. •Significant impacts on known cultural resources. Written comments on the SFEIS will be accepted until May 13, 1994, and can be submitted to: Mr. Peter A. Sneed, Director, Planning Staff, General Services Administration, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1609, New York, New York 10278, (212) 264&hyph;3581. Copies of the SFEIS are available at the following locations: General Services Administration, Business Service Center, Room 112, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York 10278. Dated: March 18, 1994.
