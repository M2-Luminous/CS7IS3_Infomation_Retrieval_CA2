As a result of talks between former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and DPRK President Kim Il-song, it has become likely that high-level U.S.-DPRK talks will be resumed. Besides, an unexpected by-product was gained as ROK President Kim Yong-sam accepted DPRK President Kim Il-song's call for holding a summit meeting. It is still uncertain whether the summit will be realized or not, but if leaders of South and North Korea can hold a direct dialogue, it will definitely bring a historic turnabout in the Korean peninsula where the Cold War structure still persists. Since North Korea announced its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN Security Council [UNSC] has been hurrying to work out a sanctions resolution against this nation. The situation has been such that if the council had gone ahead with the resolution, distrust would have generated more trust, thus bringing about unexpected developments. We welcome the fact that the tension in the Korean peninsula is easing for now and dialogue will resume. We strongly hope that North Korea will attend the high-level U.S.-DPRK talks with a sincere attitude to clear up the nuclear suspicion harbored by all nations. We also hope that the United States will make the most of this precious opportunity in finding a clue to a breakthrough in the situation through tenacious negotiations. Carter said that Kim Il-song promised to freeze the nuclear development program on condition that the United States will agree to resume talks with the DPRK and also will render support in converting its [graphite] reactors into light water reactors. President Kim is also supposed to have asked for assurances that the United States and other nations will not make North Korea their target of attack. This may indicate that North Korea is extremely anxious that it is continually exposed to the danger of a military attack. Nations isolating themselves from others tend to have such notions. Carter made his visit to North Korea as a "private citizen." But his trip, which may bring a breakthrough to the situation, showed to the world how important it is to keep open the channels of dialogue no matter what happens. Carter said he has received an invitation from President Kim several times since 1991. He is said to have made the visit at this time because confrontation over the nuclear suspicion was intensifying and, meanwhile, there was no direct dialogue with North Korea, which was the party involved. We would like to praise his insight and willingness to act. President Bill Clinton has indicated that in principle, he will use the efforts made by the former president as a lead toward finding a solution to the issue. We think that is a good plan. We hope that the U.S.-DPRK working-level meeting, expected to be held early next week, will lead smoothly to high-level talks. When looking back on the past, we realize that it is not easy to clear up nuclear suspicions. If North Korea truly does not have either nuclear weapons or intentions to build them, it should be able to accept full inspections to satisfy the international community. Meanwhile, the United States on its part should suspend its current activities toward preparing for UNSC sanctions. China and Russia, which are UNSC members, were originally opposed to or skeptical about imposing sanctions immediately. In order to elicit a sincere attitude from North Korea and to have the international community united in dealing with the issue, we must follow the direction of the dialogue to resume soon. As far as the South-North summit talks are concerned, we cannot make an optimistic prediction, since the holding of such talks has been called for by both nations several times in the past but has never been realized. But we would like to take both leaders' intentions to hold a direct dialogue at face value. Hopefully, this bud of dialogue will be handled carefully and nurtured into full bloom.
