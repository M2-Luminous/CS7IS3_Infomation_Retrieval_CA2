The government will quickly work out concrete and detailed measures by the end of June. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will attend meetings of administrative vice ministers of all ministries and agencies on 9 May to urge positive action on deregulation. He will also reaffirm the government stance on deregulation at economic cabinet ministers' talks to be held on 10 May. To prevent a further rise in the yen's value on the foreign exchange market, the government has decided it is most important not only to take direct measures, such as market intervention, but also to promote economic reform at home--for instance, by easing regulations and ensuring continued expansion of domestic demand.
