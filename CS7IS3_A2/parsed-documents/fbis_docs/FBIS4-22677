Zhirinovskiy at Seventh Interregional LDPR Conference"] [Text] Politics is the same as economics. If there is a shortage of raw material, you do not, for example, manufacture more dictating machines, if you lack the raw material, the factory comes to a halt. You are short of engineers. You have the raw material, but there are no engineers. Or the workers have given up working. Exactly the same in a party. The same mechanism. There should be no abstract thinking here: The party has divine origins. This has stuck in our minds because of the CPSU: The CPSU was God-given, as it were.... There was no other such party anywhere. This is the fate of Russia, it was always unique. Tsarism was for 300 years one family. There was change everywhere, but with us 300 years of the one Romanov family. They grew sickly because one family means no fresh blood. They marry cousins. It is bad when there is no change. This was where the CPSU became burned out. The one-party system has its advantages, but if there are other parties, which criticize, if there is an opposition. And when they are absent, the party is unnecessary also. We are a country just like all others, but our mechanism of government does not afford us an opportunity to catch up with the advanced countries. And when we lag behind, we have, of course, an inferiority complex, and we start to get agitated, although at the same time we outpace others in some respects. Where we do outpace them is with the army, and we are casting this aside. The Russian Army was the strongest at the start of the century. We have just gone and broken it up. The Democratic Russia types are betraying their people--us--and attempting to do everything to please the Americans, failing to understand that this will do nothing for us, the Americans will give us nothing, they are continually making promises, but they themselves have no spare money. And no one will feed a competitor. No one will give anything, neither the Japanese nor the Germans. Our line, therefore, must be an independent foreign policy, and within the country we must approximate the version that prevailed in tsarist Russia, that is, introduce territorial division--provinces. All these federative treaties are useless. The breakup of the state would always be occurring with them because Tatarstan, Chuvashia, and Buryatia and the Khanty, Mansi, Komi, Permi, and so forth--they would all attempt to clothe themselves in a national covering, but the economy would not stand this. Bread cannot be Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijani. Bread is for everyone. We cannot have the Abkhaz going hungry, the Georgians replete. Nationalism, therefore, is a weapon that will only lead to war, nothing good would come of this. We should have a state and normal borders. With slight revision they should be preserved. Voluntarily, otherwise there will be war. War not with Russia--among themselves. They are now beginning to understand this. They are now filing back. They are now ready to return: Azerbaijan and Armenia and Tajikistan. Kazakhstan and Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] are unhappy also. What kind of democracy is it when the president himself does not know whether, although he is president today, he could be assassinated tomorrow. Because terrorism, political included, and gangsterism and uncontrollable processes are very difficult. But they are a school: If you remove the director and the teachers, the students scamper about. A strict director, teachers, and a bell are needed, then this school functions. Take away these elements, all the classrooms are empty, the desks overturned, and the books discarded. Here's an ordinary example. So with the state also. We remove the president, we remove the army and the police, we remove the borders--there is no state. It is stupidity saying that the army can be removed, that the borders are unimportant. There would be gangsterism. Gangsters would run riot. They are already doing so today. They are already killing daily. Blood in Moscow every day. We are in a state of war. All hospitals will soon be like field hospitals. Diphtheria has already come to Moscow. What is the problem with Yeltsin? The public sector should not have been destroyed. Everything would be fine. Dealing with the economy, but not destroying the public sector, the kolkhozes and sovkhozes, but strengthening them. After all, the country is chock-full of spare land. Hands off the kolkhoz land. Give those who wish to engage in agriculture--the farmers--the spare land. Hands off enterprises that are operating successfully. Hands off the AZLK [Lenin Komsomol Moscow Auto Works], authorize private automotive services, let the private operators service vehicles day and night, and the AZLK consistently improve its production. But this was not done because our leaders did not know how, the scenario was different--destruction of the country. This was not a mistake of Aganbegyan, Gaydar, or Yavlinskiy's team. The predetermined scenario was demolition of our state. They busied themselves immediately, therefore, not with economic reform but the creation of people's fronts. It was they who attempted to ensure that the CPSU depart the political arena as gently as possible and that it be replaced by people's fronts. Elchibey came to power in Azerbaijan. And when he became superfluous, he was driven out, and the old one, Aliyev, returned once more. Or in Moldavia [Moldova] the same people's front. Lucinschi--the former secretary of the Communist Party of Moldavia Central Committee--has returned. And Brazauskas has returned in Lithuania. In two years--there they are again everywhere. The army cannot be accused of treachery in a strong state because it defends this state, it cannot be a traitor. The Chilean option is impossible here: There is no candidate for the role of Pinochet. Makashov, Yazov could not have been such. Gromov--an Afghan veteran general--could not. Varennikov could have performed this role, but he is old, near 70. Who arrested Beriya? Rokossovskiy, commander of air defense of the Moscow District. The army assumed this function. Makashov and Yazov displayed weakness, they could not do it. Defense Minister Yazov honestly admitted: "I am not Pinochet." Had he not committed tanks to Moscow at that time, there would have been no Emergency Committee. We have no Pinochet candidate. Zhukov could have been, but he is dead. Zhukov could have played the part of de Gaulle. The period coincides: De Gaulle came to power in France in 1953, Zhukov here was removed in 1956. All the other way about. Instead of putting General Zhukov, war hero, militant, strong, decisive, in the place of Khrushchev, an ignoramus, Khrushchev removed him. A general comes to power in a civilized country. And Eisenhower in America--a fighting general also. In these years America and France put fighting generals in power, at the head, as presidents, as civilians. We clear ours out. They, our generals, had experience and were decisive and intrepid people. They were removed, and such semi-imbeciles as your Khrushchev were installed, and around him was this whole team, Podgornyy. These people were incapable. The rayon is their level. And they were elevated to the height of a vast state. The most powerful state in the world. That's what the problem is. We should have a special selection of personnel. This is the problem of the one-party system because, had there been opposition parties, Khrushchev, Podgornyy, Chernenko would never have been in power. But with a one-party system, the ten of them together make the decisions. There are ten of them, they decide who will head this party, who will be head of the state. The whole problem with the communists, the one-party system, was that, as they departed, they left an entirely undisciplined people: People can decide nothing, they do not want to. They did not have to think, everything was decided for them. And the party did not support the Emergency Committee. In Moscow alone there were 1 million members of the CPSU. In Russia, 10 million. Throughout the country, 20 million. And they did nothing. Where was the party? We cannot have just one person thinking in the Kremlin. The communist rank and file did not think. They did not have to: open up PRAVDA--the decisions of the Politburo are in there. And the entire country did not think. I am speaking about the system. I am not saying that they had some false slogans. The system itself was no good. We did not have to think, they decided everything for us every two or three months. Ten persons would meet in session, and PRAVDA would print it for us: Do this. Some people say that things were good in the stagnation times. True, they were good for me also. But the golden days, when we would eat up what we did not have, are over. You cannot eat everything up, you have to set some things by. Eat a little, set a little by, and we use the interest alone--only the interest. But we simply ate through our entire income. We are now left without anything. Things were good under Brezhnev, but what are we to do now? The Democratic Russia people also can objectively do nothing now because there is nothing. Our industry demanded renewal: Everything here is old. We had giant-mania: more doctors and teachers, but little use. We need quality, only quality. We need to fight for this. We fought for quantity. We lost out here. Quantity is good in a time of war: capture a large amount of territory. Quantity is needed then. But in civilian life only quality is needed. Having experienced all this, we should not return to what was bad, to the old ways. We should take from tsarist Russia only the country's division into provinces. This was outstandingly well done. Catherine II did it over 200 years ago. An excellent option. Today we have 89 regions, but they are tiny, consequently, Russia needs 70 provinces with 2 million persons, approximately, in each. Some 150 persons altogether. It is this that should be taken from tsarist Russia. Tsarist Russia's was a mixed economy--that could be taken also. The State Duma--the first Russian parliament--the name, could be taken, it was bicameral, a Senate. This could be taken. Problems of social security could be taken from the communists because, regardless of the events in the country, the old people are not to blame, each of us will be old. If a new revolution is begun when we are all 70, and we are once again left without pensions, without accommodations, without health care--this is preposterous. Social problems were tackled pretty well under the communists. Everyone had a physician for free, a pass to a recreation center sometimes and some kind of roof over his head, and a minimum diet. A person could live on a pension, he could live at least somehow on R50. We could take the solution of social problems from the communists, therefore. The decisions concerning pioneer camps, say, were pretty good. Is this a bad thing? Remove the word "pioneer," simply youth camps. But the children had a holiday, it was better than now, when they are washing cars. You may wash cars, but let whoever wants to go on holiday, go on holiday. Paid tuition is possible, but there must necessarily be tuition for free also. Some things may be taken from the communists, therefore. And we should take what world experience has accumulated, namely, a multiparty system. It is better taking the common, tried-and-tested path, we would do better to abandon experiments at this time.
