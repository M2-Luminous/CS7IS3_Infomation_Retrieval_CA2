FR941216-1-00119 FR941216-1-00012 (3) Cutting tools shall be chemically compatible with the pyrotechnic material to be machined, capable of maintaining a sharp cutting edge throughout the machine cycle. (4) Control measures such as guides, bushings, and stops shall limit depth, diameter, and contour of the cut. The lineal and rotational speed of tools for the machining of pyrotechnic material shall be the minimum necessary for safe and efficient operation. Controls should be designed to prevent unintended operator adjustment. (5) Drilling operations shall not impede the flow of chips and coolant in the bore. The drilling of small holes (one-quarter inch or less) and any size of multiple drilling operation shall be performed by remote control, with operator protection, unless documented hazard analysis or tests prove this unnecessary. (6) Contoured cutting tools shall be removed from contact with the pyrotechnic material being machined before personnel are permitted to enter the machining area. Frequently cleaning machine tools during operating hours shall prevent residues from accumulating; a thorough cleaning shall conclude each work shift. Vacuum accumulator systems, immersion in liquid coolant streams, or similar automatic means shall remove the pyrotechnic waste products. Only low pressure (10 PSIG) compressed air may be used as a coolant and only when the scattering of pyrotechnic particles is contained by a vacuum collection system. The coolant delivery tube shall have a metallic tip or nozzle grounded to the machine to reduce static charges. (c) Specific guidance for machining. (1) Drilling and facing operations for colored smoke compositions containing organic dyes, potassium chlorates, and sugars should be conducted at not more than 2475 lineal inches per minute, with the feed rate adjusted to enhance the machinability of the composition. For red phosphorous compositions, drilling and facing operations should be conducted at not more than 1100 lineal inches per minute with the feed adjusted to minimize friction and heat buildup. For extruded candles composed of magnesium, tetrafluoroethylene polymers, and fluoroelastomer binders, drilling and machining operations shall be conducted at not more than 530 lineal inches per minute. (2) Hand trimming and cutting of pyrotechnic candles may be permitted when supported by results of a hazard analysis specific to that composition and candle configuration. (3) Sawing operations require particular care, to prevent work from plunging into the saw blade and to ensure that chips are removed from sawteeth before their next cutting pass. Plunging can occur when thin sections are force-fed into coarse-pitch saw blades. To prevent this, a minimum of two saw teeth shall remain in contact with the work during sawing, or the work feed shall be controlled. Chip accumulation in the saw teeth is a function of the material being sawed, rate of feed, blade speed, tooth design, and flushing arrangement. Additional chip removal equipment such as blade-wiping brushes may be required. ยง184.82 Spill control. Spills of pyrotechnic composition and energetic ingredients pose potential hazards. In case of accident, the responsible supervisor should be notified before any action to clean or contain the spill. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for pyrotechnic operations shall cover spill cleanup, either as part of the various operations detailed or as a separate procedure. The procedures shall specify which actions are to be taken by whom and in what order. The recovery of the spilled material and decontamination of the area shall also be addressed. ยง184.83 Collection of pyrotechnic wastes. (a) Waste material and scraps shall be removed at regular intervals from all operating areas. All waste material shall be segregated by type and compatibility, and kept separate from common wastes. Containers for these materials shall be distinguished by color and labeled. Filled containers shall be placed at designated collection points. (b) Special care shall preclude the mixing of small quantities of water with powdered or finely granulated metals. Pyrotechnic waste may be maintained dry or submerged in water or oil, whichever is appropriate for disposal. Plastic liners for waste containers facilitate cleaning. Liners should be conductive when contents are subject to initiation by static electrical discharge. ยง184.84 Cleaning of pyrotechnic processing equipment. (a) As pyrotechnic materials are sensitive to friction, impact, or static discharge, cleaning this equipment poses hazards. Because personnel shall be near the equipment being cleaned, risks may exceed those of processing. Therefore, cleaning shall receive the same planning and SOP coverage as production. (b) Solvent solution flushing and cleaning by remote control is required for slurry-type mixing operations. For other applications, the process equipment shall be flushed with a compatible solvent and drained, with the process repeated as often as necessary to remove the pyrotechnic composition. High-pressure water wash may be used when compatible with the pyrotechnic composition. Precautionary measures shall be taken when a solvent represents a fire or toxicological threat. Runoff from cleaning operations shall be controlled to preclude the creation of a secondary hazard from the spread of contamination. (c) When remote cleaning cannot be used, personal protective equipment shall be designed and proven by test to afford operator protection from the maximum quantity of material that could be present, and its use shall be required. ยง184.85 Personal protective equipment. (a) Personal protective equipment shall not be relied upon as the primary means of operator protection. The primary means should be by reducing the quantities being handled to the minimum necessary or by using operational shields. Supplemental operator protection should be afforded by high-speed deluge systems designed and installed for such purposes. The personal protective apparel prescribed in an SOP shall be based upon the hazards associated with the operation. (b) The minimum protective apparel for personnel exposed to open containers of pyrotechnic or energetic raw materials shall consist of the following:
