The press statement pointed out that the forum, the largest ever held in Australia, "reflected the importance the Australian and Chinese Governments placed on developing the bilateral trade and economic relationship." The joint press statement was released at the forum by Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan and visiting Vice-Minister Gu Yongjiang of China's Ministry for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. Gu led a largest Chinese trade delegation, consisting of more than 100 businessmen from 20 out of China's 30 provinces and municipalities, who have brought with them over 500 projects, worth 7 billion U.S. dollars. The two officials held that the forum has created an opportunity to deepen and strengthen the economic relationship between the two countries." The two-way trade has increased rapidly in recent years. In 1993, the trade volume between the two countries enjoyed a record high of 3 billion U.S. dollars, up 29 percent over the previous year, according to China's official figures. Latest Australian official figures indicated that China has become the 6th largest trading partner of Australia and Australia has become the 10th in China's largest trading partner list. The two sides agreed that the current trade and investment levels were only a small proportion of what would be achieved as the economic relations matured. "The development of the economic relationship would be assisted by trade and economic regions both countries were pursuing and by the formalization of China's status in the GATT," the statement said. The two ministers reaffirmed that in line with the understanding contained in the Australia-China Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, the two sides will continue to -- Take a purposeful and systematic approach to removing trade and investment barriers; -- Maintain MFN as a basis for trade between the two countries; -- See an early settlement of China's GATT status; -- Encourage closer integration of mineral, agricultural and raw materials processing sectors; and -- Encourage further visits by ministerial-level trade delegations and senior government and business officials. The two officials believed that economic complementarities between the two countries have created potential for ventures and projects in areas of raw materials and mineral process as well as manufacturing and services.
