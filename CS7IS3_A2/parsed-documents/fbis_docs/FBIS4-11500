Goldenberg, who is attending the GATT conference of ministers, which closes today in Marrakech, one of the main Moroccan cities, said the WTO "is the corollary to the liberalization policy advocated by Peru." He said the Peruvian modernization process seeks to achieve social development through the enforcement of an economic liberalization and stability program. Goldenberg also stressed the policies for the promotion of private investments, the changing role of the state, the privatization of state companies, and the elimination of all types of subsidies in Peru. As for tariff commitments established within the framework of GATT, Goldenberg emphasized the Peruvian Government's decision to offer a 30 percent tariff ceiling, one of the most attractive in Latin America. The prime minister said Peru has opened its doors to the world market by simplifying its tariff system and by reducing its tariff levels to only two rates, 15 and 25 percent, and that the first of these rates is applied to 97 percent of Peruvian imports. Regarding the relation between trade and the environment, Goldenberg said Peru "is very concerned about safeguarding the environment, but we do not want protectionist measures to be concealed behind the enforcement of environmental measures." As for the "social clause" that several European countries have proposed to be included in the Uruguay Round agreements, Goldenberg reasserted that although Peru is a member of the International Labor Organization and a signatory of the majority of agreements that safeguard labor rights, it views with concern trends that in allegedly defending these principles seek to promote new forms of protectionism that will distort international trade. He said safeguarding both the environment and labor rights were proposed for inclusion in the final text of the Uruguay Round agreements, which will be signed today and will establish the WTO, after four days of negotiations of representatives from 120 countries.
