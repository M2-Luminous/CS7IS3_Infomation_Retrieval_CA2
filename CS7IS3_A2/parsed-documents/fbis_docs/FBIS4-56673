We regret the emotional reactions of FMLN comrades over the fact that a group of FMLN deputies exercised its legal right to nominate and be nominated for positions on the Legislative Assembly's Board of Directors. 2. It concerns us that offensive and fallacious attitudes are being fostered in the internal debate. There is talk of expulsions or punishment, impossible to apply to something that is legal and normal for any democratic party in the world. This attitude projects an image of the FMLN as an authoritarian party. 3. We appeal to the FPL [Popular Liberation Forces], the PC [Communist Party of El Salvador], and the PRTC [Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers] to remain calm and to seriously pursue a new internal agreement. This agreement should define the terms of the alliance between the two tendencies that throughout the FMLN's history have existed and that have had innumerable differences. The war is over. None of the currents can any longer be a political prisoner for attempting to maintain the image of a united party that has never really existed. The political identity of each tendency is as important as our alliance in facing the right wing. 4. We hereby suggest that there be a mature debate of the main points that differentiate us, such as the true or apparent acceptance of a market economy and private property, the struggle inside the system or control of the system, the validity or invalidity of Marxist-Leninist precepts, the acceptance that we are living a new reality in a developing democratic process while defending the challenging and confrontational manner of speech or political style. 5. We believe that the parliament's work is a matter of dialogue, negotiations, and agreements among political parties. This is why deputies are elected. This is why we never considered as negative the search for understanding that comrades in the FPL, PC, and the PRTC undertook with ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] with regard to holding positions on the Board of Directors. We want to point out to you that it was a political error not to make proposals on the day established for this. Because of this, you projected an image of rejecting the system that was not positive while you lost the opportunity for the plenum to chose you. We always made it known to you that we would nominate candidates if we did not reach consensus on this point and if the majority tried to impose nominations on us. We have not acted behind anyone's back nor was there any need to reach agreement with anyone. We only nominated candidates according to the deadline, setting aside for subsequent discussion the problems of the Assembly's internal rules. 6. The RN and the ERP reconfirm their support for the left wing's renovation and modernization in keeping with the new realities of peace, thus effectively defending the popular interest. We reject challenging and anti-system attitudes that seek to soothe the ideologically conscious but that do not produce specific results for the people, while projecting a war-mongering and conflictive image that alienates the support of the vast majority. We favor strengthening our credibility as a political party that is satisfied with the rules of the game and that accepts and respects its adversaries. In this way its coming to power does not constitute a threat to any sector of Salvadoran society. [signed] ERP and RN Political Commission and Deputies
