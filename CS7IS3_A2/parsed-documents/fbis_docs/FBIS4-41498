[Ramzan Khadzhiyev] The forces of law and order in the Chechen republic are not having the best of times. After another presidential purge, many heads of the power structures have lost their jobs, including the procurator general, the heads of certain power departments and heads of militia area divisions. Dudayev is not attacking the Internal Affairs Ministry and procuracy so much for the assassination attempt on him, as for the paralysis in the power forces when faced with criminal groups. [Begin Dudayev recording] The heads of all power forces are to carry out a thorough investigation into officials in the bodies of law and order and security who are directly responsible for ensuring the safety of top officials, law and order, and observance of legislative discipline. The toughest measures are to be taken against them, up to and including instigating criminal charges. [end recording] [Khadzhiyev] The decree has been published, and the passions around it have still not died down. Those fired are looking for high-ranking intermediaries in order to return to their comfortable offices. Criminal elements are on their guard and biding their time.
