An exchange of opinions was held on the political and socioeconomic situation in the states on the territory of the USSR and on further steps to strengthen the unity of the communist movement. The participants in the meeting note that the years since the criminal destruction of the USSR -- contrary to the will of the peoples -- have confirmed the correctness of the fundamental assessments of the congresses of the communist parties of the states and of the conclusions of the 29th CPSU Congress. The pursuit of sovereignty has checked the economic development of all the states, while the economic reforms being pursued are a mere screen for a tiny section of the population to appropriate the national wealth created by generations of Soviet people. The collapse of the Union, the plundering of national wealth, and the emergence of unbridled nationalism have split the Soviet people up into national compartments and divided them into a handful of rich and millions of poor. All this has resulted in economic catastrophe and a drastic worsening of ethnic and social conflicts. The economic damage inflicted on the Soviet people and our common Homeland is five times greater than that caused during all the years of war against fascist Germany. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet people have perished in ethnic wars and millions have become refugees or jobless, doomed to suffer misery and poverty. The lofty achievements of our national culture are being displaced by Western mass culture, with its cult of money and violence. Free medical care and education are being replaced by paid services, which are becoming beyond the means of an ever-increasing number of citizens. Millions of people waiting in line for housing or actually homeless are losing hope of obtaining accommodations. Only the death rate, corruption, and criminality are on the increase. The death rate exceeds the birth rate in the majority of former Union republics. Three to four times as many people die each year at the hands of criminals than during the 10 years of the Afghan War. In these conditions the peoples of the states are beginning to realize the antipeople nature of the ruling regimes and to pin their hopes on replacing them by establishing people's power based on an upsurge of the communist movement and progressive left-wing forces. The states' party organizations have drawn the requisite lessons from their heavy defeat. They have cleared out the traitors, careerists, and timeservers. The majority of the states' Communist Parties are completing their organizational formation and are waging a hard-hitting campaign on behalf of the interests of workers, the working peasantry, and the people's intelligentsia. The common goals of the states' communist parties are as follows: - service to the working people; - socialism and communism as the historic future of mankind, freedom and social equality, collectivism, social justice, and genuine humanity; - the achievement, defense, and strengthening of the political power of working people in the form of soviets and the development of socialist democracy and broad self-management by the people; - resistance to the restoration of capitalism and the resumption of a socialist path of development in the republics of the USSR -- which most fully meets working people's social needs; - the ending of ethnic conflicts and the prevention of civil wars on the territory of the USSR; - the restoration of the USSR as a voluntary association of sovereign states based on the principles of Soviet patriotism, internationalism, the fraternity of the peoples, and respect for national traditions in accordance with the decision of the nationwide referendum of 17 March 1991, when three-quarters of the adult population of the country expressed itself in favor of retaining the USSR; - the reconstitution of single republic Communist Parties and their amalgamation as the USSR is restored into a single Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In defining their political strategy and tactics the parties are guided by Marxist-Leninist teaching and materialist dialectics in their creative development and underpinned by analysis of the specific historical situation and the achievements of national and world science and culture. The parties employ both parliamentary and nonparliamentary means of political struggle within the bounds of existing legislation to achieve their set goals. While endorsing the correctness and timeliness of the 29th CPSU Congress decision on the temporary reorganization of the CPSU into the UCP-CPSU, the participants in the meeting consider that the states' communist parties are, while maintaining their own organizational autonomy, program documents, and rules, an integral part of a single communist movement on the territory of the USSR. The participants in the meeting note that certain provisions of the UCP-CPSU Rules and Program are out of date and do not take full account of the special features of the work of the states' communist parties in modern conditions. The conference instructs the UCP-CPSU Council, in conjunction with authorized representatives of the parties, to draft common principles governing programs and rules and to submit them for examination at the 30th UCP-CPSU Congress and other partywide forums. The participants in the meeting regard the present coordinating conference of leaders of the communist parties of all the states formed on the territory of the USSR as a standing conference. The participants in the meeting instruct all communist parties to concentrate their efforts on elaborating and theoretically validating our common goals, coordinating the parties' joint efforts to achieve them, propagating the experience of political work in labor collectives, and supporting and disseminating communist and opposition socialist-oriented mass media. The participants in the meeting condemn all attempts to split the communist parties and their regional organizations and the creation of multiple communist centers and advise communists to unite in single organizations to enhance their influence among workers, peasants, and the intelligentsia. Parties can and should observe proper standards of party ethics in debating questions relating to different understandings of theoretical problems and the tactics and strategy of practical actions in discussions within the party. The participants in the meeting urge all communists to campaign actively for the unity of the communist movement on the territory of the Soviet Union, to be resolute in defending the interests of working people, and to enhance the level of organization and party discipline. Our goals are: the Soviet Union, power to the soviets of working people's deputies, a single Communist Party, and socialism. [Signed] On behalf of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, R.
