The initial fear was that the advisers group would become a kind of shadow government, undermining the current administration of Hong Kong. The initial, most optimistic hope, was that the advisers would open up a channel of communication between Hong Kong and China so that the incoming sovereign state would have its ear closer to the ground in its new territory. Both the fear and hope have failed to materialise. The advisers' conclaves have proved to be too incoherent to have much impact. They certainly give no credible impression of forming any kind of shadow government. On the other hand, it has become clear that China has no real intention of creating a truly representative group of advisers. The membership consists of longstanding supporters of the Chinese Government, converts, or potential converts. The exercise of appointing advisers has become an exercise in giving rewards to the chosen few. Thus, Elsie Tu was rewarded for her outspoken criticism of the governor and new converts, such as Allen Lee, are being offered an opportunity to move closer to the embrace of the new masters. The Chinese Government is employing tactics that are familiar to those versed in the works of the Soviet Union's first leader V I Lenin. His strategy for winning power for the revolutionaries was one of the few aspects of revolutionary thought absorbed by the infant Chinese Communist Party, under the tutelage of the Communist International's agent, Michael Borodin. The essence of Leninist strategy was to widen the net of those who could be called upon to support the revolution, using the outer periphery of supporters to attract mass support, while ensuring that real power resided with a highly-disciplined revolutionary clique. Beyond the inner circle, a broader band of revolutionaries, committed to the cause but not trusted with full knowledge of the strategy, were to be brought together. In essence, these tactics have been dusted down and employed again in China's battle for control of Hong Kong. The Chinese Government has grouped its allies in three categories. First, the long-term hard-core supporters, second are those showing a willingness to be fully committed (but not yet fully trusted) supporters, and third are those with whom it is thought desirable to form a tactical alliance. In many ways, the third group is the most important because they give China access to a much larger section of the population than the other two groups. In addition, the recruitment of allies, as opposed to fully committed supporters, provides an opportunity to isolate those considered hostile to the Chinese Government. Thus, China has created a complex web of advisory bodies and appointed a number of people to important-sounding posts within the Chinese parliamentary system. The strategy is to reward friends, make new friends, and mobilise the widest possible alliance against the enemy, who in current circumstances, are the pro-democracy groups. Those who remain within the third group of the Chinese alliance will have to think long and hard about whether they intend to be used in this way. It seems most likely that they will stick with their new friends, although some might emit a few whimpers of regret over Cheung's dismissal. As many members of the third group used to be counted among the colonial government's chosen few, they should be fully aware of what to expect. For years, the British administration, in a more selective and elitist way, played the game that China is now playing with equal skill. The colonial rulers would pluck a number of "suitable" people from the ranks of the Chinese community and shower them with honours, positions of alleged responsibility, and fancy titles. They were then expected to go out and extol the virtues of benevolent British rule. They would also be paraded on occasions that demanded a token display of confirmation that the colonial administration had the support of the local population. The Hong Kong Government still makes desultory attempts to mobilise its supporting forces in this manner but the imminence of Chinese rule has made the exercise rather problematic. History, as Karl Marx, the founder of communist thought, said, is repeating itself; first as tragedy, then as farce. It is in this light that we view the purging of Anthony Cheung from China's advisory group.
