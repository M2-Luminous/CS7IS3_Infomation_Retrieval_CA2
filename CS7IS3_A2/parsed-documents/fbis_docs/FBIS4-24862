Speaking at the state diner in honor of Kim Yong-sam in the Kremlin, the Russian president said "ties between the two countries are developing effectively at present." But it is necessary to "move ahead" and give "the green light" to all cooperative projects in all spheres of live, Yeltsin pointed out. He added that this applies first of all to the economic field, particularly since the two countries have opportunities and reserves for this. Russia wants to see Korea reunified in a peaceful, democratic way as soon as possible, Yeltsin said, expressing hope that a "united" Korea becomes "a reliable partner of Russia." According to him, relations with Seoul is "one of Moscow's most important priorities in the Asian-Pacific direction." One of the high priority tasks is to guarantee the non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula, the Russian leader stated. He recalled that Russia was the first to propose convening an international conference on the issue. "The conference would seek a comprehensive solution to the nuclear problem as well as specific accords aimed at lessening and eventually eliminating the dangerous confrontation on the Korean peninsula," Yeltsin noted. Kim Yong-sam said, in turn, that he is quite convinced that "a very bright future lies ahead of us" in Russian-South Korean relations. "We will surely share a great future together if the advanced technology and vast natural resources of the Russian Federation are combined with the industrial development and business management expertise of (South) Korea," he said. He said documents concerning the Korean war of 1950-1953, which were handed earlier on Thursday to the South Korean president by Yeltsin, "will stand as a symbol of our firm determination to make a fresh start in our relations, putting behind us our unfortunate past relations during the era of Cold War." Kim Yong-sam arrived in Moscow on Wednesday afternoon for a four- day official visit to Russia. On Thursday morning he signed with Yeltsin a joint Russian-South Korean declaration at the close of their summit talks in the Kremlin.
