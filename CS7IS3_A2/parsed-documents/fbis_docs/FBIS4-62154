The document notes, specifically, that, taking into account the new German federal lands' difficult adaptation to the market economy, the members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had agreed to grant Germany easy terms for crediting export trade during the transition period. Such credit guarantees were issued to the sum of 8.2 billion German marks in the period from 1992 to 1993. This meant that German companies could export their goods to Russia while payment for such deliveries was guaranteed on easy terms, within the limits of the indicated sum, by the "Hermes Kredit-Versicherungds-Ag" company. The point is that the German Government does not handle administrative and technical matters linked with the insurance of export credits. This job is entrusted to the foregoing private firm, but decisions to grant credits are made by four ministries: the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economics, the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry for Economic Cooperation. The embassy's statement points out that the conclusion of many contracts with Russian firms on the basis of the above-said preferential guarantees was delayed for different reasons and now they can no longer be applied, because the preferences were annulled beginning from January 1, 1994. The authors of the statement claim that the Russian side was notified about all this in advance. Nevertheless, export guarantees for goods delivered to Russia are still being granted, but now on general terms, corresponding to the international practice and on agreement with credit insurers within the OECD. For instance, advance and intermediate payments, amounting to no less than 15 per cent of the total cost of the deal, have to be made if it is financed for a term of over 360 days. No preferential period is envisaged. Therefore, the statement of the FRG Embassy notes, there is no deterioration of crediting terms, simply the period for granting temporary preferences has expired.
