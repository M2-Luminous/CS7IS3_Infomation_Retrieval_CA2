Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa attended the session. Following the meeting, Minister Musa said that Egypt's position, as has been stated by President Mubarak, is that an immediate cease-fire should be observed in Yemen, because continued fighting is detrimental to that country and its unity. Minister Musa said that a cease-fire would give dialogue a chance to begin and a solution to be found. The longer the fighting continues, the slimmer the chances of preserving Yemen's unity and interests. It is in the interest of all Arabs to see an end to the fighting in Yemen. This is a message that has been relayed to all the warring parties and expressed repeatedly by President Mubarak, Minister Musa stated. For his part, Brahimi said that he was honored by his meeting with President Mubarak, noting that the meeting is part of the consultations he is holding with various Arab officials concerning the Yemeni crisis. He added that his visit to Egypt is the last stop on a tour that took him to a number of Gulf countries. The UN envoy said he appreciates the time President Mubarak spent with him discussing the Yemeni crisis. Brahimi said that President Mubarak told him Egypt takes an interest in the crisis out of concern for regional stability. Brahimi said that President Mubarak expressed a view shared by many Arabs and Yemenis, namely, that the fighting in Yemen should stop and that disputes should be worked out through dialogue rather than violent means. This is all I can say for now, Brahimi noted.
