The conference participants condemned the politics of violence. The resolution says the time has now come for the government and the opposition to resolve their differences through negotiations, as their continued confrontation is against the interests of the province and the country. The resolution adds that since problems cannot be settled through the use of force, political problems should be resolved only through mutual dialogue. The conference unanimously adopted another resolution, expressing the hope that Pakistan will not roll back its nuclear program unilaterally. The resolution says Pakistan has always opposed the use of force and its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. The resolution also says the international community can easily assess India's ambitions from its recent statement about its nuclear program. In yet another resolution, the conference appealed to Islamic countries to support the struggle of the Kashmiri people.
