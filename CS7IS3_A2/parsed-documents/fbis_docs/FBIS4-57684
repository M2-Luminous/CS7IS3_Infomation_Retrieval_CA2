The proposal calls for full liberalization of the services trade in seven years. During that time, negotiations would be conducted to establish a market and a legal system in the Andean countries. In the proposal, the delegates from Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Peru say the legal and juridical standards will be applied to all measures affecting the services trade.

The proposal places priority on market access, national treatment, and the most-favored-nation clause, which is unconditional with the exception of agreements limited to adjacent border areas. The plan, which must be approved by the Andean Pact's board of directors, stipulates the commitment to define community standards on subsidies for services one year prior to the implementation of the measure. The plan also provides for special transit methods, the temporary presence of persons, and the recognition and qualification of professional certificates, which cannot be valid for more than three and a half years.
