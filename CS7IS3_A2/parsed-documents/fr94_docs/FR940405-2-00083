FR940405-2-00083 FR940405-2-00043 CEI and Joseph Carabetta will voluntarily agree to be suspended from participation in any program/projects operated by the Department for a period of two (2) years, reviewable annually by your office upon request of CEI or Joseph Carabetta. Field Office Requirements Your office will prepare a schedule of payables due the projects and the Department, including all diversions, unpaid section 236 excess income, accrued interest and civil money penalties. Upon approval of each ELIHPA Plan of Action, the funding request to the Office of Preservation and Property Disposition will include an updated copy of this schedule showing: interest accrued since the last funding request, proceeds of the equity loan and application of the proceeds to project accounts, unpaid Excess Income and penalties as appropriate. This report will be required until the entire amount of funds owed is repaid. Funds will be applied first to diversions and interest, second to delinquent excess income and interest, and third to penalties, until all are paid. Upon approval of an ELIHPA Plan of Action, your office will report a waiver of 24 CFR 248.233(f) for the project. The first 80% of the penalty is to be remitted to be deposited in the Special Risk Insurance Fund. The balance (20%) of the penalty should have separate checks issued, on a unit proportionate basis, to tenant associations or their legal representatives, of each of the 40 projects for use as those associations see fit. If you have any questions about the terms and conditions of this waiver, please call Kevin East at (202) 708&hyph;2300. 2. Regulation: 24 CFR 811.105(b), 811.107(a)(2), 811.108(a)(1), 811.108(a)(3), 811.114(b)(3), 811.114(d), 811.115(b). Project/Activity: Laurel Woods Housing Finance Corporation refunding of bonds which financed a section 8 assisted project, Laurel Woods Apartments, FHA No. 073&hyph;35444, South Bend, Indiana. Nature of Requirement: The Regulations set conditions under which HUD may grant a section 11(b) letter of exemption of multifamily housing revenue bonds from Federal income taxation and authorize call of debentures prior to maturity. Granted By: Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary for Housing-FHA Commissioner. Date Granted: September 29, 1993. Reasons Waived: The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms of refunding transactions. To credit enhance refundings bonds not fully secured by the FHA mortgage amount, HUD also agrees not to exercise its option under 24 CFR 207.259(e) to call debentures prior to maturity. This refunding proposal was approved by HUD on September 2, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 6.10%. The tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $2,775,000 at current low-interest rates will save Section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt bonds at an 11.75% interest rate at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 6.10%. The refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, from 11.75% to 7.0%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's Section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues, (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective.
