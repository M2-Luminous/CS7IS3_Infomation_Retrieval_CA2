Mr. Dembri spoke of the situation in Algeria, the scope of the national dialogue conference and other issues. A report from Lisbon by our television correspondent Samia Azi: [Azi] Today was the first meeting between Foreign Minister Mr. Dembri after arriving in Lisbon airport with his counterpart, Mr. Durao Barroso, at the Portuguese Foreign Ministry. The tete-a-tete talks, which lasted more than 30 minutes, consisted of different topics: security in Algeria, the national dialogue conference, and Algerian economic reform policy. International problems were not ruled out at the two ministers' talks. What is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina, expectations for Middle East talks, and North-South relations were discussed. The meeting later expanded to include delegations from both sides. [Begin Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso recording in French] I can frankly tell you that here, in Europe, we are very worried about the news we get from Algeria regarding security matters. My Algerian colleague has had the opportunity to tell me that some of these reports are exaggerated, that the situation is under control, but, frankly, we have great respect for Algeria and the Algerian people. We think of Algeria as a very welcoming country and it would be a shame to see this image now change abroad. [end recording] In the evening, the Algerian foreign minister, Mr. Mohamed Salah Dembri, met Portuguese President Mario Alberto Soares. Mr. Dembri told the president that Algeria always supported Portugal in its chosen democratic path. After he met the Portuguese president, we asked Mr. Dembri: [Begin recording] [Correspondent] As you end your meeting with the Portuguese president, what is your opinion of the Portuguese position towards what is happening in Algeria -- that is of course after your meeting with the president? [Dembri] After Spain, our visit to Portugal appeared to be very useful because we did not have continuous dialogue with Portugal since 1987. But now, we agreed this morning with the foreign minister to strengthen bilateral ties and to raise them to the required level. Political dialogue with the Portuguese authorities consisted of all what interests our countries bilaterally as well as multilaterally, while including the Mediterranean, the Maghreban Union and what interests us in terms of current international developments. The Portuguese were very optimistic about the current developments in Algeria concerning the national dialogue conference and scopes for future proposals. Algeria still occupies its natural position and has preserved its reputation, well-known in the histories of countries which have reached independence after liberation wars.
