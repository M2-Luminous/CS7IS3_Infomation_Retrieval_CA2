Oxygen-consuming waste water discharged into the lake has dropped by some 40 percent in the past year, according to environmental protection officials from Baoding city, a dozen km from the lake in Hebei Province. A working group set up in 1992 and headed by the mayor of the city is now responsible for controlling the flow of pollutants into the lake. A sewage treatment plant that can use coal dust from a thermal power plant to recycle 50,000 tons of waste water discharged by a paper mill has recently been put into operation by the lakeside. The five-million-yuan plant is a model project supervised by the State Environmental Protection Agency. Another two waste water treatment plants financed by the central and local governments and through a Finnish Government loan are now under construction. Each will be able to treat 80,000 tons of waste water a day. In 1992, a paper mill and a chemical plant were closed down by the city government to reduce waste discharges into the lake. Since 1990, factories in the area have had to pass environmental assessments by the government before being allowed to discharge waste into the lake. So far 45 factories have been licensed, according to the officials.
