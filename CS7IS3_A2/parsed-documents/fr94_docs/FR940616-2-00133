FR940616-2-00133 FR940616-2-00092 Participants should become thoroughly conversant with state-of-the-art theory and practice of teaching English as a second language. They should observe and participate in classroom and language lab instruction, become involved in the complexities of curriculum development, and produce guidelines for and examples of classroom-appropriate teaching material. In addition, they should be introduced to professional associations and networks of teachers, curriculum developers, and education officials, providing them models of professional cooperation and information exchange which will be useful in establishing cross-cultural professional linkages in the region. The second phase of the project should take place over a period of approximately six months and should entail the travel at approximately eight-to-ten-week intervals, of four American specialists/consultants. Each specialist will conduct a series of two-to-three-day workshops on one or more of the key issues addressed in the initial phase of the exchange (e.g., curriculum development; teaching methodology; in-service training), in each of the locations in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank from which participants in the original phase were drawn. Participants Participants' professional titles will vary from community to community, given the independent development of educational supervisory/oversight institutions in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank. They might be drawn from the Ministry of Education, the ranks of consultants to the educational establishment, teachers' unions, professional committees, or teacher training institutions. All will be responsible, in some capacity, for the development of effective English language teaching programs. Participants will be selected by United States Information Service officers (The United States Information Agency's overseas contingent is officially called the United States Information Service) serving in the American Embassy in Tel Aviv and the American Consulate in Jerusalem. Individuals may also be recommended for participation by the grantee institution, but selection will be made only in close consultation with USIS officers. American consultants who will travel abroad during the second phase of this exchange program will be selected by the grantee institution in consultation with USIA. USIA officers in participating countries will facilitate the issuance of visas and other program-related material. Programmatice Considerations Thematically, the project should: _Consider the current status of English Language instruction in the communities represented by the participants and determine, in conjunction with USIS posts in Israel and Jerusalem and with the educators selected as participants, the needs to be addressed by the project; _Provide the participants both a general and specific overview of English Language education_focussing specifically on teaching English as a second language_as it is practiced in the United States, in the context of a socially diverse country; _Be organized, to the extent possible, around open seminar/discussions, participant observation, and hands-on, experiential learning; _Introduce participants to the organization and workings of professional associations of educators and other means of information exchange, such as internet, which would provide continued access to diverse ideas, publications, etc.; _And include, if feasible, attendance at the TESOL international convention in Long Beach, California, March 28&hyph;April 1, 1995.
