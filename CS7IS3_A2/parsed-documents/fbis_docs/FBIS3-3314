At a news conference joined by visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, Chernomyrdin told reporters that Russia has accepted the NATO's partnership proposal without putting up any preconditions. The U.S. defense secretary also pointed out that the partnership for peace plan would not be practical until the end of March, when Russia formally applies for the partnership, the first step toward the full NATO membership. The two ministers have worked on the issue of nuclear weapons and discussed specifically the disarmament of the nuclear arsenal in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine, reportedly the world's third largest. Cooperation on the conversion of military industries into civil business and destruction of chemical weapons were also among the subjects they discussed, said the Russian prime minister. Before leaving Moscow for Alma Ata, Perry and Russia's First Deputy Minister of Defense Andrey Kokoshin signed an agreement on military conversion this afternoon.
