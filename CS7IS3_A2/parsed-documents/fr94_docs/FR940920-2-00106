FR940920-2-00106 FR940920-2-00054 One commenter suggested that ``outside parties'' be consulted before announcing a meeting open to public observation because they may wish to submit proprietary, personal, or other confidential information prior to the meeting. Another suggested that the NRC staff inform the ``outside parties'' if a meeting will be a public meeting. This is the current NRC practice; however, the NRC will include a provision in its implementing management directive emphasizing that the NRC staff should make outside persons aware when a meeting will be a public meeting. This practice will allow the outside persons to raise concerns regarding confidential information before a meeting. Several commenters expressed the concern that essential or urgent meetings would not be scheduled promptly enough because of the need to provide ``ten days advanced notice.'' This provision is intended to ensure that when the NRC staff deems that a meeting should be a public meeting there is sufficient time to provide adequate public notice of the meeting. When a meeting is deemed essential and adequate public notice cannot be provided, exemption ``h'' of the policy statement would apply because trying to provide notice would constitute an administrative burden that could interfere with the NRC staff's efficient execution of its safety and regulatory responsibilities; however, limited notice would still be provided using available telephone and electronic bulletin board systems. Another commenter noted that its experience has been that some past public meetings noticed in the Federal Register were published on the day of the meeting or published so close to the date of the meeting that public attendance was impossible. The NRC recognizes that delays may occur because of the requirement to publish a notice of the meeting in the Federal Register . Consequently, the NRC did not adopt publication in the Federal Register as the principal mechanism for announcing public staff meetings. The NRC will announce public meetings through a toll-free telephone recording, a toll-free electronic bulletin board, weekly distribution of public meeting announcements to the Press, and by posting meeting announcements in the NRC Public Document Room. One commenter suggested that minutes of closed meetings be prepared when substantive regulatory issues are raised in a closed meeting or when minutes of the closed meeting can be prepared and released to the public. The NRC recognizes that closed meetings may involve discussions regarding substantive regulatory matters, such as those involving preliminary, unverified information; meetings may also be closed because of the administrative burden of opening the meeting for public observation. The NRC does not believe it is necessary to require in the policy statement the preparation of meeting minutes or summaries of closed meetings. However, current NRC practice, when appropriate, is to make publicly available summaries of non-public meetings. This practice will continue.
