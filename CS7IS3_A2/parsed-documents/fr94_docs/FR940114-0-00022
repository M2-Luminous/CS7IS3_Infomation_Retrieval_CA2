D. Public Participation Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c) of this chapter, the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process or for any other good cause which may be consistent with applicable law. The Assistant Secretary finds that Utah's, Arizona's and Puerto Rico's Voluntary Protection Programs are generally identical to the Federal Voluntary Protection Programs, meet Federal requirements and were adopted by the States in accordance with State procedural requirements. Good cause is therefore found for approval of these supplements and further public participation would be unnecessary. E.
