"We must be absolutely neutral in this inter-Rwandan conflict, and we ask all Burundians wherever they are, to respect this government's commitment to neutrality in the conflict." Ntibantunganya went on to say Burundi has to help Rwanda to restore peace and security and that the Arusha agreements must be the starting point for negotiations between the Rwandan sides. "Given the situation in Rwanda over the last two months, these agreements must be adjusted to suit them to the current situation," he added.
