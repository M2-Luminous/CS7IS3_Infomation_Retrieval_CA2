FBIS4-18104 "drweu062_e_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-062 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 UNITED KINGDOM Major: Cease-fire Designed to Deceive `Gullible' Major: Cease-fire Designed to Deceive `Gullible' LD3103102094 London PRESS ASSOCIATION in English 0924 GMT 31 Mar 94 LD3103102094 London PRESS ASSOCIATION English BFN [By Chris Moncrieff and Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] [Text] The Prime Minister today accused the IRA of using its "self-serving and cynical" three-day ceasefire to deceive the gullible into believing it was a road to peace. Mr Major, on a lightning tour of Northern Ireland, said: "The fact is the gullible ought not to be deceived." He was speaking at the start of a hectic day in which he will make a whirlwind tour of the province. He did not answer questions about the Tory leadership crisis and the row in London over the Euro votes "climb down." But he used the opportunity at Hillsborough Castle to underline his stark denunciation of last night's ceasefire announcement, due to take effect from Tuesday. He rejected suggestions that he and Dublin Premier Albert Reynolds were no longer in step on this issue. "I think the Taoiseach's [Prime Minister Reynolds] view and my view over the course that the IRA need to take is quite clear. They need to stop the violence and they need to stop violence for good," he said. "We committed ourselves to that in the Joint Declaration. I have repeatedly said that since and so has the Taoiseach." Mr Major was also critical of those -- including Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams -- who said that people should build on this three-day ceasefire. "The ceaefire is a very cynical exercise.... What effectively the IRA are saying is that on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday they will decide not to attack people and not to kill people," he said. "On Friday, Saturday and Sunday they will then go back to killing people. I do not think that is satisfactory." But Mr Adams asked: "What is the alternative? Are we going to continue to be locked into armed conflict in perpetuity? Is this what is opening up for us, is it going to continue forever? I would hope that Mr Major -- who made a kneejerk reaction last night -- would reflect on his position, will send the right signals, will make it easier, rather than more difficult for Republicans to engage in the peace process." Senior Sinn Fein official Martin McGuinness said: "We are still very much interested in the establishment of a meaningful peace process. What we're trying to do is lay down the foundation stones on which the bricks of peace can be built." In Washington where President Clinton came under a barrage of criticism for allowing Mr Adams a visa earlier this year, the White House said it hoped the ceasefire -- the first in 19 years, apart from the traditional Christmas truces -- would be a step towards an IRA renunciation of violence. It also urged the IRA and Sinn Fein to accept the Joint Declaration. Meanwhile, Mr Major said: "The only message we want to hear from them is that they have decided to give up violence for good. I am sure everybody would wish to see that. I would like to see them entering the democratic process. The Joint Declaration opens the door for them to do precisely that. They know what needs to be done. If they genuinely wish to play a democratic part in the future of politics in Northern Ireland there is a route they can take, there is a road for them to go down. They have thus far failed to do so." Referring to the Joint Declaration, he said: "As far as clarification is concerned the document stands on its own merits. It is perfectly clear to everyone else what it means. It is perfectly clear to Sinn Fein as well. What they are trying to do is to encourage the Government to believe that there is some extra step to draw the Government into negotiations. The fact is the gullible ought not to be deceived." Mr Major added: "At the moment the IRA and Sinn Fein are under pressure. I intend to stand by the Joint Declaration. I hope everyone else will keep up the pressure. A three-day ceasefire is not going to change the future of Northern Ireland. They must stop the violence permanently and then in due course enter the constitutional talks. They should stop killing people permanently. They should stop wrecking people's lives permanently."
