FR940831-2-00052 FR940831-2-00037 [FRL&hyph;5062&hyph;4] Open Meeting on the Definition of Solid Waste and Hazardous Waste Recycling Agency: Environmental Protection Agency. Action: Notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is conducting two public small group discussions with representatives of several companies potentially affected by recommendations from an internal Agency task force for revising the regulatory definition of solid waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery ACT (RCRA). Other attendees to these meetings would be afforded the opportunity at the appropriate times to ask questions or comment on the small group discussions. The revisions to the definition of solid waste are intended to eliminate the disincentives to the safe recycling of hazardous waste while maintaining full protection of human health and the environment. They are also intended to reduce any possible current underregulation of hazardous waste recycling. DATES: September 20, 1994 from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM in Chicago, Illinois, and September 27, 1994 from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM in Edison, New Jersey.
