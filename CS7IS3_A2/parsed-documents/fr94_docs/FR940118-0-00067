The vision should build on assets and coordinate a response to community needs in a comprehensive fashion. It should also set goals and performance benchmarks for measuring progress and establish a framework for evaluating and adjusting the revitalization plan. State and local governments may nominate distressed urban areas for designation as Empowerment Zones (which will also permit their consideration for designation as Enterprise Communities), or solely for designation as Enterprise Communities. Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 included Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities as a new program. II. Program Description General Pursuant to title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, the Secretary of HUD may designate up to six urban Empowerment Zones and up to 65 urban Enterprise Communities. If six Empowerment Zones are designated in urban areas, no less than one shall be designated in an urban area the most populous city of which has a population of 500,000 or less and no less than one shall be a nominated area which includes areas in two States and which Zone has a population of 50,000 or less. The Secretary of HUD will designate Empowerment Zones in urban areas in such a manner that the aggregate population of all such Zones does not exceed 750,000. Eligibility To be eligible for designation as an urban Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community the statute prescribes that an area must: (1) Have a maximum population which is the lesser of: (a) 200,000, or (b) The greater of 50,000, or ten percent of the population of the most populous city located within the nominated area; (2) Be one of pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress; (3) Not exceed twenty square miles in total land area; (4) Demonstrate a poverty rate which is not less than: (a) 20 percent in each census tract; (b) 25 percent in 90 percent of the population census tracts within the nominated area; (c) 35 percent for at least 50 percent of the population census tracts within the nominated area; (5) Have a continuous boundary, or consist of not more than three noncontiguous parcels; (6) Be located entirely within the jurisdiction of the unit or units of general local government making the nomination, and not be located in more than two contiguous States; and (7) Not include any portion of a central business district unless the poverty rate for each population tract containing portions of the central business district is at least 35 percent for an Empowerment Zone and 30 percent for an Enterprise Community. Nomination Process The law provides that one or more local governments and the State(s) in which a nominated urban area is located may jointly nominate the area for designation if: (1) The area meets the eligibility requirements set forth in these rules; (2) The urban area is within the jurisdiction of the local government(s) and the State(s); (3) The local government(s) and State(s) provide assurances that the required strategic plan they adopt will be implemented;
