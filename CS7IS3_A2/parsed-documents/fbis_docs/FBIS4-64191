How do you intend to come up from the depths by the elections? [Schaeuble] As with the economy, the trend is more important than the absolute figures, and if the trend continues, things will not look so bad on election day. The more we succeed in nailing down the Social Democratic Party [SPD] and in explaining a few contested measures that were taken this year, the better our chances will be. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] The unusual thing about this campaign, however, is that it is the government that must attack, not the opposition. [Schaeuble] In fact, the opposition should be calling attention to alternatives to the government's policies. It has been Scharping's strategy thus far--not without success--to refuse to do precisely that. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Your former secretary general, Heiner Geissler, is of the opinion that one should be the aggressor when one is behind. Where do you intend to stir things up? [Schaeuble] I hold the same view as Heiner Geissler. Is it not strange, that Mr. Scharping wants to pursue the government's family policies and external security policies in a seamless fashion? Continuing to pursue our own policies is something we can probably do better than the opposition. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Now, the election will be decided on other fronts, especially with regard to the question: who can create the most jobs? The SPD seems to be credited with greater competence in that area. [Schaeuble] The most recent polls give us a definite advantage in the area of economic competence. True, we would have to lead in that area by a ratio of 10. We cannot solve everything overnight, in a dramatic fashion with a dose of medication, which appears to be what the SPD is offering. These matters require a long, sustained effort to address the structural problems that have crept into the economy of western Germany. We shall dismantle our structural disadvantages. That is the way to assure long-term growth and employment. There is no easier way. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] How do you intend to create jobs, given predictions of economic growth rates of 1.5 to 2 percent? [Schaeuble] We shall create them if we cut back on this overheated trend of spiralling wage and wage-related costs. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] [Nursing-care] benefits are not exactly the best place to achieve reductions in wage-related costs [Schaeuble] No, they are not increasing. In this case, we have achieved, arduously and imperfectly enough, full compensation, in principle, of the costs incurred by the firms. Of course, one could haggle over details. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Originally, this was intended as a means of assuring greater self-sufficiency for the citizenry. [Schaeuble] That was a victim of the cross-fire between the opposition, the majority of the Bundesrat, and the major economic associations. The fact that the unions did not support this was known, but their tumultuous opposition really amazed me. Now we shall provide the care, and we shall introduce greater self-sufficiency and participation in the next legislative session. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Will the topic of continued wage payments in case of illness be on the agenda? [Schaeuble] It makes little sense, four weeks after the end of the discussion of these benefits, to revive the topic once more. But I guarantee, we shall address the topic of "more responsibility for oneself" once more. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] The issue of benefits insurance would make Ludwig Erhard turn over in his grave. How does it come about that Erhard's party has evidently taken one step ahead of the economically predictable next generation? Is the internal climate within the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] an unhealthy one for economic policymakers? [Schaeuble] No, not at all. In the person of Rainer Haungs, we have an outstanding economic policymaker. It is true that Klaus Toepfer is the minister of the environment, but no one disputes his high degree of competence in the area of economic policy. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] The firms used the recession to restructure and they have achieved great increases in productivity. Has the political world also taken advantage of the opportunity of the crisis? [Schaeuble] In this legislative session, we went to the limit of the politically possible. This path must continue to be taken in a consistent manner in the next session, for which reason, a Red-Green alternative in the next four years would be irresponsible. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] There could be a social-liberal coalition as well. [Schaeuble] Any theoretically conceivable constellation, other than the present-day coalition, would be less suitable. We could have saved a few billion [German marks] more by now if the SPD Bundesrat majority had not hindered our savings measures. And if you take a look at Mr. Scharping's program, you will find a shortfall of about 50 billion between the claim and reality. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] You had better recheck your figures. [Schaeuble] Is it more? [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Yes. [Schaeuble] You see, I try to be nice to those who cannot quite grasp the difference between gross income and net income. In any case, the country can ill afford a worse government. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Will this coalition, if it is reelected, increase taxes again? [Schaeuble] We want to reduce the state's share as a whole, and thus, the quotient of taxes and other levies. There will be no further increases, beyond those tax increases that have already been enacted, and the solidarity supplement. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] And the subsistence minimum that Karlsruhe [Supreme Court] insists upon? [Schaeuble] Of course, as the situation continues to shift, there is the possibility that in an individual instance, increased levies could be assessed, but on the whole, there will be no increase of overall taxation. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Will you repeal the tax on labor, and rely, instead, more on indirect taxes? [Schaeuble] For a long time, I have been saying, over and over, that, in the long term, we must assess lower levies on labor and business earnings. Private consumption and private assets pose a means of offsetting this. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Are you slowly getting the feeling that you cannot implement everything you want? [Schaeuble] I keep trying to keep the proper balance between the requisite confidence and a sufficiently sober assessment of the situation that is rooted in reality. Of course, after 12 years of governing activities, signs of wear start to show. I would not like to place my confidence purly on the sympathy vote. But when, on 16 October, a decision is reached concerning the concrete decisions and realistic proposals of both sides, we shall manage it. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Are you not also harboring the hope, just a bit, that events in world politics will help you? For example, on the premise that f the world all around us, especially Russia, is getting to be an ever more dangerous place, the Germans want the experienced Helmut Kohl once more. [Schaeuble] We are placing our bets on the discussion in the fields of economics, finance, employment, and social policy. Of course, external security will remain a topic of central importance, but not in the sense that we hoped for crisis-laden developments. Such a price would be too high. To state the case somewhat informally: Better Scharping in Bonn than Zhirinovsky in Moscow.
