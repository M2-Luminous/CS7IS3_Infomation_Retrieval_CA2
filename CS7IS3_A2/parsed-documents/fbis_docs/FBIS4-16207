These were federal laws "On the state protection of judges and employees of the law enforcing and monitoring bodies," "On the state protection of victims, witnesses, and other individuals assisting in criminal proceedings," and also "on the tabling of amendments and additions to the RSFSR criminal and criminal procedure code." According to Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the Duma Committee for Security, who was presenting the draft laws to the deputies, the need for a speedy adoption of these laws was brought about by the acute situation with regard to crime in the country and the fact that the existing laws dealing with the battle against crime were insufficient and consequently ineffective. In particular, Viktor Ilyukhin noted, the adoption of the law "On the state protection of judges and employees of the law enforcing and monitoring bodies" will allow the lives, health, and property of this category of citizens and their families and friends to be protected. The Duma committee chairman also stressed that the adoption of the law "On the state protection of victims, witnesses, and other individuals assisting in criminal proceedings" will permit the safety and social protection of these citizens to be guaranteed, so that the necessary conditions for the battle against crime might be created, and justice might be appropriately done in criminal cases. The laws were adopted in their first reading without discussion since, in the parliamentarians' opinion, society had an acute need for their speedy adoption. All remarks and additions to the above laws which Duma deputies table in the immediate future will be taken into account during consideration of the laws in their second reading.
