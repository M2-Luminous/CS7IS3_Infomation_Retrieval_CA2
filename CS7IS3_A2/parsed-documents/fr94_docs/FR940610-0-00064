FR940610-0-00064 FR940610-0-00023 (3) The assumption that the amount described in §1.664&hyph;3(a)(1)( i )( a ) is distributed in accordance with the payout sequence described in the governing instrument. If the governing instrument does not prescribe when the distribution is made during the period for which the payment is made, for purposes of this section, the distribution is considered payable on the first day of the period for which the payment is made. (b) Actuarial Computations by the Internal Revenue Service. The regulations in this and in related sections provide tables of actuarial factors and examples that illustrate the use of the tables in determining the value of remainder interests in property. Section 1.7520&hyph;1(c)(2) refers to government publications that provide additional tables of factors and examples of computations for more complex situations. If the computation requires the use of a factor that is not provided in this section, the Commissioner may supply the factor upon a request for a ruling. A request for a ruling must be accompanied by a recitation of the facts including the date of birth of each measuring life, and copies of the relevant documents. A request for a ruling must comply with the instructions for requesting a ruling published periodically in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (See §601.601(d)(2)(ii)( b ) of this chapter) and include payment of the required user fee. If the Commissioner furnishes the factor, a copy of the letter supplying the factor should be attached to the tax return in which the deduction is claimed. If the Commissioner does not furnish the factor, the taxpayer must furnish a factor computed in accordance with the principles set forth in this section. (c) Statement supporting deduction required. Any claim for a deduction on any return for the value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust must be supported by a full statement attached to the return showing the computation of the present value of such interest. (d) Valuation. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust (as described in §1.664&hyph;3) for transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, is its present value determined under paragraph (e) of this section. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust (as described in §1.664&hyph;3) for transfers for which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989, is its present value determined under the following sections: ␣ 1Valuation dates 2After 2Before 1Applicable regulations l 01&hyph;01&hyph;52 1.664&hyph;4A(a) 12&hyph;31&hyph;51 01&hyph;01&hyph;71 1.664&hyph;4A(b) 12&hyph;31&hyph;70 12&hyph;01&hyph;83 1.664&hyph;4A(c) 11&hyph;30&hyph;83 05&hyph;01&hyph;89 1.664&hyph;4A(d) (e) Valuation of charitable remainder unitrusts having certain payout sequences for transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989 _(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, in the case of transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, the present value of a remainder interest is determined under paragraphs (e)(3) through (e)(6) of this section, provided that the amount of the payout as of any payout date during any taxable year of the trust is not larger than the amount that the trust could distribute on such date under §1.664&hyph;3(a)(1)(v) if the taxable year of the trust were to end on such date. See, however, §1.7520&hyph;3(b) (relating to exceptions to the use of the prescribed tables under certain circumstances). (2) Transitional rules for valuation of charitable remainder unitrusts. (i) If the valuation date of a transfer to a charitable remainder unitrust is after April 30, 1989, and before June 10, 1994, a transferor can rely upon Notice 89&hyph;24, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 660, or Notice 89&hyph;60, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 700, in valuing the transferred interest. (See §601.601(d)(2)(ii)( b ) of this chapter.) (ii) For purposes of sections 2055, 2106, or 2624, if on May 1, 1989, the decedent was mentally incompetent so that the disposition of the property could not be changed, and the decedent died after April 30, 1989, without having regained competency to dispose of the decedent's property, or the decedent died within 90 days of the date that the decedent first regained competency after April 30, 1989, the present value of a remainder interest determined under this section is determined as if the valuation date with respect to the decedent's gross estate is either before May 1, 1989, or after April 30, 1989, at the option of the decedent's executor.
