Matsuura told a luncheon meeting at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan it might be more "productive" to hold informal meetings than having official discussions under the spotlight of public attention. "On our part, we are prepared to get into negotiations again, but... We have had conceptual difficulties in defining 'objective criteria'," Matsuura said. "We have to think hard how we can overcome that conceptual difference. I hope the American side will also think hard," he said. The framework talks, aimed at redressing the bilateral trade imbalance, broke down last weekend in Washington over U.S. demands that "objective criteria" such as numerical targets be set up to gauge foreign access to Japanese markets. Matsuura said the greatest cause of the failure to come to full agreement was the different perception of the function of past bilateral agreements between Japan and the U.S. The U.S. claimed that the past 30-odd accords between the two countries have not fulfilled their objectives, citing the deteriorating bilateral trade imbalance as proof, he said. The Japanese argued that many accords have achieved their initial objectives such as an agreement on NTT procurement and one on beef imports, and that the bilateral trade imbalance is not the result of the failure of bilateral agreements but is caused by macroeconomics, he said. Matsuura said Japan should hammer out a package of voluntary actions to deregulate its economy and to take further market-opening measures. For example, Tokyo should look more carefully into its action program on government procurement announced earlier this month before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting, and study what additional elements it could add to it to introduce more competition and more transparency. Concerning auto and auto parts, Matsuura said the Japanese and U.S. Governments should encourage cooperation among private sectors, saying additional government steps are limited because it is a highly deregulated area. Matsuura, who led the Japanese delegation to the framework talks, said he feels "very depressed" that the six-month long negotiations failed. He said at more than one point he felt the Japanese and U.S. delegations would be able to strike a deal and produce a small package. It was a "very, very painful decision" for both sides to wrap up the talks without success. After the luncheon meeting, Matsuura and other senior officials of the foreign, finance and trade ministries met with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to discuss further action Japan should take following the breakdown of the talks.
