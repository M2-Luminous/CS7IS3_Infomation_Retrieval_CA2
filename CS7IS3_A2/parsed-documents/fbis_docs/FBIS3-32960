According to Santos, the members of the G-3 -- Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico -- fully agree on tariffs, and he added that only small details are pending. He also said that if everything goes according to plan, the agreement will be signed within 30 days. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1955 GMT 8 Feb 94) The multinational oil firm Dutch Shell has asked the Colombian Government for a 10-year extension of its concession for the exploitation of an oil field in the southern department of Huila. The oil field, which is scheduled to revert to the state on 18 November, yields 18,000 barrels of crude a day. Shell said that if the extension is granted, it will comply with the terms established by the government and will pay corresponding royalties. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2035 GMT 9 Feb 94) Official sources said today that Colombia was able to increase its banana exports by 10.8 percent during the past year despite the difficulties this Latin American export is facing in the European market. In 1993, banana exports yielded $400 million in revenues. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1833 GMT 10 Feb 94) The expected revenues Colombia will receive from the Cusiana oil bonanza have prompted the government to request $400 million less in new loans than the planned amount for 1994. This measure seeks to avoid a greater increase in international reserves, which could interfere with exchange and monetary policies. In addition, the government seeks to reduce the foreign public debt from $15 billion to $10 billion from now until the year 2,000. The Executive Branch has already notified the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank of the move. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 11 Feb 94 pp 1A, 1B, 3B)
