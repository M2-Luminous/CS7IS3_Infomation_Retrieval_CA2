Elias] [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA--The Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] is running a large group of armed right-wingers out of Mmabatho, STAR photographer Ken Oosterbroek said on Friday [11 March]. ITN [International Television Network] Reporter James Brittan told SAPA there was a "wall-to-wall" Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] presence in downtown Mafikeng and continuous gunfire from the central business district. "It is a running firefight," he said. According to CNN news, the AWB has refused to pull out of Bophuthatswana as "this is our land and we are staying". There was fighting in dowtown Mafikeng on Friday between the AWB and the BDF, with one AWB member killed and two civilians caught in crossfire. SUNDAY TIMES Reporter Ray Hartley described the scene "war". There was sustained, continuous gunfire for more than four minutes. "There have been casualties. One AWB guy has been killed and two civilians. There are plenty of people wounded," Mr Hartley told SAPA. Surrounding townships and Mafikeng were battlefields, journalists told SAPA after returning from trips to Mmabatho and Mafikeng. "The AWB have moved beyond Mafikeng," Mr Hartley said, adding that hundreds of right-wingers had left town. A continuous stream of vehicles filled with the right-wingers left the Mmabatho area soon after noon, heading towards Mafikeng and Lichtenberg in the Western Transvaal.
