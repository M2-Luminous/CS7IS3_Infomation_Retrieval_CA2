The annual white paper on fisheries said Japan's total fisheries production, including catch and cultured fish, amounted to 9.27 million tons in 1992, down 7 percent from the previous year. It is the first time fishery production has declined four straight years since 1945, the paper said. Deep-sea fishery production increased by 0.8 percent to 1.27 million tons. It was the first year-on-year increase in five years for deep-sea fisheries, which have been generally declining due to tightening regulations on fisheries in international waters, the paper said. Coastal fisheries also increased by 4 percent to 3.27 million tons. Offshore fisheries, however, declined 17 percent to 4.53 million tons, dropping below 5 million tons for the first time in 15 years. The paper said the decline in offshore fisheries reflects the growing scarcity of marine resources in Japanese waters. "It is an urgent task for Japan to recover marine resources in the Japanese waters by such means as releasing fish fry and maintaining underwater reefs for fish," it said. Utilization of marine resources should also be more effective, it added. The paper, submitted at a regular cabinet meeting by Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata, also noted for the first time the importance to the industry of the female workforce. Women are taking an important role in the workforce of the fisheries industry and as leaders of local activities in fishing areas, it said. It is important to encourage young women in the field to stay by creating a better working environment for them, the paper said.
