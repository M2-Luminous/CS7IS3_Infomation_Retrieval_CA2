FR940523-0-00016 FR940523-0-00005 8 CFR Parts 210a, 214, 241, and 242 [INS No. 1438&hyph;93; AG Order No. 1879&hyph;94] RIN 1115&hyph;AC86 Revision of Grounds for Deportation; Conforming Regulations AGENCY: Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule makes technical amendments to conform agency regulations with statutory provisions regarding general classes of deportable aliens. These amendments are necessary due to statutory changes. They will ensure implementation of, and regulatory compliance with, the statutory changes. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert A. Jacobson, Director, Deportation Branch, Detention and Deportation Division, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., room 6008, Washington, DC 20536&hyph;0002, telephone (202) 514&hyph;2865. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 13, 1991, an interim rule with request for comments was published in the Federal Register at 56 FR 38331. This rule amended pertinent sections of 8 CFR parts 210a, 214, 241, and 242 to reflect the technical amendments necessary for conformity with section 241 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), Ch. 477, 66 Stat. 163 (1952), as amended by section 602 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT 90), Act of Nov. 29, 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;649, 104 Stat. 4978. Section 307(h) of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (Technical Amendments), Act of Dec. 12, 1991, Public Law 102&hyph;232, 105 Stat. 1733, subsequently made minor corrections in section 241 of the Act. The majority of the amendments made to section 241 of the Act by section 602 of IMMACT 90 were technical in nature, relating in large part to citation changes. Consequently, the majority of changes to 8 CFR parts 210a, 214, 241, and 242 in the interim rule were also technical in nature. Those regulatory changes which did alter substantive rights were so identified in the interim rule. The comment period for the interim rule ended on September 27, 1991. The Service did not receive any comments. Moreover, the Technical Amendments did not substantively change the interim rule. The interim rule is, therefore, adopted as final with minor technical changes. Regulatory Citation in the Interim Rule In the supplementary information to the interim rule, 8 CFR 214.2(a)(10) was erroneously referred to as ``(s)ection 241.2(a)(10).'' Also, 8 CFR 214.2(f)(12(i)(E), referred to in the supplementary information and amended by the interim regulations, has since been redesignated as 8 CFR 214.2(f)(16)(i)(D). Finally, 8 CFR 242.7a was erroneously referred to in the paragraph heading of 8 CFR 242.7a of the interim regulations as ``§241.7a.'' Changes to Title 8, Code of Federal Regulations The regulations at 8 CFR 242.8(a), as well as at 8 CFR 242.17(d) (in both the paragraph heading and the regulatory text), are amended by substituting ``241(a)(1)(E)(iii)'' for ``241(a)(1)(E)(ii).'' These changes are necessary because the Technical Amendments redesignated section 241(a)(1)(E)(ii) of the Act as section 241(a)(1)(E)(iii). Although this amendment is not directly related to the other citation changes in Part 242, 8 CFR 242.20 is amended by substituting ``§3.39'' for ``§3.37,'' redesignated by a recent regulatory change. Table of Citation Changes A table of citation changes in section 241 of the Act resulting from section 602 of IMMACT 90 was included in the supplementary information to the interim rule. The Technical Amendments have since resulted in the addition of a new section 241(a)(1)(E)(ii), as well as redesignated of the former section 241(a)(1)(E)(ii) as section 241(a)(1)(E)(iii). Further, section 241(a)(21), added by section 544(b)(3) of IMMACT 90, and section 241(a)(3)(C), added by the Technical Amendments, both relate to the same deportation charge. A new table of citation changes is, therefore, included here for informational purposes. Not all current sections of law, however, are, in all respects, identical to the corresponding former sections. ␣ 1Former citation 1New citation (effective 3/1/91) 241(a)(1) 241(a)(1)(A). 241(a)(2) 241(a)(1)(B). 241(a)(3) Repealed. 241(a)(4) 241(a)(2)(A) (i), (ii), (iii). 241(a)(5) 241(a)((3) (A), (B). 241(a)(6) Repealed. 241(a)(7) 241(a)(4)(A). 241(a)(8) 241(a)(5). 241(a)(9)(A) 241(a)(1)(C)(i). 241(a)(9)(B) 241(a)(1)(D)(i). 241(a)(10) Previously repealed. 241(a)(11) 241(a)(2)(B). 241(a)(12) Repealed. 241(a)(13) 241(a)(1)(E)(i). 241(a)(14) 241(a)(2)(C). 241(a)(15) Repealed. 241(a)(16) Repealed. 241(a)(17) 241(a)(2)(D) (i), (ii), (iii). 241(a)(18) 241(a)(2)(D)(iv). 241(a)(19) 241(a)(4)(D). 241(a)(20) 241(a)(1)(F). 241(a)(21) 241(a)(3)(C). 241(b)(1) 241(a)(2)(A)(iv). 241(b)(2), (d) Repealed. 241(c)(1) 241(a)(1)(G)(i). 241(c)(2) 241(a)(1)(G)(ii). 241(e) 241(b). 241(f)(1) 241(a)(1)(H). 241(f)(2) Repealed. 241(g) 241(a)(1)(D)(ii).
