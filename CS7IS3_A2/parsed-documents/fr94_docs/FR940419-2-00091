FR940419-2-00091 FR940419-2-00048 Bureau of Reclamation All-American Canal Lining Project, Imperial County, CA AGENCY: Bureau of Reclamation, Interior. ACTION: Notice of availability of the final environmental impact statement/final environmental impact report: INT FES&hyph;94&hyph;9. SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and section 21002 of the California Environmental Quality Act, Reclamation and the Imperial Irrigation District have issued a joint final environmental impact statement/final environmental impact report (FEIS/FEIR) on a proposed canal lining project. Reclamation proposes to conserve about 67,700 acre-feet of water, annually lost through seepage from the federally owned, unlined All-American Canal, for beneficial use in southern California. The canal delivers 3.3 million acre-feet of water annually from the Colorado River for the Imperial Valley and Coachella Valley. ADDRESSES: Single copies of the FEIS/FEIR may be obtained on request to the regional director at the address below: •Regional Director, Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region, P.O.

Box 61470, Attention: LC&hyph;150, Boulder City, NV 89006&hyph;1470; telephone: (702) 293&hyph;8560; or Michael Remington, Imperial Irrigation District, P.O. Box 937, Imperial, CA 92251; telephone: (619) 339&hyph;9426. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The preferred alternative presented in the FEIS/FEIR is to construct a new concrete-lined canal parallel to the 23-mile reach of the existing unlined canal from 1 mile west of Pilot Knob to Drop 3. The project is authorized by Public Law 100&hyph;675. The Imperial Irrigation District proposes to construct the project with funds provided by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) in accordance with Public Law 100&hyph;675. The conserved water would be utilized by MWD and other California water agencies holding Colorado River water delivery contracts with the Secretary of the Interior. The environmental aspects of primary concern are the potential loss of wetlands habitat along the All-American Canal that have been induced by canal seepage, the loss of terrestrial habitat, and the reduction in the canal fishery. These potential losses would be mitigated by enhancing unaffected wetlands along the canal, acquiring and protecting terrestrial habitat, and replacing canal fishery habitat. The FEIS/FEIR presents the preferred alternative and four other alternatives, including the no Federal action alternative, describes the existing environment and the environmental consequences of project construction, and presents the proposed mitigation plan. It also documents the comments received during the 90-day public review of the draft environmental impact statement/draft environmental impact report and presents Reclamation's responses to comments.
