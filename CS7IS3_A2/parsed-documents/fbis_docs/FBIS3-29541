"I will explain the direction of tax reforms" at the G-7 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers, Fujii told reporters after a morning cabinet meeting. He was referring to reported U.S. dissatisfaction over Japan's income tax cuts limited to a single year. Fujii noted that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa instructed his ministers at the cabinet meeting to pin down efforts in realizing tax reform by the end of the year, as agreed to by the ruling coalition parties. "That (agreement) spells out a balanced tax system on income and consumption," Fujii stressed, indicating a direction for full-fledged income tax cuts. He also said he would "strongly insist" that Japan's record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package, including 6 trillion yen in tax cuts, would contribute to lifting the economy. On currency exchange rates, Fujii expressed his intention to call for reaffirmation of a past G-7 accord that calls for cooperation to stem speculative moves and keep rates stable under economic fundamentals. "Wild volatility is bad not only for a country but for the global economy," Fujii noted. Fujii brushed aside speculation that U.S. monetary authorities intend to tolerate the yen's rise, saying, "I don't know about other U.S. officials but I haven't heard any such remarks by the monetary authorities." Regarding the Japan-U.S. "Framework" trade talks, the U.S. side "seems to be misunderstanding" the insurance area, Fujii said, noting that Japan must make further explanation. Japan will continue to take deregulatory and other measures in the insurance field, and they will be specified in a detailed program to be launched at the G-7 meeting. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura on Thursday told reporters that Hosokawa will hold a cabinet meeting to discuss Japan's measures in reducing the trade imbalance. On possible U.S. sanctions against Japan, Fujii said although Hosokawa and Clinton failed to reach agreement on the framework talks during their February 11 meeting, they did agree to maintain "basic friendship relations." "This must not be destroyed," he said.
