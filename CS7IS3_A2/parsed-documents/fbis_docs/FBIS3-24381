Aleksandr Belyayev, leader of the bloc, reported this at a news conference yesterday. However, according to his words, such a position does not mean that the DUP [Democratic Unity of St. Petersburg] will not cooperate with other blocs in the second round of the elections. The bloc is conducting negotiations on the possible mutual support of candidates who won the sympathy of the voters in the first round. But yesterday the DUP finally published its preelection program. Its main thesis--St. Petersburg should become a safe city, which includes the guarantee of the personal safety of citizens, a fight against crime and corruption, a fight against ecological crimes, and the prevention of social conflicts. The social and economic policy of the municipal authorities should be subordinated to these tasks. As for the fate of the head of the executive authority of the city, Aleksandr Belyayev did not agree with certain preelection associations that are proposing holding mayoral elections before the end of this year. In his opinion, conditions have not yet ripened for early elections.
