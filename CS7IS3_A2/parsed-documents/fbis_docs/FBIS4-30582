The prime minister delivered a speech, during which he noted to Korean businessmen that relations between the two countries are now entering a new dimension, that of a joint investment, which will enhance stability and contribute to regional prosperity as a whole. The prime minister took note of the overwhelming success of South Korea in development of democratic administration, free trade and industries, and cultural progress, especially in sports. He said that ROK achievements serve as a model to all developing countries. The prime minister said that Thailand should not simply be a market for Korean industry but should serve as a gateway for joint investment ventures, which will certainly benefit South Korea. He noted that the labor in Thailand is skilled labor, and Thailand also boasts high financial stability. The value of the baht is strong, and Thailand has the lowest rate of inflation in Asia. He said South Korea should take advantage of those favorable aspects of Thailand to expand trade and industry to step ahead into Burma and other Indochinese countries in the future.
