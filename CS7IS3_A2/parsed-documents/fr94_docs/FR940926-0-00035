FR940926-0-00035 FR940926-0-00010 After reviewing the comments and other available information, NHTSA continues to believe that the proposed number of pressure cycles accurately represents the extreme conditions that CNG fuel containers could experience during their lifetime, with a margin of safety. This is based on the large number of cycles to which fleet vehicles are subjected. The agency believes that the 5,000 cycles suggested by AAMA and Norris would not ensure the safety of vehicles that experience multiple refuelings each day, such as taxis and other fleets. NHTSA further notes that the number of cycles being adopted is consistent with the cycles in NGV2 and therefore establishes a minimum level of safety that is consistent with NGV2, a standard supported by a large majority of the commenters. Accordingly, the agency has determined that a CNG fuel container will be subject to 18,000 pressure cycles. 2. Failure Criteria In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that a CNG fuel container would have to meet two test criteria to pass the pressure cycling test: (1) No leakage, and (2) no permanent circumferential deformation greater than one percent. The agency proposed these two criteria to provide objective means of evaluating a container's durability during compliance testing. NHTSA adopted the no leakage portion of the proposal from NGV2's pressure cycling test. The one percent deformation level, which is not in NGV2's pressure cycling test, was based on the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Recommended Practice J10, August 1985, a requirement involving the performance of metal air brake reservoirs. The agency proposed a limit on circumferential deformation to aid in determining when a container's failure was impending. No commenters objected to the no leakage criterion. Accordingly, the agency has adopted the no leakage requirement in the final rule. The agency believes that specifying that containers ``shall not leak'' provides an objective measure that will ensure that a container maintains its integrity by retaining its contents under pressure. Sixteen commenters addressed the issue of the allowable circumferential deformation criterion. The commenters were NGVC, Brunswick, Pressed Steel Tank (PST), Structural Composites Industry (SCI), Tecogen, CGA, AAMA, Amoco, Alusuisse, Oklahoma Gas, ARC, Flxible, Fiber Dynamics, Norris, Comdyne, and EDO. All the commenters, except Brunswick, believed that the agency should not include a deformation requirement in the pressure cycling or burst tests. The commenters believed that the test requirement is not appropriate for all container materials and designs. They stated that due to the nature of the different materials used in these containers, and their different rates of deformation under load, some materials such as fiberglass, would deform more than others, such as steel. The commenters also stated that deformation was not an indicator of impending failure and that the SAE brake reservoir test was not appropriate for a CNG fuel container application.
