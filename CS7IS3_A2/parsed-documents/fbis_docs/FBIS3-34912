The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] yesterday issued a statement broadcast over Aden radio protesting President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's order to annul Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas' decision to appoint a new governor of the southern (?Abyan) Governorate. The YSP, which is led by Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, said that al-'Attas' decision does not contravene the constitution as long as it aims to prevent corruption in the governorate. The Yemeni presidency regarded the decision as a violation of both the constitution and the law because appointing governors must be effected by joint decisions of the president and the vice president. It goes without saying that this issue is within the differences which seem to be continuing between the northerners and southerners, between the president and the vice president, or between the two main political parties, the YSP and General People's Congress.
