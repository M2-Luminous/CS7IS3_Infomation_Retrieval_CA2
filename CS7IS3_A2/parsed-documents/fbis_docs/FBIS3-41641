In his contribution to the document, he will be handing in to EC Government leaders at the end of the year, he champions a radically new resource-based system. This idea is favoured by a team of Commission experts, who have been considering these issues with an eye towards the White Paper: wage costs are twice as high as the net income of workers, whereas energy and investment taxes do not match the size of the increase. Present compulsory taxation systems are making it so much harder for European businesses to compete with their rivals and are having a serious affect on job prospects, so they need to be given a complete overhaul, claim the experts in their report. Competitiveness, employment and the environment are three types of policies that ``might be neutral towards one another, they might be mutually reinforcing, and they may indeed be contradictory.'' For the likes of the Commission and the Presidency of the EC Council of Ministers, they stand a good chance of strengthening each other, but others only spot the potential conflicts. This issue already cropped up for discussion, albeit from a narrow point of view, in a Communication the Commission produced roughly a year ago on the theme of industrial competitiveness and the environment . A working group made up of members of various Commission services, and orchestrated by the ``Forward studies unit'' (created by Jacques Delors), has been giving these matters some thought in the runup to a conference being organised by the Commission and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers on the theme of Forward towards a European model of sustainable development, on 9-10 November (at the Centre Borschette in Brussels) and the environment chapter in the White Paper, which has to be ready in time for the EC Summit on 10/11 December. The mid-term report drawn up by the group throws the spotlight on areas where EC action is vital to ensure employment/competitiveness and environmental protection stimulate each other. Root-and-Branch Reform of Tax Systems The Commissioner wants to see environmental costs and benefits meshed in with macro- and micro-economic planning systems. Our labour and profit-based taxation systems ought to be changed to use resources and pollution as starting points, including soil utilisation taxes, the Commissioner believes, as ``green taxes'' are the best means of integrating environmental factors into the economy. He gives a few examples for guidance purposes: a landfill site eco-tax collected by the local authorities would make the comparative cost of incineration, recycling or re-use more realistic. Taxes on industrial output or profits could make way for charges on soil utilisation, emissions into the air or water. The present vehicle taxes stand back for emission-related road charges. Different eco-taxes on packaging could automatically lead to a reduction in the level of waste and boost the efficiency of waste processing. Employment Overly Penalised Our present system ``penalises work and production,'' reckons the Commissioner, who feels that ``our social insurance systems are mostly obsolete, over-generous (...) and very expensive,'' while ``our tax system, and notably VAT, encourages the use of capital rather than labour.'' What is needed is a new development model based on the integration of the environment into our economic thinking. The Commissioner is persuaded that this new approach will make ``the environment our new locomotive for healthy growth.'' Energy Saving in the Construction Industry: More Than 30 Million Job-Years The Commissioner stresses the two separate roles of the environment strategy: -- protective role: an effort to save or restore our environment, mainly through legislating, which may create additional jobs but can add to the costs of operating the economies. -- active role: when action for the environment directly increases the competitiveness of our economies and products. The action may also create jobs in certain circumstances (but not always). Accordingly, the introduction of a a carbon energy tax does not especially create jobs in the short run, but an energy saving programme in the building industry can generate between 24 and 34 million job-years over the next few years, underscores the EC Commissioner. Energy/CO2 Tax Could Maximise Employment Potential Although the Commissioner does not believe that the introduction of a CO2/energy tax will create jobs in the short term, the ``inter-services group'' of the Commission emphasises, in its report, the economic benefits of the energy/CO2 tax, revenues from which, since it is ``neutral'' from an macro-economic point of view, could help to lower certain taxes which create large distortions (such as wage costs). The report stresses that, in calculating the effects of the tax, only the general reductions of other taxes (neutrality) were considered, and not a ``custom-made'' reduction aimed specifically at job creation. Simulations have shown that application of the energy/CO2 tax would have no effect, or a slightly positive effect, on employment. However, if the effects of the energy/CO2 tax were calculated with a concomitant basis of taxes affecting employment directly and specifically, the results could be much more positive. The key is the reduction in taxes which create large distortions in employment and competitivity in relation to the EC's rivals, the report notes. To create jobs in the short term, the report recommends using revenues from the tax to help industry to invest. New Model of Development: Four Focuses The new model of development favoured by the Commission is based on four high-priority measures: -- a rapid start to a programme of research into the economic implications of environmental measures, in order to assess the costs and benefits in terms of growth, employment and technological development, over both the short and longer term; -- a re-orientation of tax systems (see above); -- with the conclusion of a GATT agreement, the initiation of a new ``green'' round of negotiations on environmental and cultural dumping; -- extensive research into and implementation of an action programme for radical change to the urban environment. Community Action Essential In the opinion of the inter-services group, the key to increasing employment and improving competitivity within the framework of sustainable development lies first in a total reform of the structure and operation of social security systems. The group identified five areas for which Community action is necessary and would be effective: -- as a top priority, the group chose eco-taxes, which would facilitate sharp reductions in taxes that create distortions and have a negative effect on employment and competitivity. Using environmental taxes has the advantage of influencing millions of consumers and firms without entailing costly administrative charges. -- provision of information to increase Europeans' awareness of the issue of ``sustainability.'' The Community is well placed to promote debate, inform and encourage cooperation. -- restoration of sites suffering environmental damage, to rectify the errors of the past and prevent future pollution, with the help of new technologies (creation of jobs). -- The Community must orient its research and sectorial policies towards sustainable development. -- The Community should encourage a basic debate on lifestyles in Europe and ways of changing them (in terms of flexibility of working hours, time management and use of transport). Such societal changes could have positive consequences for sustainable models of socio- economic development (which could in turn increase employment).
