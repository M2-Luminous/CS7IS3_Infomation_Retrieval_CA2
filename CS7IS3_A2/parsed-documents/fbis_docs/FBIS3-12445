TISHRIN says it is not strange that Israel tries to hide the traces of the dawn crime with another crime also targeting worshipers in a church in Juniyah. This was exposed by the similar plans of implementation, which threaten the Arabs in their homeland, shrines, and even at their prayers. If the Zionist terrorists managed to enter the Ibrahimi Mosque and open fire at Palestinian worshipers, their proxy instruments played the same role in Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Juniyah when they planted explosive devices in disgusting timing, because at that time the church is packed with worshipers on the occasion of Lent. TISHRIN stresses that the Zionists are masters in desecrating shrines and committing blatant aggressions against these shrines. In this, they do not differentiate between a church and a mosque. Their objective is to kill more Arabs. Following the Hebron massacre, it seems that the Israelis were afraid of the overwhelming popular anger in the occupied Arab territories, and were affected by the broad Arab and international condemnation, so they tried through their new heinous crime in Sayyidat al-Najat Church to overshadow the denunciation and anger at Israel and Rabin's government caused by the Hebron crime. TISHRIN adds: Israel, which thought that by committing the massacre of Sayyidat al-Najat Church it could alleviate the effects of the Hebron massacre, is once again deluded. Concluding, TISHRIN says that Lebanese blood is not cheap. It is Arab blood the same as Palestinian and Syrian blood. Israel should not be allowed to continue with its crimes and massacres before the eyes of the entire world. It should not be allowed to undermine the will of the international community and the resolutions of international legitimacy, adhere to its occupation of the Arab territories, and reject the just and comprehensive peace. It is impossible to remain silent toward Israel's terrorist practices. Israel should be deterred and stopped, and this is an international responsibility as much as it is an Arab responsibility.
