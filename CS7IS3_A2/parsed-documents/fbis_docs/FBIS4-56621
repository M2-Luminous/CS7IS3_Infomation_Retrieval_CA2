Not only is he responsible for hydrocarbons, but also electricity and other energy sources, like wind and solar power, which he believes should be the ones Bolivia uses most in the future. At the same time, he is preparing to begin the process of privatizing the companies in this sector: YPFB [Bolivian Government Oil Deposits] and ENDE [National Electricity Enterprise]; to continue negotiations to build the gas pipeline to Brazil; to oversee compliance of the accords with Argentina; and to analyze the possibilities of selling gas to Paraguay and Chile. [passage omitted] Gas Routes [PRESENCIA] You have been one of the promoters of the project to convert Bolivia into a center for supplying gas to the Southern Cone. What is that project based on? [Miranda] The vision that we have (I can no longer say that I have, for it seems that everybody has adopted this view) is that for natural gas, our geographic position in the center of the continent is an advantage. We are a sort of Latin American Tibet. To the west lie the Andes, a formidable barrier; to the north and east, the great green barrier of the Amazon forests; and to the south, thousands of kilometers of pampas. And we are right in the middle. While we have blamed a large part of our troubles on this landlocked position, I believe we have a special edge for natural gas because on both coasts--that is, toward the Atlantic and the Pacific--we have two neighbors with structural energy shortages, which means that they are not expected to be able to provide all the energy they need for their own consumption. To the south is Argentina, the third or fourth leading consumer of gas in the world, proportionally: 40 percent of the energy Argentina and Brazil consume is gas. So we have two large potential markets and one large real market to the south. That is the origin of the concept that Bolivia may become a gas supply and distribution center, for we also have Peru with large gas deposits in Camisea. Let me repeat this: our geographic position and those markets, plus the availability of resources, make those prospects possible. How is all this taking shape? We are starting with Brazil. PETROBRAS [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] has submitted its engineering costs study to us. [PRESENCIA] Is the engineering costs study for the gas pipeline from its border to Sao Paulo or does it include the entire pipeline? [Miranda] It includes the entire pipeline. Actually, the study covers the gas pipeline for the Rio Grande (Santa Cruz)-Campinas-Sao Paulo-Curitiba-Porto Alegre line; this gas pipeline is not going to supply only Sao Paulo, but the entire Brazilian southeast. It opens up to us both the Sao Paulo market and the market in southern Brazil, its most productive area. To the south, we have been supplying gas to Argentina for over 20 years. The result of our latest trip is that we now have a supplemental accord for hydrocarbons. We have worked out a great concept here: hydrocarbons and their by-products from Bolivia can flow to Argentina free of taxes and without any tariff or paratariff barriers, and vice versa. Our view is that while we are suppliers to Argentina, at some given moment we may also be purchasers from Argentina or transporters of Argentine gas to Brazil or other points. [PRESENCIA] But by eliminating tariffs, are we not hurting ourselves, especially when acting as a distribution center? [Miranda] No; we would be doing ourselves no favor if we put tariffs on gas that comes into Bolivia to be sent on to other markets. We want gas to flow through Bolivia "as fluidly as possible." The gas pipeline system that we have now, as well as the projected system, are designed to create a large closed circuit on the Atlantic coast, where gas can flow in any direction. [PRESENCIA] Give us an example of the advantages for Bolivia of transporting Argentine gas to Brazil. [Miranda] Making maximum use of our infrastructure that has been built so that it can be expanded. [PRESENCIA] Will a toll fee be charged? [Miranda] Of course! [PRESENCIA] Who will set the rates? [Miranda] That will be determined at the precise time the operation is conducted. But such fees are a fully accepted practice all over the world. We also plan to go to Chile, and this gas from northern Argentina has to flow through Bolivia to enter Chile too. The Argentines are going to build a gas pipeline to Santiago. We plan to go to Antofagasta; it is my goal to have this circuit also completed by 2015 or 2020. These are large markets; the gas will come from Bolivia's reserves, from northern Argentina, and from Comisea (Peru), and Bolivia will serve as the gas supply and distribution center. [PRESENCIA] What does that mean in terms of volumes, dimensions, and money? [Miranda] With what we have now, by using 3.4 trillion we can supply Brazil with 560 million cubic feet of gas per day. That means that if we have 10 times more, we can supply the entire system, in the long term, with 5.6 billion cubic feet a day. [PRESENCIA] With our own reserves? [Miranda] With our own reserves. [PRESENCIA] What does that represent in time? [Miranda] It will mean 20 uninterrupted years, and with the Bolivian reserves that may come to 33. If we add the reserves from northern Argentina in this integrated system, plus the Camisea reserves, we are talking about a gas pipeline system that could handle about 50 trillion cubic feet a day for 20 to 50 years. [PRESENCIA] What does this mean in terms of money? [Miranda] We are getting into some very special calculations and speculations. We will say the following: the 215 million cubic feet that we now send to Argentina represents $100 million in revenues a year. So right away the Brazilian business will be more than $250 million a year. The problem is determining how much gas will cost in the long term. But at constant prices, we are talking about eight times what we can send to Brazil, that is $1.6 billion a year in 20 years, in a gradual process that will continue to grow. Let us not forget that gas is the fossil fuel of the 21st century. The data show that everybody is trying to move as much toward gas as possible, because it is the least polluting fuel. Moreover, it has a stable and permanent supply. To recap these ideas: our geographic position with markets around us, and natural resources in and near Bolivia (northern Argentina and Peru) make it possible to plan this large network, and in very conservative figures, we are speaking of this order of magnitude. [PRESENCIA] Geologically, what will happen when this energy supply comes to an end? Will it be necessary to change the energy matrix? [Miranda] Yes, but that is at least 50 years in the future. What happens to the other energy sources? That is why I speak of gas fundamentally as energy for export, for our most abundant resource is hydroelectric power. We should export gas and generate our own energy hydroelectrically to the greatest extent possible. Let me point out that along with this gas production, we estimate that while we have 22 trillion cubic feet of gas still remaining to be discovered in the country, we estimate that we also have about 4 billion barrels of petroleum, so I am talking about another 40 to 50 years of petroleum as well. We should not address the problem by asking what will happen when our petroleum or gas are depleted, for we are talking about a time frame of at least 50 years. That same situation is true all over the world. Everything now known about hydrocarbon reserves and consumption on a global level shows that up to 2040 the figure is certain. From that point forward it is very difficult to foresee. The image of a nonrenewable resource that is going to come to an end is relative, for at the same time a number of substitutes have to come in. Work is being done on other fuels like hydrogen, and others are being sought. But right now, in global terms, the world remains dependent on hydrocarbons as its great energy source, and in national terms, we are in the same position and have a horizon similar to the world position, perhaps a tiny bit beyond that. Gas Pipeline Being Built [PRESENCIA] How are negotiations going for gas sales to Brazil? [Miranda] This is the situation now. First, PETROBRAS has defined how it wants to bring the entire project to Porto Alegre. A very detailed engineering cost study has been received and the general feeling that we have, that they gave us, is that despite the World Bank's objections, the gas pipeline, first of all, is Latin America's biggest energy project, and that is extremely important. Second, it has such appeal to any investor that they are sure that despite the World Bank's objections, financing will be arranged at terms that are acceptable for the investor and for us (the producers and consumers). Obviously, it would be easier with the World Bank, but the president of PETROBRAS told me that when they were going to build the Itaipu dam, the bank raised similar and many more objections, but they went ahead and built Itaipu, which is larger than the gas pipeline project, so he was quite sure that this project will go ahead. [PRESENCIA] What might the problems be in PETROBRAS? There was said to be internal opposition to the project. [Miranda] The problem is that PETROBRAS, constitutionally, holds a monopoly on the import and supply of hydrocarbons in Brazil. That led the World Bank to raise that objection. The problem is in the hands of the Brazilian Congress. Until 15 May, they are going to be reforming their Constitution and they are studying that and many other reforms. There is a strong inclination to take the monopoly on the import, transport, and marketing of hydrocarbons in Brazil away from PETROBRAS. Where is it going to end up? We do not know, as this is an internal Brazilian problem. Some indications seem to suggest that PETROBRAS might retain a large part of its monopoly, but for gas it might no longer hold that monopoly. If that happens, the financing problem would be much easier, because in the end, that will result in repayment guarantees for the loans they get to build the pipeline. With the monopoly, the view from outside is that PETROBRAS is not a sufficient guarantor, but if it loses the monopoly, those guarantees would exist. So far, we know of three large consortia that would definitely like to compete to build the project. These include Enron, the BHP, Tenneco, and British Gas group, which has visited the country, and according to PETROBRAS, the French group TOTAL. [PRESENCIA] Would this be with or without PETROBRAS as the majority enterprise? [Miranda] Yes, it would be with or without PETROBRAS holding the majority. [PRESENCIA] Is YPFB able to handle that job for the Brazilian part? [Miranda] Yes, there would be no problem on the Bolivian side. [PRESENCIA] Then why are you saying that the project will be built with private capital? [Miranda] Because we decided that this project will be carried out fundamentally--not exclusively--with private investment. [PRESENCIA] Why? [Miranda] Because there is now no intention for YPFB to get involved in this type of investment. YPFB has no access to financing sources. One reason for its privatization is the closeoff of concessionaire multinational capital continuing with the state as a contractor. [PRESENCIA] How much do you calculate will be invested on the Bolivian side? [Miranda] About $450 million. Of that amount, half will easily be spent on materials and at least about $100 million on labor. [PRESENCIA] And the Brazilian investment? [Miranda] To Porto Alegre, about $1.6 billion. The total project is on the order of $2 billion. [PRESENCIA] Does the Bolivian investment include the supply of gas to be exported? [Miranda] No, that is another item. For the supply to the pipe, it is estimated--with a fairly good degree of precision--that we will invest about $700 million over the next 10 years to develop fields, build feeder lines, and put a large plant in Rio Grande. [PRESENCIA] To whom will the gas pipeline belong? [Miranda] To the transporting enterprise, but our legislation will state that any gas producer, not just YPFB, may enter this pipeline. We have to see two things: that YPFB has the sales contract, it must provide; and the transporter will be the one that has the line and carries the gas. This line will be a "common carrier," so any enterprise will have the right to enter the line by paying its toll fee. All this, controlled by the regulatory agency, will be set up as part of the privatization process. Argentine Compensation [PRESENCIA] Could you explain the contents of the agreement that has been signed in Argentina? [Miranda] We have signed a three-year sales contract. We are going to increase the volume of gas a little. Before, we were selling 200 million cubic feet and we are going to raise that to 215, and we are also increasing the "take or pay." [PRESENCIA] What is "take or pay"? [Miranda] These things are not absolutely precise; there are seasonal fluctuations in demand and other factors, so "take or pay" means that the purchaser is obliged to pay the seller for a minimum volume of what has been contracted, even if he does not take the entire amount. This is called "take or pay," meaning that even if you do not receive, you still have to pay. In the petroleum world, gas contracts are written with "take or pay" clauses of 80 or 75 percent. We got 92.5 percent. [PRESENCIA] So if you do not use the gas, you pay us 92.5 percent of what was agreed? [Miranda] Of the volume of which we spoke. The previous contract had an 85 percent "take or pay" clause. [PRESENCIA] What does Argentina do with that unused gas? [Miranda] It puts it into its system, which it has to sell, and if not it will still have to pay for it. Fortunately, we have not had to use a "take or pay" with Argentina. They took everything we sent. We are now beginning a seasonal pricing mode: in winter it costs a little more and in summer a little less. The first year the price is going to be 1.05 [denomination not given] in summer and 1.10 in winter; the second year, 1.10 and 1.15; the third year, 1.15 and 1.20. And the door has been left open so that in the future, prices can be set based on variations in fuel oil prices. But that is still a potential arrangement. [PRESENCIA] The contract also includes the possibility of importing and exporting other by-products.... [Miranda] Yes. As a consequence of the termination of the old arrangement and starting new accounts, it was agreed that Bolivian gas could enter the deregulated Argentine market without any tariff and that it would be treated like Argentine gas. In exchange, Bolivia also lowered tariff barriers on all of Argentina's petroleum by-products until the year 2002. The change that has been introduced means that there is now no time limit, it is indefinite. So this creates a free energy market between Bolivia and Argentina, bearing in mind that we are becoming a gas distribution center. [PRESENCIA] In those conditions, is it possible that Argentina may send us gasoline that is cheaper than YPFB's gasoline? [Miranda] I do not think so, theoretically no. Do not forget that when we deregulate the market, which we are going to have to do in 120 days, we are going to enter a new system of setting prices in Bolivia. There will no longer be transfers from YPFB to the Treasury (which come to 65 percent); instead, there will be the ICE [Specific Consumption Tax]. So from now on, it will be the company's efficiency that will enable it to obtain the lowest possible cost. Right now, we are bringing diesel fuel from Argentina which, since there is no ICE or transfer, is an excellent deal. But when we start the ICE system, we are going to have an intermediate import and export parity model that will make it almost a matter of indifference whether it is a Bolivian or imported product. [PRESENCIA] Luckily, gasoline prices did not go up at the start of the year.... [Miranda] That is part of the reason why. [PRESENCIA] But will they go up automatically? [Miranda] No, we do not expect prices to rise, because in this system what interests us most is that the ICE replaces YPFB's 65 percent transfer. It will be a tax in the full meaning of the word. Then YPFB will be able to compete perfectly. It has been hard to compete with YPFB, because all the pipelines are set up for domestic consumption, and bringing products in from other countries to Bolivia is difficult. We do not believe that will cause major disruptions; perhaps in some products there may be some things that do not work smoothly, but I do not think it will cause any problems for the Treasury. [PRESENCIA] And for the citizens? [Miranda] Or for the citizens, for if the YPFB product plus the ICE is too expensive, the imported product will take away its market. [PRESENCIA] What does it mean that YPFB and YPFSA [Government Oil Deposits, S.A.] (of Argentina) can join in an association? [Miranda] The association contract that has been initialized and that will take effect very soon is our first such contract in Bolivia. It means that YPFB signs an association contract with YPFSA of Argentina. YPFSA conducts the operation at its own risk, using its own resources. When there is commercial production, YPFB has the option of working in association or continuing with an operating contract like the ones we already have, and for everything that has been invested, YPFB only acknowledges the costs of commercially exploitable wells. [PRESENCIA] One last issue with Argentina. They have made a payment to us of $84 million. Why? [Miranda] Basically, they have given us $84 million, of which $50 million is fully and totally available, and $34 million is to be used for border development projects. [PRESENCIA] Why are they making this payment? [Miranda] Our proposal goes like this: "Gentlemen, as you are our sole gas market, you set the price (this is the truth; as we do not have anyone else to sell it to, they set the price), and as you put us in the position of keeping all of your economic activity balanced, you have to compensate us." That was the rationale behind that proposal. We Are Changing the Nation Carlos Miranda was inevitably asked about the privatization of YPFB and ENDE, which are now under his stewardship. In both cases, he expressed confidence that this process will move forward, although slowly. He said YPFB's value is between $1.5 and $2 billion, but there are some variables that could cause its value to rise. [PRESENCIA] Who will be the owner of the pipelines? [Miranda] The party who privatizes it: the state is completely withdrawing. [PRESENCIA] What does the clause in the Privatization Law mean, which says that hydrocarbon resources remain the "property of the state and are inalienable and nontransferable"? [Miranda] That means that the state, when it privatizes or awards areas through contracts or licensing arrangements, is not giving away the reserves, which remain under its control. [PRESENCIA] What does market deregulation mean for hydrocarbons? [Miranda] Deregulation will be a gradual process. In a country full of ports it is very easy to do this; in Bolivia the process is quite complicated. At first, it will mean that YPFB's transfers will be compensated with both sales and production taxes, and that prices will not be set by decree, as they are now, but by the workings of supply and demand. [PRESENCIA] YPFB now has contracts with a number of companies. Will the privatization process include them? [Miranda] One issue that is being discussed is whether we will privatize YPFB by itself or with its contracts as well. If we take the first route, the companies will be able to sell their products. If we choose the second route, everything is going to pass through the hands of the privatized YPFB. Those two positions both have their pros and cons. If we privatize YPFB with its contracts, we are replacing a public monopoly with a private monopoly. Of course, here the regulatory agencies will be greatly involved in order to avoid any unfair consumer practices. That is what concerns us. The other model will be simpler, as they will enter a full competition system. Electricity Then Miranda explained the benefits of privatizing ENDE, even though the company now generates profits and performs a social function by undertaking unprofitable projects, especially in rural areas. "First, ENDE is now a financially sound company as the Treasury has covered over $100 million of its debts. To continue expanding, ENDE is in the same position as YPFB. It would have to turn to external financing that is closed for this type of project, so the possibility of ENDE's expansion, not in the short term, as it has financing for the next two or three years, might be a problem." He added that "the model is adjusted so that Bolivia can substantially increase the rate of growth of its Gross Domestic Product. That will present major energy requirements, as we will need energy in order to grow. ENDE can handle a growth of 3 percent, but if we raise this rate to 6, 7, 8, or 9 percent, there will be big financing problems, and that is one of the fundamental reasons for privatizing ENDE." "By privatizing ENDE--and we are quite sure about the model--we want to create the conditions for healthy competition." Rural Electrification: the Third Arm Miranda explained that rural electrification is complicated "because the problem of rural areas is not simply electricity. In essence, it is a problem of poverty: of being able to bring energy in any form (electricity, LPG [Liquefied Petroleum Gas], kerosene, unconventional forms of energy), and then having the ability to pay for it." To deal with that situation, his office is working on a plan to establish the DIFER [Office of Rural Energy Promotion], which will serve as a link between organizations like NGO's [nongovernmental organizations], foundations, and multilateral and private institutions, with municipalities, in order to finance specific projects in specific areas. Local participation will be involved in that process because, with that, communities will be able to determine precisely what their needs are and develop appropriate projects, which will not necessarily involve electricity. He made it clear that that plan "is outside the privatization plan, but it is not intended that the state will do everything, for that has been a failure." Enthusiastically, he said this is "our third big plan and it is the one which presents the greatest challenges, because to set loose, absolutely in the hands of market forces, almost 50 percent of the rural population would not be very prudent. We need to develop a system to give rural inhabitants access to energy." He insisted that "this still needs to be worked out, for we have to coordinate this very well with all the social development programs. We have to recognize the problem of agriculture, the problem of energy for agriculture is the problem of poverty. This is a slow and complex process, but we are putting much faith in the process."
