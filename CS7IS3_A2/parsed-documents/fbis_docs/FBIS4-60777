Yeltsin's letter came as answer to a letter sent by Brazauskas earlier this month. Brazauskas told reporters after the meeting that the Russian president links the implementation of economic treaties with the problem of Russian transit to the Kaliningrad region through Lithuania. Russian transit through Lithuanian territory remains the main stumbling block hindering economic and trade relations between the two countries. The Lithuanian leadership raised the issue on numerous occasions on the international level. Lithuania and other European nations need to know whether such positions reflect the working style of Moscow functionaries or Russia's political line, Brazauskas said in his speech at the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly April 14. After his meeting with Obiortyshev, the Lithuanian president emphasized that Lithuania cannot assent to such a policy. He said the Lithuanian-Russian economic treaties signed last November were a result of only one stage of talks, but transit to Kaliningrad and visa requirements are matters of further negotiation. But Brazauskas called "acceptable" Yeltsin's proposal to continue talks because "the interests and tendencies" of both countries coincide. Brazauskas said the Russian ambassador told him that the official Moscow values his initiative to exchange letters between presidents. Obiortyshev said the process would be "a good impulse" to bilateral talks. The Russian diplomat said relations between Lithuania and Russia are not bad, but neither of the sides is satisfied with their "tempo." Obiortyshev noted, however, that Russia's relations with Lithuania have progressed much further than relations with Estonia and Latvia, as well as other former Soviet republics.
