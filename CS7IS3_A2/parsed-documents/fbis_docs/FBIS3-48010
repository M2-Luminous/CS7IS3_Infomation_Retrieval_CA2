In this connection, the Japanese Government stated that it "has not been informed of it officially. However, if such a request is made, the government intends to refuse it. While the United States and the EC have demanded that contents of the agreement on market access issues under GATT's multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Round), which was concluded at the end of last year, be improved, Japan has stated that it is "impossible to bring up things on which an agreement was already reached for negotiations once again" (according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]). However, the situation remains fluid because, with the Japan-U.S. summit talks near at hand, the United States is expected to strongly demand that a quadrilateral meeting be held. The issue of holding a quadrilateral meeting cropped up when President Clinton, who is now visiting Europe, met with EC Commission President Delors and other officials. During discussion on trade issues, the two leaders agreed that the United States and the EC should cooperate in urging Japan to further open its markets. In response, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and EC Commissioner Leon Brittan (in charge of external economic affairs) have agreed that consultations should be held at the quadrilateral meeting in an effort to further improve market access conditions on which an agreement was reached under the Uruguay Round talks. It is expected that the United States and the EC will demand that Japan further lower or abolish its tariffs on timber, copper, distilled liquor, and other products. The tariff issue concerning these products was concluded at a quadrilateral meeting held in Geneva at the end of last year, and the final agreement was reached under the Uruguay Round. In the negotiating process under the Uruguay Round, while the United States and the EC demanded the withdrawal of tariffs on such products as timber, Japan refused their demand. It is said that, "even after the Uruguay Round conclusion, "the U.S. and European industrial circles are exerting pressure on their governments, (according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MFA]). Japan has stressed its view that "because negotiating countries, including the United States, have reached an agreement on the Uruguay Round in a package, it is inappropriate to renegotiate on a part of the agreement," (as stated by the MFA). Some government officials have pointed out that "since Japan also wants to make some demands such as that the United States and the EC abolish tariffs on electronics products, no conclusion will be reached if a quadrilateral meeting is held," (according to a senior MITI official). However, because it seems that the United States and the EC are trying to encircle Japan with the two leaders playing a leading role, this is a source of concern for the Japanese Government officials.
