FBIS4-56566 "drlat088_a_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-088 Daily Report 5 May 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Decree-Law 149 on Confiscation of Goods Outlined Decree-Law 149 on Confiscation of Goods Outlined FL0505213794 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1700 GMT 5 May 94 FL0505213794 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Text] Today, the newspaper GRANMA printed Decree-Law No. 149 on the confiscation of goods and assets obtained through illegal enrichment. The document reflects the decision adopted by the Cuban parliament in response to demands by the majority of our people, charging the Council of State with adopting effective and exemplary measures against those who obtain illegal possessions as a result of theft, speculation, embezzlement, black market activities, or other forms of enrichment that negatively affect the most vital interests of our society. The decree-law provides for the confiscation and expropriation by the Cuban State, without any right of indemnification, of goods and assets obtained by people who directly or through third parties illegally increase their possessions in amounts beyond their normal income. The minister of finance will impose, through a resolution, the sanction of confiscation of goods and income in cases to which Decree-Law No. 149 refers. The Republic's attorney general will have the authority and legal faculties necessary to conduct investigations, and to substantiate procedures of confiscation, acting on his own initiative by virtue of any information obtained. The confiscation process will be directed against property owners, holders, or bearers of goods and assets, including those of third parties who benefited from them and who fictitiously appear as their owners. The attorney general's office, according to the results of the preliminary investigations, through a resolution, can retain the goods and assets of the person affected, and take any precautionary measures necessary to guarantee the fulfillment of the law. The attorney general's office will also determine any actions required by public officials, employees of any entity, or by administrative or public officials to substantiate the case, and to implement any preventative measures that it may determine. These actions must be executed within a specific period of time. According to the decree-law, once the attorney general's office adopts the necessary preventative measures on goods and assets, he will immediately call for legal proceedings in which those actions must be substantiated, and where those affected can present documents to justify the legitimacy of possession of those goods. According to the result of the proceedings, the attorney general's office will adopt one of the following actions: Prepare the preventative measures that correspond to the goods and assets in case of not having already done so, and in that case, to ratify or modify the established measures or to annul them; Pigeonhole the case file and annul the preventative measures, granting the return of goods and assets to their legal titleholders and owners; Present the records with the confiscatory claim to the minister of finance and begin penal proceedings independent of the confiscatory action, if the investigation determines the existence of a crime. Decree-Law No. 149 establishes that its implementation will be retroactive, given social interest, public use, and national needs. All acts carried out in an attempt to cover up the illegal character of an acquisition of goods or assets to which the document refers, and all actions carried out to avoid its application are annulled and lose all judicial value. The Council of Ministers is in charge of dictating regulation of the decree-law. All laws, decree-laws, decrees, and other legal dispositions that oppose the fulfillment of this Decree-Law No. 149 are abolished. Decree-Law No. 149 will become enforceable from the moment of its publication in the official gazette of the Republic of Cuba.
