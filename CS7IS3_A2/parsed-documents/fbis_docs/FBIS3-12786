CONTENTS: 1. Human Rights Violations Claimed 2. Government-Serbian Ties Cited 3. Mufti Interviewed on Israelis 4. Copts Urged To Denounce Butrus-Ghali 5. Butrus-Ghali Trial Urged 6. Release of Hamas Leader Urged 7. Yusuf Wali Castigated HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS CLAIMED A 400-word report on pages 1 and 7 cites a statement by the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights claiming irregularities in police handling of confrontations with and arrests of extremists. GOVERNMENT-SERBIAN TIES ALLEGED A 350-word report by 'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn appears on pages 1 and 7. Abu-Husayn starts out by saying: "Our government has committed a new crime against the memory of Bosnian martyrs, thus refuting all its claims of seeking to stop the Serbian massacres of Bosnian Muslims. Our government continues to deal with European companies exporting weapons to Serbs. It even allowed the Serbian military attache in Cairo to engage in supplying his countries with its military needs in weapons and hardware through a gun-running network of companies in Egypt, Cyprus, and other countries in the region." 'Abd-al-Sattar then summarizes a DER SPIEGEL report to the effect that "Serbian authorities have made Cairo their center for contacts in the region and for providing supplies to the Serbian war machine with the help of the Serbian military attache in Cairo." MUFTI INTERVIEWED ON ISRAELIS A 2,700-word report by Muhammad Hilal on page 6 includes Hilal's telephone interviews with Mufti of the Republic Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi and Ahmad Jamal Abu-al-'Aza'im, a leading Egyptian psychologist. The topic of the interviews is a conference held recently in Dar al-Ifta' or the house of Islamic legal opinions, of which the mufti is the head. The conference, organized by Abu-al- 'Aza'im, was attended by Israelis. Hilal is opposed to their presence in this "impregnable Islamic bastion" and questions both the mufti and the psychologist about this event. He writes: "I said: The Israelis [were] in Dar al-Ifta'. Why, Your Eminence? "His eminence the mufti is quoted: `By God, my son. I do not know of their participation in the conference, and I did not notice them in the hall when I delivered the opening speech on "Islam's Way of Resolving Conflicts."'" The mufti then explains that he granted Abu-al-'Aza'im's request to use the Dar al-Ifta's conference room without inquiring about the identity of the delegates. Asked what he will do if Abu-al-'Aza'im requests using the conference room for another conference, the mufti is cited saying: "After what happened, I will ask him about the identity of the delegations he will invite." Hilal presses the mufti further: "I said: `If, among the delegations, there is an Israeli delegation, will you refuse to hold the conference in Dar-al-Ifta?' "His eminence the mufti said: `Listen, my son, do not ask me who entered Dar al-Ifta' and what his identity or religion was. But ask me what Dar al-Ifta' will tell them.'" Jalal then asks the mufti about his speech to the conference and the mufti says: "I only delivered the opening speech and welcomed the guests. If you want to learn more, get in touch with Dr. Abu-al-'Aza'im." Jalal does that, phoning Abu-al-'Aza'im, who reacts to his questions with a call for dialogue as a means of ending hostilities in the region. The psychologist says: "Frankly speaking, enmity between us and Israel is a mere psychological wall that we are trying to demolish so that everyone may live in peace." COPTS URGED TO DENOUNCE BUTRUS-GHALI A 600-word column by Dr. Muhammad Muru appears on page 6 under the headline "Conspiracy against Egyptian Copts." Muru writes: "Sectarianism is an old imperial game that never goes out of fashion. Egypt, which remains a major obstacle to the imperialist and Zionist scheme, is facing a multiple threat. Turning Copts against Muslims in Egypt is an old policy that was pursued by British imperialism and by American and Zionist imperialism more recently. As part of this scheme, Muslim sensitivities are provoked so that they turn against Copts, making them hostile to the national cultural endeavor and swear allegiance to the Western imperial scheme." Muru reviews the history of Prime Minister Butrus-Ghali, a Coptic politician, who, hated by the nationalist movement, was assassinated in 1910 by a fellow Copt. The slain prime minister is the grandfather of the current UN secretary general, with whose policies Muru disagrees: "Today, Butrus-Ghali, the grandson, acts in a similar manner that provokes every Egyptian. The Coptic Egyptian UN secretary general does not hide his sympathies with Israel, describes UN Security Council Resolution 242 as not binding, and acquits himself as a hardliner in affairs concerning the blockade of Iraqi children and the Libyan people." The UN secretary general, Muru adds, "plays a suspicious and insolent part in the continuing massacres against the Bosnian people." Muru then reasons that the Copts should denounce the "crimes" of the UN secretary general, as their grandfathers denounced his grandfather's, "so as to foil the imperialist scheme aiming to foment hostility between the country's two religious communities." BUTRUS-GHALI TRIAL URGED A 1,100-word report by Khalid Yunus on page 7 concerns a seminar held by the Egyptian Committee for Supporting Bosnia on Monday 21 February. He writes: "The seminar held by the Egyptian Committee for Supporting Bosnia last Monday on the subject of `UN Legal and International Responsibility Toward the Bosnian Issue' called for staging a popular trial of the United Nations and its Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali and for the formation of a preparatory committee to make arrangements for the trial within two months." The seminar, Yunus adds, was attended by "a large number of international law experts and political figures, led by Labor Party leader Ibrahim Shukri." Addressing the seminar, Labor Party leader Shukri is cited as saying that "the trial of the United Nations and its Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is an urgent necessity in view of UN positions and resolutions that only serve Serbian schemes." RELEASE OF HAMAS LEADER URGED An unattributed 350-word column entitled "Palestinian Issues: Vatican and Shaykh Yasin" appears on page 8. The unidentified columnist notes that the Vatican is marking the holocaust. The writer asks: "What is curious is that this is the first time the Vatican is marking this occasion, which is taking place at a time when the truth about this presumed pogrom is starting to come out. Studies appearing even in the West speak of a big lie behind this story that has been touted for decades and been used by champions of Zionism to flagellate the world into a feeling of guilt so that they may earn undeserved compensation for an alleged tragedy." The columnist wonders why the Vatican should feel sympathy with a tragedy that "even if it is true" happened decades ago but overlooks the "living tragedy" of the Palestinian people. The columnist then asserts that the health of Ahmad Yasin, 58-year-old spiritual leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement--Hamas, "is seriously deteriorating as he languishes in an Israeli jail." The writer concludes: "Where are those who negotiate and mediate with Israel? Why don't they call for the release of the paralyzed shaykh?" YUSUF WALI CASTIGATED AL-SHA'B continues its long-running campaign against Yusuf Wali, deputy prime minister and minister of agriculture, livestock and fisheries, and land reclamation. A 2,200-word report by Salah Budaywi headlined "Wali and the Zionists Prepare a 45-Clause Plan To Promote the Idea of a Middle East Market" appears on page 10. Budaywi notes that the "Higer Zionist-Egyptian Agricultural Committee held its 18th session in Cairo late in the week before last." He then highlights a 25-point protocol on agricultural cooperation that was signed by both sides and calls for the establishment of joint scientific research centers and training programs. Throughout his report, Budaywi attempts to make the point that such cooperation with the "Zionist entity" is designed to ensure regional supremacy for the latter. For example, he writes: "The two sides agreed to request assistance from Washington in implementing a joint program in the framework of the Middle East market. The program, involving the United States, Egypt, the Zionist entity, and the Palestinians, aims at reclaiming desert areas in the Middle East and improving agriculture production. The program is designed to give the Zionist entity and its experts the upper hand."
