But that is just the way it is: we have still not received a proper reaction on the part of the government. This is why, with a feeling of complete solidarity, I am joining my colleagues from the neighboring oblasts and, once again, by taking action in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, I want to set forth the vision of the reforms from Russia's textile region. And currently a large machine-building center. Our main principle in the realization of the economic policy, which must be followed, is extremely brief: reforms for the people and not at their expense. The reforms should improve the lives of all people who are ready to work honestly and not reduce them to total impoverishment. The reforms should be carried out through improvement of the organization of the country's national economy and not through devaluation of the citizens' money and exorbitant taxes on commodity producers. What is decisively important for the Ivanovo Oblast's economy is the stabilization of the situation in the textile industry. In order to have this, first of all, it is necessary to solve the matters of supplying raw material at acceptable prices and selling the output at prices which would cover the average industry costs. It would seem that everything is simple. But, in practice, we are running up against insurmountable barriers. The actions of government economists, which are aimed at pushing Uzbekistan and other cotton-growing republics out of the ruble domain, have sharply aggravated the situation in the textile industry. Extremely necessary are urgent intergovernmental agreements on the organization of a payment union between the republics and, what is most important, permanent monitoring of their implementation. The following may be said with respect to the economic situation in the country: a policy, under which the production of the majority of goods becomes unprofitable and it is more worthwhile for the enterprises to stand idle than to operate, runs counter to the country's national interests. The stabilization of the state's finances, about which they have been talking for more than a year now, is really the most important task. But, with unconditional priority given to the stabilization of production and the creation of new jobs. It is necessary to fight against inflation. But, given the current landslide decline in production, it is impossible to restrain inflation in principle, since the decline in production is not of a structural nature, but rather, of a general nature. It is necessary to extend the state's economic policy directly to the commodity producer. And, in order to do this, the federal organs of power must, without delay, implement a number of urgent measures. The first item is taxes. Currently, with respect to the commodity producers, they exceed all reasonable limits. Such taxes are becoming nothing more than an economic noose. Over the millennia of the development of market relations, experience has proven that, in order for a commodity producer to produce goods and to support himself and the state, he should direct one-third of his income toward the development of production, keep one-third to himself for subsistence and give the remaining third to the state so that it could protect him from foreign and domestic foes, educate the children, develop the infrastructure, and so on. You will not think of anything new here and there is no need to do so. Deviations from this scheme do not produce any kinds of additional funds for the treasury, but only lead to the degradation of production, which is what we have at the present time. This is why it is necessary to limit legislatively the maximum rate for all types of taxes and other obligatory payments from commodity producers to an overall level no higher than 35 percent. Likewise, it is necessary to exempt legislatively, without any stipulations, from taxation the profit directed by the commodity producers toward the replenishment of their working capital. The second requirement involves the banks. It is currently absolutely clear to everyone that the confusion in the banking system is being deliberately maintained, since, with a discount rate of 210 percent or higher, it is an inexhaustible source of easy profit for sticky-fingered workers and, first and foremost, for those in the banking system itself. It is known that the larger the transmitted payment amount, the longer it goes through the banks, since it is a more dainty morsel for them. At the same time, it makes no difference how it is transmitted -- by telegraph or by mail. Until such time that sanctions, which exceed by a minimum factor of 2 the possible dividends for delaying payments, are applied to all the banks, including the Central Bank, there will be no order there. The third direction is investments. The state's current investment policy cannot be called anything other than suicidal. The fixed capital in industry is 70-80 percent worn out, while investments are practically nil. Everyone remembers quite well that, in the not-too-distant past, the entire investment process in the country was provided through two sources: centralized and non-centralized, i.e., the enterprises' own resources. Today, for all practical purposes, the state has abandoned centralized capital investments, while the majority of enterprises does not have enough internal resources even to maintain current production and to pay wages. The investment total amounts to a big fat zero. Also, no one even dares think about credit, given the current bank interest rates. So it turns out that, given the current investment policy, industry is doomed to extinction. There is one way out -- exempt from taxation all the profit directed toward investments in production and also provide legislatively a special bank investment rate for credit for housing construction. The prices for energy resources are another point. No one is about to refute the obvious truth that everything should cost what it costs. This is an axiom, without consideration of which a normal market and an effective economy cannot exist. But here we need to determine firmly just whose economy we are getting ready to help out of a crisis -- our own or the West's. If it is the West's, then we are on the right path. And, in this instance, it is really necessary to raise the prices for raw materials to the world level as quickly as possible. Domestic consumers will not be able to pay for them and all the raw materials will happily stream into the West at bargain prices. At the same time, our own industry will shut down -- here is your sales market for old imported stock! However, if we firmly intend to help the Russian economy out of the crisis, then the main task of industrial policy today should be the creation of conditions for the stable production of domestic goods and the introduction of such legislative statutes as would motivate a commodity producer. The stability of prices for primary energy resources plays a key role in the attainment of these goals. No one in the world has ever managed to stabilize an economy when the prices for energy resources keep jumping higher. Our position in this mater is unambiguous: the state should take it upon itself to regulate the prices for energy resources temporarily. Specific demands on the government arose among the commodity producers in the implementation of economic ties with the republics which were part of the former [Soviet] Union and are currently sovereign states, as well as in the conducting of foreign trade policy. The thoughtlessly destroyed ties in the relations with the current CIS countries should be restored, while the artificially created barriers should be removed. Otherwise, for a long time to come, we will each separately be attempting unsuccessfully to create closed economic cycles. And this at a time when the capitalistic West is proceeding along the path of combining efforts. Is this not a paradox on our part? There are the matters involving exporting and importing. For the time being, there is also a lot of confusion here, which is playing into the hands of the fanciers of easy profit. Meanwhile, the scheme is well-known: the export duties on raw material goods should bring the domestic prices for the exported raw materials into line with world prices, ensuring a reasonable standard of profit for the exporter and enriching the state budget. However, the import duties in turn are called upon to ensure the reasonable primacy of domestic commodity producers on the one hand and, on the other, to destroy monopolism and to create a competitive environment inside the country, while not serving as exclusively fiscal goals. Also unconditional should be a decision to exempt from customs duties imported manufacturing equipment and components for the production of competitive products.
