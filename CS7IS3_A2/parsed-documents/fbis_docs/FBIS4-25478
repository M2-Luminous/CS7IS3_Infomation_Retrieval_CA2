Built in 1954, the airport used to serve the military forces only. It was given approval by the central government to become a civil airport in July last year. A local official in charge of the project said the expansion will require a total investment of 180 million yuan (some 2.1 million U.S. dollars). Upon completion, the modern airport with an annual handling capacity of 650,000 passengers will be able to accommodate large and medium-sized planes, and link Quanzhou with Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai by air.
