FR940707-2-00171 FR940707-2-00094 [Release No. 34&hyph;34291; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;11] Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Floor Official Zone System June 30, 1994. On April 18, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend Exchange Rule 22 (``Authority of Floor Officials'') to delete references to the Floor Official zone system. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33980 (April 28, 1994), 59 FR 23241 (May 5, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change. The Exchange Floor currently is divided into zones comprised of designated trading posts. As set forth in Commentary .01 to Amex Rule 22, each Floor Official is assigned to a specific zone and may render rulings only in that zone. Among other things, Rule 22(c) authorizes a Floor Official to supervise openings and reopenings of securities; to halt or reopen trading in a security; to resolve market disputes submitted to him or her by members; and to regulate and supervise unusual situations which may arise in connection with the making of bids, offers or transactions. Finally, a majority of the available Floor Officials assigned to a zone may (1) restrict or ban trading by Registered Traders; (2) restrict or ban transactions pursuant to off-Floor orders in which members or member organizations have an interest; (3) prohibit specialists from accepting stop or stop limit orders; or (4) restrict or ban the use of hand signals. 3 3 See Amex Rule 22(c). The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 22 to delete references to the zone system for purposes of establishing the authority of Floor Officials, and to permit a Floor Official to render rulings anywhere on the Floor. In addition, the Amex proposal will provide that those matters which currently require the approval of a majority of the Floor Officials in a zone 4 may be determined by a Floor Official with the concurrence of a Senior Floor Official. 5 4 See supra, note 3 and accompanying text. 5 Pursuant to Amex Rule 21(a), Senior Floor Officials include the Floor Governors and those Exchange Officials who were previously Floor Governors and continue to be active on the Floor. The Amex states that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). 6 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 6 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). After careful review, the Commission agrees with the Amex that the Floor Official zone system may not be appropriate for today's market environment. According to the Amex, its system of assigning Floor Officials to specific zones was adopted in 1965, before the Exchange Floor was expanded and reconfigured. The Amex also notes that, since that time, new securities products and improved technologies have been developed, and trading (particularly for options and other derivatives) generally proceeds at a faster pace. Given these changes in market conditions, the Commission finds that requiring members to deal only with the assigned Floor Officials may be unduly time-consuming and burdensome. Accordingly, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change should facilitate quicker resolution of trading questions. By eliminating the zone system for assignment of Floor Officials, the Amex proposal will enable members to seek guidance from any Floor Official. In the Commission's opinion, this flexibility should reduce unnecessary delays and encourage compliance with Exchange rules, the Act and the regulations thereunder. For those matters which previously required the approval of a majority of the Floor Officials in a zone, 7 the Commission believes that the Amex proposal contains sufficient safeguards to ensure accurate and consistent decisionmaking. Specifically, the Floor official who determines the matter will be required to consult with, and obtain the agreement of, a Senior Floor Official ( i.e., a Floor Governor or an Exchange Official who was previously a Floor Governor). 8 According to Amex staff, these individuals are among the most experienced and knowledgeable members of Exchange. 7 See supra, note 3 and accompanying text. 8 See Amex Rule 21(a). It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 9 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;11) is approved. 9 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 10 10 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1991). Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
