For two centuries Cartagena de Indias was fortified until it became the architectonic patrimony of mankind we know today. Fortunately, as time passed its use has changed, and its defensive walls are now a warm refuge for evening lovers. In this enchanting city, the memory of Fernando Claver becomes a permanent lesson of philantrophy. In this city, Bolivar dreamed of a single America as the epicenter of liberty and equality. Here, Cesar Gaviria, your delighted host who for the last time has attended this Ibero-American summit as Colombian president, has been honored to share with you the commitment, responsibility, and dignified task of molding the present and near future of our nations. This task can be no other than advancing as brothers in building a new political, social, and economic order capable of eliminating inequality, eradicating violence, and promoting culture, solidarity, respect, and knowledge to create a new Ibero-American man proud of what he is, what he has, and what he can obtain in the future. This has been an inspiring and pleasant task, which we have all fulfilled for the benefit of our compatriots, without forgetting that this benefit is only possible if each one of our Ibero-American brothers, their children, and grandchildren who also receive their share. Our people's interdependent independence [as heard] was conceived as the visionary paradox that would make our dream a reality and is now approaching the millennium. Not in vain, through the centuries our cultures have acquired a pragmatism characterized by unselfishness, as well as the vision and capacity to excel in that that we call civilization. A new era, which offers great possibilities, demands struggling tirelessly, maintaining the capacity to listen, and also the determination and firmness to make ourselves heard, until we have finally made an overwhelming reality which not long ago was just a fantasy. As participants mandated by our peoples, we are drawing the map that will determine the future of Ibero-America, which we have sketched with an imaginary line that begins in Guadalajara, and continues to Madrid, Salvador de Bahia, and Cartagena de Indias. Now, that line will extend to the Southern Cross, to Buenos Aires, the site of our next summit and will project itself beyond that point. With your permission, my dear friends, I would like to express what may seem a digression, but is not. I cannot forget for a moment my compatriots, the Paez Indians, who live in Cauca and Huila Departments, who are now in distress. I cannot forget that thanks to the solidarity of so many friendly nations, my brothers who have lost their dear ones and their belongings due to a misfortune, have been able to take the first steps toward a new life. Normalcy, no matter how difficult it may seem, and although it may take a while to come, is something we must build each day. We thank those who have tendered their friendly and generous hand to us. Finally, I must recognize the work carried out by the government officials of the other member-countries of the penta-troika [pentatroika] -- that is, Argentina, Brazil, Spain, and Mexico -- who along with Colombia assumed their share of responsibility with great enthusiasm and dedication. This summit would not have been possible without them. We also want to extend our recognition to several institutions and groups of people who, enthused with the significance of the summit and possessing a true Ibero-American spirit, contributed their valuable cooperation. The millenial Iberia and the young America are united by a word, a gesture, and a tone. We understand and express the universe in Spanish and Portuguese. This communion of concepts grants us an identity. However, more than a past, Ibero-America is the future, the hope, and it is a voice that calls for a place in the world. We are the crossroads that humankind will pass in the coming decades. Colombia, as a member of the Ibero-American fatherland, has wanted to be your home in these past days and it bids you farewell today, hoping that when you return to your homes, the Caribbean sun, Cartagena's hospitality, and, especially, the Colombians' unlimited warmth and gratitude are engraved in your memories forever. Friends, the project started by Antonelli so many years ago was intended to defend Cartagena de Indias. At that time, the walls were needed to separate men from other men, people from other people, and cities from other cities. Today, these walls, stone by stone, should serve to unite Ibero-America, to build new bridges that will unite men, to turn our countries into an everlasting brotherhood, and make the land of the Portuguese, the Spaniard, and the American one where it is possible to make our dreams come true. I thus declare this Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government closed, not without wishing that any one of our six teams at the World Cup Soccer Games be victorious so we can accomplish our dreams in this respect. Thank you. [applause]
