However, the Israeli minister did not say whether a change has taken place in the Israeli position that has obstructed such progress. It is known that the Syrian-Israeli talks in particular, and the Arab-Israeli talks in general, have always faced the Tel Aviv rulers' intransigence and their refusal to discuss the most important aspect of the conflict -- withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. [break in transmission] The Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre dealt a strong blow to these talks and entrenched the conviction that Israel is not serious about realizing peace. This is not the first time that Israeli officials have spoken about progress in the negotiations with Syria. Such talk has never gone beyond media deception and negotiations tactics aimed at playing games on each track. Hence, a demonstration of real seriousness about making progress should come through a serious declaration of commitment to reaching a just and comprehensive solution in the Middle East based on Security Council resolutions. Syria has unequivocally committed itself to this position. Any talk about partial and phased settlements, or peace by installments, is only an Israeli maneuver to entrench the occupation and legitimize settlement activities. Syria has repeatedly urged the Arab parties to stick to the principles of the Madrid conference, the resolutions of international legitimacy, and the principles agreed on at the Damascus, Amman, and Beirut meetings. Syria has also urged the Arab parties to coordinate positions in a manner that will circumvent the malicious Israeli attempts to isolate Arab parties and dictate conditions on each party. The Arab parties are expected to hold a meeting to discuss the resumption of the Washington talks in light of their contacts with the United States, the developments in the region, and the higher pan-Arab interest. It should be recalled that Israel is the one that has obstructed the Washington talks so far, and prevented the realization of the slightest progress by refusing to commit itself to withdraw from the occupied territories. The area is now in need of real, just, and comprehensive peace. It is impossible to attain this peace without Israel's full withdrawal and the return of all occupied territories to their owners. The only viable agreements are ones that realize calm, security, satisfaction, and peace. What we see in the occupied territories is the total opposite of this. Confrontations between the Palestinian people and the occupation forces are on the rise, and scores of people are being victimized daily. Furthermore, the occupied territories have turned into a real battlefield. Therefore, where is peace in all of this? In response to [Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on] Peres' optimism, we say that progress in the talks with Syria and the other parties depends on Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan and the occupied Arab territories, and the full implementation of Security Council resolutions without ambiguity, and in a manner that gives the final say to international law and the principles of right and justice.
