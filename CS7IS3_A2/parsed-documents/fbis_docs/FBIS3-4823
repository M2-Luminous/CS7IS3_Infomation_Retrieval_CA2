Mustapha's son, Datuk Amirkahar, who is former president of USNO, Datuk Salim Bacho (former deputy president), Pitting Ali, and Said Senang (former vice presidents), who had joined PBS "temporarily" to contest in the recent state election, confirmed they are staying on in the party. Another USNO vice-president Ramli Wen and five former Supreme Council members also joined the PBS with Mustapha. Mustapha was welcomed into the PBS by its president Datuk Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan, his once bitter political rival, at a simple ceremony at Sri Gaya, Pairin's official residence. The 74-year-old founder of the deregistered USNO said he decided to join the PBS because he was now convinced that only the PBS could protect the interests and rights of the people in the state. [passage omitted] In January this year, Mustapha resigned from his federal cabinet post and as an UMNO member, citing his deteriorating health and failure to unite the people under UMNO. The veteran politician's decision to join the PBS did not come as a surprise as he had thrown his weight behind the party in the recently concluded State election. [passage omitted]
