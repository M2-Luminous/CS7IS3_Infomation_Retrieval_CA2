"Importation of about 60 percent of 1.7 million tons (the government) is scheduled to import from now on this year is now in sight," Hata told a press conference. According to the Food Agency, Japan has imported about 445,000 tons of rice since last November. In the wake of the worst harvest since the 1950s, the government decided last year to import rice on an emergency basis, mostly from the United States, China and Thailand.
