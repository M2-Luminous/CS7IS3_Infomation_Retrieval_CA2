FBIS4-30622 "dreas124_j_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-124 Daily Report 25 Jun 1994 Indonesia Stock Exchange Chief Urges Foreign Shares Stock Exchange Chief Urges Foreign Shares BK2506160794 Jakarta ANTARA in English 1400 GMT 25 Jun 94 BK2506160794 Jakarta ANTARA English BFN [Text] Jakarta, Jun 25 (ANTARA) -- It is now time to allow 100 percent foreign ownership of shares in Indonesia's stock exchange following a ruling stipulating that foreign investors are allowed to control 100 percent of the shares in companies set up under a foreign investment scheme, a senior stock exchange director has said. "It is my hope that portfolio shares can also be 100 percent controlled by foreigners," president director of Jakarta Stock Exchange Hasan Zein Mahmud told ANTARA during a break in a gathering organized by WARTA EKONOMI [ECONOMIC NEWS] Business Club here Friday. Malaysia, he said, has proved that such a practice can also benefit domestic investors provided that certain rulings are issued to regulate it. "In Malaysia, 100 percent foreign ownership of shares in a stock exchange is allowed only in the secondary market. In the primary market this is subjected to certain limitation. This practice is profitable to domestic investors because they have a greater chance to buy primary shares at a lower price to be sold later in the secondary market at a higher price," he explained. Replying to a question whether or not 100 percent ownership of shares in a stock exchange will lead to foreign investors taking over the share issuers, he maintained that this is unlikely to occur provided that certain limitation rulings are effected in this respect. "This is an unnecessary worry because a capital market ruling can, for example, stipulate that although foreign investors may control 100 percent of shares in stock exchange, foreign participation in managerial matters should remain limited to 49 percent. As such a ruling is common in other countries, why can't Indonesia follow suit?" he said. He added that this ruling will not disadvantage foreign investors as other commercially profitable rights such as dividend, right issue, and bonus share rights will remain theirs. In the meantime, in his lecture on the occasion entitled "The Concept of the Development of Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX)" he expressed his optimism that market capitalization of JSX in 1994 may reach some rp [Rupiah] 100 trillion, up from rp 69.3 trillion registered in 1993. He said this estimate was based on three factors, namely, the large number of new issuers entering JSX, the expansion of many old issuers at JSX and steady increase of share prices.
