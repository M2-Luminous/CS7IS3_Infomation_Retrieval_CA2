He said all the views expressed in the memoranda by interest groups and individuals had been taken care of in the agenda. Answering a question, Dr. (Ofonagoro), said memoranda were received from traditional rulers, articulating what their role should be. He stated that the commission would recommend that some of them should be nominated to present their views at the conference. Also answering a question, the chairman of the finance and general purposes committee of the commission, Chief (Derbo Akonde), said the military would be a subject on the agenda. He said that the military would not be represented at the conference to avoid creating the impression that they were there to guide the delegates. Chief (Akonde), however, explained that the commission, in its recommendation and the government in accepting it, did not completely leave out the military. He said it was possible that some retired military officers would be elected into the conference.
