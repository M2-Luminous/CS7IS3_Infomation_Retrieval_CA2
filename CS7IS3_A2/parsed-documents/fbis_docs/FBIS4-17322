A day earlier, during the debates over the signing of the agreement in the State Duma Gaydar spoke in favor of its signing. In his opinion, the parliamentary majority, which in his words, consists of opposition forces should "take responsibility for its like-minded persons", because "to provoke tensions in Russia today is a strike on security." At the same time, Gaydar acknowledged that the foundation of possible civil accord "is very limited and there can be no agreement with the opposition on program issues." In particular, he pointed to different approaches to private property and the restoration of administrative control over the economy.
