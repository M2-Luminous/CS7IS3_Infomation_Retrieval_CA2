For this reason, many pessimists hold that China will most probably not have its MFN status renewed this year. However, some optimists argue that China's tough stance reflects the huge changes in the international situation and that China is confident and will definitely have its MFN status renewed. They maintain that it is even possible that China will obtain permanent MFN status, ending once and for all the big issue over which China has to quarrel, deal, and bargain over with the United States every year. Diplomatic struggles are based on strength. China today is able to struggle with the United States. Let us look at how the West evaluates China's strength. The ECONOMIST, a British magazine, worked out for the first time in November 1992 that China's GNP was more or less the same as that of Germany that year and ranked third, coming next only to those of United States and Japan. Estimating China's economic scale with the purchasing power parity method for the first time in 1993, the U.S. Land [lan de 5695 1795] Company worked out that China's GNP ranked second or third in the world. Articles carried in FOREIGN AFFAIRS, an American quarterly, even argued that China's overall economic strength will surpass that of the United States and rank first in the world by the year 2020. It is from political motives that Western countries and international organizations intentionally belittled China's economic strength in the past and then are suddenly exaggerating China's strength now. Therefore, Beijing expresses its distrust and will not accept the title "super economic power." However, the various calculations above also have scientific evidence and reflect China's increasingly strong economy after years of great efforts. According to Beijing, China's foreign trade volume exceeded $190 billion last year and is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 20 percent. In the next seven years, China will import $1 trillion of commercial equipment and thus become Asia's largest market. Nowadays, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Australia, and others are vying to develop trading relations with China. Can the United States then cancel China's MFN status and exclude itself from China's market? In fact, since shortly after he became president, Clinton has paid special attention to China and has repeatedly revised the China policy he put forward during the presidential election campaign. Last July, his think tank compiled a research report on foreign affairs, stating that the rate of Asia's economic growth was quicker than that of the United States and Europe and that U.S. exports to Asia ranked first. Therefore, the report proposed that the United States shift its economic and foreign affairs strategy from Europe to Asia and change the "containment policy" for socialist countries to the "market expansion strategy" to serve its economic revival. As for its strategy for Asia, China, the locomotive of Asia's economic development in recent years, will become the focal point for U.S. "market expansion." Therefore, in the name of calling the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, Clinton invited China's State President Jiang Zemin and held the first Sino-U.S. summit to jointly confirm norms for China and the United States to develop friendly and cooperative relations. If Clinton cancels China's MFN trading status over the human rights question, it also means that the United States will lose its MFN status granted by China and that their bilateral trade will retrogress. More importantly, the "market expansion strategy," which focuses on Asia, planned by Clinton through extraordinarily painstaking efforts, will "go bust before it is ever implemented." Being the president of a superpower, how much face will he have if his strategy ends up this way? If China and the United States lose MFN trading status at the same time, U.S. losses will absolutely not be "an insect bite" as some critics put it. According to statistics, last year, U.S. exports to China came to $8.76 billion and 170,000 job opportunities were thus created. If trade develops in a normal way and if China is willing to reduce the trade surplus, it will probably reach $40 billion this year, U.S. exports will be nearly $20 billion, and 400,000 job opportunities will be created for the United States. Moreover, it will offer a big market for its depression-stricken airplane, automobile, chemical, telecommunications, and service industries. If a trade war begins, the United States will not only suffer from its nearly $20-billion exports. Its real losses cannot be estimated lightly. Will Clinton, who is currently troubled by the Whitewater incident, be laoathe to to incur attacks from industrialists and businessmen? Will he? It seems that U.S. "human rights diplomacy" is a double-edged sword which will hurt others as well as itself. Some White House advisers proposed to Clinton that by granting China permanent MFN status, the president will be able to get rid of the limitations from Congress, thus avoiding bargaining with some Congressmen over the question of renewing China's MFN status between March and June each year in exchange for interests on other bills. If this is true, the permanent mutual granting of the favor will become an inevitable historical trend.
