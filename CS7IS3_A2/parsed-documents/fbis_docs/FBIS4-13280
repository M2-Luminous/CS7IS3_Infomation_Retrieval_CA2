The first witness to appear told the commission that he had heard shooting after Barukh Goldstein had been beaten to the ground by Muslims in the cave. Steve Linde has details: [Begin Linde recording] The commission's hearings were delayed by about an hour this morning, because the three Muslim witnesses due to appear, arrived late. Soldiers apparently held them up because they did not have the necessary permits to enter Jerusalem from Hebron. In nearly three hours of testimony, Hajj Ahmad Muhammad complained about the behavior of Jewish worshipers in the Cave of the Patriarchs, and gave a detailed account of the February 25 massacre. Muhammad said after the morning prayers began, he heard two loud explosions, immediately followed by automatic fire, at which point all the Muslims in the cave fell to the floor. He saw the man with the case and earphones who had fired, and saw Muslim worshipers who were standing behind him attack him and throw him to the floor. [passage omitted] Muhammad shocked the commission when he testified earlier that on the night before the massacre, on the Purim holiday, settlers had entered the cave drunk. He also said settlers had urinated in the cave, but when pressed by the judges, said he had only seen Muslim cleaners washing the floor afterwards. Judge Eli'ezer Goldberg noted that the witness had not actually seen what he was alleging, and he could not accept that Jews, who regarded the cave as holy, would defecate inside. The commission of inquiry has held 30 sessions and heard testimony from some 100 witnesses. [end recording] Two lawyers have petitioned the High Court of Justice to suspend Judge 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Zu'bi from the Shamgar Commission. They say al-Zu'bi was quoted in the media as saying settlers are the cruelest element in the territories.
