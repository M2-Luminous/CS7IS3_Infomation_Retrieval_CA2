They said the EC's executive complained to the European Court of Justice that France, Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands were retaining the monopolies in contravention of the EC's principles of free competition. The move is an attempt to pressure the six countries into accepting a directive from the Commission that they should make their state-owned utility networks available to power companies from other countries. The directive has been blocked for nearly two years. The Commission is targeting France for its electricity and gas monopolies, Denmark for gas, and Spain, Italy, Ireland and the Netherlands for their electricity monopolies. Commission officials said the liberalisation of the power and gas markets was essential if the EC's single market was to work properly. It would mean that a French company, for example, could get its power from Germany if this was cheaper.
