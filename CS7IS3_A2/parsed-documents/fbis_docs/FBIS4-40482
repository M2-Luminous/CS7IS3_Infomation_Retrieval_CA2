Over the two weeks since the beginning of the operation, the police have seized over 20 kilograms of drugs. On Tuesday, on one of the metro stations they detained a resident of Tajikistan who was carrying one kilogram of opium. An investigation was launched. The operation is generally viewed as part of the federal anti-crime programme approved by the president. The government plans to spend about five trillion roubles to implement it, hoping to receive back twice as much. The programme largely expands the rights of law enforcement bodies and provides for a greater role of counterintelligence in fighting organised crime in Russia. Counterintelligence service leaders said they will set up a special body to take active measures to combat the rising wave of crime and will act in cooperation with other crime-fighting organisations. Similar bodies are planned to be set up in several big Russian cities, including Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk. On Tuesday, President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree giving Russia's police new powers to fight organised crime which has been lately terrorizing most Russian cities. To prevent possible criticism of the decree, a high-ranking Russian counterintelligence official said earlier today that the decree does not infringe upon civil right and curbs only the rights of criminal groupings. Yevgeniy Sevostyanov, head of the counterintelligence service in Moscow and the Moscow region, said that the decree aims at protecting the population of Russia from organised crime. "The adopted measures limit only the rights of the members of criminal gangs and their direct accomplices," he said.
