This ultimatum is a brave step, Dr. Bukoshi states, to be distinguished from the previous threats of the West, which were not realized. Those threats only made the aggressor brave and diminished the credibility of international powers. Peace in the Balkans is not possible without resolving the Kosova crisis, Prime Minister Bukoshi stresses further on in the letter. Kosova once again asks the United States to intensify pressures against the Belgrade regime so as to interrupt the systematic oppression against the Albanian people in Kosova, Bukoshi underlines. In this letter, Prime Minister Bukoshi asks the West to influence the return democratic institutions and international observers to Kosova, as well as to respect the elementary rights of 2 million Albanians in Kosova. If an immediate preventive action is taken, there is still time for the international community to enable a peaceful solution to the question of Kosova before its citizens face the tragedy and horror that can be of greater proportions than what is happening in Bosnia, prime minister of the republic of Kosova writes among other things in his letter addressed to the governments of NATO member countries.
