Immediately after this, London and the Hong Kong Government simultaneously made public an abstract of the contents of the 17 rounds of Sino-British talks and the remainder of Chris Patten's constitutional reform package was published in the government gazette. The package will be submitted to the Legislative Council for examination and discussion on 9 March. The opportunity for resuming the Sino-British talks on constitutional reform has now been completely destroyed. It will be difficult to find a mechanism for the convergence of the Hong Kong constitution around 1997; the arrangements for a through train have thoroughly vanished; and the opportunity for Sino-British cooperation on Hong Kong's constitutional development is equivalent to zero. This is something that the Chinese side is extremely unwilling to see. The Chinese side has repeatedly said: As far as the Chinese side is concerned, the door to talks is wide open, but the prerequisite is that the British side must withdraw the partial constitutional reform package that has already been submitted to the Legislative Council. The British side, however, is bent on confronting the Chinese side to the very end and on deviating farther and farther away from the road of cooperation. Although Chris Pattern is still putting on a show and has said that the possibility of reopening dialogue with the Chinese side on the constitutional issue of Hong Kong has not been ruled out, he has started to tear down one of the supports of the mansion that will soon be returned to its owner, while at the same time saying that he is willing to cooperate with the owner to construct a taller building. By acting this way, he himself may be the only one cheated in the end. The Chinese side and the people of Hong Kong have ears as well as eyes. Their eyes will not miss any of Chris Patten's damaging moves. According to Chris Patten's way of doing business, he will exert himself to the utmost to promote -- in accordance with his constitutional reform package -- the election of the three-tier councils in 1994 and 1995 in a bid to extend Britain's colonial influence beyond 1997. Although the voice of opposition within the Legislative Council is not low, it will not be too difficult for Christ Patten to affix the seal with his hand. However, the Chinese side has repeatedly reiterated that, without an agreement between China and Britain, any constitutional reform package adopted by the Legislative Council of Hong Kong will not be accepted. The Chinese side will certainly dissolve and reorganize Hong Kong's three-tier councils on 1 July 1997. This means that the three-tier councils to be elected in 1994 and 1995, the birth of which Chris Patten is unilaterally expediting, are bound to be short-lived. The Legislative Council to be elected in 1995 can only last 20 months. Britain must return Hong Kong to China in 1997, and by that time China will certainly have restored its sovereignty over Hong Kong. This is a fact which no one can change. The three-tier councils of Hong Kong to be elected in 1994 and 1995 without an agreement between China and Britain are only one part of the British Hong Kong constitutional structure, and their terms of office are provided for by the British Royal Instructions and the relevant regulations. Following the end of the British rule over Hong Kong on 30 June 1997, the Royal Instructions and all other relevant laws, being in conflict with the Basic Law, will certainly become invalid, and all the three-tier councils of the Hong Kong Government will be dissolved at that time. The Chinese Government will reorganize the constitutional structure on 1 July 1997 in accordance with the Basic Law and the decision of the National People's Congress. This is very natural. Although Chris Patten has clung to his course, he and the British Government have absolutely no chance of changing the fate of the last three-tier councils of the Hong Kong Government. Percy Cradock, former foreign affairs adviser to the British prime minister, pointed out that, because the talks broke down, the British Government will have no say about the blueprint for Hong Kong's future development. Recalling the experience of the previous Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's future, Percy Cradock pointed out that the British side was in fact in an inferior position, while the Chinese side was in an overwhelmingly dominant position. Therefore, one of the ways to work together with China is to avoid confronting the tough with toughness and to hold talks and discussions. In commenting on the results that were achieved in the Sino-British talks on Kong Kong at that time, CPC elder Deng Xiaoping once pointed out, "What is the reason behind the success of the talks on Hong Kong? It was not due to the special skills of the participants from our side, but was primarily because our country has developed over the past few years and has become a prosperous and flourishing country, a country with strength, and a trustworthy country. We pay attention to trustworthiness, and we keep our word." Chris Patten is doomed to failure because he is ignorant about China today. His understanding of China and even Britain seems to be identical to that of some people in 1840.
