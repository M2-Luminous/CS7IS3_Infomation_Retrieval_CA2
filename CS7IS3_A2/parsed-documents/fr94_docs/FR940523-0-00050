Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, 21 CFR parts 173 and 573 are amended as follows: PART 173_SECONDARY DIRECT FOOD ADDITIVES PERMITTED IN FOOD FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION 1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 173 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 201, 402, 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 342, 348). 2. New §173.170 is added to subpart B to read as follows: §173.170 Aminoglycoside 3 ’-phosphotransferase II. The food additive aminoglycoside 3 ’-phosphotransferase II may be safely used in the development of genetically modified cotton, oilseed rape, and tomatoes in accordance with the following prescribed conditions: (a) The food additive is the enzyme aminoglycoside 3 ’-phosphotransferase II (CAS Reg. No. 58943&hyph;39&hyph;8) which catalyzes the phosphorylation of certain aminoglycoside antibiotics, including kanamycin, neomycin, and gentamicin. (b) Aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase II is encoded by the kan r gene originally isolated from transposon Tn 5 of the bacterium Escherichia coli. (c) The level of the additive does not exceed the amount reasonably required for selection of plant cells carrying the kan r gene along with the genetic material of interest. PART 573_FOOD ADDITIVES PERMITTED IN FEED AND DRINKING WATER OF ANIMALS 3. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 573 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 201, 402, 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 342, 348). 4. New §573.130 is added to subpart B to read as follows: §573.130 Aminoglycoside 3 ’-phosphotransferase II. The food additive aminoglycoside 3 ’-phosphotransferase II may be safely used in the development of genetically modified cotton, oilseed rape, and tomatoes in accordance with the following prescribed conditions: (a) The food additive is the enzyme aminoglycoside 3 ’-phosphotransferase II (CAS Reg. No. 58943&hyph;39&hyph;8) which catalyzes the phosphorylation of certain aminoglycoside antibiotics, including kanamycin, neomycin, and gentamicin. (b) Aminoglycoside 3 ’-phosphotransferase II is encoded by the kan r gene originally isolated from transposon Tn 5 of the bacterium Escherichia coli. (c) The level of the additive does not exceed the amount reasonably required for selection of plant cells carrying the kan r gene along with the genetic material of interest. Dated: May 17, 1994.
