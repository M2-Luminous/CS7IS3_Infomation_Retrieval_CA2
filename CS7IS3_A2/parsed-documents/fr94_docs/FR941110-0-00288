FR941110-0-00288 FR941110-0-00018 Historically, Mariscus pennatiformis ssp. pennatiformis was known from six populations, located on Kauai at Halemanu in Kokee State Park, on Oahu in the Waianae Mountains on a ridge above Makaha Valley, on East Maui at Keanae Valley and Hana, and on the island of Hawaii at an unspecified location (HHP 1992f3 to 1992f6). Mariscus pennatiformis ssp. pennatiformis also exists in cultivation at the Maui Zoological and Botanical Gardens. The cultivated plants were originally from Nahiku, East Maui (J. Davis and R. Silva, Maui Zoological and Botanical Gardens, in litt., 1978). It is not known whether the Nahiku population is still extant. The five current populations, with an unknown number of individuals, are at open sites in mesic forests and low elevation grasslands from sea level to 1,200 m (3,940 ft) in elevation. No historical locations are known for Mariscus pennatiformis ssp. bryanii. It is currently known only from federally managed Laysan Island. This subspecies is found on the southeast end of the central lagoon, and the west and northeast sides of the island (HHP 1992f1, 1992f2; Koyama 1990). These 3 locations are on sandy substrate at 5 m (16 ft) in elevation and contain approximately 30 individuals (HHP 1992f1, 1992f2; Koyama 1990). Associated species include Cyperus laevigatus (makaloa), Eragrostis variabilis (kawelu), and Ipomoea sp. (HHP 1992f1, Koyama 1990). The small number of individuals and fewer than six known populations of Mariscus pennatiformis make the species vulnerable to stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor. Neraudia sericea (ma'aloa) was published by Gaudichaud in 1851 (Cowan 1949). In 1888, Hillebrand reduced it to a variety of N. melastomaefolia ( N. melastomaefolia var. sericea ). He also described a new species, N. kahoolawensis, named for a specimen collected by J.M. Lydgate on the island of Kahoolawe. In the most current treatment (Wagner et al. 1990), the reduction of N. sericea to a variety of N. melastomaefolia is not accepted and N. kahoolawensis is considered a Kahoolawe population of N. sericea. Neraudia sericea, a member of the nettle family (Urticaceae), is a 3 to 5 m (10 to 16 ft) tall shrub with densely hairy branches. The elliptic or oval leaves are between 4.3 and 13 cm (1.7 and 5.1 in) long and have smooth margins or slightly toothed margins on young leaves. The upper leaf surface is moderately hairy and the lower leaf surface is densely covered with irregularly curved, silky gray to white hairs up to 1 mm (0.04 in) long along the veins. The male flowers may be stalkless or have short stalks. The female flowers are stalkless and have a densely hairy calyx that is either toothed, collar-like, or divided into narrow unequal segments. The fruits are 1 mm (0.04 in) long achenes with the apical section separated from the basal portion by a deep constriction. Seeds are oval with a constriction across the upper half. Neraudia sericea differs from the other four closely related species of this endemic Hawaiian genus by the density, length, color, and posture of the hairs on the lower leaf surface and by its mostly entire leaf margins (Wagner et al. 1990). Neraudia sericea was known historically from Kamalo and near Waianui on Molokai, from Kaiholena on central Lanai, Olowalu Valley on West Maui, the southern slopes of Haleakala on East Maui, and from an unspecified site on Kahoolawe (HHP 1992g1, 1992g3, 1992g4, 1992g6 to 1992g10). Currently, two populations of this species are known, from the slopes below Puu Kolekole on Molokai, specifically along the bottom and lower slopes of Makolelau Gulch, and from Pohakea Gulch on West Maui (HHP 1992g2, 1992g5, 1992g11). Both populations are on privately owned land. The Makolelau population contains an estimated 50 to 100 individuals growing in 'Ohi'a/'A'ali'i/ Styphelia tameiameiae (Pukiawe) Lowland Dry Shrubland in an area of over 100 sq m (1,080 sq ft) (HHP 1992g11). The population size of the Pohakea population is undetermined (HHP 1992g2). Neraudia sericea generally occurs in lowland dry to mesic shrubland or forest between 670 and 1,370 m (2,200 and 4,500 ft) in elevation (HHP 1992g3, 1992g10, 1992g11; Wagner et al. 1990). Other associated plant species include 'ilima, lama, Bobea ('ahakea), Coprosma (pilo), and Hedyotis (HHP 1992g11). The primary threats to Neraudia sericea are habitat degradation by feral pigs and goats; competition with the alien plant, Melinus minutiflora (molasses grass); and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations and individuals.
