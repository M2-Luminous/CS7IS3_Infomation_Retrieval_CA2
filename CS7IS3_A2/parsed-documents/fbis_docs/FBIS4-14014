The national movement is divided, and the peace process has lost its credibility. Among all the factions there have been various views and conflicting efforts. As a result, the urgent question keeps popping up: What should we do? Neither I, nor anyone else can answer this question. I believe there can be no answer to it, except through a unified Palestinian stand capable of making a decision that can win the respect and commitment of the entire Palestinian people. I beg the readers pardon for reiterating already well-known details. But the sequence of events and their relationships need to be repeated in order to clarify the truth and make it possible to grope for a way out of our crucial situation. The Palestinian struggle has, from the outset, taken upon itself to defend the right of the Palestinians to self-determination and to an independent state. Later, after the emergence of the refugee problem it became necessary to defend their rights as stipulated in the UN resolutions. Despite the human and material sacrifices of the Palestinian people over three-quarters of a century, it has been affected with consecutive setbacks. There is no need to go over the reasons, but they should not be totally ignored either. The intifada erupted in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem as conclusive evidence that the Palestinian masses, driven by conscience categorically and definitively, reject occupation. Moreover, they will never relinquish their declared national rights which they express on every possible occasion. Despite the violence, Israel confronted it with a fierce type of bloody repression and measures that are incompatible with international norms and the principles of human rights. The world knows all that. There is no need to repeat it. The Palestinian National Council, out of political pragmatism and desire to put an end to the warring and bloodshed in the Middle East, through concessions and flexibility unprecedented in the history of peoples fighting for their rights, adopted a peace initiative accepting the principle of two states on Nov. 15, 1988. The principle is based on UN Resolution 181 as a basis for negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis under the UN's auspices with the aim of reaching a just and enduring peace in the region. Israel rejected this initiative outright, heaping incriminations and definitions upon the Palestinians. The United States, Israel's staunchest supporter, ignored it claiming it was insufficient. Thus, the real opportunity for peace in the Middle East was missed. The Israeli refusal was neither surprising nor totally strange. For the dimensions and conditions of the Israeli approach in the occupied territories have emphasized that Israel has a claim to the area, partially or totally. It has clearly demonstrated such an attitude by employing a policy of land seizure, the establishment of settlements, the annexation of East Jerusalem and expanding its area with complete disregard to the Security Council's resolutions, condemning such measures and asserting that they contravene international laws and norms, as well as the principles of human rights. Such policy was also condemned by the whole world as being difficult obstacles on the way to a just and lasting peace in the region. The Gulf crisis that started with Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and America's devastating aggression against Iraq under the banner of Security Council resolutions shed light anew on the Palestinian problem as an issue of occupation that has been going on for so long that it cannot be ignored. The United States proposed a peace process for the Middle East on the basis of UN resolutions 242 and 338. The nations of the world and the Arab states surrounding Israel responded to the proposal. The Palestinian side also responded to it, despite the Israelis' provocations, in order to prove its true desire for peace. The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations faltered at an early stage because of Israel's insistence on continuing settlement, and its refusal to talk about the status of East Jerusalem, as well as its insistence on stripping the Palestinian government during the transitional period of any real powers. In brief, the Israeli attitude aimed at legitimizing what Israel has illegally established in the Palestinian occupied territories, including Jerusalem. The implication of all that was to obstruct the road to the possibility of establishing an independent Palestinian state as a result of the final negotiations. Israel aimed at emphasizing the stability of its dominance on all the occupied territories, that is the whole of Palestine within its natural borders. The Palestinian side rejected this attitude because we have not participated in the negotiations to bargain on the Palestinians right to self-determination. That was the core of the negotiating crisis. The US sponsor did nothing to put things in order in accordance with the peace reference "Resolution 242," which stipulates the inadmissibility of acquiring land by force, and the withdrawal from the occupied territories in the context of the peace accord. The US approach has revealed a supportive stand to the Israeli ambitions. Though this position was expected from the beginning, yet it become crystal clear during the ninth and tenth rounds. It became useless to continue with the negotiations. The negotiating team deemed it fit to suspend negotiations so as to have an opportunity to reconsider and reassess the situation in order to reach a clear and precise decision around which the Palestinian people could rally. In the midst of all this, everyone was surprised by the Declaration of Principles, which was presented to the Palestinians as substantial accomplishment that would pave the way for achieving our national goals as well as realizing a just peace. The accord was approved by the Executive Committee and the Central Council with considerable reservations and a demand to implement its term in a way that is consistent in harmony with our national rights. The accord has many loopholes: 1. It does not challenge the Israeli claims to the occupied territories. Israel expressed such a claim by usurping land, establishing settlements and annexing East Jerusalem, in addition to the measures taken in support of this claim and in flagrant violation of all international laws and norms. It is worth mentioning here that the accord is void of any request for Israel to halt settlements or to allow it to continue with them. 2. This non-challenging attitude to Israel's claim implied acceptance of a separate Israeli presence in the occupied territories, the settlements and settlers, with their separate legal and administrative systems whose point of reference is the Israeli state. This complete acquiescence in the Israeli claim. [sentence as published] 3. Many of the terms of the accord are open to several interpretations. This rendered the current negotiations extremely difficult to implement and paved the way for imposing the Israeli point of view. The danger of what is going on now lies in the fact that the Palestinian side has not raised the issues of continued settlement, the establishment of new settlements, the expansion of the existing ones and the establishment of infrastructures for the benefit of the settlements, especially when the UN resolutions and international consensus emphasize that settlement is illegal and constitutes obstacles on the way of achieving a just and consistent peace. Continuing in the current mode of negotiations but heeding the views of opposition, which are raised daily, causes the deepest concern and wonder. [sentence as published] I don't think the leadership is aware of this grave situation. I think we are at an emerging national juncture that makes it imperative upon all nationalist forces to join together to review the situation and reach a decision that might win the confidence and support of all the Palestinians, wherever they might be.
