The first prong moved from Kamping Puoy toward Don Peou; the second prong from Treng toward Veal Thom and Buo Charak hill; the third prong from Sdau toward Neang Len hill; and the fourth prong from Snoeng toward Buon Chuo. The people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] cooperated and smashed and routed this attack on the evening of the same day. We killed 53 enemy soldiers on the spot, including a colonel, two majors, and three lieutenants and wounded a great number of others. We destroyed 35 assorted weapons and some assorted ammunition and seized 15 AK's, three B-40's, a 60-mm mortar, and some ammunition. On 8 March, troops of communist Vietnam's puppets and the two-headed government launched a two-pronged second attack along Route 10. The first prong moved from Treng toward Tuol village on Route 10 and the second from Kamping Puoy and Chrouy Sna toward Kaoh Chen Don Peou. The people and the NADK cooperated and completely routed this attack for the second time. We killed or wounded over 80 enemy soldiers; destroyed 31 assorted weapons and a quantiy of other war materiel; and seized 49 assorted weapons and some ammunition. Concerning the above attacks, people clearly know that the puppets of communist Vietnam and the two-headed government continuee to fuel the war of the communist Vietnamese aggressors; they do not want national reconciliation and peace.
