ACTION: Notice of proposed actions under the NIH guidelines for research involving recombinant DNA molecules (51 FR 16958). SUMMARY: This notice sets forth proposed actions to be taken under the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (51 FR 16958). Interested parties are invited to submit comments concerning these proposals. These proposals will be considered by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee at its meeting on June 9&hyph;10, 1994. After consideration of these proposals and comments by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, the Director of the National Institutes of Health will issue decisions in accordance with the NIH Guidelines. DATES: Comments received by May 26, 1994, will be reproduced and distributed to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for consideration at its June 9&hyph;10, 1994, meeting. ADDRESSES: Written comments and recommendations should be submitted to Dr. Nelson A. Wivel, Director, Office of Recombinant DNA Activities (ORDA), building 31, room 4B11, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, or sent by FAX to 301&hyph;496&hyph;9839. All comments received in timely response to this notice will be considered and will be available for public inspection in the above office on weekdays between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Background documentation and additional information can be obtained from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, building 31, room 4B11, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The NIH will consider the following actions under the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules: I. Addition to Appendix D of the NIH Guidelines Regarding a Human Gene Transfer Protocol/Drs. Sobol and Royston In a letter dated October 6, 1993, Drs. Robert Sobol and Ivor Royston of the San Diego Regional Cancer Center, San Diego, California, submitted the human gene transfer protocol entitled: Injection of Glioblastoma Patients with Tumor Cells Genetically Modified to Secrete Interleukin-2 (IL&hyph;2): A Phase I Study to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for formal review and approval. At the December 2&hyph;3, 1993, meeting, the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee disapproved the original protocol. The majority of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee members concluded that the preclinical data derived from a previous single patient protocol was inadequate to justify the experiment. The motion to disapprove the protocol passed by a vote of 10 in favor, 5 opposed, and 1 abstention.
