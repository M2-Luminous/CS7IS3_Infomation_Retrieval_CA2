By November, the "overheated" economy was notably controlled. The target to exercise macro-economic control were basically achieved as expected. The Cast [kasite 0595 2448 3676] index shows that the uniform composite index fell from its peak of 115.3 to 106 with an average monthly drop of 1.8 percent. The comprehensive evaluation mark dropped from the middle section of the red light zone (54 points) to the lower limit of the yellow light zone (43 points). All this indicates that the economy is approaching normal operation. The measures taken this time have drawn support from the relatively tight monetary policy. Since the last quarter of 1993, the tight monetary policy had begun to slacken off. The indexes of the narrowest measure of money supply M1 and the broader measure of money supply M2 had rapidly risen in December with their rate of growth reaching 20.87 percent and 23.7 percent. The rate of growth of the total industrial production value stopped to fall since November. It rose to 29.7 percent in December, 10.8 percent higher than that in November. Incentive for more investment was once again aroused. The uniform composite index in December rose by 1.9 percent over November. The comprehensive economic index increased to 48 points showing itself within the upper limit of the yellow light zone. As seen from the present moment, the exceptionally early rebound in the entire economy merits attention, although indicators of one month cannot represent the whole situation. Two Possibilities Affecting 1994 Economic Trends Due to the fact that policies for macro-economic control may vary in the days to come, there may be two different trends in the development of our overall economy. 1. The monetary policy which has already become relaxed will continue to slacken off. This will make the economy to grow rapidly. As a result, the need for macro-economic control will once again become pressing, and original problems such as serious unbalanced economic developments, various "bottlenecks" and inflation will once again crop up. This will prevent the various on-going reform measures from being smoothly carried out. Also, it may force the government to readjust its economy and use "emergency brakes." 2. Timely and adequate measures will be adopted to exercise micro-economic adjustments, to strengthen guidance over the economic sector, to control the growth of investments and money supply and to optimize the economic structure by selecting the proper investments. Under this kind of situation, the general economic trend may possibly be as follows: The rate of economic growth will drop to 9-10 percent from the 13 percent in 1993, and the commodity price index will drop below 10 percent from the 13 percent in 1993. As a result, the uniform composite index will only fluctuate on a small scale, and our overall economy will remain in the area between the green light zone and the yellow light zone. This kind of comparatively relaxed environment will not only help the smooth transition of the economic cycle to the economic expansionary period. It will also help quicken the tempo in carrying out reform and in making preparations for the rapid economic growth in the near future. How To Create a Relaxed Economic Environment This year is the first year of great significance in carrying out reform. Studies and practice at home and abroad indicate that the announcement and implementation of policies in carrying out reform must keep pace with the economic cycle. Generally speaking, reforms in financial affairs, taxation, commodity prices and investments are usually carried out in the period of economic decline so that such reforms would have less negative impact. Therefore, this year's macro-economic control is basically aimed at continuously creating a stable economic environment which is conducive to the reform program and at reducing the shock the program may possibly create to the minimum. A relaxed environment in 1994 is mainly determined by the following three factors: 1) A stable price index. Commodity prices constitute a direct factor in affecting social stability. Right now, we still need to prevent the inflation from going beyond the endurance of the society. We must strive to keep the price rises below the 10 percent level. 2) Adequate rate of growth. The history of China's economic cycle indicates that China's economy is mainly one of "speed-effectiveness" type. An excessively high rate of growth often drives the economy into the red light zone and makes us feel notably restrained by the environment. Therefore, we should keep the rate of growth of our GNP below 10 percent in 1994. 3) Flexible monetary policy. Since the implementation of the reform and opening up program, we discover that the several economic fluctuations in the past were invariably connected with the monetary policy. In most of the cases, the tightening of the monetary policy was often the first choice in preventing our economy from entering the red light zone. The monetary policy will still play an important role in 1994. We should control our economy by adopting the form of "tightening the overall economy, while relaxing the control over specific projects." That means to place the overall economy under control, while ensuring the fulfillment of important economic plans.
