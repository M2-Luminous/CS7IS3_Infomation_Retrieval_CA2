We must concentrate on political and ideological work to ensure the political and ideological unity in the entire party. Cadres and party members must be given regular training on the party's conceptions and lines to upgrade their knowledge, confirm their commitment in the socialist path, and help them to creatively apply and develop the Maxist-Lenininsm, Ho Chi Minh thought, and advanced ideas of our times and grasp new thinkings to correctly resolve problems arising from real situations. The ideological work must first must concentrate on pressing problems that need to be dealt with quickly. Through practical research and review, problems arising from the renovation process together with measures to solve them must be scientifically clarified. Mistaken conceptions and vague and unsure ideologies must be corrected. We must fight against all opportunistic, rightist, dogmatic, and conservative manifestations. Party cadres and members must strictly observe the party's resolutions and directives and state laws. They must not disseminate conceptions contradicting the party's line. Party unity and unification must be strengthened. Principles relating to party organization and activity -- first, the principle of democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership and individual responsibility -- must be implemented. Revolutionary morality and healthy lifestyles must be drilled to fight against waste, corruption, and illegal business. We must fight against personalism, indiscipline, arbitrariness, authoritarianism, parochialism, and clannishness. The party protection work and the work to ensure internal and national secrecy must be given particular attention. All conspiracies and tricks to degenerate the party cadres must be eliminated. The control work on the implementation of the party's lines, policies, and regulations must be strengthened. The national unity block must be broadened, and the close relationship between the party and the public must be consolidated. Uncle Ho's thoughts must be promulgated to broadly unite all Vietnamese people in supporting the renovation cause for national independence and in striving to extricate ourselves from poverty and backwardness to surge forward for the goal of rich population, strong nation, and just and civilized society. We must consider national interests as a common goal. At the same time, we accept different viewpoints as long as they do not counter the national interests. We should eliminate obsession of hatred to look forward to the future. The ideology of great unity must be manifested in all state guidances, policies, and laws. We must perfect policies to guarantee the interests and roles of the workers, peasants, and intelligent. The forces of women and youth must be fostered and developed. The party and state's policies regarding the ethnic and religious people, industrialists, businessmen, overseas Vietnamese community must be supplemented and satisfactorily implemented. The party echelons and party committees must hold study workshops before implementing party Central Committee and Political Bureau resolutions on the work relating to fatherland fronts and mass organizations. We have to set up mechanisms to coordinate activities between state organs and mass organizations. The work content, method, and attitude of the fatherland fronts and mass organizations must be revamped. We have to reform cadre-related work. First we have to renew our conceptions and methods of our cadre-related work in assessing, selecting, employing, and deploying, especially key cadres. Gifted people must be trained, fostered, and employed. We have to create favorable conditions for good people, both inside and outside the party and inside and outside the country, to contribute their best efforts to the nation. The contingent of cadres must be rejuvenated. Woman and ethnic cadres must be given special attention. We must fight against narrow-mindedness, parochialism, prejudice, and discrimination. The evaluation, choice, and assigning of leading cadres at all levels must base on fundamental standards outlined in the Third Central Committee Plenum resolution. We must pay particular attention to their political knowledge, determination in the party's goals and ideals, and morality and life style to ensure that they always exercise diligence, practice frugality, instill honesty, and uphold righteousness. They must not be corrupted and determined in fighting against corruption. They must have consciousness of organization and discipline, stay close to the masses, and obtain a capacity and quality in par with their duties. We will bring about democratization of party member work. The evaluation of cadres must be done collectively by the party committee directly managing the cadres together with relevant agencies and must be done in accordance with proper process in a democratic, conscientious, and fair manner. Every cadre has the right to be informed and to give opinion on the evaluation by the party committee and agency leaders on the concerned cadre. All party organizations will reorganize and reevaluate the existing contingent of cadres, and base on this evaluation to build up plans for party member work from mow until the year 2000, which will correspond to the requirements of quantity, quality, and structure of cadres. We will provide training and further training to cadres according to plans. The training content must be specific for each task and requirements of each concerned position. Renovation must be carried out in both teaching and studying methods in training, while adequate funds must be provided to the training provision. Party members, especially the cadres at all levels, must regularly study, enrich their knowledge, heighten their understanding level, and improve their revolutionary characteristics. We have to urgently prepare the human force for the eighth party congress and the later years. We have to improve the policies and awards for cadres, renovate our thinking, heighten the scientific characteristic of the organization task, and continue to overhaul the organization system to guarantee a light and effective party mechanism with high efficiency. We have to boost the research on organization models, discern each function, duty, and leadership style of the party at all sectors and echelons, and from there set up plans to perfect the organization and rationalize the mechanisms of the party, state, and other organizations. We will renovate the party's leadership model. Our party is a ruling party, which sets up policies and lines for the national construction and protection. The successful implementation of party's policies and lines requires us to grasp firmly the organization and cadre work. The party leads applying the democratic centralism principle, and the principle of collective leadership with individual responsibility. The leadership task is fulfilled through the party organization, not through the individual party cadre. The leader executes collective decisions, follows up and guides the implementation, encourages good deeds, corrects deviations to develop the role and efficacy of the state, not to replace it. We must heighten militant character of the party members contingent regarding consolidation of grass-roots party organizations. At present, the political determination and loyalty to the party's ideals, to working people's interests and interests of the people as a whole, are essential characteristics of a party member. The party regulations clearly stipulate the criteria and duties of a party member, and every member must abide by these regulations, be a model in striving to become an excellent worker, cadre, or manager, who fulfills all assigned tasks, studies regularly to improve knowledge and work ability, respects organization disciplines, fosters party unity, and strictly follows state laws. We have to handle in a timely and strict manner those degenerated and deviated party members, and those breaching party disciplines and state laws. We continue to expel from our party those who do not have membership eligibility any more. We must perform well the party development task, especially among youth and women and in organizations where grass-roots party organizations do not exist or have too few members. We will rejuvenate the party contingent. On the occasions of the party's 65th founding anniversary and other important festivities in 1994, we will launch education and training campaigns on party development with prime attention be focused on youth, in preparation for the eighth party congress. In front of us is a new era full of promising potentials, challenges that we determine to overcome, and favorable opportunities we must exploit. All of our party, army, and people must stick together, be unified in the struggle to successfully implement the resolution of the Seventh Party Congress and bring the renovation undertaking forward with ever greater victories.
