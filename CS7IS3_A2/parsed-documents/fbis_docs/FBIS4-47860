He spoke to our correspondent at Ulundi today. [Begin Buthelexi recording] When we went to the elections, it was under the understanding that we would accept the results of the elections, and the only reservation that I had was because of all the irregularities that were taking place, that made me reserve my position and say that, you know, well, let's wait and see what the outcome is. But I don't think that there's any possibility that I could turn around and say that I don't accept the results of the elections, if everyone else accepts them. [end recording]
