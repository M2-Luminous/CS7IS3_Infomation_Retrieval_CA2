The United Nations Security Council told North Korea to permit IAEA checks by the middle of May in a presidential statement issued March 31. The government will hold a meeting of related ministers this week, after Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu returns from trips to the United States and Japan, to discuss Team Spirit's suspension, the sources said. A final decision on suspending the war games will be made at a South Korean-U.S. defense ministers' meeting. U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry will visit Seoul on April 17 to discuss the North Korean problem and meet with his South Korean counterpart Yi Pyong-tae. The South Korean Government is considering suspension of Team Spirit because it wants the North to respond positively to the Security Council president's statement. If Pyongyang refuses to allow inspections by mid-May, however, Seoul may resume Team Spirit in late May or sometime in the second half of this year, the sources said. Seoul also plans to allow deployment of Patriot missiles as scheduled since the Patriot is purely a defensive weapon.
