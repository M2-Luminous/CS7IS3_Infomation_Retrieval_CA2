Burlakov, who is expecting the Bundeswehr chief of staff, General Naumann at the Western Group of Russian Forces headquarters at Wuensdorf south of Berlin this Thursday [27 January], said in Berlin that such cooperation could include joint field exercises. Taking stock of the withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany, Burlakov once again severely criticized the delays that have occurred in the housing program for soldiers returning from Germany. From the families of soldiers that returned home between 1990 and 1993, 40 to 45 percent are without apartments. The chief of staff blamed both the Russian Defense Ministry and the German side for the slow realization of the housing program. He accused the Defense Ministry, which did not decide on new locations in Russia until after the withdrawal had begun, of bad planning and mismanagement at the building sites and the German Economics Ministry of insufficient control of the German companies carrying out the building work. He said that some of these companies were lagging up to 10 months behind schedule. The part of the housing project funded by Germany with 7.8 billion marks, is to provide 25,000 apartments by the time of the final withdrawal on 31 August. The part funded by the Russian Defense Ministry has to complete some 22,000 apartments. While the withdrawal of troops is on schedule, he doubts that the housing program will be completed on time, Burlakov said. He said that of 546,000 former Soviet troops stationed in Germany up to mid-1990, only 68,000 had remained by 1 January this year. To date, 90 percent of war materiel and ammunition have been withdrawn. In this connection, Burlakov denied German reports saying that Russian statistics are missing some 81,000 tonnes of ammunition that seem to have disappeared. Over the past years, the Western Group has conducted an intensive training program, during which a great quantity of ammunition was fired. Besides, the supreme commander said, not a single Russian bullet, bomb, nor shell will remain in Germany after the withdrawal. The Russian commander in chief is concerned about the increasing number of crimes committed around the Russian garrisons. While a total of 277 unlawful acts were reported in 1991, the figure had risen to 1,038 in 1992, and to 1,277 in 1993. In 1992, 816 of these offenses were committed by "immigrants," 389 by German citizens; the rest of the offenders could not be clearly established. By "immigrants" Burlakov means people from the former Soviet Union's successor states -- including soldiers stationed here before -- who conducted their dark dealings near the Russian barracks, often organized in gangs. According to Burlakov, 23 Russian soldiers were killed in attacks over the past years. On the other hand, Russian soldiers committed 72 crimes since 1990, involving five deaths. The colonel-general expressly rejected allegations that Russian forces are involved in liquor and cigarette trafficking. He said these are isolated cases and are severely punished by the military authorities. Close investigations into the Western Group by the Russian Public Prosecutor and other authorities have shown that the allegation of corruption and a reference to Mafia-like structures are unfounded. Yet, offenses by individual members of the Western Group cannot be denied. In this connection, Burlakov confirmed that the 10,000 sports rifles that were seized in mid-January had been brought to Germany illegally by a Russian company in aircraft belonging to the Western Group via the Sperenberg air base to be passed to a Hamburg company. The supreme commander has already some specific ideas about the way to mark the farewell of Russian forces from German soil -- which after all means finally putting an end to World War II. Since the Germans do not want a joint farewell ceremony for the Russians and the French, British, and American forces, the Russians are now planning a joint function with the Germans on a state level. President Yeltsin and Chancellor Kohl have already been in contact over this matter. Colonel-General Burlakov, who wants to leave Germany as the last Russian soldier on 31 August, is thinking of celebrations in two stages. In the time between 1 and 10 May, a "week of remembrance" should be held, with commemoration services honoring soldiers killed, not only in Germany, but also in Russia, if possible. In early August, an event should take place at the Soviet memorial in Berlin's Treptow Park with Yeltsin and Kohl attending, street festivals, and a meeting of veterans. The Russian side is now waiting for the German reply to these suggestions, said Burlakov.
