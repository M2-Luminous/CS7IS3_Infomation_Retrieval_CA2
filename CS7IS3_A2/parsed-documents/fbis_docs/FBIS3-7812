Our correspondent David Stahlavsky reports: [Stahlavsky] The Polish guest regards the visit as a further step in the process of strengthening goodneighborly relations between our two countries. Jozef Oleksy visited Bratislava last week. The agenda of his talks with the prime minister, the foreign minister, and President Vaclav Havel later in the afternoon included European issues and other issues important for both Poland and the Czech Republic. At a joint news conference, the speaker of the Polish Sejm described his talks with Klaus as businesslike and interesting. They were talks that brought a pragmatic contribution to relations between Poland and the Czech Republic. He focused, in particular, on reforms in both states. Welcoming the outcome of the talks, Oleksy said: [Begin Oleksy recording, in Polish with superimposed Czech translation] The prime minister's statement that relations with Poland are an absolute priority for the Czech Republic was of enormous importance for me. I fully share the prime minister's view that Western Europe has much to learn from our two countries. We said that Europe needed a broad and fresh dialogue and that no institutions could substitute for this dialogue. [end recording] Speaking about the visit of the Polish Sejm speaker, Klaus said the following: [Begin Klaus recording] I would like to say, in fact, that I am very glad that this visit is taking place because we need to overcome certain misunderstandings that exist with regard to Czech-Polish relations. For me, personally, it is not just a phrase to say that relations between the Czech Republic and Poland take a high priority in our policy. I am convinced that they must be perpetuated not only on government and parliament levels but on all other levels. [end recording] [Stahlavsky] Klaus and Oleksy discussed the strengthening of economic relations, the increase of mutual investments, and the use of Polish debt to the former Czechoslovakia. After the division of the federation, the Czech Republic share of claims is $68 million. Klaus rejected the initial proposal that this balance should be offset by deliveries of Polish coal because the Czech Republic has a surplus of coal. The speaker of the Polish Sejm recalled the current concept according to which the debt should be used to improve the infrastructure along the common border and on ecology-related projects.
