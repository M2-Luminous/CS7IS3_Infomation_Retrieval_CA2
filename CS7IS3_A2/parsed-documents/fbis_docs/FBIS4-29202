Overriding the ruling coalition's objections, Budget Committee Chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi declared that his panel would summon the 56-year-old Hosokawa. As soon as Yamaguchi made the announcement, several lower house members openly protested while opposition party legislators, including those of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), applauded. Members of both the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] are trying to use Hosokawa's plight to their advantage and force Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority government to step down. Budget panel chairman Yamaguchi is an SDP member. The budget panel made the announcement a day after Hosokawa's former financial secretary appeared before the panel to say Hosokawa had indeed paid back a 100 million yen loan borrowed in 1982 from scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm. The secretary, Masatoshi Miyama, testified under oath at the committee about the former premier's questionable financial deals, which led to Hosokawa's resignation in April. Miyama denied allegations that Hosokawa may not have paid back the 100 million yen loan and that it was received as a secret political donation.
