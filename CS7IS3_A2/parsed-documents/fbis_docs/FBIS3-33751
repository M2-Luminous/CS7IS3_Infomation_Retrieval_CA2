Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said last night that Israel and the PLO have overcome two or three of the toughest issues in the negotiations. The prime minister was speaking in a conference call with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, while the foreign minister also spoke in a conference call, but with Israeli journalists in Washington. Arye Golan reports from Washington: [Begin recording] [Golan] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres will start a two-day visit to Washington this afternoon. The main event on the first day is a meeting with Secretary of State Warren Christopher to update him on the talks with 'Arafat in Davos. In a conference call from Florida, where he started his U.S. visit, Peres refused to detail the solutions worked out in Davos. [Peres] We agreed on the contents, but we have not yet reached agreement on the wording. I did not want to draft it hastily or without holding consultations at home, because telephone consultations have their limitations. Since each word is important, I came to the conclusion that before we add our signature, it would be best to wait several days until I have the opportunity to speak with the prime minister and others involved in the talks. This requires a lot of time and patience, but I remain firm in my belief that we can reach a full agreement, although under no circumstances am I ready to say how long it will take. [Golan] Both Prime Minister Rabin, in his conference call with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, and Foreign Minister Peres stress that the government will make sure that Israel remains responsible for overall security and that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will protect the settlements. Both promise the government will not compromise on security. [Peres] We have not compromised and will not compromise on security matters, and we must be extremely careful in wording any agreement on security. As I have already said, I prefer to go over the draft word by word, because we have reviewed many drafts during the negotiating process. I would like the final draft to be acceptable to my colleagues, the prime minister in particular. [Golan] Before Peres leaves the United States to continue the negotiations with 'Arafat in Cairo, he will confer here with Senate and House leaders, and tomorrow he will meet with Vice President Al Gore and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake.
