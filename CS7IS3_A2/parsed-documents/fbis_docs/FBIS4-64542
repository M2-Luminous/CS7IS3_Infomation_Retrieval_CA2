[passage omitted] During the talks to be conducted with the Iraqi delegation that will arrive in Ankara in the coming weeks, ways will be sought to develop new relations between Turkey and Iraq, beginning with the repair of the oil pipeline and the pumping of the 12 million barrels of oil that are currently trapped in the pipeline. This will not be in violation of the embargo but will be pushing it to its limits. There is no doubt that the UN embargo and the unchanged attitude of the United States with regard to Saddam constitute an obstacle to the development of these relations. To tell the truth, however, Turkey's current economic situation does not allow it to heed these objections. In any case, Ankara will not violate the embargo but merely bend the rules to revive the relations. No one should be surprised if these initiatives meet with objections. Given the events in Bosnia, it is also wrong to think that the United Nations and Washington will not have the boldness to oppose the development of our relations with Iraq. Have there not been sufficient examples of double standards on the part of the United Nations and the United States until now? Turkey should now try to bring the miscalculation to the attention of the whole world and explain to the Western countries that Saddam is a reality that is here to stay, that totally isolating Iraq and pushing it into a difficult situation will not contribute to regional peace, and that fundamentalism could spread into this region to fill any vacuum caused by Saddam's overthrow. Even if it does not solve Turkey's economic problems entirely, the development of relations with Iraq could contribute positively to overcoming the economic crisis. [passage omitted] In brief, the process started with Sanberk's visit is important enough to constitute the first steps of righting a wrong, as long as it is well appraised and the necessary determination is demonstrated.
