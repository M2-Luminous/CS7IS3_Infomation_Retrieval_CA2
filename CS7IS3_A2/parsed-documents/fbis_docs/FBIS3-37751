The specific features pertaining to the application of trading conditions between both countries on an agreed range of goods will be drawn up in annual protocols that form an integral part of this agreement. 2. For the purposes of this agreement and for the period of its validity, goods proceeding from the territory of the contracting parties are understood as follows: a) Goods that have been produced in their entirety on the territories of the contracting parties; b) Goods that have been produced on the territories of the contracting parties, using raw and other materials and assembly components originating from third countries, with a change, in this case, in their classification, in accordance with the Classification of Goods of Foreign Economic Activity (CG FEA) based on the EC Coordinated System of Describing and Coding Goods and the Combined Tariff and Statistical Register; the first four characters must be used in the listing; c) Goods that have been produced with the use of raw materials, materials, and assembly components mentioned in Point b on condition that their aggregate value does not exceed the fixed share of the export price of the saleable goods.

The quantitative restrictions mentioned in Point 1 of this article may be established by one side within reasonable limits and for a strictly defined period of time only: When there is an acute shortage of the given goods on the internal market -- until the situation on the market is stabilized; When there is an acute deficit in the balance of payments -- until the situation with the balance of payments is stabilized; If any types of goods are imported onto the territory of one of the contracting parties in such increased quantities or under such conditions that harm or threaten to harm home producers of similar or directly competing goods; In order to implement the measures stipulated in Article 4 of this agreement. 3. The quantitative restrictions mentioned in Point 1 of this article may also be established on the mutual agreement of the sides and be included in the annual protocols mentioned in Article 1 of this agreement. 4.

The contracting sides will aim to resolve by means of consultations all questions arising in connection with the application of the quantitative restrictions mentioned in Point 2 of this article. Article 4 Each of the contracting parties will not permit the reexport of goods on whose export the other contracting party from whose territory these goods originate is applying measures of tariff and/or non-tariff regulation. The parties will exchange lists of goods on which measures of tariff and/or non-tariff regulation are being applied. Such goods can be reexported to third countries only on written consent and under conditions defined by the authorized state body that is the country of origin of these goods. In the event that this clause is not implemented, the contracting party whose interests have been violated has the right to introduce measures against the other side to regulate the export of goods onto the territory of the contracting party that has permitted the unsanctioned reexport. At the same time, the currency earnings from such reexport are to be returned to the country from where the corresponding goods originated. Each year, the contracting parties will additionally agree upon the conditions, range, and volume of goods permitted for reexport. For the purposes of this article, reexport means the removal of goods originating from the customs territory of one of the contracting parties by the other contracting party beyond the limits of the latter's customs territory with the aim of exporting them to a third country. Article 5 The contracting parties will exchange information on a regular basis on customs questions, including customs statistics. Bodies authorized by the contracting parties will draw up the procedure for the exchange of such information in a corresponding document. Article 6 The contracting parties will undertake measures aimed at drawing together the levels of customs duty rates that are being applied in trade with third countries and, to this end, will hold regular consultations.

Article 8 The contracting parties recognize as incompatible with the aims of this agreement unfair business practice expressed, in particular, in the following: In the conclusion of contracts between enterprises whose aim is to hinder or restrict competition or violate the conditions for it on the territories of the contracting parties; In the carrying out of actions with whose help one or several enterprises use their position of dominance, restricting competition on all or a significant part of the territories of the contracting parties. Article 9 The contracting parties will not use state aid in the form of subsidies to enterprises or in any other form if such state aid should result in the violation of normal economic conditions on the territory of the other contracting party. Article 10 During the implementation of measures aimed at the tariff and non-tariff regulation of bilateral economic relations, in order to exchange statistical information and conduct customs procedures, the contracting parties have agreed to use the single nine-character Classification of Goods of Foreign Economic Activity (CG FEA) based on the Coordinated System of Describing and Coding Goods. At the same time, for the own needs of their states, the contracting parties, when necessary, will develop the classification of goods beyond nine characters. The Russian Federation will introduce a standard copy of the classification of goods through its representations in the corresponding international organizations till such time as the Republic of Georgia announces that it is independently introducing such a copy. Article 11 The contracting parties agree that the observance of the principle of free transit is a most important condition for achieving the aims of this agreement and an essential element in the process of their inclusion in the system of the international division of labor and collaboration.

The contracting parties will not demand payment for services connected with the warehousing, transshipment, storage, and carriage of goods in the currency of any third state. Article 12 Nothing in this agreement should hinder any of the contracting parties from adopting measures that they consider necessary for the protection of their vital interests or that are absolutely necessary for the implementation of international treaties to which they are signatories, if these measures concern: - Information that touches upon the interests of national defense; - Trade in weapons, ammunition, and military hardware; - Research or production connected with defense needs; - The delivery of materials and equipment used in the nuclear industry; - The protection of common morals and public order; - The protection of industrial or intellectual property; - Gold, silver, or other precious metals and stones; - The protection of the health of people, animals, and plants. Article 13 In order to develop trade between the two countries, the contracting parties will promote participation in trade fairs and exhibitions held in either of the two countries.

Article 15 Nothing in this agreement hinders the contracting parties from conducting relations with third countries and also their associations and international organizations provided these relations do not contradict the aims and conditions of this agreement. However, the contracting parties will hold consultations in those instances when these relations could affect the interests of one of the contracting parties, proceeding from this agreement. Article 16 Disputes between the contracting parties concerning the interpretation or application of the terms of this agreement will be settled by means of negotiations.
