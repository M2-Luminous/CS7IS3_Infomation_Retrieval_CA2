Officials from the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) emerged from the meeting near the Iraqi border, organised by Turkey, without making any comment to journalists. But Kurdish sources said the officials failed to make any progress in efforts to halt the fighting which has claimed more than 100 lives since the start of May and split northern Iraq into PUK and KDP-controlled zones. Tehran Radio said Monday that thousands of Kurds had fled their homes amid renewed fighting in Qal'at Dizah, al-Sulaymaniyah, the Hajj 'Umran region of Halabjah, near the Iranian border, and in Irbil. Northern Iraq has been under Kurdish control since it was established with the help of the U.S.-led coalition which drove Iraqi occupying forces out of Kuwait in February 1991.
