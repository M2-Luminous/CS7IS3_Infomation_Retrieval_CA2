FR940414-1-00038 FR940414-1-00010 1. Existing Databases A pesticide, as defined by the FIFRA, includes ``any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest, and any substance or mixture of substances intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant'' (40 CFR 152.3(s)). Under FIFRA, all pesticides must be registered with EPA prior to shipment, delivery, or sale in the United States. A pesticide product is a formulated product; that is, it is a mixture of at least one ``active ingredient'' and ``inert'' diluents. Each formulation has a distinct registration. Mandatory reporting of yearly pesticide production is required by FIFRA as part of the pesticide registration process. Pesticide producing establishments, including formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities, are required to provide information to EPA on registered pesticide products, such as product registration numbers, product classification, type and use, and production rates. These data are submitted as part of the ``Pesticide Report for Pesticide-Producing Establishments'' (EPA Form 3540&hyph;16) and are stored in the FIFRA and TSCA (Toxic Substances Control Act) Enforcement System (FATES) data base. (The FATES data base has been renamed the Section Seven Tracking System (SSTS).) Accessing the FATES data base gave the population data from which the stratified random sample of formulating, packaging and repackaging facilities were drawn. The databases for more recent years (1989 through 1991) were also accessed to identify any changes in the make-up of the industry and to evaluate the applicability of this regulation, as will be discussed in more detail later in this preamble. For the survey of pesticide chemicals formulating, packaging or repackaging industry, the Agency focused on the 272 active ingredients or classes of active ingredients that were the basis of the census for the pesticide manufacturing facilities. In 1988, EPA decided to separate the pesticide manufacturing rulemaking, which at that time was well underway, from the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging rulemaking. However, as the subcategories are all included in the same point source category and were initially intended to be developed concurrently, EPA continued to use the same list of 272 active ingredients that formed the basis for the pesticide manufacturing data base for the pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging subcategories. (For the final rule covering organic pesticide chemical manufacturing, three of the active ingredients were dropped from coverage: biphenyl since it was no longer a registered pesticide active ingredient and ortho- and para-dichlorobenzene whose manufacture is covered by another effluent guidelines regulation.) The initial basis of this list was the 284 active ingredients and classes of active ingredients presented in Appendix 2 of the October 4, 1985 regulation (50 FR 40672). These 284 active ingredients were originally selected in 1977 on the basis of significant production and/or commercial use. EPA then expanded this list to 835 active ingredients by adding the following group of active ingredients: •All salts and esters of listed organic acids (such as 2,4-D); •All metallo-organic active ingredients (consisting of an organic portion bonded to arsenic, cadmium, copper, or mercury); •All organo-tin active ingredients; •All active ingredients that appeared to be structurally similar to other listed active ingredients (such as organo-phosphorus pesticides); and •Any other active ingredients with an analytical method previously demonstrated to be applicable to wastewater. EPA excluded from this list of 835 active ingredients those active ingredients already subject to regulation under other effluent guidelines_specifically, those for which the manufacturing is regulated by the Organic Chemicals, Plastics and Synthetic Fibers (OCPSF) (40 CFR part 414), Inorganic Chemicals Manufacturing (40 CFR part 415), and Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (40 CFR part 439) effluent guidelines. Information provided to EPA under FIFRA indicated that 335 of those 835 active ingredients were produced in 1984&hyph;1985, and the other 500 were not produced for domestic use in either 1984 or 1985. An additional 15 (of the 835) were added to the 335 active ingredients because those 15 active ingredients had been manufactured prior to 1984 and might still be manufactured for export. The list of 350 active ingredients and derivatives, such as salts and esters of an active ingredient, was consolidated into an active ingredient class, to arrive at a total of 272 active ingredients and classes of active ingredients. Because the consolidated classes include all elements of the class, such as all salts and esters of 2,4-D (i.e., not just those in use in 1986), the 272 active ingredients and classes of active ingredients actually include 606 of the 835 specific active ingredients. This list of active ingredients was used as a basis for the effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the pesticide chemicals manufacturing subcategories (58 FR 50367). 2. Survey Questionnaire A major source of information and data used in developing effluent limitations guidelines and standards is industry responses to questionnaires distributed by EPA under the authority of section 308 of the Clean Water Act. These questionnaires typically request information concerning the generation of wastewater and pollutants as part of production processes, treatment, and disposal, as well as wastewater treatment system performance data. Questionnaires also request financial and economic data for use in assessing economic impacts and the economic achievability of technology options. In 1988 EPA submitted a draft questionnaire to pesticide industry trade associations, environmental public interest groups and a number of pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities for review and comment. EPA subsequently revised the draft questionnaire and in 1989 distributed it to nine facilities for a pretest. Further revisions were made to the form following the pretest, and it was then submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. OMB cleared the questionnaire on January 30, 1990 (OMB control number 2040&hyph;0139). FATES data files were accessed to obtain information on product registrations containing one or more of the 272 targeted PAIs. This dataset was used to define a sampling frame of 3,241 facilities identified in the 1988 Fates database as formulators, packagers, or repackagers of these PAIs. The sampling frame was partitioned into 51 strata. The stratification was done according to pesticide production amount (large, medium, small, and tiny) and pesticide type (fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, and other and combinations of these types for facilities that formulate and/or package more than one type). A total of 611 facilities was selected randomly from the sampling frame to comprise the questionnaire survey sample. The survey was also distributed to a census of 91 pesticide manufacturers that also formulate, package or repackage pesticides which were identified from the ``Pesticide Manufacturing Facility Census for 1986''. Two of the 611 sampled facilities and two of the 91 manufacturers were sampled twice and received duplicate surveys so the actual number of facilities sent surveys was 609 sampled facilities and 89 manufacturers for a total of 698 surveyed facilities. EPA received responses from 676 (587 randomly sampled facilities and 89 manufacturers) of the 698 facilities that received the questionnaire (a 97 percent response rate). Of the 676 facilities that responded to the survey, 349 indicated that they were formulating, packaging or repackaging pesticide products in 1988 and 203 were refilling establishments. One hundred nineteen (119) facilities did not formulate and package pesticide products in 1988. Of the remaining 5 facilities that were sent questionnaires, 3 had gone out of business, one was released from completing a questionnaire and one sampled facility merged with a second sampled facility. A small number of facilities (22) did not submit questionnaires. EPA believes most of these facilities are refilling establishments by virtue of their stratum, the company name and their locations. Since the survey had drawn significant numbers of refilling establishments, EPA did not further pursue these questionnaires. Based on the responses to the surveys from the randomly sampled facilities and the census of manufacturers, quantitative estimates of pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging activities were computed for the entire U.S. population of such facilities. EPA also received questionnaires from six facilities that were not selected in the random sample part of the census of manufacturers. Three of these facilities had participated in a pretest of the questionnaire but were not chosen in the sample. The remaining three were facilities that asked if they might submit voluntary surveys. The responses to these questionnaires were reviewed but for statistical reasons were omitted from any further analysis for the purpose of national population estimates.
