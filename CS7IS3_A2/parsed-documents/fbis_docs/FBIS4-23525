A: It has primarily been an organisational and functional change. We had to change our vision of the present and future South Africa as well as our view of Armscor's position in the country's economic household (and this) involved scaling down manpower activities in certain areas, and strengthening manpower in others. Our relationship with the arms industry has never been healthier. Q: Do you place a high premium on local companies increasing their international market share? A: Exports are of paramount importance for the economy to grow to required levels over the next 10 years. Companies have, for too long, suffered from a "blockade mentality" and need to broaden their outlook. The only way our economy can grow is through active participation in international markets. To be successful, however, we need to become far more productive and competitive. The arms industry has a tremendous advantage over other players who have been manufacturing under licence agreements from overseas companies for a considerable time (as) Armscor's producers are mostly unique and that is why the arms industry is the [as published] Q: How do you see Armscor's future as the acquisition organisation for the SANDF? A: Since the SANDF will need to replace most of its major equipment over the next two decades, or face a massive reduction of its capabilities, Armscor will still have a vital function to fulfill. The local military industry will have to contend with full foreign competition, and this means it will have to look closely at performance, value and cost-effectiveness. We are not only acquiring capital equipment for the army but are engaged in procuring everyday necessities, which may sound mundane but are important for the well-being of the soldier -- items ranging from basic foodstuffs to socks and boots. Q: What specific areas of growth would there be for Armscor? A: There are tremendous growth opportunities, not only in servicing established clients, but also extending services to government institutions. We can also be of invaluable help to other countries in southern Africa, and this is an area in which I perceive growth potential. The whole of the sub-continent has a wealth of military vehicles and equipment left over from recent wars (and) these need to be maintained and upgraded. Armscor's biggest growth area, however, lies in the field of counter trade, in which we are the leaders in this country. By being active in this field, we can contribute towards the growth of industrial enterprise and contribute further towards the saving of foreign exchange and new job opportunities.
