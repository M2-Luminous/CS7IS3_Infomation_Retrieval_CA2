The Christian Democrats of the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] elected to parliament, yesterday met in a Rome hotel for their first group meeting. Naturally, however, talk concentrated on the storm raging inside the pole of freedoms. Key concepts set out in instructions issued by Pierferdinando Casini, Clemente Mastella, and Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli read: "The only candidate to head the government is [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi." The second point was: "We will not allow the League to enforce a presumed relative majority within the pole." In other words, the CCD could join up with Forza Italia in parliament but its votes are available to Silvio Berlusconi, enabling him to do without the seats held by the League. The third point requires the immediate drafting of laws on two fundamental issues, information and justice (for the former, this means the launch of a law affecting not just TV, but also newspapers, advertising, and cinema. In the words of Fumagalli Carulli: "a law that confirms general and fundamental points and which releases the sector from its chains." Where justice is concerned, it must be quickly decided whether or not it is necessary to alter the rules for the election of the CSM [Higher Council of the Magistracy], the legislating body for informers, and the obligatory nature of penal action. On the future government, all things considered, the CCD is confident (otherwise we will have to immediately return to the polls). What about the anguish in the PPI [Italian Popular Party]? We are ready to welcome into our ranks only those who, in good faith, have changed their mind about our political plan." What about Formigoni's [PPI] approach? "If they are roses, they will flourish."
