Noting that the Japanese ruling circles are now making haste with the preparations for "security emergency legislation arrangements," the article says: "The security emergency legislation arrangements" mean the enactment of a wartime law which would allow Japan to take part in the war immediately after the United States started it in Korea. This is a dangerous move to lay a legal foundation for overseas aggression and, on this basis, stage a military comeback to Korea. The Japanese reactionaries are scheming reinvasion of Korea, availing themselves of the tension mounting on the Korean peninsula due to the U.S. policy of stifling the DPRK. They are now crying for "the security of Japan," while spreading the rumor that a war will be started by the North in Korea in no time. This is aimed at drumming up support from the Japanese people for the enactment of the wartime law. Their intention to enact the wartime law is related to their dominationist, aggressive design not only on Korea but also on the rest of Asia. They seek to dispatch their aggression forces to Korea and any other regions of Asia under the pretext of "emergency" by formulating the law. Though dozens of years have passed since the end of World War II, the Japanese reactionaries have not yet honestly reflected on their past crimes and apologized for them, because they remain captive to the ambition to dominate Korea and other Asian nations again. If Japan choose aggression and war again, failing to draw a lesson from their defeat in the past, it would suffer a more miserable defeat.
