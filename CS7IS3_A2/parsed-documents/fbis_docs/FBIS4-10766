M. do Prado] [Text] Exchange operations on the financial market have registered an $800 million deficit. Payments on external obligations have heavily influenced Brazilian external accounts, while no sufficient compensatory income came from the financial sector. Stock markets have continued to attract rather significant amounts of foreign funds -- the balance is $251 million, including investments in stocks and portfolios. Foreign funds also have been attracted by fixed earning funds for foreign capital, which were created at the end of 1993 for investment of the debenture funds. The flow of income into these funds, which used to stand at $80 million a month, rose to $122 million, with the total value of fund capital standing at $1.631 billion on 30 March. However, obtaining capital through bonds, notes, and commercial papers [preceding two words in English] has been rather slow. The balance in March was still positive -- income reached $1.851 billion while the outflow stood at $1.6 billion -- but the balance is expected to be smaller in March as a result of the difficulties in selling securities abroad, which Brazilian enterprises and banks already have felt. Foreign currency operations tied to foreign debt obligations -- this includes interest not only on the debt that was contracted in the 1970's but also on the debt contracted in this decade in bonds and other papers -- have increased: remittances of $470 million went to pay interest, while $270 million went for amortizing loans contracted within the terms of Resolution No. 63 (contracting of external loans for domestic use). Profits and dividends of $340 million also were paid, while $300 million was paid to amortize funds that were used for financing imports. The figures were released by the Central Bank, whose technicians believe the financial sector performed poorly because of the effects of the remittances and payments on the external obligations. From a strict viewpoint, the influence of such payments and remittances should be inversely proportional to the country's ability to contract new loans abroad. Last month, the inflow of money into the stock markets was significant -- it reached $1.851 billion -- but in this case it is volatile capital. In the same month, the capital outflow reached $1.6 billion. Actually, international reserves last month grew on the basis of the currency exchange operations involving foreign trade. At the foreign currency level, exports yielded $4 billion (effective cash inflow), repeating the performance of January. As for imports, which since the beginning of last year have had the same performance, they caused a foreign currency drain of $1.8 billion. Last month, the net income from financial and commercial operations stood at approximately $1.4 billion. This will push the first quarter's net surplus to approximately $7 billion, well above the $2.3 billion net surplus registered in the first quarter of 1993. During the first days of April, the Central Bank has observed that export income remains high, standing at around $200 million per day. In the financial sector, however, incoming and outgoing flows still are registering a deficit. It is still early -- only four workdays have passed -- to conclude that this is a trend, but projections lead to the conclusion that April will also register a deficit in the financial exchange market.
