FR940426-1-00068 FR940426-1-00007 (1) In those cases in which the indebtedness of a military member has been reduced to a judgment, an application for an involuntary allotment from the disposable pay of the member may be made pursuant to the procedures described in appendix A to this part. These procedures provide the exclusive remedy available under Public Law 103&hyph;94. (2) Involuntary allotment requests will not be processed for creditors who, either at the time of application for the involuntary allotment or at the time the debt was incurred that forms the basis for the court judgment, are in an ``off-limits'' status, or who have been determined to be practicing unfair consumer or commercial practices detrimental to the morale and welfare of service members, pursuant to applicable directives of the military services, to include the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board and Off-Installation Liaison and Operations regulation. (3) An involuntary allotment from a member's disposable pay shall not be commenced in any indebtedness case in which: (i) Exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the member from the judicial proceeding at which the judgment was rendered. (ii) There has not been compliance with the procedural requirements of the SSCRA. (4) Only one involuntary allotment pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;94 and this part may be authorized from the disposable pay of a member at any given time. (5) An involuntary allotment shall not exceed the lesser of 15 percent of a member's disposable pay, or the maximum amount authorized under the garnishment law of the State where the judgment was entered. An involuntary allotment shall not be authorized if the pay of a similarly situated civilian employee is not subject to garnishment under the applicable State law and Public Law 103&hyph;94. (6) The amount of an involuntary allotment under Public Law 103&hyph;94 and this part when combined with deductions as a result of garnishments or statutory allotments for spousal support and child support under 42 U.S.C. 659, 661, 662, or 665, may not exceed the maximum percentage specified in 15 U.S.C. 1673. In any case in which the maximum percentage would be exceeded, garnishments and involuntary allotments for spousal and child support shall take precedence over involuntary allotments authorized under Public Law 103&hyph;94 and this part. Involuntary allotments established pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;94 shall be reduced or stopped as necessary to avoid exceeding the maximum percentage allowed. ยง50.6 Full disclosure and standards of fairness by creditors The Truth in Lending Act prescribes the general disclosure requirements which must be met by those offering or extending consumer credit, and 12 CFR part 226 prescribes the specific disclosure requirements for both open-end and installment credit transactions. In place of Federal Government requirements, State regulations apply to credit transactions when the Federal Reserve Board has determined that the State regulations impose substantially similar requirements and provide adequate enforcement measures. Commanding officers, with the assistance of judge advocates, should check regulations of the Federal Reserve Board to determine whether Federal or State laws and regulations govern. Appendix A to Part 50_Processing Procedures A. Debt Complaints 1. It is incumbent on those submitting indebtedness complaints to show that the disclosure requirements of the Truth in Lending Act, and 12 CFR part 226 have been met and that the Standards of Fairness (appendix C to this part) have been applied. 2. Creditors subject to 12 CFR part 226, and assignees claiming thereunder, shall submit with their request for debt processing assistance an executed copy of the Certificate of Compliance (appendix B to this part), and a true copy of the general and specific disclosures provided the military member as required by the Truth in Lending Act. Requests which do not meet these requirements will be returned without action to the claimant. 3. A creditor not subject to 12 CFR part 226, such as a public utility company (as set forth in ยง226.3 thereof), shall submit with the request a certification that no interest, finance charge, or other fee is in excess of that permitted by the law of the State in which the obligation was incurred. 4. A foreign-owned company having debt complaints shall submit with its request a true copy of the terms of the debt (English translation) and shall certify that it has subscribed to the Standards of Fairness. 5. Indebtedness complaints which meet the requirements of this part will be processed by DoD Components. Processed means that Heads of DoD Components, or designees, shall: a. Review all available facts surrounding the transaction forming the basis of the compliant, including the member's legal rights and obligations, and any defenses or counterclaims the member may have. b. Advise the member that (1) just financial obligations are expected to be paid in a proper and timely manner, and what the member should do to comply with that policy; (2) financial and legal counseling services are available under the provisions of DoD Directive 1344.7 1 in resolving indebtedness; and (3) that a failure to pay just debts may result in the creditor obtaining a court judgment which could form the basis for collection of pay from the member pursuant to an involuntary allotment. 1 See footnote 1 to ยง50.4(c). c. If a member acknowledges a debt as a result of creditor contact with a DoD Component, advise the member that assistance and counseling may be available from the on-base military banking office, or the credit union serving the military field of membership, or other available military community service organizations. d. Direct that the appropriate commander advise the claimant that (1) those aspects of DoD policy prescribed in ยง50.5 are pertinent to the particular claim in question; and (2) the member concerned has been counseled concerning his or her obligations with respect to the claim. The commander's response will not undertake to arbitrate any disputed debt, or to admit or deny the validity of the claim. Under no circumstances will the response indicate whether any action has been taken against the member as a result of the compliant. B. Involuntary Allotments 1. Involuntary Allotment Application a. Regardless of the Service affiliation of the military member involved, an application to establish an involuntary allotment from the disposable pay of a military member shall be made by sending a signed application on DD Form aa, 2 ``Involuntary Allotment Application,'' to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) at the following address. Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Cleveland Center, Code L, PO Box 998002, Cleveland, OH 44199&hyph;8002. 2 This form will be developed. The final form will be included as an appendix to this part. (1) Each application must include a copy of the final judgment certified by the clerk of court, proof of actual service on the member, and such other documents as may be required by paragraph B.1.b. of this part. (2) A garnishment summons or order is insufficient to satisfy this final judgment requirement and is not needed in order to apply for an involuntary allotment under this appendix. (3) Proof of actual service on the military member shall, in the case of any default judgment, and may, in other cases, be demonstrated by including with the application for involuntary allotment a copy of the return of service showing personal service on the member or, where service by certified or registered mail is permitted by the rules of court, of the return receipt for such mail signed by the member. Involuntary allotments will not be authorized without evidence of actual service. In cases where jurisdiction was obtained by substituted service (such as service by publication or by mailing to a last known address), or where the judgment was entered on a confession of judgment, no involuntary allotment will be authorized and the application will be returned to the creditor. b. Applications for involuntary allotment, must contain the following information, certifications, and acknowledgment: (1) The full name, social security number, and branch of service of the military member against whose disposable pay an involuntary allotment is sought. Although not required, inclusion of the member's current duty station and duty address on the application form will facilitate processing of the application. (2) The applicant's full name and address. If the applicant is not a natural person, the application must be signed by an individual with the authority to act in behalf of such entity. If the allotment is to be in favor of other than the judgment creditor, proof of the right to succeed to the interest of the original judgment creditor is required and must be attached to the application. (3) A certification that the judgment has not been amended, superseded, set aside, or satisfied; or, if the judgment has been satisfied in part, the extent to which the judgment remains unsatisfied. (4) A certification that the judgment was issued while the member was not on active duty. If the judgment was issued while the member was on active duty, a certification that the member was present or represented by an attorney of the member's choosing in the proceedings, or if the member was not present or so represented, a certification that the judgment or other court documents comply with the rights of the member under the SSCRA. (5) A certification that the member's pay could be garnished under applicable State law and Public Law 103&hyph;94 if the member were a civilian employee. (6) A certification that, to the knowledge of the applicant, the debt has not been discharged in bankruptcy not has the member filed for protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws of the United States.
