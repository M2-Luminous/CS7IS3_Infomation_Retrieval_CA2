They are outfitting a Russian reentry vehicle with German infrastructure for the "Express" experiment. There will be German and Japanese experiments on board the capsule, which will be launched on 9 September by a Japanese M2-S3 booster. The Munich Kayser-Threde GmbH is responsible for the central power system for the equipment, the boosting and processing of the measurement signals, and data processing. The three experiments will concentrate on the continued development of technologies for reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. The scientific work will begin at the conclusion of the flight, when the nose cone of the capsule heats up to 2,400ï¿½C in the atmosphere. The capsule will be brought to Japan in July to prepare for launch.
