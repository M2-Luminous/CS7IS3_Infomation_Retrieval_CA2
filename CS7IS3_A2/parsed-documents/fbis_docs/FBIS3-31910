Today, Radames Munoz wished success to the new administration of President-elect Rafael Caldera. Munoz, who on Saturday was informed by Caldera that the entire high Military Command would be removed, said he was "humiliated" and announced he would resign before the inauguration of the new president on 2 February and that he would request his retirement from the Armed Forces. Nevertheless, this Sunday, as he left the last meeting of the council of ministers of interim President Ramon J. Velasquez, Munoz said "the new government must be given an opportunity to succeed. It must be helped because the success of the new government means success for the country, and the failure of the new government means the people's failure." Vice Adm. Munoz also praised the members of the new high Military Command that Caldera will appoint and denied that a crisis might break out in the government or the Armed Forces. These remarks contrast with those he made yesterday, when he said, "I am crying inside because I do not know what will happen with a precarious government that was elected by 16 percent of potential voters and that begins by striking out at an institution that is at the service of the fatherland and not political or economic interests." Munoz will be replaced as defense minister by General Manuel Montero Revette, current Army inspector general.
