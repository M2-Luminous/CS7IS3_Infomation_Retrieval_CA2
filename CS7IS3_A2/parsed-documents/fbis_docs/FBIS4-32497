The first was to demonstrate Slovak support for the Middle East peace process, although our country does not overestimate its influence on developments in this region. What was more important was to demonstrate interest in developing mutual relations, which had been stagnating after the demise of Czechoslovakia, as well as a certain enhancement of the economic dimension of our foreign policy. The Arab world is a prospective trade partner and is very interested in cooperating with our country. This was confirmed, among other things, for example, during the talks our foreign minister had with Egyptian President Mubarak and Syrian President al-Asad. It should be added in this connection that the Slovak economy has a chance of stepping up cooperation with the Palestinian autonomous regions, which will start building their infrastructure in the near future. Through Egypt or Jordan, our companies might start getting involved even in this direction.
