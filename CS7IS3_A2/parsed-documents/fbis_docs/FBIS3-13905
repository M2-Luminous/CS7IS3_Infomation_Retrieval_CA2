Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi Jawad made this announcement to the Iraqi News Agency. He said that Iraq would participate in the meeting out of its concern for the interests of oil-exporting developing countries. He added that the OPEC Ministerial Committee in charge of monitoring the oil market would discuss the deteriorating situation in the world oil market, where the average price for OPEC crude oil recently dropped to $13, an extremely low level that has not been seen since the mid- eighties. He pointed out that the current price is $8 less than the minimum price that the OPEC approved in 1990. The oil minister said that Iraq's absence for the past three and a half years, resulting from the unjust and illegitimate embargo, severely damaged the interests of oil-exporting developing countries in general. These resolutions, he said, excluded a very positive and influential force and an important balancing factor from the world oil market, pointing out that the drop in the current oil price on the world oil market and that deteriorating oil revenues of the OPEC member states are just two consequences of the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq. The oil minister also said that Iraq, which is still steadfast through its huge oil potential, its firm principled positions, its belief in the need to protect the interests of the oil-exporting developing countries, and its compliance with the principles of OPEC, was and will continue to be an influential force in the oil market and is looking forward to playing its full role positively and efficiently after the removal of the nightmare of the unjust blockade, which is being imposed by the forces that are dissatisfied by Iraq's brave positions and its confrontation of their monopolies. He added that Iraq has drawn the attention of all parties concerned in OPEC to the dangers of the deteriorating oil price that will harm the producers because it will reduce crude oil production and oil revenues. The consumer, he said, would also sustain losses because of the possibility of a halt to its oil revenues and of an imbalance in the oil market. He then explained the sound Iraqi position, and said that the oil-importing countries have begun to pursue certain polices to raise oil prices for the ultimate consumer by imposing huge taxes on consumption and using various pretexts to justify these polices, including ways to protect the environment, limit the rising global temperature, and impose energy and carbon taxes. As a result, he added, oil has become a commodity and a suitable tool to collect taxes and revenues for the treasuries of consumer countries' governments. Meanwhile, he said, the oil-exporting developing countries are suffering from a drop in oil prices and from shrinking revenues, at a time when they are more entitled than others to these revenues.
