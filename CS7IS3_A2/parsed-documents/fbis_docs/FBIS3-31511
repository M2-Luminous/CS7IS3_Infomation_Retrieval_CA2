According to Chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) Peter Weiss, the opposition is hesitating to vote out the premier because a new cabinet would not have a definite stable majority in parliament and its ideas would sometimes differ from those of Hungarian deputies. "Don't let them make excuses about us. The opposition has enough votes to recall the premier even without us. If such a proposal is made, the Hungarian coalition will vote for it," Harna said today. He added that the Hungarian parties had not formulated demands concerning a possible new government, because they had not been invited to. "No one has talked to us yet about the formation of a new cabinet," Harna said. "We do not agree with the opinion of the opposition parties that it would not be suitable for the Hungarian coalition to take part in the creation of a new government because we would be allegedly adding grist to the mill of Meciar's nationalists. We cannot agree with this, because we are just as much citizens of this state as other people," Harna said. "We are absolutely not against a vote of no confidence being made in Meciar's government. The creation of a new government is a matter for further negotiation," the deputy chairman of Egyutteles said.
