Up until now, the UN has always ruled out troops from nations bordering on the former Yugoslavia and the Balkan states taking part in the UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR). However, UNPROFOR commander, General Michael Rose, this past week asked for new reinforcements (at least 10,500 men) to help enforce the truce at Sarajevo and to strengthen the protection of the security zone. The United Kingdom, which along with France, has provided most of the some 12,000 UN troops currently in Bosnia, reportedly stands ready to send in another 1,200 soldiers, but on condition that other European states respond to General Rose's call, these same NATO sources said. London has reportedly proposed that bordering states like Italy and Turkey send troops to relieve UN troops at other hot spots around the world so they, in turn, can be sent to the Balkans. In this way, some 5,500 UN troops could be freed to go to Bosnia, according to British estimates. Meanwhile, in Rome, Italian Defense Undersecretary Antonio Patuelli, intervened in the debate Sunday by underscoring the "strong validity" of the UN's determination to keep troops of neighboring countries out the former Yugoslav territory. He said he was certain that the United Nations should and would continue to adhere to this line. Italy is already doing its part by furnishing the air bases for the UN initiatives and by taking part in the naval blockade in the lower Adriatic, Patuelli said. In Italy, as general elections move closer, the matter has become a campaign issue. General Luigi Caligaris, running for a seat in the Chamber of Deputies on the Forza Italia ticket, told a campaign rally in Trieste today that he was sharply against the sending of Italian soldiers to Bosnia as part of the UN force there, for both practical and political reasons. Should a UN decision call for Italian troops to be sent to Bosnia, it would be Italy's duty to comply, according to Mario Segni, the Pact for Italy champion. The leader of Democratic Alliance, Ferdinando Adornato concurred, saying that the indifference to Bosnia so far shown by the European states was a disgrace. However, the matter of sending in Italian troops should be carefully weighed by both Italy and the United Nations, he said, because of the difficult history of relations between Italy and the Balkan states. It is certainly an issue to be considered with great care, agreed Environment Minister Valdo Spini during a campaign rally for the Socialist Party in Ancona. These thoughts were echoed by People's Party deputy Carlo Fracanzani, chairman of the House Commission for Community Policies. He noted the risk of producing "contradictory results" for historical-political-geographical reasons. However, any such initiative should be considered only under at least four conditions, Francanzani said: 1) that the UN overrides its general principle not to send in protection forces from states neighboring on the trouble spots; 2) that all sides to the conflict give their explicit assent; 3) that the Italian contingent be given an exclusively logistical role; and 4) that any such decision not be taken by the government alone but be endorsed by the new parliament as well. "If the United Nations asks us it will be useful and opportune to deploy Italian Blue Helmets to Bosnia," said Roberto Formigoni, the coordinator for the People's Party in Lombardy today. The president of the Venezia Giulia and Dalmazia Association, Lucio Toth, Sunday said that as exiles those in his organization knew from direct experience the high level of conflict that exists among Croats, Serbs and Muslims and for this reason are very concerned about any intervention of Italian troops in Bosnia, even though "we call for a more active political role for Italy in finding a solution to the crisis." He pointed out that tens of thousands of Italians live along the Istrian-Dalmation coast and could well fall hostage to various warring forces in the field.
