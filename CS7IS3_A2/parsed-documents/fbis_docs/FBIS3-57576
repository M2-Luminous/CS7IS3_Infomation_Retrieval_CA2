Were Committees Divided `Fairly?'"] [Text] The exciting process of "the organization of the Duma's work" has unexpectedly ended in the peaceful distribution of the main posts among parliamentary factions. There has been virtually no Duma faction displeased with the "organization." Only the "12 December Union" and the "Russian Path," groups that did not manage to register on time and, consequently, were not allowed to grab their share, were mightily displeased. The other factions resolved the issue amicably by adopting as a basis Gennadiy Zyuganov's scheme: "The organizational strength of each faction should be proportionate to its numerical representation at the State Duma, taking into account, of course, the faction leaders' opinions." The communist leader even recommended that a mathematical method be used for calculating this: each elected post in parliament will be assigned a certain number of points, the points will be summed up, and the total number of State Duma seats will be divided by the sum. Thus the "price" of each seat will be calculated. Each faction, depending on its strength, may thus "buy" one post or another. As a result of further agreements, a joint "package" will be put together, which will be approved by the Duma. Presently it is hard to say if the faction leaders actually calculated anything, but the final distribution of the chamber's key offices fitted surprisingly well into Mr. Zyuganov's abstract mathematical model. For instance, only two persons were nominated to the posts of committee chairmen by the fairly numerous Agrarian Party [APR] faction (55 deputies) because the Agrarians ran out of "points" after Ivan Rybkin's election as State Duma speaker. The aggregate numbers of committee chairmen and their deputies from "Russia's Choice" and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] are equal -- the blocs hold 16 posts each. The "Choice" faction, however, comprises 78 deputies, while that of the LDPR has 63, so to strike "a fair deal" "Russia's Choice" was given the post of State Duma first deputy chairman, which was initially not foreseen, whereas the Liberal Democrats put up with "only" a deputy chairman. In all, the LDPR leads in the number of "its own" Duma committee heads -- 5 out of 23. "Russia's Choice," the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], and the "New Regional Policy" factions have three chairmen each. The Agrarians, the communists, and the "Yabloko" faction nominated two chairmen each. It should be noted, however, that the value of the committees is somewhat different. The post of Geopolitical Committee chairman (held by LDPR's Viktor Ustinov) is clearly lower in importance than the post of Security Committee chairman (held by RFCP's [Russian Federation Communist Party] Viktor Ilyukhin). Still, there have so far been no specific objections in that regard from the Liberal Democratic chief. This may be attributed to the fact that the Geopolitical Committee is one of two State Duma committees where one faction (the LDPR's in this case) has an absolute majority. The second of these committees, on agrarian matters, is, of course, dominated by the APR. There was no malicious intent, however, in APR's and LDPR's "occupying" one committee each; according to the State Duma's provisional rules of procedure, each deputy must be "assigned" to a committee, so no wonder that the Agrarians and the Liberal Democrats chose precisely those committees that suited them best according to their "area of expertise." The other factions were also given the chairmanship in committees of their "expertise:" "Yabloko," the budget and international affairs committees; "Women of Russia," on women's affairs; and the PRES, on regional policy, local authorities, and on CIS affairs. The "fair" solution of organizational matters has so far proved only one thing: the communist-nationalist bloc of State Duma deputies, although it has a relative majority, did not venture to stage an open confrontation with the democrats; while the latter, having weighed it all, did not refuse to accept their due share. Only the disgruntled radical nationalists from the "Russian Path" called the day on which the personal "package" was approved "a black day for Russian patriots."
