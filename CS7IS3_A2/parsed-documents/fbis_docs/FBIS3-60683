He said: A contact between the DPRK and the United States over the nuclear issue took place in New York on 10 December at the request of the U.S. side. As is known, at an earlier contact we had advanced a new reasonable proposal which could break the present deadlock in the DPRK-USA talks. U.S. official figures too took a positive view of it. At the recent contact, however, the U.S. side came up with a counter proposal negating ours. Although the U.S. side described its proposal as progressive, there is nothing new in it in actuality. The White House spokeswoman made this plain when she officially stated that ``there is no change in the U.S. stand.'' We showed the utmost lenience we could offer at the present stage, taking into consideration the U.S. side's expression of its readiness to accept our formula of package solution. Nevertheless, the United States stubbornly insisted on its unreasonable stand. Judging from this, we cannot but wonder if they truly intend to solve the nuclear problem, or seek to stifle our Republic on the pretext of the nuclear problem, although they say outwardly they hope for a negotiated solution of the nuclear problem. Moreover, we cannot help doubting the United States' will for talks because they are deliberately delaying a solution of the nuclear problem by persistently raising as a precondition for the third round of the DPRK-USA talks the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South of Korea, a question which has nothing to do with the talks. We made a dramatic offer to accept an inspection of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] necessary for the continuity of safeguards, an offer commensurate with our special position in which we temporarily suspended the effectuation of our withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, out of our basic stand to solve the nuclear problem fundamentally through the DPRK-USA talks. We cannot but be surprised at the fact that the United States is laying artificial obstacles again by connecting the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South, an internal affair of our nation, with the nuclear issue in a far-fetched manner at a time when the prospects of a negotiated solution of the nuclear problem are in sight. If this resulted from a U.S. policy switchover, we will have no alternative but to seriously consider our stand toward the dialogue. If the United States continue to resort to pressure and delaying tactics without showing concern for the progress of the dialogue, it is hard to expect an agreement on the formula of a package solution even if the third round of talks were held. Saying its counter proposal is based on an agreement with its allies, the United States threatened to bring the matter to the United Nations unless we accept it. We cannot but be on our guard against this ultimatum-like pressure of the U.S. In case the last opportunity of a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue should be lost because of the unreasonable act of the United States threatening our existence as today, it would be the United States that would regret this. Clear is our position. It entirely depends on the U.S. attitude whether the third round of talks are held and the nuclear problem is solved, or not in the future.
