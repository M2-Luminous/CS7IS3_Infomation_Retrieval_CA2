Ambartsumov said that spending on the construction of a parliamentary center was absolutely impossible because it would put a heavy burden on the tax-payers. Ambartsumov noted at the same time, that Gaydar's decision pointed to growing rifts in the democratic camp, which weakened its positions and gave more freedom to Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. In such a situation the president will have to increase his role of a judge standing above various political groupings, he said. He also noted that the idea of establishing a presidential party had no prospects for the moment. Plans to create such a party were announced by the president some time ago.
