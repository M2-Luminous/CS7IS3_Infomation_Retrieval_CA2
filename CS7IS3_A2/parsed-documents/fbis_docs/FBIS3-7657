"In dealing with the North Korean nuclear problem, the intentions and direction of the government have not been fully delivered to the people, so it is necessary that the information minister attend some important meetings of cabinet ministers," Yi said as security-related ministers met at the prime minister's office. "Under the past authoritarian governments, the Agency for National Security Planning led the way in explaining measures on North Korea and security, but now this is not proper under a civilian government," O said. He added that he will attend security-related meetings in the future and then provide detailed explanations on government measures and intentions on security matters.
