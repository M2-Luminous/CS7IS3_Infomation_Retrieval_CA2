ACTION: Notice of determination not to revoke countervailing duty order. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing duty order on stainless steel wire rod from Spain. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian Albright or Mercedes Fitchett, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202)482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 30, 1993, the Department published in the Federal Register (58 FR 69343) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on stainless steel wire rod from Spain (52 FR 52; January 3, 1983). Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation and no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. Within the specified time frame, we received objections from domestic interested parties to our intent to revoke this countervailing duty order. Therefore, because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met, we will not revoke the order. This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4). Dated: October 13, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26054 Filed 10&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
