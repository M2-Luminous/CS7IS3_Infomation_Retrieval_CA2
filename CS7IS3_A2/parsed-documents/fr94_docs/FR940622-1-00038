FR940622-1-00038 FR940622-1-00011 Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Part 1 [CO&hyph;8&hyph;91] RIN 1545&hyph;AQ42 Distributions of Stock and Stock Rights AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: This document proposes amendments to regulations relating to constructive distributions on preferred stock. The proposed regulations concern the treatment of stock redeemable at a premium by the issuer. Under the proposed regulations, a call premium is generally treated as giving rise to a constructive distribution only if redemption pursuant to the call provision is more likely than not to occur. The proposed amendments to the regulations also reflect 1990 amendments to section 305(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. DATES: Written comments must be received by October 24, 1994. Outlines of oral comments to be presented at the public hearing scheduled for November 14, 1994, must be received by October 24, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send submissions to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (CO&hyph;8&hyph;91), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. In the alternative, submissions may be hand delivered between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (CO&hyph;8&hyph;91), Courier's Desk, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. The hearing will be held in the IRS auditorium, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Concerning the proposed regulations, Kirsten L. Simpson, (202) 622&hyph;7790 (not a toll- free number); concerning submissions and the hearing, Carol Savage, (202) 622&hyph;8452 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on the collection of information should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224. The collection of information is in ยง1.305&hyph;5(b)(5).

The likely respondents are individuals or households and business or other for-profit institutions. The estimated total annual reporting burden: 333 hours. The estimated annual burden per respondent varies from 5 minutes to 15 minutes, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 10 minutes. The estimated number of respondents: 2000. Estimated annual frequency of responses: one. Background This document proposes amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 305 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 305(a) provides that gross income generally does not include stock dividends. Section 305(b)(4) provides an exception for certain distributions with respect to preferred stock. Section 305(c) provides that, under regulations, a difference between redemption price and issue price, or any transaction having a similar effect, shall be treated as a distribution. This provision addresses methods ``devised to give preferred stockholders the equivalent of dividends on preferred stock which are not taxable as such under present law.'' S. Rep. No. 552, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 151 (1969). For example, ``a corporation may issue preferred stock for $100 per share which pays no dividends, but which may be redeemed in 20 years for $200. The effect is the same as if the corporation distributed preferred stock equal to 5 percent of the original stock each year during the 20-year period in lieu of cash dividends.'' Id. Current ยง1.305&hyph;5(b)(1) provides that if a corporation issues preferred stock which may be redeemed after a specified period of time at a price higher than the issue price, the difference is considered a distribution of additional stock on preferred stock which is constructively received by the shareholder over the period of time during which the preferred stock cannot be called for redemption. Current ยง1.305&hyph;5(b)(2) provides that this rule does not apply to the extent that the higher redemption price represents a reasonable redemption premium. A safe harbor is provided under which a redemption premium is considered reasonable if it is not in excess of 10 percent of the issue price on stock not redeemable for five years from the date of issuance. A redemption premium that does not meet this safe harbor is considered reasonable if it is in the nature of a penalty for premature redemption and is not larger than the premiums being paid for this purpose by other issuers of similar stock at the time of issuance.
