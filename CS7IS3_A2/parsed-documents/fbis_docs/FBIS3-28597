FBIS3-28597 "dreas026__a94018" FBIS-EAS-94-026-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Poll Indicates Hosokawa Support Rate Climbing OW0302122594 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0302122594 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa registered a support rate of 74 percent, according to an emergency nationwide telephone poll conducted by MAINICHI SHIMBUN on 31 January, immediately after the political reform bills were enacted the previous day. The administration has thus recovered the high level of support it enjoyed at the outset of its inauguration last August. Political reform has been a major political task which has been tackled for six years, and failure to enact political reform bills has caused the administrations of former Prime Ministers Toshiki Kaifu and Kiichi Miyazawa to topple. Apparently, the public has reacted favorably toward the Hosokawa administration for managing to have the political reform bills enacted in the final moments of the last Diet session. Although 70 percent of the respondents supported passage of the bills, many objected to easing the ban on corporate donations, among other points. Meanwhile, the support rate for the Liberal Democratic Party dropped 9 percentage points from that registered in a poll conducted last December down to 15 percent. This is the first time the party's support rate has dropped below 20 percent. Results of the poll also showed that a record 46 percent of the respondents supported no particular party. The support rate for the Hosokawa administration registered 75 percent at the outset of the administration's inauguration -- the highest such rating ever recorded in MAINICHI SHIMBUN's polls. In a subsequent poll conducted last September (by interviewing voters), the administration's support rate dropped to 65 percent. It further dropped to 58 percent in a poll conducted in the same manner last December. Thus, the administration's support rate has shown a rapid downward trend. The latest poll shows that 74 percent of the respondents support the Hosokawa administration, while 12 percent do not support it and 13 percent have no opinion. Supporters of the administration were also asked to give reasons (more than one accepted) for their support. Of all the given reasons, 49 percent was that "the administration can be expected to come up with new policies"; 32 percent was that "Prime Minister Hosokawa has a good personality"; 30 percent was that "the administration is a coalition government which is not dominated by a single party"; and 26 percent was that "the administration can be expected to carry out political reform." The last reason ranked second in the poll conducted at the outset of the administration's inauguration. Among reasons given by nonsupporters of the administration, 45 percent was that "Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership and abilities are doubtful"; 33 percent was that "the administration cannot be expected to come up with new policies"; and 31 percent was that "there seems to be a dual power structure within the government." These three negative reasons have each increased by 5-6 percentage points over the initial poll last August. The fourth reason, at 30 percent, was that "the government is unstable because it is a coalition." This last reason has dropped by 13 percentage points over the initial poll.
