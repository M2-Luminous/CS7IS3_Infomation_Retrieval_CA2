Traffic emissions are ``major challenges'' to the Government's attempts to reduce climate change and to improve air quality in cities. An increase in vehicles will damage nature sites and create unacceptable noise levels. The draft transport chapter of the UK Strategy for Sustainable Development is frank about the negative effects of the projected doubling of traffic growth over the next 25 years. But it is likely to disappoint environmentalists because it contains no new transport policies to curb road traffic or promote public transport. The document, drawn up as Britain's contribution to carrying forward the aims of the Rio Earth summit, warns that travel costs ``may have to rise further to reflect environmental costs and to affect the future demand for transport.'' But it says there will be public resistance to this. The near-final draft of the report, to be launched by the Prime Minister next week, shows that Mr. MacGregor, Transport Secretary, and Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary, disagreed over the need to accommodate traffic growth. Amendments and deletions by Mr. MacGregor show the Transport Department at pains to excuse and justify its policy of building roads to meet demand. There remain some strong statements, such as: ``It is clear that traffic growth in certain parts of the country, and on certain assumptions, would produce unacceptable economic and environmental consequences.'' It is the lack of any conclusions which measure up to this striking analysis of the problems posed by traffic growth that is likely to invite criticism on Tuesday when the strategy -- which covers every area of Government from energy to agriculture -- is launched. The strategy points out that technical innovations in engines, catalysts and fuels will not be enough to temper the increase in pollution. It says the benefits of catalytic converters will be short-lived as traffic growth overcomes initial gains in air quality. It says the Government is also likely to have to take action to limit carcinogenic substances in petrol such as benzene. It also points out that transport creates water pollution, a mountain of 20-30 million used tyres each year and that road building, even at present rates, accounts for 32 percent of the sand and gravel quarried. The document's conclusion is a call for more public information, further research and for local authorities to develop clear environmental targets and criteria. Environmentalists said the emerging evidence of what the environmental strategy contains showed a chance to change policies into the next century had been thrown away. Miss Fiona Weir, of Friends of the Earth, said: ``The Government has admitted that traffic growth is a massive problem but then they throw their hands up in the air when it comes to doing anything about it.''
