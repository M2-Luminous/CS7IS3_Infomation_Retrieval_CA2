Azmuko; UDC 543.422.8] [Abstract] Chemical analysis of materials by the x-ray fluorescence method, such an analysis being based on the relation between intensity I of fluorescence and the chemical composition C of the test specimen. The original version was trial analysis with use of a model without calibrating specimens (J. Criss, L. Birks; ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY, Vol. 40 No. 7, 1968). This simple procedure has been later found to be inadequate (R. Tertian; X-RAY SPECTROMETRY, Vol. 15 No. 3, 1986), inasmuch as no one mathematical model would simulate the reflection pattern accurately enough under any circumstances. One of the proposed modifications of this method was to determine the instrument errors and to reconcile experimental data with theory (R. Tertian; X-RAY SPECTROMETRY, Vol. 17 No. 3, 1988), but this required use of standard specimens and complicated the procedure. The method of fundamental parameters was proposed next, first on the conventional premise that determining the entire composition would require a preliminary separate determination of the lighter elements by some other method. Simpler variants of this method, especially effective in partial determinations, are empirical ones using coherent and noncoherent reflection of incident light by the analyzed specimen. Another variant of this method is approximating the equation I[.sub]i[/]= C[.sub]i[/] (i= 1,2,... constituent chemical elements in the material) by expanding the function C[.sub]i[/]/I[.sub]i[/] into a Taylor series: C[.sub]i[/]= C[.sub]i[/]*(1 + _s_ _a_[.sub]ij[/]'_D_C[.sub]j[/], where C[.sub]i[/]*= f(I[.sub]i[/] and _D_C[.sub]j[/]= C[.sub]j[/]- C[.sub]j,c[/] (C[.sub]j[/], C[.sub]j,c[/]- concentration of j-th significant element in analyzed specimen and in reference specimen respectively, _a_[.sub]ij[/]'- differential coefficient characterizing influence of element j on the intensity of fluorescence of i-th element). Several mathematical models have been proposed for implementation of this method, each with a generally different value of each coefficient _a_[.sub]ij[/] and different expression for _a_[.sub]ij[/]*= _a_[.sub]ij[/]+ _D__a_[.sub]ij[/] but all taking into account, though also differently, the dependence of _a_[.sub]ij[/] on C and on the analyzer geometry. Listed are six of them: 1) Claisse-Quintin, 2) Tertian, 3) Lachance-Claisse, 4) Rassberry-Heinrich, 5) Broll-Tertian, 6) Rousseau. Tables 1; references 160.
