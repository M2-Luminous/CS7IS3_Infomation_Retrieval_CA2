FBIS3-52968 "drnes007dd_94005" FBIS-NES-94-007 Document Type:Daily Report 11 Jan 1994 Palestinian Affairs Fatah Hawks Oppose `Nonessential' Use of Arms TA1001162694 Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew 10 Jan 94 p 2 TA1001162694 Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR Language: Hebrew Article Type:BFN [ITIM Report] [Text] Shots were fired in the early evening yesterday at an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] outpost in Rafah's Tall Sultan neighborhood, but did not cause either casualties or damage. The soldiers returned fire. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine took responsibility for the attempted attack and claimed that several soldiers were wounded. But, to repeat, there were no casualties. A Fatah Hawks leaflet disseminated yesterday in the Gaza Strip called for an end to use of arms when nonessential. The leaflet threatened to confiscate the weapons and punish the perpetrators. The cases referred to are shots fired during festivities and taking money from residents under threat of arms while pretending to belong to Fatah or other organizations. During festivities marking Fatah's establishment 10 days ago wanted men and residents fired in the air out of happiness. At least five armed terrorists were later arrested and all were freed after senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers intervened. Arab sources note that groups of criminals are roaming around pretending to be wanted men and are demanding "taxes" from shopkeepers and wealthy people in the Strip. In some cases, wanted men are also making a living that way.
