FBIS4-59516 "drnes094_j_94008" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Roundup of 13-16 May Clashes in North, South Roundup of 13-16 May Clashes in North, South Sanaa: Advances on al-Dali'-al-'Anad Axis JN1405064794 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0430 GMT 14 May 94 JN1405064794 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Statement by a Defense Ministry "official source"; place and date not given] [Text] With support and help from God, the heroes of our valiant Armed Forces continued their confrontation of the forces of apostasy and secession in various axes and sectors and foiled all the hostile, treacherous goals of the criminal secessionist elements in the Socialist Party leadership and inflicted on them heavy losses in weapons, equipment, and vehicles and forced the deceived units to flee and surrender. In the al-Dali' sector, the forces managed to proceed with steady steps forward. Our valiant, proud Armed Forces were able to return the center of Musaymir in Lahij Governorate to constitutional legitimacy. On the Abyan-Aden axis, the forces of unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy were able to score tangible progress and chased the forces of the secessionist rebellious elements in the Aden garrison and forced them to retreat after inflicting heavy losses on them. In the al-Mahfid District, units from the valiant Armed Forces were able to attack the forces of apostasy and secession from the Taysir Brigade and from the command of the Central Axis and seized 18 tanks, four 130-mm armored vehicles, one 122 [mm] Howitzer, one 85-mm gun as well as quantities of military ammunition and vehicles. The forces of apostasy and secession from the Taysir Brigade and from the command of the Central Axis retreated to (al-Naqabah) in the Shabwah Governorate. This prompts us in this statement to underline the call of tolerance, sincere brotherhood, and the single affiliation to all comrades in arms in the military units that are still under the hegemony and tyranny of the secessionist, rebellious forces. We urge them to benefit from all the clear practical lessons that have taken place and are taking place in the fields of confrontation between the forces of evil, rebellion, and secession -- which ignited the war to serve their own selfish and detestable, suppressive party ambitions in order to fragment the homeland and rebel against constitutional legitimacy -- and the forces of good, right, and peace which rushed to defend unity and democracy and to protect the national sanctities, at the top of which is constitutional legitimacy, and to ensure respect for the Constitution, law, and the constitutional institutions, since this is a sacred duty that must be fulfilled by every soldier, noncommissioned officer [NCO], and officer of the armed and security forces; and by every citizen in any position. This makes us pin hopes on all the soldiers, NCO's, and officers, who are more able to reject the orders of the secessionist elements and return to the trenches of legitimacy and defend Yemeni unity because so doing is much easier than making themselves and their colleague face death and defeat. He who stands against the people's will, brings a rebellious force against the unity of the homeland, or seeks to fragment it and the defenseless citizens will be a loser. O ye who believe; if you will aid the cause of God, he will aid you, and plant your feet firmly. [Koranic verse]
