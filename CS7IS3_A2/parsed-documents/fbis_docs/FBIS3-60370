The European Commission, which took up the case last May at the request of Denmark, has accepted the conclusions of a majority of experts who have been consulted on the subject, that neither the reactors, nor the nuclear heads with which its stock of torpedoes is armed, pose any threat to the environment under present circumstances, whereas any attempt to salvage the submarine could have unpredictable consequences. In confirming the findings of over a hundred experts in the field of submerged nuclear waste, the group of specialists from the European Union and Norway who met recently under the auspices of the Commission's Joint Research Centre expressed the judgement that even assuming the most pessimistic scenario the Komsomolets did not appear to constitute a significant pollution risk. They agreed that radiological monitoring, studies on sea-current variations, or indeed a thoroughgoing analysis of the risks involved could be carried out if the need subsequently arose. On the other hand, the specialists warned that any hasty moves would be more likely to worsen than to remedy the situation, a far from unwarranted remark, given that Moscow has been trying to obtain authorisation to salvage the wreck since 1989. The Rubin company, which built the submarine, actually signed a contract with Dutch recovery experts, on behalf of the Russian authorities, but the Dutch firm later reckoned that the hull was too extensively damaged and abandoned plans for a refloat operation. Other possible solutions have been mooted and rejected: burying the sub in sediment, coating it in resin, dissecting it and salvaging the titanium hulls, etc. A confidential memorandum, confirmed by French and Norwegian military experts, contains the view that the Russians were particularly anxious to recover the torpedoes and their nuclear warheads, thereby incidentally eliminating the risk of pollution from the plutonium contained in the head cones. Given that this submarine is of an extremely advanced design, and that the torpedoes are also the result of the latest development, the memorandum concludes that the then Soviet authorities intended either to recover their equipment, or at least to prevent anyone else from getting hold of it. This thesis is strongly supported by Moscow's initial moves to refloat and transport the Komsomolets in the name of the former Soviet state, and the constant presence of Russian ships in the area of the wreck.
