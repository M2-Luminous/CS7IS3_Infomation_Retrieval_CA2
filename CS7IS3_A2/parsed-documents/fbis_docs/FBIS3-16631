This shows that it is not screened off from its opponents by an "iron curtain of secrecy" even if they do say unpleasant things to the occupants of the "Smolensk Square skyscraper [Russian Foreign Ministry Building]." On this occasion the session was dedicated to the topical theme of "Problems of the formation of a Pan-European security system and relations between Russia and NATO." The posing of this problem by the Russian Foreign Ministry, it seems, is due to the existence of different conceptual approaches both in the East and the West to the formation of a pan-European security system in the context of the possible expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance. Russian international affairs experts, like their Western counterparts, have differing approaches to the problem of mutual relations between Russia and NATO. Thus the Foreign Ministry, it seems, has decided to "synchronize watches" and listen to the informed opinion of leading representatives of Russian political science and well-known Russian deputies engaged on foreign policy questions. As usual the council session was addressed by A. Kozyrev, a fact which undoubtedly lent significance to the theme under discussion. In particular, the foreign minister advocated that the military, military-political, and military-industrial machines created in the period of confrontation be reformed into instruments of stability, security, and even cooperation between East and West. This is viewed as a real and practical path toward ensuring that the former enemies not only see one another as friends and allies but also arrive at the idea of the deepening and institutionalization of cooperation with NATO, which has been embodied in the concept "Partnership for Peace." Today, Russia is close to signing the corresponding agreements but, as the head of the Russian foreign policy department hinted, that will take at least 2-3 years. It emerges from the minister's speech that both he and his colleagues have not lost faith in the qualitative strengthening of the CSCE during the new all-European summit in December this year. But that will require resolute actions in the security sphere within the framework of NATO, the EU, the Western European Union, and the CIS. Such an approach is most unlike Russia's diktat or veto toward the states of central and Eastern Europe and NATO. It is also symptomatic that the head of Russian diplomacy could not ignore the "Zhirinovskiy factor." He uncompromisingly rejected the attempts by certain circles in the West and in central and Eastern Europe to exploit that factor and also the intentions to attribute an enemy image to Russia because the artificially created thesis of the Russian threat prevents people from seeing the real security problems. It was stressed in particular that "Partnership for Peace" is not the finished article but merely a pattern for military-political cooperation. Victory in the Cold War, the minister stated, went not to NATO's military machine but to the democratic principles of the CSCE. This assessment of the CSCE's role deserves the utmost attention although different opinions exist in certain circles in the West, as is well known. Clearly, the different approaches should not lead to the division of Europe into opposing alliances and spheres of influence. This speech was marked by its straightforwardness. A. Kozyrev did not resort to trickery and honestly set out the Russian position on the formation of a security system in Europe. But Moscow's efforts alone will clearly not be enough. There must be a cooperative approach from other states and the world community. A. Kozyrev's frank discussion with W. Christopher, his U.S. counterpart, in Vladivostok will make it clear whether such an approach is forthcoming. Predictably enough, the minister's speech provoked a keen debate, which revealed quite a wide spread of opinions, ranging from agreement to accept the invitation to share NATO's "Partnership for Peace" concept and work with NATO on parallel courses, on the one hand, to pessimistic predictions on the idea of deepening cooperation with NATO on the other. But even the supporters of the first approach, and they formed the majority, had to acknowledge that although the North Atlantic bloc remains an important factor in the preservation of military-political stability in Europe it is nevertheless a rudiment of the Cold War and thus needs to be transformed itself. One path for the alliance's evolution is to merge into the pan-European security structure, first and foremost under the auspices of the CSCE and the United Nations. But even here the viewpoints differed. Some political scientists did not rate highly the potential of the CSCE as a universal pan-European forum. The UN's rating was higher. There were also appeals to revive the UN military staff committee for the leadership of international peacemaking operations. On the whole there were quite a few well argued appeals to the effect that broader account should be taken of the opinion of the people's masses when carrying out various foreign policy actions. For example, a warning was expressed that the unification of the central and East European countries and NATO will upset the existing balance of security and lead to a growth in nationalist feelings within Russian society. The reasons: The old stereotyped perceptions of the West and NATO are still strong in Russia. It was also noted that Russia must reinforce its image as a democratic state which enjoys the reputation of being a reliable partner and must destroy the anti-Russian psychological complex which is entrenched in Eastern Europe by means of establishing relations of a new type based on trust and good-neighborliness. A special place in the discussion was occupied by questions of defining the optimum forms of combining national priorities and collective principles in the formation of the pan-European security system which takes into account Russia's specific interests in European affairs. It was pointed out that cooperation between Russia and NATO must be carried out on a mutually beneficial and equitable basis and the Russian "Partnership" program must correspond as much as possible to the vital interests of our national security. It was proposed that contacts with NATO be strengthened by the signing of agreements on various aspects of international security, as happened in the days of the former USSR, and by building up bilateral cooperation with leading Western states. Considerable attention was paid to the problems of involving our CIS partners in the efforts aimed at forming a European security system and to the effect that Russia's involvement in the "Partnership" program would have on centripetal processes within the Commonwealth itself. The idea was expressed that by joining NATO Russia will not lose its leading role in the CIS. Thus, prior to unification there should be a preliminary consultation with the CIS members. It was also said that Russia must take a more active part in resolving CIS problems, which would strengthen its role as guarantor on the territory of the CIS. But for that, as one speaker figuratively put it, it is necessary "not to bark but to bite." In other words, less talk, more action. Individual political scientists put forward highly disturbing predictions about the future character of the development of our relations with China and other eastern neighbors after Russia affiliates to the "Partnership" concept. It was also said that people should "come back down to earth" and see that the development of events in Europe is being formed under the influence of geopolitical interests which do not presuppose Russia's smooth entry into Europe. Moreover, there is a clear tendency toward "forcing" Russian out of the European area. NATO's expansion by means of the countries of central and Eastern Europe will inevitably lead to the isolation and weakening of Russia. There were proposals on measures to curb the process of the admission of the central and Eastern European countries into NATO. For that, it was said, Russia should constantly remind people of its desire to become a full-fledged member of NATO. But since that is hardly likely to happen the Eastward expansion of the alliance will automatically stop. Some of the political scientists tended to the view that Russia's affiliation to the "Partnership for Peace" concept must be carried out circumspectly because this could harm the Russian military-industrial complex and lead to the loss of arms sales markets. They spoke skeptically about Russia's participation in the transformation of the North Atlantic alliance because "we are the guests there, not the hosts." On the whole the Foreign Policy Council session confirmed the importance of a joint and constructive exchange of opinions among diplomats, scientists, parliamentarians, and other representatives of political and public circles on the most topical problems of Russian foreign policy. It may be said without exaggeration that the discussion was extraordinarily useful and was directly conducive to achieving a democratic consensus on approaches to current international problems.
