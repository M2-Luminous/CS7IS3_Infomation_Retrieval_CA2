(c) Temporary authorizations of operation not to exceed 180 days may be granted under the standards of Section 309(f) of the Communications Act where extraordinary circumstances so require. Extensions of the temporary authorization for a period of 180 days each may also be granted, but the applicant bears a heavy burden to show that extraordinary circumstances warrant such an extension. (d) In cases of emergency found by the Commission, involving danger to life or property or due to damage of equipment, or during a national emergency proclaimed by the president or declared by the Congress or during the continuance of any war in which the United States is engaged and when such action is necessary for the national defense or safety or otherwise in furtherance of the war effort, or in cases of emergency where the Commission finds that it would not be feasible to secure renewal applications from existing licensees or otherwise to follow normal licensing procedure, the Commission will grant radio station authorizations and station licenses, or modifications or renewals thereof, during the emergency found by the Commission or during the continuance of any such national emergency or war, as special temporary licenses, only for the period of emergency or war requiring such action, without the filing of formal applications. §24.826 Receipt of application; Applications in the broadband Personal Communications Services filed on FCC Form 175 and other applications in the broadband Personal Communications Services. (a) All applications for the initial provision of broadband PCS must be submitted on FCC Forms 175 and 175&hyph;S. Mutually exclusive initial applications in the broadband Personal Communications Services are subject to competitive bidding. FCC Form 401 (``Application for New or Modified Common Carrier Radio Station Under Part 22'') must be submitted by each winning bidder for each broadband PCS license for which application was made on FCC Form 175. In the event that mutual exclusivity does not exist between applicants for a broadband PCS license that have filed FCC Form 175, the sole applicant will be required to file FCC Form 401. The aforementioned Forms 175, 175&hyph;S, and 401 are subject to the provisions of 47 CFR Part 1, Subpart Q (``Competitive Bidding Proceedings'') and Subpart H of this Part. Blanket licenses are granted for each market frequency block. Applications for individual sites are not needed and will not be accepted. See §24.11. (b) Applications received for filing are given a file number. The assignment of a file number to an application is merely for administrative convenience and does not indicate the acceptance of the application for filing and processing. Such assignment of a file number will not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of the application if it is found to be not in accordance with the Commission's Rules. (c) Acceptance of an application for filing merely means that it has been the subject of a preliminary review as to completeness. Such acceptance will not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of the application if it is found to be defective or not in accordance with the Commission's rules. ( See §24.813 for additional information concerning the filing of applications.) §24.827 Public notice period. (a) At regular intervals, the Commission will issue a public notice listing: (1) The acceptance for filing of all applications and major amendments thereto; (2) Significant Commission actions concerning applications listed as acceptable for filing; (3) Information which the Commission in its discretion believes of public significance.
