FR940721-0-00073 FR940721-0-00014 As discussed above, several foreign vehicle manufacturers requested an exclusion from the statutory requirement to specify the percentage parts content originating from major sources of foreign content. Volkswagen stated that its recommendation for such an exclusion is ``consistent with the intent of the original bill,'' but recognized that the statutory requirement to list the percentage parts content originating from major sources of foreign content was added by the House/Senate Conference Committee. Volkswagen argued that ``the Committee did not appear to have assigned great importance to the inclusion of foreign sourced parts percentages.'' NHTSA notes that it must implement a statute as finally passed by the Congress, and not an earlier version that was not passed. Moreover, the agency must follow the plain meaning of a statute and cannot ignore express statutory requirements based on a belief that a Congressional committee may not have assigned great importance to a particular requirement. The committee, and ultimately the Congress, thought the requirement at issue was important enough to pass into law. Congress decided that prospective purchasers should know the percentage parts content that originated from major sources of foreign content. This particular requirement primarily applies to foreign vehicles, since domestic vehicles are less likely to have major sources of foreign content. Yet, the exclusions recommended by the foreign manufacturers would permit a large percentage of foreign vehicles to labeled without this information. Such exclusions cannot be considered de minimis. The agency does observe that the additional flexibility it is providing with respect to how country of origin is determined for purposes of item 2 of the label should help reduce manufacturer costs in this area. G. Multi-Stage Manufacturers and Small Businesses NHTSA proposed to exclude multi-stage manufacturers of ``carlines'' of fewer than 1,000 vehicles from providing items 1 and 2 of the label (the two items that are determined on a carline basis). However, these manufacturers would be required to provide items 3, 4 and 5 of the label. Similarly, the agency proposed to apply the same limited requirements to businesses that produce a total of fewer than 1,000 passenger motor vehicles for sale in the United States annually. The agency explained that the concept of carline is largely meaningless for many multi-stage manufacturers. Many of the vehicles made in the multi-stage process are highly specialized, and are often built to order. A ``carline'' in this instance could consist of only several vehicles. The agency stated that it did not believe that Congress had this situation in mind when it defined carline. Moreover, to the extent that vehicles are built to order, prospective purchasers may not be able to inspect a content label prior to making a purchase decision. NHTSA also stated in the NPRM that it believes that the same arguments made concerning multi-stage manufacturers, regarding carlines with a minimal number a vehicles produced annually, can be made in a discussion of small businesses. In its discussion of multi-stage vehicles, the agency noted that alterers are not covered by section 210 for reasons similar to those discussed above concerning dealer and port-installed options. Alterers modify completed vehicles, after they have left the manufacturer's final assembly point. The parts they use are not considered equipment by section 210 of the Cost Savings Act, because they are never shipped to the final assembly point. Their modifications cannot affect carline-basis calculations made before the start of the model year, and cannot be known in advance of the model year by the manufacturer. NTEA stated that it agrees with agency's tentative determination that the label on vehicles produced in multiple stages should differ from the label on mass produced vehicles. It also stated that it is confident the agency has authority under the Labeling Act to promulgate different rules, and believes the Act could be interpreted to allow even a full exclusion for multi-stage vehicles. NTEA stated that requiring small business multi-stage manufacturers to calculate U.S./Canadian versus foreign percentages would be extremely burdensome in both an economic and practical sense as they would need to do so on a per vehicle basis. That organization added that any ancillary reporting or recordkeeping requirements would also need to be done on a per vehicle basis. NTEA noted that the proposed multi-stage rules would require information on final assembly point and place of manufacture of the engine and transmission. That commenter stated that this would allow a consumer to know where the vehicle was built and whether the most valuable individual mechanical components, the engine and transmission, are of foreign or domestic origin. NTEA also stated that the burden on small business multi-stage manufacturers would be minimal. AIAM stated that it applauds NHTSA's recognition of providing some regulatory relief to small automotive manufacturers. It suggested that the agency expand the proposed exclusion for small manufacturers from fewer than 1,000 vehicles to fewer than 2,500 vehicles. That organization stated that this would provide relief from the costly burdens the Act imposes on additional small manufacturers without depriving consumers of information deemed necessary by the Act. Coachmen stated that the ``concessions'' made in the NPRM fall far short of what was requested by RVIA in commenting on the request for comments. Coachmen argued that the proposed requirements would impose an undue and costly and unnecessary burden on Coachmen. It recommended that the final rule should exclude carlines of less than 20,000 per year, exclude recreation vehicle manufacturers and van converters, or, as a less desirable alternative, provide simplified and less costly compliance recordkeeping and reporting requirements based on using the information provided solely by the original vehicle manufacturer on a pass through basis. Coachmen stated that it has several divisions, some of which are final stage manufacturers and others van converters. It stated that the process of documenting and re-computing percentage of domestic content of vehicles would require large amounts of paperwork, additional labor and possible delays in shipments, but result in a minuscule change in the original vehicle manufacturer's domestic content.
