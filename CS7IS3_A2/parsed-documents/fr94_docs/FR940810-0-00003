FR940810-0-00003 FR940810-0-00001 On the employee's return to the lower grade, the agency must set pay using GS pay setting rules. The agency may restore the employee's rate of basic pay to what it would have been had there never been a temporary promotion (including any within-grade or merit increases that would have been granted at the lower grade). Also, if permitted by its own policies, the agency may instead set pay at a higher rate using the highest previous rate under §531.203(d). In either pay-setting procedure, if the recomputed rate of basic pay falls between steps of a GS grade or a special salary rate schedule, the rate of basic pay must be set at the next higher step within the lower grade. To clarify this policy, OPM has added a new paragraph entitled, ``expiration or termination of temporary promotions '' (see §531.204(c)). This replaces OPM guidance that was previously published in Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supplement 990&hyph;2, Book 531, S4&hyph;5d. That guidance has been abolished by the sunset of the FPM. 2. Setting pay on loss of GM status through voluntary reduction in grade. Summary of Comments: It was called to our attention that the regulation on setting pay on loss of GM status implies that an employee retains pay if he or she is voluntarily reduced in grade (see redesignated 5 CFR 531.204(e)). Discussion and Change: A new paragraph has been added to clarify that the provisions of §531.204(e) (1) through (4) do not apply when an employee loses GM status as a result of a reduction in grade at the employee's request (see §531.204(f)(3)). Rather, an agency may set pay at the lowest step of the lower grade or at a higher step in the lower grade under its policies for applying the maximum payable rate rules. 3. Creditable service in a waiting period for a within-grade-increase when an employee is in a non-pay status. Summary of Comments: One agency proposed simplifying regulatory text by combining separate language for GS and GM employees. Discussion and Change: OPM is removing unnecessary references to steps, next higher rate within the grade, and GM employee in §531.406(b)(2) (i)&hyph;(iii) to be consistent with the language used to establish the length of waiting periods in §531.405. 4. The impact of final locality pay regulations on PMRS termination regulations. Summary of Comments: One agency commented that the revised definitions in §§531.101 and 531.301 of the interim regulations are no longer current since the definitions were subsequently revised again by the final regulations implementing locality pay adjustments. Discussion and Change: This comment is partially correct. The current definition of scheduled annual rate of pay in §§531.101 and 531.301 is the definition as revised in the locality pay regulations published in the Federal Register on December 30, 1993 (58 FR 69169). However, the current definition of employee in §531.101 is the definition as revised in the interim PMRS termination regulations. There is no change, except that a statutory reference in the employee definition in §531.101 is clarified by inserting ``of title 5.'' Editorial Revisions to Regulations References to the PMRS Termination Act in §§530.306(b)(2), 531.401(d), and 531.502 are clarified by replacing ``Public Law 103&hyph;89'' with ``the Performance Management and Recognition System Termination Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;89).'' References to GM employee in §§531.203(c)(2) and 531.205(a)(2)(i) are clarified by inserting the citation, ``(as defined in §531.202).'' Also, minor editorial changes are being made to correct errors or clarify text at §§531.204(e)(1), 531.205(a)(2) (ii) through (iv), 531.403, 531.405(a) (1) and (2), and 536.308 (a) and (b). Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they apply only to Federal agencies and employees.
