The volume of industrial output during the first four months of the year was 0.7 percent lower compared with the same period last year; this figure was 3 percent in organizations with 25 and more employees. According to estimates, output in smaller organizations was higher in April and has been since the beginning of the year, by almost one-quarter. The production of goods was higher, in particular, in the paper and printing industry and in publishing activity, by 15.4 percent; in oil refining, by 9.3 percent; and in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, by 3.3 percent. Construction output was 0.3 percent higher in April; it was 6.5 percent higher for the first four months of the year compared with the same period of 1993. During the first four months, output rose by 11.4 percent in organizations with fewer than 25 employees and among individual businessmen. The number of employees in enterprises with 25 and more employees in industry was 5.5 percent lower during the first four months compared with the same period last year; this figure was 1.4 percent higher in construction. The average monthly wage during the aforementioned period rose to 6,185 korunas [Kc] (by 13.7 percent) in industry and to Kc6,787 (by 13.5 percent) in construction. The volume of cargo traffic declined in April in all types of traffic compared with last April. Compared with the January-to-April period last year, during the first four months of this year, 3.2 percent more goods were conveyed by public road haulage; 15.1 percent fewer goods were conveyed by railroad; and 25.2 percent fewer goods were conveyed by river. During the first four months of 1994, sales of slaughter cattle fell by 9 percent, of slaughter hogs by 4.4 percent, of slaughter poultry by 27.6 percent, of milk by 6.6 percent, and of eggs by 4.8 percent compared with the same period last year.

The number of unplaced job seekers declined further in April to 171,900 and was 13,400 lower than at the end of last year. Retail sales in the January-to-April period amounted to Kc131 billion and were 15.2 percent higher than during the same period last year. Expressed in physical volume, they increased by 6.5 percent. The overall volume of exports during the first four months amounted to Kc117 billion in franco prices and was 6.5 percent lower than in the January-to-April period last year. The decline in exports to Slovakia by Kc7.5 billion--that is, by 27.9 percent--had a decisive influence on the reduction in exports. Imports amounted to Kc118.5 billion and were 10.9 percent more than last year; at the same time, imports from Slovakia fell by 7.1 percent. So, the balance of trade ended with a deficit of Kc1.5 billion. With the exception of the countries of the former Soviet Union (a deficit of Kc10.1 billion), there was a surplus with all territories.
