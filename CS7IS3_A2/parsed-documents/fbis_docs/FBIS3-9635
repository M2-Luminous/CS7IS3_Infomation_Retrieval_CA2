The agreement, which on the U.S. part was signed by Defense Secretary William Perry, provides for regular meetings at the level of chiefs of staff and of military delegations, the possibility of the Polish military participating in U.S. training sessions, and U.S. support for modernization of the Polish Armed Forces. The agreement also provides for assistance to Poland in preparing our Army for cooperation with the Armed Forces of the NATO countries. After signing the declaration on cooperation, Minister Kolodziejczyk stated that the declaration expresses a full openness to cooperation and a new approach to Poland's role and place. From among the visit's specific results, Piotr Kolodziejczyk mentioned the establishment of a Polish-U.S. technical commission, whose goal is to assist with the Polish Army's modernization and also with restructuring the Polish defense industry. Defense Secretary William Perry accepted an invitation to pay a visit to Poland. No specific date for joint Polish-U.S. military exercises has been set, but General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with whom Kolodziejczyk had a meeting at the end of his U.S. visit, agreed to the minister's suggestion that they take place before the end of the year and that some U.S. troops participate in the Polish Army's maneuvers that had been planned earlier. Minister Kolodziejczyk's talks on Capitol Hill have already resulted in first reactions. During a Senate debate, Senator Mitch McConnell spoke in favor of making more specific the criteria for participation by countries of the East in the "Partnership for Peace" program. McConnell also submitted a proposal for an amendment to a draft of a Senate bill concerning the appropriation of resources for military goals. The amendment contains the following passage: "The Unites States shall oppose, by applying the appropriate means, any attempts by the Russian Federation aimed at intimidation, using military force or economic blackmail, with the goal of restitution of spheres of influence on the territory of the former Soviet Republics, in the Baltic states, and in Central and East Europe." When asked about his Washington meetings, Minister Kolodziejczyk replied that he is so optimistic that he is "afraid to push my luck." Concerning the sale of Polish helicopters to Burma, which was reported by news agencies in the morning, he said only that the matter has been cleared up. Poland was reported to have sold helicopters to Burma, where human rights are violated. --Of the 13 countries that signed the so-called framework agreement with NATO concerning "Partnership for Peace," Poland was the first to initiate consultations with NATO regarding the program's specific contents. There are predictions that consultations concerning the so-called document of presentation will last several weeks.
