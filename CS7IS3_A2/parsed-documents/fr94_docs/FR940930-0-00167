FR940930-0-00167 FR940930-0-00028 EPA considered allowing the post-installation test to be alternately conducted by the purchaser to provide additional flexibility for those manufacturers who may not have access to inspection and maintenance test facilities. Upon further evaluation of this option, EPA believes that it is unworkable given that it would create a situation where the requirements for producing a certified vehicle would not be complete until after the manufacturer transferred the title of the converted vehicle to the ultimate purchaser. To be eligible as a CFV, each vehicle emission control information label 38 must state that it is a clean fuel vehicle (indicating that a post-installation test was performed as required). The transfer of the vehicle title before all of the criteria for certification of the converted vehicles are met would raise doubts as to the validity of such a label given that a vehicle purchaser could fail to perform the required test. 38 See 40 CFR 86.085&hyph;35 regarding additional labeling requirements. Public comment largely supported the use of a CO emissions test such as that discussed in the NPRM for the post-installation emission evaluation. Commenters agreed that the approach proposed by EPA would be useful in uncovering gross installation errors and would provide an additional level of assurance that CFV emission standards will be met in-use. EPA believes that the simple requirements of such a CO emissions test will fulfill the goal of uncovering gross installation errors without imposing a significant burden on small-volume manufacturers. 39 It should be noted that this test is intended as a screening mechanism only and may not be as discriminating of emissions levels as tests performed for inspection and maintenance purposes or a full Federal Test Procedure. 39 ibid. Two options will be available to satisfy the post-installation test requirement. Under both options, a separate test would be required for dual-fuel vehicles for each fuel on which the converted vehicle is capable of operating. Under the first option, a CO emissions test could be performed using the same equipment, procedure, and pass/fail criteria as that used under the inspection and maintenance testing program in the area where the testing is conducted. This test could be performed at an official inspection and maintenance facility, by the manufacturer, or by the manufacturer's contractor. If pass/fail criteria specific to the converted vehicle's operation on alternative fuel are not available the pass/fail criteria applicable to the vehicle's operation on gasoline prior to conversion will be used. In cases where inspection and maintenance testing procedures are not available the second post-installation testing option described below must be used. The second post-installation testing option may also be used in areas where inspection and maintenance facilities are available at the manufacturer's discretion. In the NPRM EPA discussed adopting a single-speed idle test per 40 CFR 85.2212 as an alternative to the inspection and maintenance testing facilities procedure described above. Since the publication of the NPRM, EPA has further evaluated the capabilities and limitations of potential post-installation test procedures and has determined that measuring CO emissions on an existing two-speed idle test 40 would provide greater assurance of properly identifying gross installation errors while limiting the potential of false failures as compared to a single-step idle test. EPA believes that the minor change from a single-speed to a two-speed idle test will not add significantly to the cost and difficulty of post-installation testing. 41 The California Air Resources Board's regulation of alternative fuel retrofit systems also requires that a two-speed idle test be performed as part of a post-installation vehicle evaluation. 42 For these reasons, EPA is adopting the two-speed idle test of CO emissions as the required post-installation test when an inspection and maintenance test procedure is not available. 40 The two-speed idle test (40 CFR 85.2215, ``EPA 91'') is described in the Short Test Emission Regulations Final Rule, 58 FR 58405&hyph;58407. 41 The two-speed idle test requires a tachometer and a special multiple emission measurement computer software algorithm that are not required for the single-speed idle test. However, many emissions testing facilities will already have access to such equipment and EPA believes the cost to those who may need to acquire the additional equipment to be less than $300. 42 Title 13, California Code of Regulations, Sections 2030 and 2031. A two-speed idle test is required to be performed on the certification vehicle during certification testing to establish reference values (at idle and 2500 rpm) against which post-installation test results may be compared. EPA considered requiring that each vehicle's post-installation test CO emissions measurement be below the reference value established at the time of certification plus 20 percent of the reference value. The comment received from the public on the post-installation test pass/fail criteria indicated that the CO emissions of some CFVs may be so low as to make the use of a cut point at this level impractical given the measurement accuracy of the test. One commenter suggested an alternative cut point of the CO certification reference value plus 0.4 percent CO by volume.
