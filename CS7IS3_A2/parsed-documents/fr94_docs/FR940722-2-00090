FR940722-2-00090 FR940722-2-00058 Final Decision and Order Based upon a preponderance of the evidence resulting from an examination of the complete application, the supporting documentation, and the OSHA staff finding including the on-site report, OSHA finds that Wyle Laboratories has met the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 to be recognized by OSHA as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory to test and certify certain equipment or materials. Pursuant to the authority in 29 CFR 1910.7, Wyle Laboratories is hereby recognized as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory subject to the conditions listed below. This recognition is limited to equipment or materials which, under 29 CFR Part 1910, require testing, listing, labeling, approval, acceptance, or certification, by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory. This recognition is limited to the use of the following test standards for the testing and certification of equipment or materials included within the scope of these standards. WL has stated that all the standards in these categories are used to test equipment or materials which may be used in environments under OSHA's jurisdiction. These standards are all considered appropriate test standards under 29 CFR 1910.7(c): ANSI/UL␣153_Portable Electric Lamps ANSI/UL␣187_X-Ray Equipment ANSI/UL␣465_Central Cooling Air Conditioners ANSI/UL␣484_Room Air Conditioners ANSI/UL␣489_Molded-Case Circuit Breakers and Circuit-Breaker Enclosures ANSI/UL␣499_Electric Heating Appliances ANSI/UL␣506_Specialty Transformers ANSI/UL␣508_Industrial Control Equipment UL 544_Electric Medical and Dental Equipment ANSI/UL␣698_Industrial Control Equipment for Use in Hazardous (Classified) Locations ANSI/UL␣1012_Power Supplies ANSI/UL␣1025_Electric Air Heaters ANSI/UL␣1069_Hospital Signaling and Nurse Call Equipment ANSI/UL␣1087_Molded-Case Switches ANSI/UL␣1236_Electric Battery Chargers UL 1244_Electrical and Electronic Measuring and Testing Equipment ANSI/UL␣1262_Laboratory Equipment ANSI/UL␣1310_Direct Plug-In Transformer Units ANSI/UL␣1411_Transformers and Motor Transformer for Use in Audio-, Radio-, and Television-Type Appliances ANSI/UL␣1459_Telephone Equipment ANSI/UL␣1570_Fluorescent Lighting Fixtures ANSI/UL␣1571_Incandescent Lighting Fixtures ANSI/UL␣1585_Class 2 and Class 3 Transformers ANSI/UL␣1778_Uninterruptible Power Supply UL 1863_Communication Circuit Accessories ANSI/UL␣1950_Information Technology Equipment Including Electrical Business Equipment Wyle Laboratories must also abide by the following conditions of its recognition, in addition to those already required by 29 CFR 1910.7: This recognition does not apply to any aspect of any program which is available only to qualified manufacturers and is based upon the NRTL's evaluation and accreditation of the manufacturer's quality assurance program; The Occupational Safety and Health Administration shall be allowed access to WL's facilities and records for purposes of ascertaining continuing compliance with the terms of its recognition and to investigate as OSHA deems necessary; If WL has reason to doubt the efficacy of any test standard it is using under this program, it shall promptly inform the organization that developed the test standard of this fact and provide that organization with appropriate relevant information upon which its concerns are based; WL shall not engage in or permit others to engage in any misrepresentation of the scope or conditions of its recognition. As part of this condition, WL agrees that it will allow no representation that it is either a recognized or an accredited Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) without clearly indicating the specific equipment or material to which this recognition is tied, or that its recognition is limited to certain products; WL shall inform OSHA as soon as possible, in writing, of any change of ownership, facilities, or key personnel, including details; WL will continue to meet the requirements for recognition in all areas where it has been recognized; WL will not test or certify any equipment or materials for a client which installs its equipment in an electronic enclosure cabinet manufactured or distributed by Wyle. WL will always cooperate with OSHA to assure compliance with the letter as well as the spirit of its recognition and 29 CFR 1910.7. Effective Date: This recognition will become effective on July 22, 1994 and will be valid for a period of five years from that date, until July 24, 1999, unless terminated prior to that date, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.7. Signed at Washington DC this 15th day of July, 1994. Joseph A. Dear, Assistant Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17888 Filed 7&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;26&hyph;M
