FR941021-0-00066 FR941021-0-00008 Written comments were received from the Powder River Basin Resource Council (PRBRC) (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;27&hyph;12). A summary of these comments and their disposition is set forth below: 1. PRBRC expressed concern that the wording of the phrase ``may be assessed against either party as the court or the council deems proper'' in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) is too broad. The commenter stated that it should be limited by adding the clause ``in conformity with 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295.'' In addition, PRBRC stated that the phrase ``and shall include all classes of actions in which participants would be eligible for an award of costs and expenses under 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295'' should be inserted after ``in accordance with P.L. 95&hyph;87'' in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to clarify the classes of actions in connection with which participants would be eligible for awards of costs and expenses. The Secretary does not agree that the suggested additional language is either necessary or proper. The statutory language adopted by Wyoming is substantively identical to and therefore consistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA, which also contains an unmodified ``deems proper'' standard. Furthermore, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality's Rules of Practice and Procedures contain counterparts to 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295. On January 24, 1994, OSM approved these Wyoming Rules as being consistent with the Federal rules cited by the commenter (see 59 3515). Therefore, no further statutory revisions are needed. 2. PRBRC opposes deletion of the word ``administrative'' in the phrase ``shall apply only to administrative contested case proceedings'' in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f). The commenter argues that the term ``contested case'' should be deleted instead. The Secretary does not agree. As discussed in finding 2 of the January 24, 1994, decision document (59 FR 3515), the Secretary found use of the term ``contested case'' to be consistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and its implementing regulations, as interpreted by case law. Deletion of the adjective ``administrative'' merely eliminates a redundancy since Wyoming's Administrative Procedure Act, at W.S. 16&hyph;3&hyph;101(b)(ii), effectively defines ``contested case'' as an administrative proceeding other than rulemaking. Finally, the January 24, 1994, decision document states that the Secretary's approval is predicated upon Wyoming's interpretation of the term contested case as including all classes of actions in which participants would be eligible for an award of costs and expenses under 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295. Therefore, there is no need to make the changes sought by the commenter. 3. PRBRC expressed concern that the clause ``as the law is worded on August 3, 1977'', which modifies the phrase ``in accordance with P.L. 95&hyph;87'' in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f), may cause the State law to become less stringent than SMCRA as the Act evolves. The Secretary finds that this concern is misplaced. Under 30 CFR 732.17(d), the Director of OSM must promptly notify the State of any changes in SMCRA that will require an amendment to the State program. 4. PRBRC objected to the provision in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) which specifies that a person who did not initiate a proceeding may receive an award of costs and expenses from the State only if that person's contribution is separate and distinct from the contribution made by the person initiating the proceeding. The commenter stated that this provision could cause confusion and could be interpreted as being additive to the requirement that the person make a substantial contribution to a full and fair determination of the issues. As discussed in finding 4 of the January 24, 1994, decision document, the Secretary previously approved this provision, noting that the ``separate and distinct'' requirement is an implicit component of the ``substantial contribution'' requirement, and is not inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA or its implementing regulations (see 59 FR 3516).
