The officer-on-duty at the headquarters of the Russian garrison in Tallinn and local police in the nearby town of Keila both confirm the incident took place at 2.45 a.m. Five men, some of them wearing masks, had stopped their car near the gates of the Russian base. The assaulters had been carrying one rifle, one pistol and one hunting rifle. The Russian senior lieutenant in charge of the guard, who opened the door of the guardhouse after hearing the noise of a car engine, received a blow at the head. The men, who then entered the guardhouse, asked the lieutenant and another Russian military in the room, a sergeant, if they had any weapons. After getting a negative answer, the gang ordered the two military out of the building and to lay on the ground with faces in the snow. The five drove away in the same LADA-type car after pouring gasoline on the guardhouse and setting it on fire. Nobody was injured in the incident. The Russian military say the men had first spoken Estonian, and afterwards, Russian with an Estonian accent. These reports have been confirmed by the commander of the Russian base, Col. Mikhail Kovalyev, who declined to provide any further information. Estonian police officials in the town of Keila said they will start investigation into the incident by first meeting the commander of the base. Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn was called in at the Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow today to receive Russia's official protest. Officials at the Central Staff of Estonia's armed forces said they had no information so far on possible participation of Estonian military or the paramilitary Defense League members in the assault. The aide-de-camp of Estonia's commander in chief, however, said it was surprising that Estonia was first informed of the incident only through Moscow, since Russian military at the Amari base until now had always contacted the Estonian central staff if any problems emerged. Estonian top officials have issued no comments so far. The base at Amari is the last of former Soviet air force bases in Estonia that remains under Russian control. Russia has taken away all combat aircraft from Amari, but the landing field there is frequently used by Russian military transport planes.
