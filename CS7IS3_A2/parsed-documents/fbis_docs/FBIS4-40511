The Secretariat summed up the work carried out to organize the session. After that, its members reviewed events occurring over the two weeks since the last session. Among particular items discussed was a report released by UKRINFORM and picked up by Russia's Ostankino television and Mayak Radio regarding HRK activities allegedly directed at overthrowing the Crimean Supreme Soviet, which was labeled a provocation and as not corresponding with the truth. "The goal of the Crimean Civil Council is to preserve Ukraine's territorial integrity, decisive resistance to chauvinist demands by Crimean separatists, and the resolution of a number of issues related to social, educational, and cultural problems of the Ukrainian community in the Crimea, as well as the problem of the deported nations -- not the struggle for power," states the report by the HRK Secretariat. Participants in the session approved the time limit, formed the Presidium and several commissions, and appointed respective heads. Serhiy Lytvyn was elected head of the Crimean Civil Council, while Oleksandr Kulyk, chief editor of KRYMSKA SVITLYTSYA [Crimean Room] newspaper and head of the National T.G. Shevchenko "Prosvita" Association, was appointed as his deputy. Also approved was the line-up of the following HRK commissions: for issues of national policies and deported nations; culture and education; mass media and public relations; and analytical and internal problems. The session adopted an appeal to the electorate in connection with the presidential elections voicing support for L. Kravchuk and vowing a large-scale campaign against L. Kuchma and O. Moroz. Members of the opposition parliament went home equipped with clear goals and plans regarding the explanation of HRK goals and rallying people in the hinterland who care about the Crimea as part of Ukraine.
