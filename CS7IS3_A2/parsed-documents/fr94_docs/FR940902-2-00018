FR940902-2-00018 FR940902-2-00015 Federal Direct Student Loan Program; Extension of Closing Date AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Extension of application closing date. SUMMARY: On February 17, 1994, the Department of Education published an application notice in the Federal Register inviting applications for schools to participate in the second year of the Federal Direct Student Loan (Direct Loan) Program, which is the academic year beginning July 1, 1995. The notice pertained to the Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program, and the Federal Direct PLUS Program, collectively referred to as the Direct Loan Program. The rolling application and selection process for this program was described in the February 17 notice, which specified October 1, 1994 as the final deadline for application. Many schools have indicated that they would like to apply for participation in the Direct Loan Program but are reluctant to do so until they have had the opportunity to evaluate the program in progress. While the first year of the Direct Loan Program began July 1, 1994, the academic year for many of the first-year schools does not begin until September. Therefore, some procedures, such as funds disbursement and reconciliation, will occur at these schools for the first time in September or October of 1994. The Department wants to ensure that schools have adequate time to evaluate the day-to-day administration of the Direct Loan Program and to observe the benefits of the program for students and schools prior to applying to participate. Therefore, the deadline to submit applications for the second year of the program is extended to November 1, 1994.
