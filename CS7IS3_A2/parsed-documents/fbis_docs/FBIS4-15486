"He was eager to cooperate with all reformers, especially Russia's Choice Party, currently in the making [as received] on our group's basis." Information of MPs back from their constituencies shocked the president. He heard about local election returns forged, statistics held back, bosses' arbitrary action, and a new ruling class emerging from among executive and legislative officers. Russia's Choice thinks the president ought to be more choosy with official appointments. Despite all latest rumours, Dr. Denisenko found Mr. Yeltsin in the best of health.
