The crew comprised an American, an Australian, a Filipino and a Chinese, as well as a Tokyo-based Japanese who was the only one of the five without Chinese accreditation, they said. Relatives of Wang said about 10 police burst into his home at around 11:00 a.m. (0300 GMT) and asked the crew if they had official authorisation to carry out the interview. "As they did not have any, the police took them away, along with Wang Dan," one said. The NBC crew was taken to the central Beijing offices of a branch of the police that is in charge of foreigners in China, and was released two hours later. Wang, held for an hour at a police station in his neighbourhood, said the police wanted to know how the journalists had contacted him and what had been said at the meeting. He said the interview focussed on renewal of most-favoured-nation (MFN) customs status by the United States, the state of human rights in China and his private life.
