FR940207-2-00067 FR940207-2-00028 Comment: The rate design method does not reflect or adjust to changes in the cost of service for each customer classification which will occur over time. Western is only applying the results of the Apportionment of Cost Study to the incremental revenue requirement above that which can be met by the current rates. The net result is dilution of the transmission contractor's financial obligation at the expense of the power customers. Comment: Western compounds its errors by allocating only the incremental part of the rate increase to power and transmission. The rate design should be based upon total revenue requirements, not incremental revenue requirements. Response: Western understands the negative aspects of only allocating the incremental part of the rate increase between power and transmission. However, the customer is assuming that the past apportionment of 55 percent for power and 45 percent for transmission was incorrect. Western believes the last apportionment between power and transmission is correct, meaning that the rate design should be incremental. Each year, Western will perform an Apportionment of Cost Study to stay abreast of the incremental change from year to year. The reason for the large incremental change from power to transmission is that the original project has been fully repaid and the transmission system is deteriorating and must be refurbished. Replacements and Addition Activities Comment: Errors may exist in the assignment of replacement and addition costs between P&hyph;DP customers and Federal agencies. Western did not examine other sources of funding. Comment: The proposed increase is excessive since it includes extensive refurbishment in the Phoenix Area which does not support the path over which service is provided. Response: The need for projected replacements and additions has been previously examined and justified through the O&M and engineering budget process. Projected replacements and additions have been identified in Western's Engineering Ten-Year Plan, along with Western's FY 1993 Budget documents. Further, facility development reports have been developed which analyze the costs and benefits to Western. Although Western receives some funding through trust and reimbursables the majority of the costs that benefit the system as a whole are placed into the rate base. Western has included the customers in the planning process. This will allow the customers to help Western examine sources of funding and plan extensive refurbishment in the Phoenix Area. Comment: When did the replacement and addition program begin and what is the current status of the program? Response: During FY 1991, Western developed the Engineering Ten-Year Plan which was a planning tool for ongoing replacement and addition activities. In June 1993, Western invited the customers to participate in developing the engineering 10-year planning process. Western is currently working with the customers in updating and revising the Engineering Ten-Year Plan. It is Western's intention to update and evaluate the Engineering Ten-Year Plan annually with the customers. Comment: Western has based its decisions to replace facilities and equipment on the age of the facility and equipment or on Western's desire to try out new equipment technologies. The replacement and addition program was not planned, designed, scheduled, or maintained to best serve the customers. There is concern on how well Western has managed its program. Comment: Western has not designed facilities in a cost-effective manner. Comment: Concerning its replacement and addition program (program), Western did not (i) perform appropriate planning analysis, (ii) assess program impact on rates prior to implementation, (iii) inform customers of program, (iv) seek input from customers, or (v) minimize magnitude of program. Western has not attempted to schedule or prioritize work to minimize rate impact. Response: Western utilizes accepted utility design standards and detailed engineering economic studies in determining, planning, and executing construction and replacement projects. These standards and studies are described in Western's FDRs for each major construction project. Furthermore, the purpose of the Engineering Ten-Year Plan is to effectively design, plan, prioritize, schedule, and analyze rate impacts on all the Phoenix Area Projects. Western believes that future rate impacts are minimized and costs can be controlled through this process. Western is now including the customers in the planning process so they are informed and may provide input on future construction activities. By including the customers in this process, Western will minimize rate impacts and meet customers' needs. Comment: A fixed amount for replacements of $4.3 million in future FY 1998&hyph;2047 cannot be representative of future replacements when practically the entire system will have been replaced by 1998. Comment: Western should make a commitment to limit replacements to $4.3 million or less after 1997 unless authorized by the working committee. Response: Western believes the $4.3 million average is a good representation of the future replacement costs and is based on the replacement program which reflects historic experience and service lives of project equipment and facilities. Western cannot commit to a fixed amount when the amounts are based on actual experience and an annual budget document, which change over time. Comment: Western optimistically forecast savings and did not consider the full and true cost of its 5&hyph;Year Plan, phase two of the Phoenix Office, plus the total replacement and addition investment levels, to determine the overall impact on P&hyph;DP rates. Response: Western believes that the benefits of consolidation are just beginning to be recognized and once the consolidation process is completed, there will be additional long-term savings. Prior to the decision to consolidate the Phoenix District Office with the Boulder City Area Office, Western conducted a cost/benefit analysis that included replacement and addition investments. This study analyzed the costs and benefits of five different options of which the option to consolidate the Phoenix District Office and the Boulder City Area Office indicated the highest cost savings. This option also indicated the lowest rate impacts. The study concluded (among other things) that planned construction at Phoenix can be modified and expanded at a reasonable cost to accommodate the Area functions and increase office space. However, it also indicated that there would be disruption of continuity for up to 2 years and that there would be additional construction costs. Comment: Western's replacement and additions program is not justifiable. Comment: Western is attempting to replace a large portion of the facilities over a 10-year period. The replacement costs and the administration and general costs of administering the replacement work peaked, making the rate impact abnormally high. It is suggested that Western attempt to select a replacement period of 15 to 20 years as compared to the Engineering Ten-Year Plan. Comment: Western has not explained or justified the astronomical increase in replacements from less than $2 million on average for the past 10 years to amounts averaging over $14 million for the years 1993 through 1998.
