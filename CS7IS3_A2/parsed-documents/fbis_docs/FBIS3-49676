Regarding the way health protection functions under the conditions of occupation, let us follow the report by correspondent Ramadan Mucolli: [Mucolli] Those few studies that have so far been carried out regarding the health situation in the republic of Kosova have given distressing results. In several areas of the republic, the New Researchers Association has registered a great number of people sick with tuberculosis, jaundice, scabies, and other deficiency diseases. A global reflection of the people's health situation is done even in some other cases, but very little has been done to cure the sick, and even less to eliminate the causes of these diseases. A bit more organized work has been done in schools, where several actions have been undertaken to cure pupils sick with scabies and to eliminate lice. However, the organization of such actions from one case to another does not mean that an independent health system has been created in the republic of Kosova. The establishment of outpatient clinics for the poorest strata of the population presently serves only as a cover for the health organizations and associations. Even today, these associations have no draft program at all for setting up and creating health institutions to cure serious, chronic, and acute diseases. With more consistent work, setting up such institutions is not an unrealizable project. Furnishing them with equipment and supplying with herbs and necessary items can be done with the help of international humanitarian associations and organizations, which are ever more present in Kosova. However, to set up these institutions, it is necessary to manifest a more serious approach and commit oneself right away, without improvisations and baseless justifications.
