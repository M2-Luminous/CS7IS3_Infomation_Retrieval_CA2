At the head of the UNAMIR since he arrived in Kigali in October 1993, Canadian General Romeo Dallaire today expressed his fears and doubts and gave a brief appraisal while awaiting the reinforcements promised by UN headquarters in New York. [Frilet] What have been the consequences of French intervention in Rwanda for the UNAMIR forces? [Dallaire] None so far, except that the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) has become a little more nervous and is trying to ascertain the impact that this intervention might have on its own situation. As a result, it has reviewed its relations with us and affirmed that it can no longer guarantee the safety of the UNAMIR elements whose countries of origin announced that they would contribute troops to the French initiative. That is why I have withdrawn all the Senegalese, Congolese, and Togolese military observers. Apart from that, the RPF has also affirmed that since the announcement of French intervention, they would no longer be able to guarantee the security of Kigali airport, which is why we have so far been unable to reopen it. [Frilet] Just recently, you would appear to have interrupted quite a number of your observation missions in the capital. Is this a direct consequence of "Operation Turquoise"? [Dallaire] We have run up a delay over the past few days because of the departure of the African contingents, and because the new team designated to replace them has still not arrived. Moreover, the delay in replenishing the logistics supplies of my own force is also delaying and slowing down our operations. Nonetheless, we are still carrying out our reconnaissance missions in the capital and shall continue to distribute food. [Frilet] Since Friday, you have set up a permanent telephone link with the French commander in Zaire. What kind of relations are you going to maintain with him? [Dallaire] Let us rather say that I have his telephone number. More seriously, my objective is to establish some form of cooperation and coordination with the French commander in accordance with the orders I have received from UN headquarters in New York so that the two groups of staff can meet. This meeting should take place within the next few days. We will then discuss what we are thinking of doing, on both sides, and see how we can best adapt to these new circumstances. On my side there is not a great deal of adaptation to do. As soon as I have the men and equipment, I shall continue to fulfill my mission here in Kigali, and as far as I know the French should be staying in the western part of the country. [Frilet] Why has the arrival of the 5,500 men who are meant to reinforce your own troops in Kigali been delayed? [Dallaire] Perhaps Rwanda is regarded as a difficult country when it comes to making commitments. The mission that we are accomplishing is itself difficult, and we have still not secured a cease-fire.
