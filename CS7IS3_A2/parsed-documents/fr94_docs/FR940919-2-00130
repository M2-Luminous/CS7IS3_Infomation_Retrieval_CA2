FR940919-2-00130 FR940919-2-00057 [Finance Docket No. 32420] The Indiana & Ohio Rail Corp._Continuance in Control Exemption_The Cincinnati Terminal Railway Co. AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Notice of exemption. SUMMARY: Under 49 U.S.C. 10505, the Commission exempts from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343, et seq., the Indiana & Ohio Rail Corp.'s (IORC) 1 continuance in control of The Cincinnati Terminal Railway Co. (CTER), through ownership of all of CTER's capital stock. CTER is a class III common carrier that operates a 16.25-mile line of railroad and associated branch and connecting tracks known as the Oasis Line, located in Cincinnati, Fairfax, and Evendale, OH. 1 IORC is a non-carrier that controls, with the Commission's approval, four other railroads. DATES: This exemption is effective on October 19, 1994. Petitions to stay must be filed by September 29, 1994 and petitions to reopen must be filed by October 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send pleadings referring to Finance Docket No. 32420 to: (1) Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423; and (2) Petitioner's representative: Robert L. Calhoun, Sullivan & Worcester, Suite 1000, 1025 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beryl Gordon, (202) 927&hyph;5610. [TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721.] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Near its northern end, CTER's Oasis Line connects with the Indiana & Ohio Railway Company (IORY), a wholly owned subsidiary of IORC, and, at its northern end, with Conrail. From its northern end, the line runs in a loop south and west through Cincinnati, OH, where it connects with a line of the Norfolk & Western Railway Company (N&W). CTER entered into a track lease agreement with N&W. 2 As a result, CTER connects with another carrier, the Central Railroad Company of Indiana (CIND). The Indiana and Ohio Railroad Company (INOH), also controlled by IORC, has trackage rights over CIND. 3 Control of CTER by IORC will permit the coordination of the operations and services of INOH, IORY, and CTER. The combined INOH-CTER-IORY operation will provide a through connection to Conrail that will eliminate the need to rely on an intermediate switch. 2 The Cincinnati Terminal Railway Co._Lease Exemption_Norfolk & Western Railway Company, Finance Docket No. 32519 (ICC served Aug. 31, 1994). 3 See The Indiana and Ohio Railroad Company, Inc._Trackage Rights Exemption_The Central Railroad Company of Indiana, Finance Docket No. 32350 (ICC served Nov. 10, 1993).
