FBIS4-13622 "drnes078__a94016" FBIS-NES-94-078-A Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 ANNEX Palestinian Affairs Opposition `Scheme' To `Wreck' Peace Process Outlined Opposition `Scheme' To `Wreck' Peace Process Outlined JN1204154494 Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI in Arabic 8 Apr 94 pp 22-33 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY JN1204154494 Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI Arabic BFN [Report by Rafiq al-Zayn in Beirut] [Text] As the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations falter, and as the PLO enters a hectic race between peace and war, the 10 Palestinian factions decided to take the offensive, and worked out a scheme to wreck the peace process in cooperation with Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan. They began to form a "Palestinian Revolutionary Army," which will be based in Tehran. What are the details of this scheme, and what are the chances of the opposition Palestinian alliance's success in light of Iranian efforts to push Hamas as the leader of this alliance? A high-ranking Palestinian delegation representing the 10 Palestinian factions opposed to the Gaza-Jericho agreement arrived in the Libyan capital a few days ago. What was officially announced about the visit was that the Palestinian delegation conferred for a long time with Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi on developments in the occupied Palestinian territories following the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre and the political situation in the Arab and international arenas. Information obtained by Arab and Western security forces, which have been showing special interest in and closely watching the movements of the opposition Palestinian factions -- known as the Palestinian Alliance -- dubbed the visit one of the "very dangerous" activities the opposition has begun to carry out. This visit comes in tandem with other secret visits by political and security officials to "suspicious" Middle Eastern capitals such as Baghdad, Tehran, and Khartoum, as well as Tripoli. These security services noted that prominent leaders of the Palestinian opposition have been eager to visit countries on a common axis; that is, countries that are internationally isolated and subjected to siege, countries that want to torpedo the peace process, countries that support international terrorism and religious extremism, and countries that extend assistance to all political and military factions and organizations whose objective is to obstruct and abort the peace negotiations. In fact, the moves by these Palestinian parties toward countries opposed to the peace process--whether their positions are based on hostility to the United States and the West or a desire to avenge the siege to which Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan are subjected--are not really new. During the past few months, Iran has received officials from the Palestinian Jihad, Hamas, and the Lebanese Hizballah, and tried to form a military front in order to exacerbate the security situation in face of the peace process. Iran has also increased its financial support and arms supplies to these parties. Baghdad has also contacted Palestinian opposition officials who were living in Iraq or who are frequent visitors of Baghdad. Dr. George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] has recently visited Baghdad. As for Sudan, it opened its camps, run by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, to train fundamentalist opposition Palestinian group. It also increased its assistance to the opposition Palestinian forces in the country before al-Qadhdhafi openly invited Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna] and Ahmad Jibril [secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine--General Command, PFLP--GC] to visit Tripoli. A few weeks ago, Arab and Western security circles noted a qualitative shift in the opposition to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, represented in a new scheme that takes into consideration the political and security changes that have taken place on the ground and the new psychological atmosphere that is leading toward escalation. The factions of the opposition Palestinian alliance are of the opinion that many of the recent developments make it possible for them to move to the offensive, or at least prepare for it, instead of maintaining a wait-and-see attitude. A number of developments have taken place on various fronts: First: The opposition factions are of the opinion that at last they have managed to overcome their differences and to agree on a basic level of understanding for joint action. Available information indicates that after lengthy meetings, the opposition Palestinian factions have developed a unified political approach and emerged with agreements and joint political objectives. The information also indicates that the alliance has agreed on the following tasks: A. The alliance will set up a central command that will specify the political objectives and orientation of the alliance of Palestinian forces. B. The alliance will hold monthly meetings. Exceptional meetings will be held at the request of at least four factions. The chairmanship of the meetings will rotate. Decisions will be made by consensus. C. Each faction has two representatives. A secretariat will be set up, made up of a representative from each faction. The secretariat will hold weekly meetings. It will a have permanent headquarters. D. The tasks of the alliance on the national level: --To abide by the Palestine National Charter. --To adhere to the Palestinian people's inalienable civilian rights. --To hold the Palestine question an Arab and Islamic issue. Liberating Palestine is the responsibility of the Arab and Islamic nation, especially the Palestinian people. --To adhere to armed struggle and jihad as the main tool of struggle for the liberation of Palestine. --To adhere to the unity of the Palestinian people in the occupied homeland and the diaspora. --To hold the PLO as a national accomplishment that must be maintained. Its institutions must be reconstructed on democratic bases. --To recognize that the current PLO leadership does not represent the Palestinian people. --To begin action against the 'Arafat-Rabin recognition document, which amounts to national treason and which is unfit for the Palestinian people. --To adhere to Palestine as the irreplaceable historical homeland of the Palestinian people and to resist all alternative schemes. --To boycott the institutions and organizations responsible for implementing self-rule. --To sever ties with all institutions led or joined by 'Arafat. --To firmly adhere to the escalation of armed struggle. E. The tasks of the alliance on the Arab-Islamic level: --To emphasize that the Palestine question is the core of the Arab-Zionist conflict. --To ensure the responsibility of the Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic masses to counter destructive conspiracies. --To work to promote joint Arab and Islamic militant relations to resist the hegemony schemes. --To stress the Palestinian people's right to exercise their militant responsibilities toward liberation, repatriation, and self- determination. F. The tasks of the alliance on the international level: --To recognize that U.S. support for the Zionist entity constitutes naked aggression against the Palestinian people. --To bolster cooperation with Islamic, African, and Asian states that support the Palestinian struggle. --To form alliances with all forces of liberation and progress in the world rejecting U.S. and imperialist hegemony and Zionist invasion. --To make known all that pertains to the Palestine question and the national struggle in order to win the support of world public opinion. Second: The opposition factions believe that it can benefit from the very important change that has taken place in the atmosphere among Palestinians in the occupied territory and in the diaspora. The current support for the Gaza-Jericho accord cannot be compared with the enthusiasm that prevailed on 13 September. In fact, enthusiasm has turned into general Palestinian frustration. These factions have realized that the stand of the Palestinian people, following the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, is not even close to the stand before the massacre. The evidence of this is in the calls to halt the talks and in the lack of hope that 'Arafat will still be able to save face under the Israeli policy of intransigence and the bloody repression practiced by the occupation forces each day in which many Palestinians are being killed. The fact is, international analysts, who support the accord, believe that the peace process is now facing the danger of ultimate failure. They also believe that the peace process has become a hostage to Palestinian and Jewish extremists, who can repeat operations similar to the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. If this happens, it will be difficult to save the peace agreement. Which means that the opposition must feel that now is the time to deal a deadly blow to the peace process. Third: The opposition Palestinian alliance has discovered that it is a particularly suitable time to exploit the hostility and tension between the United States on one hand and the states that are being exposed to blockades and American and Western pressure, such as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Libya, on the other. It seems that these countries have lost hope in peaceful normalization with America and Western countries and the lifting of the embargoes imposed upon them. Thus, these countries are now ready for confrontation through supporting international terrorism or exerting pressure by obstructing the peace process and undermining, in fact, torpedoing U.S. plans. Confirmed reports indicate that the opposition Palestinian alliance has decided to enter the feverish race of war and peace using all their potential and on all levels. This alliance has recently laid out plans to execute its objectives. These plans call for escalating the confrontation in Gaza and the West Bank and intensifying military operations against the Israeli occupation forces and Jewish settlers to avenge the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and to torpedo the peace process. This escalation will not be confined to the occupied Palestinian territory, southern Lebanon will also witness an escalation and the national and Palestinian resistance will intensify its operations. Information indicates that the scheme of the Palestinian opposition includes reorganizing the armed factions to reactivate fedayeen operations. These operations will include infiltrations into occupied Palestine and other fedayeen operations against the occupation forces. The scheme also stresses a return to operations abroad, such as striking at Israeli and Western institutions and hostage-taking. Observers think that the fact that the agreement of the alliance stresses the "importance of forming alliances with all forces of liberation and progress worldwide that reject U.S. and imperialist hegemony" should be taken seriously. This is especially important considering the information about secret meetings held in Tehran between extremist Palestinian factions and international leftist and terrorist groups and organizations. Add to this reports by Western security agencies about the arrival of secret groups in their countries and the intensive coordination under way between extremist fundamentalist movements, particularly from Hizballah, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the Islamic Jihad and international terrorist groups linked to Palestinian and international organizations. These organizations include the Japanese Red Army, the Italian Red Brigades, the Armenian Secret Army, the Irish Republican Army, and the German Red Army. Western agencies found out a few days ago that these groups have held a secret meeting in Larnaca, Cyprus, in the presence of officials from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. These groups outlined a scheme to carry out terrorist operations worldwide. Within the framework of the new scheme of the Palestinian opposition, AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has learned that these Palestinian opposition factions have embarked on a plan to form an entity similar to the former "Palestine Liberation Army," which was deployed in several Arab states. Information indicates that the Alliance of Palestinian Forces is now assembling military cadres and elements. Each one of the 10 factions will contribute the largest possible number of its elements to recruit and organize them within a new liberation army that will be called the "Palestinian Revolutionary Army." The command of this army will be based in an Arab capital and in Tehran. Information indicates that 'Imad al-'Alami, the official in charge of the Hamas office in the Iranian capital, has held several meetings with Iranian officials at the University of Strategic Sciences that belongs to the Iranian Army, including Major General Reza Ma'iri and Lieutenant General Sayfillahi [name as transliterated], commander of the internal security forces. Al- 'Alami discussed with the Iranian officials the possibility of Iran supporting this military plan of the alliance and extending funds and weapons to it. It has been decided that an expanded meeting will be held in Tehran to be attended by Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the PFLP-GC; Salah Salah, representing the PFLP; Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], as well as other Palestinian officials from the Palestinian al-Biqa' region and certain camps. It has been observed in some Lebanese regions, particularly around the al-Biqa' region, that Palestinian organizations have started to train cadres to form part of the Palestinian Revolutionary Army under the supervision of Palestinian officers from certain Arab and Islamic states. But will the opposition Palestinian alliance succeed in its new move, or is this move really the creation of transient political and military circumstances that will vanish with the end of these circumstances? Neutral Palestinian sources told AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI that at first, the Palestinian opposition's wagers seem to be logical and based on a realistic assessment of the situation, but it is shortsighted. These sources believe that the danger of the talks being torpedoing will exist as long as Israel, backed by the United States, ignores the importance of time factor in the negotiations, and refuses to make concessions; something which increases frustration among the Palestinians as well as calls for military escalation. These sources added: The opposition factions have not taken into consideration several basic factors. Among these factors is the fact that the failure of the peace process will jeopardize the entire region and not only the occupied territories. Based on this, there is an international determination to achieve peace and to prevent the obstruction of negotiations. This was clearly manifested in the positions of the other Arab negotiators following the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This will restrict the margin of maneuvering for the opposition alliance and suggests that the regional circumstances will change, and consequently, this will limit their movement. However, counting and wagering on states such as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Libya is not a guarantee, especially since these states will seek to use the alliance, not because they like them or out of support for their scheme, but as a means to pressure America and to expedite normalization with it. Before this, though, one should wait to make sure of how strong the opposition Palestinian alliance is. Information confirms that the recent agreement has come following several attempts by Hamas to dominate the Palestinian opposition's decisionmaking. This agreement is considered to be a compromise solution between the Hamas plan on the one hand, and the rest of factions on the other. It seems that the recent meetings have witnessed heated discussion due to Hamas' insistence on obtaining 40 percent of the seats of proposed executive committee. Differences over some side's insistence to form a new PLO, and some other sides' proposals to reconstruct the current PLO and its charter, have not yet been settled. Differences have begun to resurface among the factions, particularly between Hamas and the DFLP. It was noticed that each of them claim operations against Israel in different ways, and publish slanderous statements in the press. Information received by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI indicates that differences within the opposition Palestinian alliance will erupt in the coming stage. This is in light of the information that Iran is currently setting a plan in accordance with which Hamas will dominate the alliance politically and militarily, taking into consideration that Hamas has opposed the idea that George Habash lead the alliance because he is closer the Marxist ideology. Information also indicates that Hamas began to act as if it were the alliance. It has been observed that its cadres and elements have begun to spread in the Palestinian camps in southern Lebanon and al- Biqa', and also to spread their fundamentalist calls to the effect that the liberation of Palestine can only take place through holy jihad.
