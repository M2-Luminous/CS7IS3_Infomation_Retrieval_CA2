However, he added, it is a pity that this cooperative relationship has been ruined by Chris Patten. Zhang Junsheng made the above statement to reporters yesterday evening when attending the founding ceremony of the Hong Kong Society of Creative Photographic Art. He was asked by reporters to comment on remarks by the British Foreign Office minister Alastair Goodlad that Sino-British relations at present are not too bad. Zhang Junsheng said: "I wish it were true. However, now the problem is that the very important part of Sino-British relations, that is, the cooperative relationship between China and Britain on the Hong Kong issue, has been ruined by the British side, and by Chris Patten in particular. The Chinese side, of course, hopes China and Britain can maintain a good cooperative relationship between them, but for the moment Sino-British relations have actually been greatly impaired." Zhang Junsheng said: China and Britain should cooperate more closely in this late transitional period to ensure prosperity, stability, and a steady transition, which is the goal clearly laid down in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Now, the problem is that the British side has ruined cooperation despite the Chinese side's wish for cooperation. In this case, what can we do on our part? Now that the British side refuses to cooperate, the Chinese side cannot stand by idly doing nothing but waiting for the British side to return to cooperation. A reporter mentioned that a couple of days ago Chris Patten had accused the economic subgroup of the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of nursing ulterior motives in inviting Hong Kong Government officials to visit Beijing to explain a bill on the Airport Corporation's articles of association. Zhang Junsheng asked: Then what is the motive? Chris Patten did not specify it at all. A few days ago, Chris Patten said he would not restrain British Hong Kong Government officials from contacting members of the PWC. But now he has categorically rejected an official invitation from the PWC. In fact, the PWC economic subgroup's letter of invitation very expressly states that the PWC needed to study the issue, and its purpose in studying this is to give advice to the Chinese representatives on the Airport Committee before further negotiations with their British counterparts. What is wrong with doing this? Zhang Junsheng said: Some members of the PWC, when studying the case, have found that they do not understand or are not quite clear about some articles in the bill; therefore, they have asked Hong Kong Government officials to explain the bill to them. The purpose is very clear, and it has been stated very clearly in the invitation letter. Should there be any doubts about this? A reporter said to Zhang Junsheng: Referring to the reorganization of the three-tier assemblies in 1997, some PWC members have suggested that the nonpolitical assemblies be allowed to switch over by means of endorsement and reappointment rather than reelection. The reporter asked Zhang whether he agreed with this idea. Zhang Junsheng said: In principle, all assemblies should be dismissed and reestablished. However, before a final decision is made, everybody is welcome to air his views on the reorganization of these assemblies. Now that PWC members are voicing their opinions on this issue and are discussing it, this shows that they are very seriously and responsibly considering the case of Hong Kong's transition. With a smile he said to the reporters: "You may express your opinions as well!"
