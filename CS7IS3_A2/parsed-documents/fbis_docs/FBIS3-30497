Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia, Gen. Jean Cot has called on the Bosnian Croats to stop continued shelling of the Muslim section of Mostar, a city in southwestern part of the war-torn former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. An UNPROFOR statement, a copy of which was submitted to TANJUG on Thursday, said the French general addressed such a demand to the commander of the Bosnian Croat army (HVO), Gen. Ante Roso, during his visit to Mostar earlier this week. Cot said no provocations by the local Muslim forces 'could justify the kind of retaliation endured by the population of Mostar (Muslim-controlled) east.' The Bosnian Muslims and Croats, the erstwhile allies against the Serbs, have been waging merciless battles since the spring of 1993 for control over territories with a mixed Muslim-Croat population. According to Spanish U.N. troops' reports, Bosnian Croats in January fired more than 1,400 shells on the Muslim section of east Mostar, while Muslims fired no more than 75 shells on the Croat-held west Mostar.
