FR941026-0-00053 FR941026-0-00020 (1) Reduce the cost of homeownership, by ensuring that funds are not held in escrow accounts in excess of the amounts necessary to protect the lenders' interests in preserving the collateral; (2) Establish reasonable, uniform practices for escrow accounting; and (3) Provide servicers with clear, specific guidance on the requirements of Section 10. In the proposed rule, new ยง3500.17 set out HUD's regulations for escrow accounts subject to RESPA. The proposed rule covered any escrow account established in connection with a federally related mortgage loan. It provided HUD's interpretation of what was a permissible cushion and what was an overcharge to the borrower's escrow accounts. The proposed rule articulated HUD's new policy requiring aggregate accounting analysis on all new escrow accounts. The proposed rule set out the requirements for initial and annual escrow account statements. The rule also proposed a delayed effective date to provide sufficient time for servicers to implement the regulatory requirements. When issuing the proposed rule, HUD reviewed existing escrow accounting procedures. A prevalent practice exists, called single-item analysis, where a lender accounts for each escrow item separately. The lender may collect more money under a single-item analysis accounting than under aggregate analysis accounting. An aggregate accounting method is one in which the sufficiency of the funds is determined by analyzing the escrow account as a whole. Attorneys General of numerous States have claimed that single-item analysis has resulted in substantial over-escrowing of consumers' money. The Attorneys Generals interpreted Section 10 as requiring aggregate accounting practices to determine the maximum account balances. HUD's own escrow study found that too many accounts were over-escrowed and too much of consumers' funds was being held by mortgage servicers. In the proposed rule, HUD announced its determination that servicers should be required to analyze all new escrow accounts on an aggregate accounting basis. HUD proposed to provide a three-year phase-in period after the rule's publication date for existing accounts to be converted to an aggregate accounting methodology. HUD requested comments on its proposed rule and received 142 comments through the February 1, 1994, due date. Discussion of the Comments HUD Received General Five commenters specifically supported the proposed rule (two mortgage companies, one attorney, one bank, and a government agency). Seven comments supported the rule, but with recommended clarifications or revisions. Twenty commenters supported industry standardization. Fifteen flatly opposed the proposed rule for various reasons. Some argued that HUD was overly interfering in escrow industry practices. HUD believes that the final rule will end uncertainty that now exists within the industry. HUD is providing clear standards for the servicing industry to follow. Congress explicitly provided HUD with regulatory authority to interpret the Act to further its purpose. This regulation is well within HUD's rulemaking authority. Eighteen commenters requested an additional comment period or the opportunity to participate in hearings. Although the Department considered requests for additional time for comments and hearings, it concludes that it has sufficient information to complete rulemaking without more input. Costs of Implementation Forty-four commenters (19 mortgage companies, 16 banks, 4 attorneys, 4 associations, and 1 government agency) expressed concern about the cost of redesigning software systems to perform the aggregate analysis and to complete the required statements. Many commenters indicated that the expense of systems design and implementation, staff training, and additional administrative efforts would far outweigh any potential benefit provided to consumers. In reviewing these comments, the Department balanced the short-term cost considerations against the long-term advantages of standardized nationwide requirements for escrow accounts and consumer savings. The Department concludes that the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term costs. Phase-in and Implementation Periods The proposed rule provided a 180-day period for persons to implement its provisions concerning aggregate accounting practices for new escrow accounts. Sixty-seven commenters (33 mortgage companies, 20 banks, 7 associations, 5 attorneys, and 2 government agencies) requested that the 180-day period be extended to 12 or 18 months. They cited changes in software, staff training, and other administrative burdens as reasons for the implementation extension. Several commenters also stated that there would be no incentive to maintain dual systems for pre- and post-rule accounts because dual systems would be too costly and difficult to administer. Sixteen commenters observed that if the implementation period was extended to at least one year, the phase-in period for pre-rule activity should be eliminated. Three commenters supporting the phase-in of pre-rule escrow accounts suggested that HUD should not require the disclosures proposed in the rule during the phase-in period. Four commenters requested that the implementation date be extended to two to three years. While recognizing that a 180-day implementation period for new accounts is demanding, the Secretary concludes that this rule will save consumers money and that it should be implemented as quickly as possible. Moreover, HUD alerted the mortgage servicing and software industry in December 1993 of its intention to implement aggregate accounting requirements. The Secretary believes the affected industries are capable of developing the necessary systems within the 180-day implementation period. This final rule therefore carries forward the 180-day implementation period.
