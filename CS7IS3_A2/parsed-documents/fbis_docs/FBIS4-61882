At NATO headquarters in Brussels today, he signed the outline document of the "Partnership for Peace" program. So, 18 countries have joined the program, including eight former Soviet republics. Turkmenistan, the deputy prime minister said, has possibilities of broad cooperation with NATO member-countries in all spheres, including the military one. He said talks were underway on joint programs for training officers of the Turkmen Armed Forces and on cooperation in other areas of military construction. At the signing ceremony, B. Shikhmuradov said Turkmenistan sees the main purpose of its participation in the program set out by NATO member-countries in objectively promoting a solution to the principal task which is strengthening Turkmenistan's sovereignty and turning it into a fully independent member of the international community. Along with developing partnership relations with new democratic Russia, the deputy prime minister noted, his republic is developing cooperation with West European countries and the USA, Asian states, and CIS neighbors. He specifically noted Turkmenistan's potential role as a bridge between Europe and south and southeast Asia. [passage omitted]
