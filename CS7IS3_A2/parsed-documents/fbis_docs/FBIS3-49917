The only multilateral summit of the five delegations was a working lunch hosted by Clinton at the U.S. ambassador's residence, where the five heads of state all delivered addresses. At the summit, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz called the "Partnership for Peace" an initiative of great significance which creates a realistic framework for Hungary and the region to set out on the path towards full security policy integration. Addressing Clinton, Goncz said, "your visit to Prague, our bilateral talks in the morning and the present multilateral meeting are important signals. They show that in this new era of world history the United States continues to be committed to Europe and to the new and restored Central European democracies belonging to the Visegrad Group, which is very important for us." The United States and NATO continue to consider their mission the full assertion of democracy, pluralism, human and minority rights in all former communist countries, Goncz said. He assured Clinton that Hungary will do its best to use the opportunity offered by the partnership for peace programme. Goncz said it is important that the programme should be open to all the states which seek to enforce principles of democracy, market economy and respect for human rights. "Nor should Russia, Ukraine or any other state in the region be excluded from European security," he stressed. Nevertheless, he admitted that differences in the extent of the development and interests of individual states have to be taken into consideration, though not at the expense of the others. Goncz said the future relationship between the Visegrad four and NATO will be a special test of the new East-West partnership and of the confidence between the United States, NATO, and Russia.
