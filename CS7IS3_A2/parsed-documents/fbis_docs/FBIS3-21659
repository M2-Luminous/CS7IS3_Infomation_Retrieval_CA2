Among those arrested was a Thai, Major General Thanat Phakpadiphat, who is assigned to Supreme Command. [passage omitted] When asked if Maj. Gen. Thanat's name is on the list of suspected narcotics traffickers, Lt. Gen. Kowit said that his name is not on the list. Because this was an American arrest warrant, Hong Kong police officials will have to extradite the suspect to the United States. The United States will state its reasons and show us what evidence it has later on. As for the details about this case, all that he knows is that prior to this, American police officials arrested two Thais on 6 December. A report stated that Maj. Gen. Thanat was arrested at 1200 hours on 8 December along with a first lieutenant who serves as his aide. But after being questioned, the first lieutenant was released because he was not involved. Before the arrest of Maj. Gen. Thanat, U.S. DEA officials arrested Mr. Michael Woo, a Thai Chinese, and Miss Saowani, surname unknown, and seized 30 kg of heroin. During the interrogation, Mr. Woo implicated Maj. Gen. Thanat, who was later arrested. When Maj. Gen. Thanat went to pick up his share of the money, $20,000, he was arrested. A news source said that besides Maj. Gen. Thanat, the United States has also issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Lee Chin Hung, a Yunnanese Chinese who works for Khun Sa. American officials asked the Thai Police Department to find and arrest this suspect, because it had been learned that he was hiding in Thailand. At 1300 hours on 9 December, NCB officials arrested Mr. Lee at the Chanphen Restaurant on Rama 4 Road, Bangkok. He will be extradited to the United States for further handling of the case. General Wimon Wongwanit, the Army commander-in-chief, talked about the arrest of Maj. Gen. Thanat, a CRMA Class 9 officer assigned to Supreme Command who was arrested in Hong Kong on charges of being involved in narcotics-trafficking activities. He said that he has been informed that the person arrested really was a soldier, but just because he is a major general doesn't necessarily mean that he serves in the Army. But regardless of which unit he is in, if he violated the law, he must be dealt with in accord with the law. He said that officials acted correctly in arresting him. Those in the military must know that if they break the law, the military will not protect them. Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani, the director of the Information Office, Supreme Command, said that he has received a report on the arrest of Maj. Gen. Thanat and that he has reported this to General Prasoet Sanrut, the deputy supreme commander. He does not yet know the details, but the Thai consulate in Hong Kong has been asked to investigate the matter. If he did commit a crime, he must be dealt with in accord with the law. Lieutenant General Chettha Thanacharo, the 1st Army Region commander, said that those who violate the law must bear the consequences. The only thing is that we must wait for the verdict. He said that he just learned of this. According to military regulations, the matter must be handled in accord with the law. Discipline must be enforced very strictly, because he is a soldier. "According to military regulations, if a soldier breaks the law, he must be dealt with very harshly. His crime cannot be covered up. He must be punished severely. We must see what his intention was. Maj. Gen. Thanat is a good person. It's hard to believe that he was involved in something like that." [passage omitted]
