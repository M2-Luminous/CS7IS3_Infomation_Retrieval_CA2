The prime minister's remarks came after his visit to the present location of the Latvian Air and Antiaircraft Forces at the dilapidated Spilve airport. The permanent base, as envisaged when the Air Force was created, will be at Lielvarde. Presently, the situation in the Air Force is critical because, of their two L-410 airplanes, one is undergoing repair while the other, due to a lack of money, is still waiting its turn to be repaired. In addition, out of six helicopters, only one is reported to be in active service. As was established in the concept of airspace control recently accepted by the National Security Council, Latvia's airspace is to be controlled by the Civil Service with the cooperation of military specialists. Air Force Commander Karlis Kins explained to V. Birkavs that it would be essential to create one or two posts for military specialists in the Civil Airspace Control Services in Riga and Liepaja. However, aircraft which pass through our airspace should not only be tracked by radar, but also, in cases of an emergency, manipulated [manipulacijas]. To accomplish this, fighter planes are needed. The small Czech-manufactured L-39 fighter would be optimal in technical as well as financial terms. V. Birkavs said that the government has agreed to purchase two Mi-8 helicopters, but at the present time there is no money available. K. Kins expressed his anxiety over the fact that factors of state security have not been taken into account in the telecommunication system created by "Lattelecom." While working on the project, consultations with military specialists were not carried out. V. Birkavs agreed that these factors should be included in the project.
