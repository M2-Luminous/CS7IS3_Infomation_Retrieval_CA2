Meanwhile, the summer vacation period is approaching. The Crimea is known to be a holiday resort traditionally popular with the residents of Russia, Ukraine, and other CIS states. If a "frontline" atmosphere is artificially created, hundreds of thousands of people may succumb to groundless fear and will thus be left without a place to spend their vacation in. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has instructed his press service to make it clear to the public that the situation in the Crimea is giving no cause for concern. The calm atmosphere and the entire infrastructure required for normal peaceful rest are being maintained in the Crimea. The president's press service gave this message to the ITAR-TASS agency.
