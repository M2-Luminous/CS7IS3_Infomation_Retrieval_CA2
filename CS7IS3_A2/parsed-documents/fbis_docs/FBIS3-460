During the last few weeks the ANC has been criticised for the actions of people who claim ANC membership. Our opponents can rest assured that we will do everything in our power to protect their right to campaign. We ourselves are the victims of large scale intolerance and in many parts of South Africa we are not able to campaign. We have fought long and hard for the right to vote and all of us who are serious about democracy must protect each other's rights in the electoral process. But we must caution other parties to make adequate security arrangements when they enter areas where many voters are hostile to them. We take very stringent precautions when our leaders speak in right wing or hostile areas. Each party has a responsibility to work closely with the SAP [South African Police] and the peace committees and must provide its own marshals to protect its leaders and supporters. Our opponents can expect us to control our members, but we cannot provide protection against the millions of South Africans who were deeply wronged by apartheid and who may express their anger in irresponsible ways. We will however do our best reach every ANC supporter and to especially target supporters who have in any way interfered with the freedom of other parties. Our message to our members is simple: We will not tolerate any intimidation threats or violence against our opponents. ANC members who break electoral code of conduct will be disciplined by our structures as well as face prosecution for crimes under the electoral act. We have nothing to gain from violence and intimidation. If you do not like a party or its policies, stay away from their meetings and activities. Our task is to take our message to the voters and to persuade them that the ANC is the best party to run this country. We have been accused of paying lip service to political tolerance. To ensure tolerance amongst our members the ANC has embarked upon the following: Our elections campaign manual forbids any disruption of political meetings. We have trained monitors for every branch to deal with breaches of the electoral code of conduct. A letter from the president of the ANC, Comrade Nelson Mandela, has been sent to every branch, region and office-bearers. A poster with an accessible version of the electoral code of conduct for political parties has been dispatched to all regions and branches throughout the country. During the week of the 13 March, the ANC is dispatching senior ANC and ANC Youth League leaders to all ANC regions to ensure that the message of tolerance reaches out to all our members and supporters. The ANC believes that it has already been partially successful and would like to point out that the National Party and the DP [Democratic Party] have had many peaceful visits to areas where the ANC has undisputed majority support. The fact that disruptions have been few and peaceful has been due to the very hard and consistent work on the part of our structures. In many areas ANC office bearers have worked hard to diffuse potentially explosive situations. The divisions in our country are very great, anger and distrust run very deep. Political campaigning in this country has always been robust. However we cannot afford to disrupt this fragile process towards democracy, by adopting campaigning strategies that increase polarisation. The ANC will do our utmost to keep the campaign clean and to use it to overcome the bitterness of the past. We appeal to all other parties to work just as hard at achieving real political tolerance.
