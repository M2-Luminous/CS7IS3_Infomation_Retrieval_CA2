The "code" recognizes the indissolubility of the relations of Kalmyks with Russia, the impossibility of the republic's secession from the Federation, and a single citizenship of the Russian Federation; that is, it disavows the previously claimed state sovereignty of the republic. What compelled Ilyumzhinov to surrender to Moscow the dearest gain of the former Soviet autonomies? [Ilyumzhinov] I did not surrender any kind of sovereignty. In fact, we did have semisovereignty, a condition in which it is impossible to stay very long. It is equivalent to being half pregnant or half hanged. There are only two solutions here: either full independence, separation from Russia in the Chechen or Tatar variant, or the opposite, unification. After analyzing the situation, I preferred the second scenario, because under conditions when everything is falling apart, we will not extricate ourselves by ourselves. For the sake of preserving Russia, and its unity and indivisibility, we are taking a step not away from the center, but toward the center. [Dikun] It is being said that the laurels of "gatherer of Russia" are enticing you... [Ilyumzhinov] I have no such ambitious designs--to go down in history. This is a course that is dictated by life itself... I am frequently asked, why did you go with a white flag to the White House during the days of the October events? Was it really in order to save Rutskoy's little suitcases, or to resolve some of my own affairs? I behaved then not as the president or a politician, but as an honest man: When two brothers are fighting, it is necessary first of all to stop the bloodshed. And my behavior today, once again, is not a political act, but the step of a normal manager who should call things by their names. Many run to the Kremlin now, and they swear: They say, we are with you, we are for a "united and indivisible" Russia, but, as a matter of fact, they are breaking away from it. But I declare openly that we cannot live outside of Russia. As for the rumors that allegedly I intend to reduce Kalmykia to the rank of a province, they have nothing in common with reality. I emphasize, I am not changing the state structure; on the contrary, this would denote an encroachment on the Russian Constitution. As before, Kalmykia will remain a republic with all of the pertinent attributes, with its own president and its own national khural [parliament]. [Dikun] You, evidently, know that there is also another version that explains your behavior. The MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service] allegedly have compromising material on you that they did not circulate as long as you were loyal to the Kremlin, but all it would take would be for you to desert to the side of the opposition, for them to threaten you: Either sacrifice sovereignty, or we will institute a criminal case. [Ilyumzhinov] I am completely fed up with all of this talk about the shady origin of my capital. The appropriate services checked me out numerous times, when I was running for national deputy of Russia, and when I ran for president--and nothing was found. And think about it yourself, how can the Kremlin pressure a republic! This is unrealistic, and even not in the interests of the Kremlin. Incidentally, even after the October events, I did not sense any kind of pressure on me on the part of Moscow. [Dikun] Do you want to say that the attitude of the Moscow authorities toward you has not changed even a little since October? [Ilyumzhinov] Not entirely so. Previously in the Kremlin, I was, as the saying goes, on a white horse. And even the first person who eliminated Soviet authority! But after the October events, a certain coolness emerged in relations, and misunderstanding: They said, Kirsan betrayed us, deserted us. But, after all, I never belonged to anyone's team, I always made my own policy, that which I consider necessary for my own people. [Dikun] Meanwhile, many interpreted your latest initiative as national betrayal. The opposition, with which you assured you are completely finished, has once again raised its head. A committee for the protection of the constitution and the state was organized, and it is demanding from you that you reject your intentions. [Ilyumzhinov] In fact, there is no opposition, it is simply a handful of people who always come out against everything. In the main, these are former communists and ex-deputies of the dissolved parliament who want to get into power at any price. The so-called parties and movements are not registered anywhere, just like the committee that they organized. I met with its representatives at one time, and I understood that it was a futile matter. They only want to kick up a row. We took a public opinion poll that showed that 74 percent of the population supports my initiative, 61 percent of the Kalmyks are "for." For the most part, it does not matter to the people--Russians, Kalmyks, Tatars, Jews--under what constitution and under what citizenship they live. The main thing is that they have a good wage and filled stores. [Dikun] Thus, perhaps, this explains everything? Inasmuch as the transition from socialism to capitalism is proceeding in the republic with a squeak, do you expect to exchange sovereignty for Moscow subsidies? [Ilyumzhinov] If it was a question of money, I would not undertake all of this. When primary emphasis is placed on mercantile interest, this does not lead to anything good. [Dikun] It is known that your colleague presidents have interpreted your step, to put it mildly, without particular enthusiasm. [Ilyumzhinov] Actually, they treated it with caution. Some of the regional leaders even began to say that I betrayed someone and something. I considered myself one of the leaders of the regional movement, and I came out with the initiative to establish a Council of Components of the Russian Federation. Moreover, I was elected its cochairman. And I was treated accordingly. But, after all, I remained the very same "regional supporter," and I think that Russia is not restricted to the walls of the White House and the red Kremlin. I will not hide the fact that I was even happy, when I heard on television the statement of the Russian Federation president's press service of his negative evaluation of my initiative. This somehow rehabilitated me in the eyes of colleagues. And they indeed began to call me up from the republics: They said, we thought that you were playing some kind of a clever game behind our backs with Yeltsin, but you, it turns out, are not welcome there. The other day, I was in the Kremlin, and I talked for a very long time with Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary. It became clear that I was not understood quite correctly there, and they decided that I, in a unilateral order, without discussions with Moscow, decided "to abolish the republic." But inasmuch as, I repeat, we do not intend to "abolish" the republic, then the Kremlin also has no complaints against me.
