The National Congress of Democratic Initiative (CNID) has not made public its reasons for the departure, announced Sunday by its ruling committee, but one faction has complained of the government's "unpopularity". It had three cabinet ministers covering justice, mining, energy and water. [as received] The Assembly for Democracy and Progress (RPD) pulled out its one minister, for youth and sport, complaining that it had not been consulted on the new list of government members. The new premier, from the Alliance for Malian Democracy (ADEMA) of President Alpha Oumar Konare, had returned everyone to their former posts. Both withdrawing parties had only joined the government last April. During the last few weeks the CNID had led a strong campaign against the former premier, Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, accusing him of not implementing the government programme and calling for a government of national unity. The radical wing of ADEMA wants the party to govern on its own.
