FR941031-2-00089 FR941031-2-00063 The ``old-law'' contribution and benefit base is used by: (a) the Railroad Retirement program to determine certain tax liabilities and tier II benefits payable under that program to supplement the tier I payments which correspond to basic Social Security benefits, (b) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to determine the maximum amount of pension guaranteed under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (as stated in section 230(d) of the Act), (c) Social Security to determine a year of coverage in computing the special minimum benefit, as described earlier, and (d) Social Security to determine a year of coverage (acquired whenever earnings equal or exceed 25 percent of the ``old-law'' base for this purpose only) in computing benefits for persons who are also eligible to receive pensions based on employment not covered under section 210 of the Act. Computation The base is computed using the automatic adjustment formula in section 230(b) of the Act as it read prior to the enactment of the 1977 amendments, but with the revised indexing formula introduced by section 321(g) of the ``Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994.'' Under the formula, the ``old-law'' contribution and benefit base shall be the larger of the current ``old-law'' base ($45,000) or the 1994 ``old-law'' base ($45,000) multiplied by the ratio of the national average wage index for 1993 to that for 1992. If the amount so determined is not a multiple of $300, it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $300. Amount The ratio of the national average wage index for 1993, $23,132.67 as determined above, compared to that for 1992, $22,935.42, is 1.0086002. Multiplying the 1994 ``old-law'' contribution and benefit base amount of $45,000 by the ratio of 1.0086002 produces the amount of $45,387.01 which must then be rounded to $45,300. Accordingly, the ``old-law'' contribution and benefit base is determined to be $45,300 for 1995. OASDI Fund Ratio General Section 215(i) of the Act provides for automatic cost-of-living increases in OASDI benefit amounts. This section also includes a ``stabilizer'' provision that can limit the automatic OASDI benefit increase under certain circumstances. If the combined assets of the OASI and DI Trust Funds, as a percentage of annual expenditures, are below a specified threshold, the automatic benefit increase is equal to the lesser of (1) The increase in the national average wage index or (2) the increase in prices. The threshold specified for the OASDI fund ratio is 20.0 percent for benefit increases for December of 1989 and later. The law also provides for subsequent ``catch-up'' benefit increases for beneficiaries whose previous benefit increases were affected by this provision. ``Catch-up'' benefit increases can occur only when trust fund assets exceed 32.0 percent of annual expenditures. Computation Section 215(i) specifies the computation and application of the OASDI fund ratio. The OASDI fund ratio for 1994 is the ratio of (1) the combined assets of the OASI and DI Trust Funds at the beginning of 1994 to (2) the estimated expenditures of the OASI and DI Trust Funds during 1994, excluding transfer payments between the OASI and DI Trust Funds, and reducing any transfers to the Railroad Retirement Account by any transfers from that account into either trust fund. Ratio The combined assets of the OASI and DI Trust Funds at the beginning of 1994 equaled $378,285 million, and the expenditures are estimated to be $324,516 million. Thus, the OASDI fund ratio for 1994 is 116.6 percent, which exceeds the applicable threshold of 20.0 percent. Therefore, the stabilizer provision does not affect the benefit increase for December 1994. Although the OASDI fund ratio exceeds the 32.0-percent threshold for potential ``catch-up'' benefit increases, no past benefit increase has been reduced under the stabilizer provision. Thus, no ``catch-up'' benefit increase is required.
