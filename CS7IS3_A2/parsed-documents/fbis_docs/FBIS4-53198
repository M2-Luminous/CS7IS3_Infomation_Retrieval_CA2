Another photo of the same era, while less known, serves a similar function of encapsulating Washington's role in Cambodia. It shows a young boy, not much older than the Vietnamese girl, swamped by his U.S.-supplied battle dress and M-16 getting ready to go to war. Twenty years later, the photo still serves as a graphic reminder of the folly of providing massive military aid to the corruption-riddled regime of Lon Nol. In both Cambodia and Vietnam, foreign military assistance extended the suffering of the local populations. Despite Phnom Penh's objections and cries of interference, Thai military leaders and politicians are right to criticize an appeal by Cambodia's leaders for international donations of arms. The Royal Cambodian Army is poorly-equipped but it is not for lack of arms that it has suffered a string of stunning defeats at the hands of the better-armed Khmer Rouge over the last few months. The biggest problem, as Bangkok has noted, is corruption and poor leadership among its generals. Sihanouk is well aware of the dangers of greed and incompetence among his officer corps, whom last week he called the "world's masters of corruption". After their defeats at the hands of the Khmer Rouge in Pailin and Anlung Veng, government soldiers complained their officers had been more interested in pillaging the area than taking proper precautions to defend the bases. According to some reports, government officers requisitioned military trucks to transport their looted spoils back to Phnom Penh while wounded soldiers were left to walk out. Irregularly paid, and poorly looked after, Cambodia's soldiers have little incentive to risk their lives. Last week, Australia said it along with the United States and France were seriously considering the possibility of sending weapons to Cambodia. Thailand has criticized the idea repeatedly, saying a renewed influx of arms would result in a prolonging of the conflict. Bangkok officials say they still hope to see a political settlement and national reconciliation but as Sihanouk, for long the leading proponent of cutting a deal with the Khmer Rouge, lamented last week, such a hope is looking increasingly vain. At the height of its ugly diplomatic row with Phnom Penh over alleged assistance to the Khmer Rouge, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said Thailand was washing its hands of the Cambodia affair and he announced Thailand would play no part in hosting peace talks. But the Cambodian problem won't go away. Shells continue to stray over the border and the unending upheaval across the border hurts Thai business interests and is a source of a wide range of criminal activity from banditry to gunrunning. What would serve Thailand better would be to join an international effort to revamp the Cambodian armed forces. An effectively trained and led army could do much to restore peace throughout much of Cambodia. A well-disciplined army would also eliminate one of the last sources of support for the Khmer Rouge -- the widespread resentment at official corruption and extortion by government soldiers. Further more, aiding the government army may be the only way to dispel the widely-held impression that the Thai military continues to support the guerrilla group. In the end, however, whatever military training the international community can offer, it will do little good unless the factionalized government in Phnom Penh also extends its support. The Cambodians must start the process of rebuilding their disgraced army and then perhaps the world will be in a position to help.
