Ocalan severely warned the members of the organization, saying that there has been an incredible number of losses. [Correspondent Fatih Yilmaz] According to available information, Ocalan said in his message to PKK field commanders the previous day that those responsible for the losses will be punished. Ocalan demanded that those not fighting voluntarily be dismissed from the organization, and called on the PKK to carry out low risk operations such as laying mines, sabotage, and putting up road blocks. The PKK conducted operations to lay mines and roadblocks yesterday. In his message, PKK leader Ocalan said the losses suffered by the organization in Pulumur and Dogubeyazit are unacceptably high. He made the following assessment: The field commanders are misleading me, the information they provide does not conform with reality. The PKK suffered huge losses during operations carried out by the security forces in the last few months. Meanwhile, the mop-up operation launched by the security forces on Cudi Mountain is continuing. It is reported that major losses has been inflicted on the PKK.
