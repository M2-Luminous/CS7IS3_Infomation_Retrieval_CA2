In particular, the decision of the Government of Turkmenistan to resume the trading sessions in the local currency exchange and to base the official exchange rate of the manat on their results created the prerequisites for a better mechanism of mutual settlements between Turkmen and Russian enterprises. The Belarusian Council of Ministers, on the other hand, had an extremely adverse effect on the infrastructure of mutual settlements. The republic government decided to cover the shortage of currency needed for the repayment of "gas" debts to Russia by instituting the compulsory sale of all of the export receipts (including those in Russian rubles) of Belarusian enterprises directly to the currency reserve of the National Bank. This eliminated the need for trading sessions in the local currency exchange, but on Thursday the decision was amended, although only with respect to joint ventures, non-residents of Belarus, and firms which had deposited foreign currency in their accounts prior to 14 March. The history of the national currency markets of the former union republics reveals three basic patterns of development, which could be termed "Baltic," "Russian," and "Ukrainian." According to the first, the official exchange rate of the national currency is based on average market indicators and most exchanges of currency take place in the interbank market. The stability of national currency is achieved primarily by means of a stringent monetary policy in this case. The "Russian" pattern of development presupposes a strong connection between the official exchange rate of the national currency and current stock market indicators. The country's main financial agency (the central or national bank) can influence the currency market with slight adjustments by pursuing a policy of strictly scheduled changes in stock exchange quotations. Finally, in the "Ukrainian" example, the seeming stability of the official exchange rate of national currency is achieved by means of flagrant intervention by the national bank or the republic leadership in trading sessions (by setting strict limits, for example, on the rise in rates in a single session or by stopping the session when the rate has reached the necessary level). The events of last week in the currency markets of Turkmenistan and Belarus revolved around the "Ukrainian" pattern. The Government of Turkmenistan took a discerning view of it and decided that the official exchange rate of the manat, which had been kept stable for almost half a year while market quotations had fallen to less than one-thirtieth of the previous rate, could not enhance the prestige of its currency and resumed the practice of basing the official exchange rate on the results of trading sessions. As a result, the official exchange rates of the manat immediately dropped, from 1.99 to 10.00 manats to the U.S. dollar and from 600 to 170 rubles to the manat. Although there is still a sizable gap between the official exchange rates and the actual market rates, the Turkmen leadership's actions could have positive implications for local and (and this is much more important) Russian financial entities. In particular, the gradual convergence of official and market indicators will do much to simplify mutual settlements between Russian and Turkmen enterprises, which have experienced constant difficulties in defining actual rates of exchange, and the repatriation of profits. If the Turkmen Government allows local banks to conduct settlements through their own correspondent accounts, the local market could become extremely appealing to the Russian entities. The Belarusian Council of Ministers, on the other hand, became an involuntary apologist for the "Ukrainian" pattern when it encountered the need to repay its debts to Russia for deliveries of energy resources. It passed decrees to institute the compulsory sale of all of the foreign currency receipts of local enterprises to the National Bank at the official exchange rate. The official exchange rates of the dollar and the Russian ruble were set at 10,200 Belarus rubles to the dollar and 6.61 Belarus rubles to the Russian ruble. It also decided to suspend trading sessions in the local currency exchange. At the last minute, however, the Bank of Belarus amended the council's decision and authorized the sale of foreign currency in the exchange by joint ventures, non-residents of Belarus, and enterprises which had deposited the foreign currency in their accounts prior to 14 March. The Belarusian currency market reacted to this "double move" immediately and unequivocally--the exchange rate of the dollar was set at 17,950 Belarus rubles to the dollar and the rate of the German mark was set at 11,950 Belarus rubles to the mark on Thursday. In this way, the foreign exchange rates of the Belarusian currency fell to half of the rate at the beginning of March. The events in Belarus have already evoked a response from Russia: By the end of the week most of the Russian financial entities specializing in financial transfers within the CIS had dramatically reduced the number of operations with Belarusian contracting partners and had virtually stopped all mutual settlements. In spite of the similarities between the situation in Belarus and the "Ukrainian" pattern, however, the circumstances in that republic could change in the future. In contrast to Ukraine, where the crisis of non-payments had stabilized the exchange rate of the karbovanets at 25,000-35,000 karbovantsy to the dollar virtually without being influenced by the decisions of official government structures, the high level of effective demand in Belarus provides no hope of quick stabilization. Therefore, it probably will be impossible to create even the semblance of government decisions influencing conditions in the currency market. Besides this, the future of the unified ruble zone is still not certain: If the currency systems of Russia and Belarus are merged, the Belarusian market could start developing according to the Russian pattern instead of the "Ukrainian" one. [Box] The development of the currency markets in the republics of the former USSR is influenced by internal and external factors. This applies above all to the perturbing effects of Belarusian currency regulation, which have been officially justified by Minsk's hope of keeping the idea of unification with the Russian monetary system afloat, primarily for the purpose of securing domestic Russian prices for Belarusian consumers of energy resources. The Draconian currency nationalization (the 100-percent compulsory sale of receipts in rubles and in convertible currencies at a clearly unrealistic fixed rate) will urge Belarusian businessmen to move beyond republic borders in mobilizing resources for settlements with Russia's Gazprom Association. According to a statement by Vyacheslav Kebich's press secretary on 15 March, Russia is already willing to lower its gas prices from 80 to 50 dollars for a thousand cubic meters of gas. The same statement included the optimistic comment that the package of unification documents would be signed before the end of this month. The actual truncation of the currency market in Belarus, however, will postpone the decision on another issue of cardinal importance in connection with monetary unification--the rates for the conversion of the Belarusian clearing rubles and cash rubles into Russian rubles. The preferred Russian option (with consideration for the actual differences between Belarusian cash and non-cash forms of money) is known to be the establishment of a single exchange rate, the average of the non-cash market exchange rate for the dollar and a cash rate based on a coordinated consumer budget. The effective undermining of the Belarusian currency market (only currency deposited in the accounts of exporters prior to 14 March can be sold freely, and this means that the exchange rate in Minsk will be decided by the National Bank of Belarus instead of the currency exchange) leaves room for currency manipulation, which certainly will not be in Russia's interest. There is also a bigger problem. Officials in Minsk are reluctant to admit that the unification of the monetary systems will be meaningless without a unified budget and credit-emission center and, consequently, without the surrender of much of Belarus' sovereignty to Moscow.
