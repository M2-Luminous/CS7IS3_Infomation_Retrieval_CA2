"Only 1.4 per thousand inmates escaped last year," said Jia Jingping, the spokesman for the ministry, adding that the figure was one of the lowest in the past 45 years. Jia said the country's judicial bodies made remarkable contributions last year in the aspects of reforming criminals to become useful persons to society and maintaining social stability. He stated that "our ultimate goal is to convert criminals by combining punishment and reform." China had more than 1,244,000 prisoners by the end of 1993, with 247,000 of them having their terms reduced on account of their good behavior in prison. Some 33,000 prisoners were released on probation in the same period. Another 34,000 of them were released on bail to receive medical treatment, he said. More than 301,000 prisoners were set free in 1993 after they had finished their prison terms. Jia said China's education-through-labor centers have also strengthened their work in educating, persuading, and saving inmates. The inmates are considered to have committed comparatively less serious offences. The spokesman said China had 153,000 such inmates, including prostitutes and drug-addicts, by the end of last year. Some 75,900 of this category of offenders were set free after they had finished their terms, and 55,800 had their terms reduced for good behavior.
