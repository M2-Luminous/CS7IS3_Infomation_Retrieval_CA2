Between 1,000 and 2,000 people, armed with machetes, iron picks and stones, attacked the Thamrin Plaza in downtown Medan, owned by leading local ethnic-Chinese businessman Tanoto Sukanto, vandalizing the building and looting the shops, the witnesses said. Intervening security forces immediately blocked the downtown business area where the mall was located while shops and offices in the area were closed again, they added. Lawyer Hasbi Ansori of the Medan chapter of the Legal Aid Institute confirmed that the attack took place but said the building was not "severely damaged." He could not say how many attackers had been involved in the incident. Ansori said the city's downtown business district was now completely deserted except for security forces as all businesses had closed again. There were no reports of arrests, the witnesses said, and the regional police and military spokesmen could not be reached for comment. Demonstrations on Thursday and Friday here by tens of thousands of workers demanding better working conditions degenerated into anti-Chinese rioting in which one factory owner was killed and many ethnic Chinese properties were vandalized. Anti-Chinese pamphlets that first appeared during Thursday's protest, focusing on how ethnic Chinese were accumulating wealth to the detriment of other Indonesians, have continued to circulate in the city. Indonesia's ethnic Chinese minority -- making up about three percent of the population -- is widely resented for its hold on economic power. Meanwhile, thousands of workers around this northern Sumatran capital Tuesday refused to return to work for the second day in a row. "Today, many of the factories are still closed and the workers are still gathering near their factories," said Jansius Lumban Tobing, Director of the Medan Industrial Zone north of here, adding that some 12,000 workers were believed to have taken part in a similar strike the previous day. "They do not want to work but only sit around near their factories," Ansori said, adding that a strong security presence was now in place in and around the industrial zone and that shops had begun to reopen. In Belawan, some 18 kilometres (11 miles) north of here, an officer at the local police post, First Sergeant Purba, said although some of workers in the area had started to return to work, "most were still standing outside the fences of their factories... demanding that their detained friends be set free." Medan City Police Chief Colonel Chaerudin was Tuesday quoted by the BERITA BUANA daily as saying that as of noon Monday, a total of 112 suspects were being detained for questioning. Witnesses said labor protests had Monday spread to Binjai, Tanjung [word indistinct], Deli Tua and Belawan -- all towns around Medan -- as well as in Pematang Siantar, some 125 kilometres (77 miles) southwest of here, where about 6,000 protestors went on the rampage and vandalized nine cars and a plastic factory. Pematang Siantar Police Chief Lieutenant Colonel Baroto Badrus said the town was now calm. Local military chief, Colonel Sunarto, said security authorities were letting workers gather in front of their factories "as long as they do not resort to destruction."
