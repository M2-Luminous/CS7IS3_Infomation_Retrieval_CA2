Wu Yi made the statement at the "Symposium on Sino-U.S. Trade and Investment" sponsored by the Asia Association here. She said: Bilateral Sino-U.S. trade has been developing very quickly. The volume of trade between the two countries has grown more than 10 times, reaching $27.65 billion in 1993 from $2.4 billion in 1979. There are now 12,000 U.S. enterprises in China. Of the $11 billion the United States agreed to invest in China, $5.2 billion has actually been invested in China and used by China. The United States has become the largest investor in China. Commenting on China's most-favored-nation status, Wu Yi emphatically pointed out that the yearly discussion of this issue has created an enormous sense of instability for Sino-U.S. economic relations and trade. She said associating trade with issues having nothing to do with trade is "extremely unwise" [fei chang bu ming zhi 7236 1603 0008 2494 2535] and "lacks strategic foresight." Wu Yi urged the U.S. Government to act pragmatically, weigh the advantages and disadvantages, do away with artificial barriers, and properly resolve this problem so that Sino-U.S. economic relations and trade can proceed steadily and in a healthy manner. Wu Yi attended the symposium in New York after attending a meeting of the Eighth Sino-U.S. Joint Committee for Commerce and Trade in Washington. Over 300 representatives from U.S. business circles attended today's symposium. Taking the floor at the symposium, Ye Qing, vice minister in charge of the Chinese State Planning Commission, and Jiao Sufen, director of the Department of Investment under the Ministry of the Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Cooperation, briefed those in attendance about China's future development and investment.
