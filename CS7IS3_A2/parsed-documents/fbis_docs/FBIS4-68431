Dmitriyev under the rubric "Rumors"; place and date not given: "'Serp i Molot' Is Doing Fine"] [Text] There are a lot of rumors everywhere. Including in Moscow. Just recently, for instance, it was said that one of the largest Moscow plants--Serp i Molot--is about to be shut down. Well, rumors they may be, but the workers became concerned: Are we being thrown out onto the street? It is not difficult to guess what panic may cause at an enterprise. Who benefits from inflaming the situation? MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent posed this question to Serp i Molot General Director Nikolay Izvekov. "I have to disappoint the sensation lovers: Nothing terrible is happening at the plant," Nikolay Yakovlevich said. "On the contrary, after a certain decline in production, it is on the rise again. Although, of course, we have our share of problems. We had some unpleasant things happening before the plant stockholders' meeting. Somebody was spreading the most outrageous rumors that the enterprise had been sold to "third parties." In reality, outside companies, which are the source of the rumors, did attempt to buy a controlling share of Serp i Molot stock. For instance, ChIF [voucher investment fund] Partnerstvo purchased at preferential prices from plant employees about 15,000 shares and attempted to place their man on the board of directors. Fortunately, we managed to keep outside commercial operators from participating in running the metallurgical plant, where incompetent people are simply dangerous. Actually, I can tell you with certainty that Partnerstvo has little interest in our production. What attracts this firm is a different juicy morsel--huge commercial space that may be used as warehouses..." According to Nikolay Izvekov, after unsuccessful attempts to place themselves on the plant joint-stock company's board of directors, the investment fund management began sowing panic among employees. In addition, clearly paid-for articles about the plant's unstable situation appeared in the "yellow" press. "Right now we need to reassure the workers," continue Nikolay Yakovlevich. "Because there are no serious reasons for concern. We are working successfully, installing state-of-the-art technologies, and are not even considering selling any of the plant's property. And anyway, how could one of the plants most needed in the country be sold? If we stop production, the entire radio, automotive, and watch-making industry will immediately grind to a halt. Everybody needs high-quality steel, which is produced at only two or three enterprises in Russia." Unfortunately a small part of the collective did fall for the temptation offered by commercial operators and sold their stock. However, in the opinion of the Serp i Molot management, the block of shares purchased by ChIF Partnerstvo is several times smaller than the controlling share. So there is no reason to worry. The metallurgical giant still belongs to the workers and produces the output we all need.
