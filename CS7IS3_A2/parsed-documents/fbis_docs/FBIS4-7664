FBIS4-7664 "dreeu064__a94019" FBIS-EEU-94-064-A Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 ANNEX Hungary Bilateral Agreements Signed With Russia Bilateral Agreements Signed With Russia AU0104185794 Budapest MTI in English 1622 GMT 1 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0104185794 Budapest MTI English BFN [Text] Budapest, 1 April (MTI) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross signed a Hungarian-Russian deal to settle former Soviet debts to Hungary on Friday [1 April]. An accord on eliminating double income and capital taxation was also signed by the two prime ministers. Foreign Economic Minister Bela Kadar and his Russian counterpart Oleg Davidov signed the minutes on the second session of the Inter-Governmental Trade and Economic Cooperation Committee, as well as a protocol on mutual goods deliveries for this year. Industrial Minister Janos Latorcai and his Russian counterpart Vitaly Mikhailov signed a protocol supplementary to the 1966 agreement on establishing a nuclear power plant. Transport and Telecommunications Ministers Gyorgy Schamschula and Vladimir Bulgak signed a memorandum on cooperation in telecommunications and postal affairs. President Arpad Goncz was present. Boross said Russia had agreed to take back used fuel cassettes from the Paks nuclear power station. (This needs no approval from Russian legislators.) Chernomyrdin felt the new agreements marked major progress in Hungarian-Russian relations. He welcomed the idea of as many as possible Hungarian entrepreneurs taking part in Russian privatization. He also praised the no-double-taxation agreement, expected to help two-way trade grow from last year's $3.5 billion to $7 billion this year. Asked whether debt repayment included arms deliveries, Boross said negotiations were under way on the question but details still had to be clarified by military experts. Chernomyrdin confirmed that Russia would like to repay part of its debts by supplying military technology, of which a list had already been presented to Hungary. "Russia could supply enough of these 'commodities' for Hungary to finally become a debtor," Chernomyrdin said. The Russian prime minister recalled that the Hungarian Army used to buy mainly Soviet weapons, and expressed Russia's willingness to continue these deliveries. Asked if arms spending was not just money down the drain, Boross said the Hungarian Army is only defensive. Hungary's single purpose for maintaining an army is to prevent war. The size and level of the Hungarian Army show that it only has a security function. Chernomyrdin said Russia welcomed Hungary's full European Union [EU] membership bid. The Russian Federation also hopes to join and hopes that Hungary, as a full EU member, will back Russia.
