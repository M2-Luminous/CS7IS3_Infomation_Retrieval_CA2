The French forces of Operation Turquoise in Rwanda have thus entered the town of Cyangugu. They have established themselves in the Nyarushishi camp. This is where thousands of Tutsi civilians fleeing the massacres have taken refuge. No shots have been fired, and we have been well received by the people, Colonel Andre Chilles said this morning. Two wide-bodied planes carrying more than 100 tonnes of medical supplies and equipment left Satolas [Lyon airport] for Rwanda this morning. Nicole Guillard reports from Lyon: [Begin Guillard recording] At least 150 tonnes of supplies and equipment are going to be transported to Rwanda from Satolas. Half of the crates were loaded aboard a wide-bodied plane yesterday, and the second will leave late this afternoon. They are taking modular operating theater units, medical equipment, medicines, and vehicles supplied by Bron military college, within the framework of the rapid humanitarian intervention air force. This emergency force, incorporated into Operation Turquoise, should make possible the rapid establishment of two medical units in Zaire, behind the Rwandan border. A rapid intervention unit in southeast Rwanda will also make it possible to give first aid to the victims of the war, thanks to two medical units, a surgical unit, and a dental unit. [end recording]
