According to him, a major issue at their talks concluded in Almaty on Saturday was the fixing of terms on a tender for the work of dismantling the silos, and the participation of Kazakh firms in the tender. However, a mutually acceptable solution failed to be reached. Kazakhstan believes that though the tender submitted by the U.S. Government is "open, because of its stringent conditions the participation of Kazakh firms in it is problematic," Kasymov said. Those who intend to take part in the tender are the joint-stock company Katep (Kazakh nuclear energy industry), and two holding companies -- Special Installations and Construction. The talks are to be continued, Kasymov said.
