Vivekanand in Amman and Wafa' 'Amr in Jerusalem] [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, on Friday [22 April] denied that it was signalling a shift in its fundamental approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict by offering to recognise Israel in its 1967 borders and negotiate a peace agreement with the Jewish state. The group, in a statement issued by its Damascus-based political office, sought to reestablish that its objective was the creation of an Islamic state "from the (Mediterranean) Sea to the (Jordan) River," and that recent comments made by one of its senior leaders were misinterpreted by the media to imply that it was willing to abandon its call for the elimination of the state of Israel. It appeared that the "clarification" owed its origins to differences from within the group's ranks in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Islamist activists and political analysts in the occupied territories said Hamas' leaders, fearing political exclusion at a time when the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) are moving towards Palestinian self-rule in parts of the occupied lands, had rushed into making conciliatory statements in a bid to ensure their survival. As such, Friday's statement was interpreted as a move to reassure those in the occupied territories who in principle reject any recognition of Israel, whether 1948 or 1967, by reaffirminig that there was no shift at all in the group's standing. Several Hamas leaders said although the conciliatory stand was aimed at preempting isolation, it was also meant to show the Palestinian people that Hamas was capable of achieving better negotiating terms and a peace accord more responsive to the Palestinians' aspirations that the Israel-PLO autonomy agreement. At the same time, the group's leaders have to take into consideration the opposition such a stand sparked among the young generation of Palestinians. "Hamas' grassroots, like all the young Palestinian generation, are desperate for independence," a leading Hamas figure told the JORDAN TIMES in occupied Jerusalem. "Therefore any peace proposal suggested by Hamas' high echelon will have to take this into consideration." Fatah leaders who have maintained a secret dialogue with Hamas affirmed that they were aware of a "change" in the Islamist group's stand and welcmed it because it gave an added momentum to demands for an independent Palestinian state in the territories Israel seized in the 1967 war. Shaykh Ahmad Bahar, an Islamic leader in Gaza, said the group was "willing to negotiate with Israel to achieve Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian lands it occupied in 1967 on the basis of U.N. resolutions. But this does not mean that Hamas has departed from its strategic goal of liberating all of Palestine." Friday's statement, a copy of which was made available to the JORDAN TIMES, echoed the same sentiment. It said Hamas was committed to "escalating popular resistance and continuing holy war as long as the Zionist occupation forces remain in our blessed Palestinian land and until the liberation of all the occupied land from the sea to the river." It said comments made by Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the group's politcal bureau, that a peace treaty was possible with Israel if it withdrew from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem did not imply any "concession to or acceptance of the Zionist enemy." Explaining that the statement was issued to clarify the group's stand "in view of the popular and official reactions" to Mr. Abu- Marzuq's comments, "Which were not seen in their full context or misinterpreted," the group said its "political programme" called for: -- Total and complete unconditional Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem; -- The elimination of all settlements and removal of settlers from these areas; (The statement did not refer to Mr. Abu-Marzuq's call for Israeli compensation for the losses Palestinians suffered as a result of occupation. -- Fair, full and free elections among the Palestinian people living inside and outside the occupied territories to elect a leadership which will be the sole authority to speak and take decisions on behalf of the Palestinian people and represent their goals and aspirations. Here was the key departure of the group from what Mr. Abu-Marzuq had said. The statement said: "If Hamas manages to win the confidence of the Palestinians, it will express and reflect the will of our people and mobilize popular forces to achieve the full liberation of our land." (Mr. Abu-Marzuq had referred to the possibility of a "peace treaty" although he did not say between whom). According to Hamas leaders in the occupied territories, the strategy as outlined in Friday's statement helps Hamas secure a role in the present political process. Without such a strategy, they said, Hamas would be left alone unable to influence the course of political developments. Shaykh Bahar said the political leadership of the group outside the occupied territories has also taken a decision to participate in elections to the self-rule institutions envisaged under the Israel- PLO accord, but no decision has been taken on how Hamas should tackle the PLO's domination of the autonomy arrangements. Shaykh Jamil Hamami, another Islamic leader in the occupied territories, said the decision was not acceptable since "participation in elections will give legitimacy to the self-rule authority." The immediate objective of the group, he reaffirmed, is to "foil the self-rule deal itself." Palestinian peace negotiator Frayh Abu-Middayn said Hamas had demonstrated political flexibility and pragmatism following the expulsion of more than 300 of its members in December 1992. He said Hamas' peace overtures were a message directed at the PLO and not at Israel. "They are telling the PLO we will not sit at the negotiating table with Israel. But we will have a share in the cake by being accepted as partners by the PLO," Mr. Abu-Middayn said. Political analyst Mahdi 'Abd-al-Hadi argued that reasons behind Hamas' new stance were: --If Hamas continued resisting Israeli occupation through rejectionist stances, it will be labelled the number one enemy to Israel and the U.S., and thus will have to pay a price it could not afford. -- If it drew closer to the PLO's political position and participated in self-rule institutions, it would facilitate implementation of the PLO-Israel accord but without granting it legitimacy, and it would isolate the opposition inside the PLO against participation in the Palestinian authority.
