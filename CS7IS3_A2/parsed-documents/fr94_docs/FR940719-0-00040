FR940719-0-00040 FR940719-0-00015 40 CFR Parts 52 and 81 [CO28&hyph;1&hyph;6401 and CO36&hyph;1&hyph;6400; FRL&hyph;4883&hyph;4] Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of PM&hyph;10 Implementation Plan for Colorado; Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this action, the EPA is approving the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Colorado for the purposes of bringing about the attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10). The SIP was submitted by the State on February 24, 1993 and December 9, 1993 to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 plan for Pagosa Springs, Colorado. EPA is also approving the PM&hyph;10 contingency measures for the Pagosa Springs nonattainment area, which were included in the State's December 9, 1993 submittal. In addition, EPA is amending the nonattainment area boundary for the Pagosa Springs nonattainment area to include some of the surrounding suburban area of Pagosa Springs. The revised boundary is based on information submitted with the SIP which provided a SIP equivalent demonstration showing that the revised boundary more accurately represents the Pagosa Springs airshed. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule will become effective on June 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the State's submittals and other information are available for inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2466; Air Pollution Control Division, Colorado Department of Health, 4300 Cherry Creek Drive South, Denver, Colorado 80222&hyph;1530; and Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Vicki Stamper, 8ART&hyph;AP, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2466, (303) 293&hyph;1765. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pagosa Springs, Colorado was designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act (Act) upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 1 (See 56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991; 40 CFR 81.306 (specifying nonattainment designation for Pagosa Springs.)) The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D of title I of the Act. The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this final action and the supporting rationale. 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Public Law No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399. References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (``the Act''). The Clean Air Act is codified, as amended, in the U.S. Code at 42 U.S.C. 7401 et. seq. Those states containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (i.e., those areas designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 under section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology_RACT) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable; 3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. Some provisions were due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Revisions to satisfy these requirements were submitted by the State on January 14, 1993, and EPA will be taking action on these requirements in a separate Federal Register notice. Such States were also required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 which become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. (See section 172(c)(9) of the Act and 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544.) The State adopted PM&hyph;10 contingency measures for the Pagosa Springs PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area in November of 1993, and those measures were included in the State's December 9, 1993 SIP submittal.
