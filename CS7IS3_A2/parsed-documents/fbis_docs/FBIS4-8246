A STANDART NEWS special correspondent reported that the prevailing opinion in Ankara is that the Turkish contingent to Sarajevo will hardly be allowed to cross Greece and Bulgaria, and Turkey is ready to send it by sea. Quoting government sources, 24 CHASA says that U.S Ambassador to Sofia William Montgomery asked "recently" that "Turkish blue helmets be granted passage through Bulgaria." According to the daily, President Zhelev and senior diplomats had been under strong pressure. "Some of them were even given a hint that if Sofia complied, its foreign debt problems would be settled in the talks with the creditors of the Paris and the London Club," 24 CHASA says. It quotes U.S. Press Attache William Cook, who "categorically denied yesterday that U.S. officials had attacked Bulgarian institutions about the passage of Turkish peacekeepers."
