The interest in the politicians is quite understandable: political analysts believe that the relationship between Moscow and Kazan, which for over two years demanded a special status in the federation, as well as their treaty on the separation of powers signed at the beginning of the year can serve as a model for the revival of the Russian Federation. This time Interfax interviews the president of the republic Mintimer Shaymiyev. INTERFAX: Five months have passed since the signing of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan. Do you think it has influenced processes in Russia as a whole and the attitude of the federal government to territories? SHAYMIYEV: Yes, undoubtedly. The treaty with Tatarstan reduced to naught the prospect of Russia developing as a unitarian state. This is an important political asset, first of all for Moscow itself. Now everyone believes that the federation can be asymmetrical. This is not just somebody's whim, but a reality. The federal government has started signing treaties with republics. Moreover these are not standard agreements, they take into account the specific features and possibilities of each republic. These differences prompt the level of dividing powers and the nature of relations between the federal government and territories. But we still will have to evaluate the true meaning of the treaty. When Russia starts working to harmonize the constitutions of the republics with the federal constitution and the matter is raised in relations with Tatarstan, then we are going to see the strength of the treaty. It was signed on the basis of the recognition of two constitutions, which means that Kazan has the right to demand the adjustment of certain articles of the federal constitution to its own. That is why I think that when future agreements are going to be signed with republics special attention is going to be paid to harmonizing constitutions on the basis of mutual compromise. INTERFAX: Do you think there has been any decentralization of power in the Russian Federation or the voice of local leaders remains inaudible and insignificant? SHAYMIYEV: There has been a change of the situation in this respect too. Local leaders are now being heeded. Probably the explanation to this is that in the absence of a clear concept of economic reforms, territorial or ethnic policies local leaders had to assume responsibility for the construction of a law-governed state. Today they are no less experienced in this than the federal authorities and offer their own versions of economic programs which are no worse. INTERFAX: Before signing the treaty with Moscow Tatarstan tried to notably amend, if not openly dissociate itself with Russian economic reforms. Now, on the contrary, the leaders of the republics more and more often speak of the need for close interaction with Russia. Programs that used to be local, such as the construction of an oil refinery or a bridge across the Kama or the reconstruction of an airport, are becoming joint programs. Why? SHAYMIYEV: The main reason is the high degree of integration of the Tatar economy in the federal one which we have never denied. When two years ago Tatar leaders chose their own strategy of reforms, they stressed that the republic is not leaving the common economic space, therefore sooner or later it Tatarstan going to face the same difficulties as the rest of the federation. We managed to prevent a total economic collapse but it was impossible to avoid general economic difficulties. The main thing is that we prevented the pauperization of the population. The stage of "softly" entering the market is over and today Tatarstan faces the need for radical changes which does not mean the renunciation of social programs. And now the federal leadership is determined to take more resolute steps in reforming the economy and our views largely coincide. The latest package of economic decrees of President Boris Yeltsin is aimed primarily at livening up production which is also our strategic task. A series of Tatar decrees is in the making and their idea largely coincides with the federal one. However, Kazan can afford even more radical steps: to support government-owned as well as private companies, impose softer taxes and revise the credit policy. Expensive federal credits can be a temporary remedy, but they will inevitably make the republic a debtor. There is a true crisis of mutual debts in the Russian Federation and Tatarstan now. Therefore we stake on the broad use of promissory notes. They have proved useful guaranteeing the turnover of means in the republic and holding back the decline in production. But much as we would want we cannot change the situation singlehanded. Tatarstan should revitalize the economy together with Russia. And such prospects are appearing today: the federal government intends to support our local programs by offering guarantees to foreign investors and financing joint projects. This does not undermine the interests of Tatarstan in any way. For instance, the controlling interest in an oil refinery is going to belong to Kazan while guarantees of the federal government will help attract foreign investments and accelerate the reconstruction of the facility. The construction of YeLAZ (an auto plant in Yelabuga, Tatarstan) implied the involvement of the federal government from the very start. We can restore KAMAZ auto works after the fire only through joint efforts. Russia is getting foreign credits and Tatarstan has the right to count on a definite share of them. INTERFAX: Analysts believe that when Yeltsin launched reforms, Russia started becoming less and less controllable. Don't you think your radical steps can have the same result? SHAYMIYEV: No. At the first stage Kazan intends to continue government regulation of the market. In corporatized companies the controlling interest will remain in the hands of the government which is going to be able to influence their operation. While supporting small and medium-sized businesses the government will control the situation, regulate tax rates and help effective plants with credits, but not keep inefficient ones afloat. In the future government control should be reduced to credit and tax policies. We are gradually moving in that direction. On the other hand, the government does not think of curtailing social programs even though it faces the difficult task of combining the incompatible: easing the tax burden and security budget spending. INTERFAX: Are you sure your initiatives are going to be regarded adequately and decrees carried out instead of being blocked? SHAYMIYEV: So far we have not had unimplemented decrees.
