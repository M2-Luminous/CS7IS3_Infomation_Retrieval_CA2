According to Imasen, Fujimori could win the first round with 39 percent of the votes, followed by Perez de Cuellar with 31.3 percent, Ricardo Belmont with 12.5 percent, Fernando Belaunde with 1.8 percent, and Alfonso Barrantes with 1.6 percent. Compared with the previous Imasen poll on the first round, Fujimori's percentage rose 3 points, while Perez de Cuellar's dropped 1.5 points and Belmont's rose 1.4 points. The following question was posed to the people who were polled: "If the presidential elections were held tomorrow, and if Alberto Fujimori and Javier Perez de Cuellar were the only contenders, for whom would you vote?" This situation would be similar to a second electoral round. The voters' answer favored Alberto Fujimori by 46.6 percent, while 43.6 percent supported Perez de Cuellar. Imasen said "support for the ex-United Nations secretary general has dropped since our last poll (last month), when he obtained 45.7 percent and Fujimori 44.1 percent." If second round contenders were Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont and the current president, the margin in favor of Fujimori would be larger, as he would obtain 54.1 percent while Belmont obtained 28.6 percent. According to Imasen, compared with the last poll the president improved his position from 51.6 to 54.1 percent, while Belmont rose from 26.1 to 28.6 percent. A hypothetical runoff between architect Fernando Belaunde and Fujimori showed a big difference: The former president obtained 13.4 percent of the votes, while Fujimori obtained 63.8 percent.
