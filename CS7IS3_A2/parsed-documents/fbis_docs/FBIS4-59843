It is worth reminding that the Saudi security officials, by creating obstructions and by stationing forces in combat gear and surrounding the headquarters of the representative of the leader in the holy city of Mecca, are the main factors in the adoption of the far-sighted decision by the leader of the Islamic revolution. This is so because the recent instructions of the leader of the Islamic revolution in connection with the holding of the hajj ceremony included the point that the Saudi officials should not be allowed to use any pretext for breaking the sanctity of the holy House of God. As has been cited in Mr. Reyshahri's telegram this year too, the devoted and vigilant pilgrims from Iran and other countries were ready to raise the secret banner of deliverance from the idolaters and arrogance in the land of revelation by taking inspiration from guidelines of the late Imam Khomeyni, peace be upon him. But the Saudi military and security forces in a provocative and irresponsible manner, and three days ahead of the antipathy rallies surrounded the headquarters of the representative of the leader and began controlling all movements of the pilgrims, thus preventing the divine obligation from being carried out. It is surprising as well as shocking that the Muslims are banned from holding the antipathy rally and announcing deliverance from the pagans near the House of God. The Saudi forces prevented the announcement of deliverance from polytheism and arrogance headed by the U.S. and Israel by controlling the movement of pilgrims around the headquarters of the leader's representative and even prevented the headquarter's vehicles from leaving or entering the area. The oppressed silence of the world Muslims in the House of God is far more effective than any cry and stronger than any storm. The message of the Islamic revolution has now crossed the geographical boundaries of Iran and has reawakened the Muslims across the globe, giving them self-confidence. Last but not least, the hajj rituals and rallies such as the antipathy rally, on the one hand, provide the world Muslims to become aware of their problems from close quarters and on the other, by announcing their indignation over the Zionist domination, raise the outcry of their common sufferings. Obviously unless these sufferings and pains are treated properly to provide a basic cure, any cry can only serve to be a temporary solution.
