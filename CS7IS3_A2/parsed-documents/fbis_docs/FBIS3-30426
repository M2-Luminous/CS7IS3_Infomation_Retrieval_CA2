The Serbs did not even bother to camouflage tanks, guns, vehicles, and containers of ammunition loaded on trucks and railway cars sent to the Bosnian Serb Army, Visnar reports. All convoys for Baranja in eastern Croatia were escorted by military and police personnel of the so-called republic of Serbian Krajina, while transports bound for Bosnia were handled by military and police personnel of the so-called Srpska republic. Visnar believes that with the establishment of political relations with Herceg-Bosna and its army the Serbs have relieved the major burden on their forces, which will now probably feel free to "step up their attacks against the Muslim enclaves in eastern and central Bosnia." They might, he writes, launch their biggest military operations: "a combined motorized-infantry and airborne assault on Tuzla" and "a prolonged artillery and missile at tack" on the Muslim stronghold of Zenica. As evidence of Serbian military objectives, Visnar cites data on "huge supplies" of sophisticated weapons sent to Serb-controlled Bosnia before the latest round of peace talks in Geneva on 18 January as well as the injection of Serb "elite units" to finish off the Bosnian-Herzegovina Army. Units of the 72d and 63d airborne brigades from Pancevo (Serbia) and the 63d airborne brigade from Nis (Serbia) -- components of the Special Forces Corps within the 3d Serbian Army -- were relocated to Bijeljina in Bosnia- Herzegovina, ostensibly for "maneuvers." Both brigades, Visnar points out, consist of professional personnel, 95 percent of whom are veterans of combat in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Their objective, Visnar states, is to take the Dubrava airfield near Tuzla to prevent UNPROFOR from reopening it and to "cleanse" the area of Muslims. He is convinced that to succeed the Serbs are prepared to endure even "a limited NATO air raid or air bombardment for a period of time." Visnar sees Belgrade as counting on Croatian support, since Croatia fears that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, supplied through the Tuzla airport, would turn against the Croats in central Bosnia. Despite a professed desire for normalization of relations between Serbia and Croatia, the VJESNIK article warns, the "Krajinas" are not defeated, and Milosevic's satellite state in Bosnia-Herzegovina has a strong army ready to protect its "weaker" brothers in Croatia and to fight the Bosnian Muslims. The article includes photographs of what it identifies as Serbian arms and equipment: 90- and 120-mm bazookas, SA-341 Gazelle attack helicopters, and T-54, T-55, and M-84A tanks, as well as a detailed description of the Dubrava airfield.
