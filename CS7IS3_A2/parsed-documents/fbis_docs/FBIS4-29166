Speaking in Sydney yesterday, Australia's minister for Pacific island affairs, Gordon Bilney, warned the South Pacific that it must improve its economic performance to avoid a bleak future. Vanuatu's prime minister, Maxime Carlot Korman, says Australia has raised the issues at the right time: [Begin Korman recording] I think the subject announced by Mr. Bilney is the subject of the day. It is so important and I think we can work together to find a solution and make the situation change in the level of economy. [end recording] However, Mr. Carlot Korman said he does not believe the situation is as bad as Australia has suggested. In his address, Mr. Bilney said that unless the region faces its problem urgently the result could be urban slums, mass unemployment, and lawlessness.
