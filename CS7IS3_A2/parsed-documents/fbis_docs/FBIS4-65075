This is what Bureau Chief Eberhard Walde told DPA in a telephone conversation on 11 May. He said his local staff had been detained. Earlier, Walde and other Europeans had withdrawn from the embattled region and gone to the Turkish border. According to estimates, the fights that broke out early in May have claimed approximately 2,000 lives. Walde is trying to find eight German development aid volunteers that are in the region without any contact with the outside world. His bureau, which was opened in Shaqlawa in March, was to coordinate the activities of German relief organizations on behalf of the Federal Government and the Worker Samaritan Organization.
