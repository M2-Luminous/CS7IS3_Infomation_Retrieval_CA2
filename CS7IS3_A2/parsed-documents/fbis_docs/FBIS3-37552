The whole period since then has been dominated by a single fundamental question: "Is Tatarstan part of Russia or not?" And all that time Kazan has issued one and the same answer, albeit with variations: The question of leaving or entering the Federation is not under discussion. Mintimer Shaymiyev, president of the Republic of Tatarstan, has expended considerable effort and time trying to explain to worried Russians that this is a question not of the republic's flight from the Russian Federation but of a change in its status and a precise demarcation of spheres of responsibility and influence. But within Russia. Tatarstan's aspiration was somewhat hard to understand in Russia. Distrust gave way to suspicion, which in turn led to a desire to sort things out.... This slow-moving crisis in relations between Kazan and Moscow with uncertain prospects in the future forced the Russian Federation leadership to decide do something. Then came the failure of the second all-Russia referendum in Tatarstan and the elections to the Federal Assembly. And the realization dawned that it would be easier and more beneficial to negotiate with Kazan. Now the treaty "On the Demarcation of Areas of Responsibility and the Mutual Delegation of Powers Between Organs of State Power in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan" has been signed. Of course, Kazan had to pay a price for the signing of this treaty. For example, the renunciation of the words "sovereign state" and "subject of international law." This also affected taxes: It had to abandon its former desire for a single-channel system and accept the general federal scheme. The important thing for us is that questions of defense remain in Russia's control. When speaking about the treaty, Russian President Boris Yeltsin stressed that it "enshrines the really existing unity of the Russian state." And that is the main thing now. Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev declared in his turn that the treaty "affirms a new model of relations founded on the principles of law and justice." And he echoed Boris Yeltsin's words: "The treaty meets the urgent need to preserve integrity and stability in the Russian Federation." I am bound to recall the words of Sergey Shakhray, Russian Federation minister for national and regional policy: "The object of the treaty," he said, "is not the special status of Tatarstan but the sphere of legal regulation...." And he added: "Regional policy will be developed on such principles as the equality of the components of the Russian Federation and the unity of the economic area." In other words, the minister was letting it be known that "the process has begun." Who is next in line? In all probability it will be Chechnya, where life in a state of legal chaos is becoming increasingly intolerable both for Chechnya itself and for Russia.
