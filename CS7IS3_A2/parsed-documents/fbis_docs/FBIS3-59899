Under an agreement with Australia, Russia's specialists will play a key role in building a new international private space launching site. This will be on one of the islands of Papua New Guinea. The islands are close to the equator, and that makes it possible to put in orbit twice as big a payload as that in the more northern and southern latitude. The launching will be done by Russia's powerful Proton rocket. The first rocket will be launched from the new cosmodrome in 1998.
