Now, the Germans are the third party benefiting while the Americans and Japanese tussle with each other in a trade war. The initial reaction to the collapse of U.S.-Japanese trade negotiations earlier this month was the sharp rise of the Japanese yen. Just before negotiations broke down on February 11, the exchange rate between the yen and the German mark was 100 yen to 1.62 marks. But on February 15, the yen's rate against the mark rose to a high of 100 yen to 1.68 marks, with the yen gaining four percentage points in trading against the mark in just four days. This depreciation of the mark means that German companies can earn more from exports to Japan. If German exports to Japan can be regarded as only a small proportion of the German economy, the appreciation of the yen does have a significant effect on the German economy. It is apparent that Germany's role is similar to that of Japan in the world's economic affairs. But the sale of Japanese-manufactured goods represents a large share of the German market. Because of lower prices, Japanese goods, including automobiles and home appliances, enjoy good sales in the German market. Now, with the appreciation of the yen, if the Japanese companies want to retain the same profit level they will have to raise prices. Consequently, any increase in the price of Japanese goods will contribute to the competitiveness of German goods in the domestic market. This could be a shot of "cardiac stimulant" for the recession-hit German economy. Both Japan and Germany are major exporters. The Germans also benefit from the appreciation of the yen in terms of competition in the markets of other countries. Also, as a result of the appreciation of the yen, the mark has remained firm against the U.S. dollar. As Germany is only slowly recovering from recession, a motivating force is needed. The benefit the Germans gain from the U.S.-Japanese trade war will undoubtedly contribute to the recovery. But the question is, how long will the good times last? In an effort to stop continued increase in the value of the yen, Japan is selling the yen in large quantities. At the same time, the United States has increased certain interest rates in order to defend the U.S. dollar. It also remains uncertain what kind of agreement Japan and the United States will reach to ease their trade conflict. In its latest monthly economic report issued on Wednesday, Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said that Germany had not yet recovered from the worst recession since World War II. On Thursday, the Bundesbank cut its discount rate, a key interest rate, by half a percentage point to 5.25 percent, in an apparent effort to inject vigor into the economy. Any lowering of the central bank's major interest rates may be effective in stimulating economic development, but will likely weaken the mark. Thus, the central bank, while lowering the discount rate, left its less important Lombard rate unchanged at 6.75 percent, and held another key money market interest rate unchanged at 6.00 percent.
