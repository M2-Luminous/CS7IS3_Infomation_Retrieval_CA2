(PNC) announced that on 1 October it will resume the production of plutonium fuel for the Monju FBR. Fuel production had been suspended since June because of trouble at the fuel production facility. To bake and harden the fuel pellets, the PNC will use a spare electric furnace that was recently set up in place of the production-line-style electric furnace that broke down. The plan is for the fuel production to end by next February, and for the Monju to reach criticality (a state in which the nuclear fission reaction occurs continuously) by next spring. Fuel loading is to begin around the middle of this month. For the initial loading 198 fuel bodies are needed, but now there are only 160.
