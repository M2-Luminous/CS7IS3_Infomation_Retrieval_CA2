Evaluating the package of documents signed in the course of the talks, he said that he views them "as a unified whole and as a regrettable necessity with which history has presented us. There are probably some mistakes and contradictions in these documents, but we view them as a single package which has only one aim -- to normalize relations between the two states," Ulmanis stressed. Having expressed the hope that the parliaments of the both countries will ratify the documents signed in Moscow, the Latvian president has refrained from speculations on how soon this might happen. Guntis Ulmanis stressed that "feeling responsibility for the future of these two neighboring states, he reached full mutual understanding" with the Russian president on all the issues discussed. [punctuation as received] In the view of Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, "the most significant result of the talks was the accord on the introduction of most favored nation status in the relations between Russia and Latvia on 1 June." He stressed that a treaty on economic cooperation and trade is already practically ready, enabling the adopted decisions to be implemented in such a short time. Birkavs expressed hope that the visit by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, during which documents on economic cooperation between the two countries are expected to be signed, will take place in the second half of May.
