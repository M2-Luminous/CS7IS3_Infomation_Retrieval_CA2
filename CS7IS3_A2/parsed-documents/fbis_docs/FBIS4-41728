"We shall not allow the Latvian people to perish because of the citizenship law," he said. "We shall not allow this law to bar our way to Europe, the only place where Latvia can survive." A special working group has been formed to amend the act. According to Mr. Birkavs, it is working on the formulas that will make Latvia's national interests compatible with the requirements of international organisations, especially the Council of Europe. The principle of quotas in granting citizenship is expected to be replaced by some other conditions for naturalisation. Specifically, the prime minister said that harsher language requirements will be made to the claimants for Latvian citizenship and a strict procedure will be established for naturalisation of non-citizens. The amendments worked out by the working group will be submitted to the parliament, which is on holiday since june 23 and is expected to resume its sessions right after U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Latvia on July 6.
