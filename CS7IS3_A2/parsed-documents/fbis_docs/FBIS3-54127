Do you think it means progress and a breakthrough, from Israel's viewpoint? [Baraq] I think the progress is mainly on a symbolic level. A commitment was created by his very uttering of such words while addressing the U.S. President and, later, the entire world in the presence of the U.S. President -- with Clinton adding some things. Yet the content was no different from things he has said on previous occasions in various places, including public ones. But I think it was nevertheless an achievement from the point of view of American and Syrian diplomacy. As for Israel, we have time, and time will show whether a breakthrough did or did not take place. If we learn that al-Asad is prepared to hold pragmatic discussions on the substance of peace and the nature of security arrangements, it will definitely mean progress. If, however, we learn that he is not prepared to hold such a dialogue, we will realize that no progress was achieved and that he may have been merely attempting to make progress vis-a-vis the Americans. Time will show whether that is the situation. In any event, if and when a dialogue is launched, we will keep an unwavering eye on the vital security interests of Israel, which are to remain intact. ['AL HAMISHMAR] Is the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] drafting plans for a possible withdrawal? Has the Army prepared any contingency plans? [Baraq] That is unnecessary at this stage. I have already said once that we are intimately familiar with the Golan Heights and if and when we are required to present our stand, we will be able to do so at any kind of discussion about its future. We must remember that the IDF has no part in the making of such crucial political decisions. It has an interest in and a stand on the security aspects of each decision, and it will present its stand to the cabinet, apprise the Knesset of it, and inform the general public of it in the appropriate fashion. ['AL HAMISHMAR] Is the IDF capable of defending Israel in any feasible situation, assuming there will be a partial or a full withdrawal? [Baraq] I say that in our current place and situation, and in the situations we have had to face to date, we need the Golan Heights very much. Every meter, every hill, every ridge and knoll. As long as the current situation remains unchanged, as long as the perils inherent in the current situation remain unchanged -- namely, as long as a Syrian attack is still a realistic possibility, even though not tomorrow morning -- we need all of the Golan Heights. If the question refers to hypothetical situations, I do not think this is the right time to reply. If a different relationship is established -- a relationship of substance rather than a merely technical or formal one -- there will be things that can be reconsidered. In any event, I do not believe there will ever be an Israeli Government that will create a situation in which the State of Israel is indefensible. ['AL HAMISHMAR] Should an agreement with Syria include a demand for -- or even insistence on -- the deployment of U.S. disengagement troops on the Golan Heights or the Hermon? [Baraq] It is hard to answer this question without knowing what kind of an arrangement we will have. Any peace arrangement with the Syrians must include a very complex system of security arrangements, including demilitarization and early warning, as well as arrangements preventing aggression initiatives in general and surprise attacks in particular. Such a system may allow for a certain involvement of outside elements, either to supervise the arrangement or as part of a joint system of control on both sides. I think discussing this question and the possibility of troops is premature, because any such thing will be the outcome of negotiations, and those have not even been launched, and the outcome of such negotiations depends on what the parties want. It would be wrong to discuss partial components at this time. [passage omitted]
