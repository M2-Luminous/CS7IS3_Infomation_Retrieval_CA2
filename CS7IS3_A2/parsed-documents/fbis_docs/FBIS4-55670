The uninformed would of course answer in the negative and ask in surprise: How and where? "Well, on the front, in a mopping-up operation a television set fell on his foot." This anecdote, with its obvious moral, is like a summary of the criticism that has been publicly expressed about the participation of volunteers in military operations. It did of course go further than that, and the Serbian fighters were accused of having gone off to war with a single motivation --looting. To some extent a climate was even created to the effect that those going off to battle voluntarily were mainly people from the wrong side of the law and that under the guise of "mopping up" they were collecting for this operation, which is the most dangerous operation in a war anyway, by hauling off expensive and valuable things -- gold, equipment, and automobiles. In some battle areas there were even special units, not made up exclusively of volunteers of course, whom observers scornfully referred to as "vultures." When the forces of the federal army passed, "patrols" would arrive equipped with special peacetime vehicles for loading up plundered booty. There is no doubt that all the belligerents suffered from this virus, and the credit for this kind of "mopping up" should go not only to the volunteers, but also to the local people where the battles were waged, as well as to certain units of the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], which a military court has been and is now concerned with. What is said about the behavior of the fighting men by some of the commanders and responsible officers of the numerous volunteer units which, under various names and referred to as Serbian guards, with chetnik insignia and other national symbols, waged war in Croatia and Bosnia? Major Borislav Pelevic of the Serbian Volunteer Guards [SDG], better known as Arkan's Tigers, says that there is looting and crime in every war, but that the volunteers who put their lives at risk because of Serbian ideals should not be sullied because of the acts of a few. Pelevic says of the Tigers that they came out of every action with their honor bright and that there were no cases of looting or any crime against civilians and prisoners in the ranks of the SDG. Our informant explained that iron discipline was enforced among the Tigers. There was a soldier's code which all had to abide by. The most popular penalty for those who messed up was the old and well-known folk punishment: 25 lashes on the bare buttocks. Alcohol was strictly prohibited. If anyone was found to have had a drink, he would get the prescribed "ration" of lashes in front of the entire formation, Pelevic said, illustrating it for us. But anyone who got drunk would be expelled from the guards. In three years of waging war, Pelevic relates, there was one Guard member who took some gloves. This Tiger received 25 lashes at the point where the back loses its honorable name, and he was expelled from the Guards. Dragoslav Bokan objects to volunteers returning from the battlefield never being asked where and how they waged war, but what they brought back. He says of the White Eagles ("because of what I said, they died for Serbia, while others only called for war in fiery nationalistic speeches"), but they did not fight a war between whites and blacks. "We did not distinguish who were Muslims and Croats, which houses were theirs. The local people where we fought knew that, both who was rich and where people were hiding things." Bokan says that the local people in those areas formed their own militia, a new military-police caste which issued permits for carrying away goods, weapons, and automobiles. Bokan says that the looting occurred in three waves and that the thieves were not confined to the volunteers. In the first wave the looters were deserters, those who were fleeing from the whirlwind of war; the regular army benefited from the second phase and took away some things under the guise of transferring military equipment and armament; and after them the local people and their militia made their contribution. Our informants agree that those returning from the front encounter spiritual chaos -- no one asks you about your wounds, but what you stole, Bokan says. Instead of welcoming words, they are met with accusations; hungry fighting men, discharged from their jobs, look upon them with suspicion; and the peacetime thieves deliver moral lectures to them, Bokan believes, adding that that is why many fighting men "crack" and have difficulty adapting. The only survivors will be the volunteers who are ideologically aware and who are ready to put up with all that, Bokan warns.
