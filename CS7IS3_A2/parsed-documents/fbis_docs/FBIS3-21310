The United Bakil Council concluded the business of its first general conference, which was held in the region of the Anisi tribes, the day before yesterday, amidst opposition to it and its rejection by some of the political and tribal symbols of Anisi, and especially those belonging to the Popular General People's Congress, the leader of which is the Yemeni president 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. While these same mentioned that the conference was plagued with failure because of their refusal to receive it in their regions, Shaykh Muhammad 'Ali Abu Luhum confirmed in a telephone call to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the conference was crowned by success and was attended by about 40,000 people from among the men of the Bakil tribes and various governorates. He confirmed the error of those who portrayed the Bakil conference as putting forth a call for disunion, when it is exactly the opposite. Likewise, he rejects any process of political or partisan polarization. He referred to the decisions and recommendations that the conference issued at the end of its business and which the closing statement contained. They concentrated on the handling of the internal issues of the Bakil tribes first, and on the presentation of a group of special and general issues in various spheres, the most important of which is working to display the civilized side of the Bakil tribes, the effective participation in building the Yemeni state, the preservation of unity and democracy, the accomplishments of the revolution, the doing away with any differences in the Bakil framework, and the striving to end all differences between it and the other tribes. The Bakil conference confirmed its devotion to unity and democracy as an irrevocable choice, and the working towards sovereignty of the law and the system. It demanded the "sound rebuilding of the security organizations nationally, and the reformation of the armed forces so that they protect the country and its sovereignty and are not a heavy weight on the nation or a protector or friend of the people in power or in the parties." The Bakil tribes demanded to be made a participant, through their United Council, in any arrangements relating to state-building issues. [They also demanded] the acceptance of the Bakil Council's opinion, the necessity of giving the Bakil people and all the ordinary people an equal opportunity in public service, including the armed forces and security forces, without reservation, in the same manner as others from among the tribes, and the taking of an interest in the rights of all the families of the martyrs. Likewise, the Bakil Council demanded the necessity of completing the centralization and the granting of full powers to the people of the governorates and districts, which enables them to serve their regions according to the system of local governing. [They also demanded] the rebuilding of the state organizations, and for the end of the double standard, and giving the qualified individuals and cadres the positions that they deserve. They demanded the hastening of the end of the present crisis, which is on the verge of threatening the unity of the country, and the necessity of requiring all the political powers, and especially those within the framework of the governing coalition, to refrain from all the practices that tend to cause disunion inside society. The statement also demanded that all the parties refrain from political provocation that leads to breach of security and violation of the national constants and hinders the movement of life. Regarding the army and security, it demanded purging both of them of the elements whose failure has been proved and which had a role in frustrating the responsibilities of this institution, and then replacing them with new elements that are capable of undertaking their role free and clear of subordination to people or parties or to the influential people in power. It demanded working to withdraw the armed forces from inside the cities, doing away with the subordination of the armed forces to the sections of power, and opening the door of service to all ordinary people. Likewise, it demanded the changing of the heads of the armed forces in the various military units who belong to any one of the sections of power, or those who belong to one region, and taking another look at the appointment of these leaders, on the condition that the retirement law be applied, and the process of blind conscription be stopped. In the economic sphere, the statement pointed to the need to require the government to maintain public funds and to paralyze the hands tinkering with them, to observe the activity of the revenue-related institutions and the central bank, to not monopolize the public funds in the hands of an individual or party who uses them to buy protections and party and political loyalties, and [the need] to prevent the administering of the public funds for anything except what is in agreement with the regulations and laws, in the framework of what the public budget of the state establishes. It demanded the hastening of putting plans and reform and growth programs into place, the limiting of luxury government spending, the checking of the process of issuing money, the abolishing of what is called invisible clauses and the application of the principle of financial protection, and the putting into operation of the principle of "Where did you get this?" Likewise, it demanded the limitation of the number of workers in the state institutions, including the army and the security forces, the opening of the door of compulsory retirement for the people in high positions of responsibility, the hastening to finish the establishment of the free economic and trade zone in the capital, Aden, and the directing of oil revenues towards what produces a push to the production process and the building of an agricultural renaissance. The statement touched on the demand for various services and the treatment of problems of revenge, and the new manifestations of crime and drugs and the like. The statement concluded with the Bakil Council's assurance that these demands express the concerns and aspirations of all the ordinary people, and not just the Bakil people. However, the Council takes the presentation of these demands upon itself within the scope of its comprehensive national directives.
