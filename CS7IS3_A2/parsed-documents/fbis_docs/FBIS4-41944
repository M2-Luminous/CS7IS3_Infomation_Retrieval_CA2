Abkhazia's position remains unchanged: Each returning refugee will be screened and vetted as to whether he has not been implicated in military or other criminal activity on the autonomy's territory during hostilities. Thus, returning to Abkhazia will be no easier than crossing the border. Therefore any talk about the massive scale or speediness of this process is senseless. Eduard Shevardnadze believes that the return of "large masses of refugees" to Abkhazia is possible within the next few days. The process will begin as soon as the bridge across the Inguri river has been restored, groups of refugees formed, and a schedule for their movement drawn up. Shevardnadze entrusted this mission to Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsiya and Defense Minister Varden Nadibaidze, who were to leave Tbilisi yesterday for a place in immediate proximity to the disengagement line in the city of Zugdidi. Indeed, the bridge across the Inguri can be restored in the next few days (after a corresponding order has been issued, engineers will cope with this task within just a few hours). Schedules for the refugees to cross the demarcation line can be drawn up and coordinated with the Abkhazia side in two to three days. But making up individual lists of refugees is not a matter of just one week. Yesterday Igor Akhba, head of the Abkhazia mission in Moscow, told KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent that the Abkhaz side considers screening of each refugee a matter of principle. Sukhumi does not intend to abandon this principle: It will not allow a spontaneous return. Neither is there a mechanism for the return: The quadripartite commission's consultations continue. Considering that in early July another round of Georgian-Abkhaz talks on a political settlement -- which has been delayed on several occasions following the introduction of peacekeeping forces -- is to begin, it is not ruled out that the refugee problem will become an Achilles heel for the Georgian delegation. Sukhumi, by manipulating this issue, will be able to obtain further concessions from Tbilisi. The latter will be appealing to Moscow, insisting that toughness be shown toward the Abkhaz. In any event Eduard Shevardnadze will be caught in a cross fire. He will not be able to avoid a compromise with Vladislav Ardzinba, who wants to talk with Tbilisi as equals. At the same time the Georgian leader will have to put this political authority on the line by submitting the accords reached to parliament's judgment.
