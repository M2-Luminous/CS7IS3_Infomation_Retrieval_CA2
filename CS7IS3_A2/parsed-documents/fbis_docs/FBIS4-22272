Tsekhmistrenko, under rubric "Problem of Arms Export":"Monopolist Paves the Road to the Market With Good Intentions"] [Text] When, for the purpose of increasing the effectiveness of weapons export, the single Rosvooruzheniye State Company (general director Vladimir Samoylov) was created late last year, it was assumed that the company's chief task would be not only the restoration of state monitoring of that specific type of foreign-economic activity, but also making it easier for direct producers to gain access to foreign markets. It was repeatedly proclaimed that, in exchange for acting as a middleman, Rosvooruzheniye would receive the commission that is customary in that sphere (3-5 percent of the total value sold). However, from the very beginning one could easily discern the new company's striving to achieve a monopoly, in which the producers see a threat to their independence not only in the foreign markets, but even in arms production itself. That tendency may become intensified: as has become known to KOMMERSANT-DAILY, at the present time the Russian government is considering a plan to provide Rosvooruzheniye with interest-free credit for a total of one trillion rubles for a three-year period in order to use weapons shipments to pay off the Russian state debt to a number of Asian states. In the opinion of KOMMERSANT-DAILY commentator Sergey Tsekhmistrenko, in the event of a positive resolution of this question, the producers, practically speaking, will be deprived of the opportunity to exert any kind of influence on weapons export. Production Is Nothing, Acting as a Middleman Is Everything! The creation of Rosvooruzheniye was influenced primarily by the fact that the abolition in 1990 of the state monopoly on military-technical cooperation (VTS) had a rather large number of negative consequences. Several of the factually independent foreign-trade associations that appeared in the foreign markets (although, organizationally, most of them were part of the MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations]) began aggressively to lure clients from one another, and that inevitably led to dumping, and, not infrequently, also, in general, to a loss of customers, together with whom entire sectors of the market were also lost. Something that became a classic example was the sale of MiG-29's to Malaysia, when Oboroneksport and Spetsvneshtekhnika fought for the right to become the supplier. There were also rather frequent instances of unsanctioned export, and the sensationalistic story with the appearance of the latest T-80U tank in Great Britain is only the tip of an iceberg, the bulk of which is concealed from the public. Under these conditions one could welcome the restoration of the state monopoly of VTS. if it were not for one circumstance: monopolism in Russia most frequently took on the form of ugly mutations, a form that was far from what was expected, Correlation of Russian (USSR) and U.S. Arms Export in 1988-1992 (in billions of dollars If one analyzes the experience of trade in weapons abroad, one can see that, practically everywhere, the producer stands in first place, while the middlemen (who, most frequently, are paid from the budget) who are working on commission only help to obtain the necessary state licenses and authorizations, and also to find foreign agents. Something similar (and good) was also in people's minds during the creation of Rosvooruzheniye, with the producers harboring the hope that they themselves would determine the export price of their output and would independently make settlements with the budget after the payment of the commission to that company. Actually, however, for the time being things seem to be turning out just the other way around, and in this regard one can assume that if the rumors about the credit are not devoid of foundation, then the situation will develop as follows. After receiving credit, Rosvooruzheniye will actually be able to use it to pay for the production of the arms that are necessary to pay off the debt to the militant Asians. But even in this instance the company is also already acquiring the features of the actual owner of what was produced, while the producer-executors are taking the risk of remaining in "happy" ignorance relative to the sale price. But the remaining part of the credit, according to the practice that has developed and has become widespread in Russia (it is only a lazy recipient of preferential credit who does not do this) will most likely be deposited in a commercial bank. The money that has been built up there simply at the expense of the runaway interest will return to the state accounts in the original amount, but not until three years later. The credit recipients, obviously, will attempt to take the path of such well-known firms as LLD and Erlan (one might recall the television commercial, "Today you make a purchase at LLD, and a year from now all your money will be returned to you"), which, incidentally, are playing with inflation for only one inning (that is, one year). Rosvooruzheniye's authorized banks, however, are Menatel, Most-bank, Intermed, and the Moscow National Bank. As a result, the real profit received by Rosvooruzheniye will greatly surpass the modest commission that is generally accepted throughout the world, which commission was previously mentioned. I'll Give You a Trillion, but I Don't Answer for the Consequences In the story with credit there is yet another curious detail. All things considered, Rosvooruzheniye intends to become the authorized agent of the Russian government in paying off the foreign indebtedness. Although the company has absolutely no right to do this, since it is stated in its charter that, with regard to the state's obligations, it is not responsible (incidentally, as strange as it seems, the government also is not responsible for Rosvooruzheniye's obligations. In this entire scheme, which at first glance seems to be hypothetical, it is not clear as to whether the Asians themselves are interested in the wave of shipments of Russian weapons that are ready to come crashing down on them at any moment. MVES experts who wanted to preserve their anonymity stated to a KOMMERSANT-DAILY commentator that, in their opinion, the rumors that have been intensively spread in the SMI [mass media], to the effect that the Chinese are sleeping and see themselves behind the controls of dozens of imported SU-27 and SU-30 fighter aircraft, have been greatly exaggerated. Those experts feel that Beijing is counting on either purchasing production licenses from Russia, or (by inviting individually Russian specialists in the VPK [military-industrial complex] simply stealing the know-how "part by part." Another potential buyer of military technology -- Iran -- has already assimilated the production of T-72S tanks and BMP [armored personnel carriers], and the sheiks and emirs on the shores of the Persian Gulf who have recently become promising have preferred the French Leclerc tanks to Russian ones. Something else that attracts attention is the fact that a possible argument that can given by those requesting credit (another one is simply not discernable) -- the necessity of the partial prepayment of production of arms for export -- to put it mildly is not completely correct. Because during previous years more than a sufficient quantity of arms for export was already produced. Thus, according to data provided by the Ilyushenko Commission, which last year verified the activities of the MVES in arms exporting, the amount of weapons produced in 1992 specially for export came to a total of $3.1 billion, but arms with a total of only $1.1 billion were delivered to foreign customers. The rest of the weapons continue to gather dust in depots (some of those arms have already been paid for --approximately $1 billion worth). In the opinion of the MVES experts who were mentioned, by pursuing the good goals of helping the enterprises in the military-industrial complex and compensating their production expenditures, Rosvooruzheniye is choosing not the most effective means. Incidentally, another alternative is not precluded: the mentioned MVES experts, by representing the interests of Rosvooruzheniye, are attempting to lobby in their favor at the very moment when, in the apparatus of First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets, the government's opinion concerning the future of the exporter monopolist is being worked out. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Basic Weapons Exporters | | | |in 1992 (see Note) Accor-| | | |ding to SIPRI [Stockholm | | | |International Peace Rese-| | | |arch Institute] Data (in | | | |billions of dollars) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Country |Percent |billion dollars | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1.
