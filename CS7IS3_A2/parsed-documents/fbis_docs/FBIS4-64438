Union leaders also emerged from their talks with Berlusconi in buoyant mood: "I feel reassured," said Bruno Trentin, national secretary of the leftist CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] union. "There could have been a head-on collision, but there was not." Sergio D'Antoni, head of CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions], welcomed the fact that Berlusconi had begun his government-formation talks with the unions: "Things may be coming up roses. This is a good start, that's for sure: we will have to see whether it goes on like this," he commented. UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] chief Pietro Larizza said that the cost of labour accord hammered out last year had been discussed at length, and that Berlusconi had promised that "the deal will be respected in its contents and methods." The union leaders, who did not give their approval to Berlusconi's outline programme which has yet to be completed, also pressed for more investment in industry, an industrial policy which is closely linked to demand, and measures to improve the labour market and professional training. The prime minister designate, engaged tonight with Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti in what he called a "meeting between friends," told reporters he thought he might be ready to present a government by next Monday. He also confirmed he did not intend to split the Interior Ministry in two to accommodate the demands of his Northern League partners for a greater role in local administration. Meanwhile League leader Umberto Bossi continued to insist his group be given control of that important ministerial post -- a move that other political forces have warned they do not support because they do not believe Bossi is "responsible" enough to take on the sensitive job of supervising the nation's police and security forces.
