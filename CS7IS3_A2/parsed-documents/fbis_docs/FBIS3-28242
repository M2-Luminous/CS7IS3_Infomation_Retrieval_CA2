LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said, "It's an irresponsible way to do things. The cabinet should take much of the blame." Mori told reporters that the coalition partners should have consolidated their opinions before the announcement because the tax system deeply affects the Japanese people. "If it was decision-making on international relations, it might have brought about a major disaster," Mori said. Earlier in the day, leaders of the coalition parties agreed to renounce the tax plan Hosokawa announced at an early Thursday morning news conference. It called for abolishing the 3 percent consumption tax and instead introducing a new indirect tax on sales of goods and services.
