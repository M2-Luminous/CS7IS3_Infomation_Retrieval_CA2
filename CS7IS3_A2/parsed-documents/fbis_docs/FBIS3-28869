FBIS3-28869 "dreas030_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-030 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Feb 1994 North Korea Troop Movements for Team Spirit Denounced SK1402134994 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1150 GMT 14 Feb 94 SK1402134994 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1150 GMT 14 Feb 94 Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Ominous Military Movements"] [Text] According to foreign news reports, at a time when the focus of attention is whether the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise will be conducted or not, the U.S. forces in Okinawa have started making movements. They appear to be making those movements on the assumption that this exercise will be conducted. The Belleau Wood attack landing ship, the (Danedo) landing transport ship, and the (Rodney Davis) missile frigate ship of the 7th U.S. Fleet reportedly entered or left the (Whitebeach) military port in central Okinawa on 8 and 9 February. They were loaded with the armed troops of the Third U.S. Marine Expeditionary Forces and combat vehicles and various other military equipment. The 353d special operation unit of the U.S. Air Force at the Kadena base left for South Korea aboard MC-130, (Convert), and (Halon) special operation aircraft. The U.S. military authorities have said that they could not comment on these military units movements because they were operational actions. U.S. and South Korean media report the United States decided to start the Team Spirit joint military exercise on 22 March and ordered the reservists to get ready. However, THE STARS AND STRIPES, a semiofficial paper of the U.S. Pacific Command, reported on 9 February that no decision had been made on whether the Team Spirit war exercise would be conducted or not and that the reservists and some military units had been on the way to South Korea for training purposes. The movements of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces based in Okinawa are very ominous and make us more vigilant [kaksongul nopiji]. As everybody knows, the issue of whether the Team Spirit war exercise is conducted or not this year is a very serious and it is directly linked to the peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, as an imminent measure [tangmyonhan chochi] to hold a third stage of talks and resolve the nuclear issue in a package deal, the DPRK and the United States agreed toward the end of last year that the United States would not conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise in 1994 and that we would receive a limited scope of inspections [hanjongdoen pomwiui sacharul] necessary to ensure the continuity of the International Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards. If the United States discards its agreement with us and tries to conduct the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise, it will be an intolerable mockery of us, a denial of dialogue, and a criminal act that brings the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. In actuality, U.S. officials are saying that if the Team Spirit joint exercise cannot be conducted, the United States will plan to conduct other joint military exercise targeted at our Republic. They are openly raving that if the joint military exercise cannot be held in South Korea, it should be conducted even in Hawaii. In this connection, the DPRK Foreign Ministry's spokesman issued the statement on 31 January. This nonetheless, the Okinawa-based U.S. forces began a military movement since 8 February, which is regarded as the simulation of the conduction of the Team Spirit joint military exercise. This is something that cannot be overlooked. Whenever the United States conducted the Team Spirit joint military exercise, it, with Japan as a launching base, brought mass- destruction weapons, including nuclear weapons and war equipment, into South Korea and conducted war exercises against the northern half of the Republic. The United States shipped a landing ship, a transport ship, frigate ship to (Whitebeach) port and brought combat vehicles and troops into South Korea. In view of its timing and strategy, we cannot but regard this as the reoccurrence of the Team Spirit war exercise. Washington-backed propaganda means reported that the United States has decided to conduct the Team Spirit war exercise beginning on 22 March and ordered reservists to prepare for the Team Spirit. This is never a coincidence. It is a gross miscalculation if the United States is thinking of deceiving us by employing a double-pronged strategy--paying lip service about the peaceful solution of nuclear issue but, in fact, running wild for the moves to bring about a new war against our Republic. The double-pronged strategy will further consolidate our resolution. If the United States is to assume the position to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it should show this through an actual activity and should, above all, give up the current pressure commotions against the Republic. There is no change in our position to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. We already expressed our clear position toward the United States trying to crush us through strength. We mean what we say, we never say an empty word. If the United States constantly tries to crush us through military commotions in spite of our warnings, it should be held entirely responsible for a grave situation to be entailed therefrom. We will carefully watch U.S. activities henceforth.
