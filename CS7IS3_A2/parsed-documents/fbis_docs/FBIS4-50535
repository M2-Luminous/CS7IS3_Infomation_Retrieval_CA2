Christopher, who arrived here from Tel Aviv earlier today, held talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad on ways of bringing closer the viewpoints of Syria and Israel to narrow their differences over restoring Syria's Golan Heights. Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross attended the talks. Diplomatic sources here said that Christopher is shuttling between Israel and Syria to seek common ground and help iron out hurdles still on the way to peace. The sources said that the talks Christopher had in Tel Aviv Tuesday [17 May] and in Damascus today have not made tangible headway in bringing their differences closer. Christopher, who did not give a press briefing on his talks, was seen off by al-Shar' at the airport. Syria's presidential spokesman Jibran Kourieh [name as received] said after Christopher's departure that "the differences remained wide." "The president reiterated Syria's position and its adherence to the basis of the peace process in accordance with U.N. Security Council resolutions which call on Israel to fully withdraw" from territories occupied in 1967," Kourieh said. [quotation marks as received]
