Cola Chairman Chao Shou-po said that the new regulation will go into effect March 16. Previously, the COLA allowed public construction works to rely entirely on foreign laborers, but an easing of Taiwan's labor shortage has brought more domestic workers into the labor market. The average labor shortage rate in Taiwan was only 2.91 percent in 1992, down from 5.16 percent in 1987. The labor shortage rate measures the percentage of unfilled positions in local firms. Meanwhile, despite protests from workers' groups Wednesday [2 March], COLA vice director of the labor-management relations department, Lai Ching-fong, reaffirmed COLA's decision to deport two Thai workers who the COLA said led a recent strike in central Taiwan. The workers groups had requested that COLA overturn its decision to deport the two Thai workers. They also asked the COLA to provide interpreters for Filipino, Thai, Indonesian and Malaysian workers to give the workers a way of voicing their complaints. Some 500 Thai workers at Taichung's Cheng Tai Yi Construction Co., went on strike last week, marking the first foreign workers' strike since the introduction of foreign labor to Taiwan.
