Shipment of grain and construction materials is next in line. In the whole shipping season, the crews of the Vyatka River Steamship Company have to ship around 2 million tonnes of freight. That is considerably less than in past years. Customers' inability to pay has robbed the enterprise of a chance of procuring the full amount of fuel. Some of the fleet will therefore be standing idle. However, passenger lines will open in time as planned and in a day or two the first motor ships will set out.
