Among the decisions adopted during the conference with the emigre community were: continuation of contacts and exchanges to promote the normalization of relations, creation of an office to take care of emigration issues, and creation of a specialized magazine for that sector. The elimination of the five-year waiting period for those who abandoned the country to legally return, and abolition of the requirement for them to obtain reservations in hotels, were other measures discussed. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina also informed participants at the conference of the government's willingness to facilitate cultural links reaffirming their Cuban nature. The meeting was devised by our country in an attempt to identify common problems between the nation and the emigre community and to promote solutions to those problems.
