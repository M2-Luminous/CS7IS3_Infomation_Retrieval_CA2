FBIS4-9324 "dreeu079_i_94022" FBIS-EEU-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Serbs Deny Blocking Convoy Serbs Deny Blocking Convoy LD2504105094 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1025 GMT 25 Apr 94 LD2504105094 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Sarajevo, April 25 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Serb army headquarters has denied a statement by a U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman in Sarajevo to the effect that Bosnian Serb forces had blocked a second convoy of peacekeepers for the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde immediately after it had left Sarajevo on Sunday [25 April]. The French AFP news agency quoted the statement on Sunday. A protest note, which the Bosnian Serb army H.Q. has sent to UNPROFOR commands in Zagreb and Kiseljak, says that UNPROFOR on Sunday asked a permission for its convoy to pass through the Bosnian Serb territory three times and the permissions were invariably given them. The note quotes a statement by the deputy chief of UNPROFOR command for Bosnia-Herzegovina to the effect that the problem with the convoy was that it had not started from Sarajevo, because some countries, which had given their troops, did not agree to their leaving for Gorazde. This was primarily France, the note states and adds that the convoy was at the airport since early morning until the afternoon, when its structure was finally changed. This can be confirmed by Captain Drole, an officer in the headquarters of Colonel Sonic, UNPROFOR chief of staff for Section Sarajevo, says the statement. The Bosnian Serb army H.Q. statement says that UNPROFOR convoy, which should have left Sarajevo at 10 A.M. (0800 GMT), should have consisted of 221 troops from the British, French and Ukrainian contingents. However, the convoy, which entered the Bosnian Serb territory at 5.05 P.M., consisted of British (117 members), Egyptian (51), Russian (20), Ukrainian (48), French (5) and Nordic (3 members). The note explains that added to the newly-formed convoy were some "new members," who had not been discussed earlier in the day. They were military observers and members of the UNPROFOR civilian affairs, UNPROFOR civilian police and UNICEF. We have allowed that too, and the newly-formed convoy entered the territory of the Bosnian Serb republic at 5.05 P.M. and set out for Gorazde, says the protest note.
