The Home Affairs Department says the green ID card issued in 1950, the blue ID document issued since 1972, all green ID's issued since 1980, reference books issued to blacks since 1950, and ID's issued by the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states are acceptable. The department has requested that those already in possession of a valid ID not apply for a new document at this stage because it might delay the provision of valid documents to those who need it for the April poll.
