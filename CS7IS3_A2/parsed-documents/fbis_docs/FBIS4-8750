The meeting, also attended by Russia's special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin, began at 0830 GMT and was aimed at looking into a proposal to review the security zone around the besieged enclave, the Bosnian Serb agency said. Churkin in recent days has become a critical player in trying to resolve the conflict with the United States calling on Russia to use its influence with the Serbs to put a stop to an escalating crisis that has put UN personnel at risk. Commander Guy Vinet, spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), earlier had said that the Serbs were still holding UN troops in the Sarajevo sector. Their release by 0800 GMT was one of the conditions set by UNPROFOR for the resumption of peace talks in Pale. It was unclear, however, whether they had been released when the talks began. UNPROFOR was also waiting for Serb checkpoints around Sarajevo to be reopened to allow its units to go to Gorazde to provide a buffer force between Serb and Moslem forces. SRNA quoted the Serb military leadership as saying that Moslem units, backed by UN troops stationed in Ugorska, north of Sarajevo, had shelled Serb position early Sunday. It said the offensive stopped once the Serbs retaliated. The agency added that fighting around Gorazde was continuing Sunday and that the Serbs had taken control of "strategic zones" north of Gorazde. [passage omitted] The UN Protection Force has drawn up a plan to demilisarise the enclave, one of the so-called UN safe areas, which has been reduced to the town itself by the ongoing Serb offensive. A multinational force of majority French UN troops with some Ukrainians would enforce the plan. [passage omitted]
