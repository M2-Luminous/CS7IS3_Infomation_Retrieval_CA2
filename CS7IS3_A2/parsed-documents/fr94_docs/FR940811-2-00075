FR940811-2-00075 FR940811-2-00048 (a) Determines that the use or disclosure does not violate legal limitations under which the data were provided, collected, or obtained; (b) Determines that the purpose for which the disclosure is to be made cannot reasonably be accomplished unless the data are provided in individually identifiable form; (c) Requires the recipient to: (1) Establish reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the record; (2) Make no further use or disclosure of the record except: (a.) In emergency circumstances affecting the health or safety of any individual; (b.) For use on another project under the same conditions, and with written authorization from HCFA; and (c.) When required by law; (3) Secure a written statement attesting to the recipient's understanding of, and willingness to abide by the following provisions: (a.) Not to use the data for purposes that are not related to the subject project; (b.) Not to publish or otherwise disclose the data in a form raising unacceptable possibilities that persons could be identified (i.e., the data to be published must not be person-specific and must be aggregated to a level where no data cells have 10 or fewer persons); and (c.) Not to publish any aggregation of the data without HCFA's approval. Because these proposed changes will change the purpose for which the information is collected or otherwise significantly alter the system, we are preparing a report of altered system of records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(r). We are publishing the notice in its entirety below for the convenience of the reader. Dated: July 28, 1994. Bruce C. Vladeck, Administrator, Health Care Financing Administration.
