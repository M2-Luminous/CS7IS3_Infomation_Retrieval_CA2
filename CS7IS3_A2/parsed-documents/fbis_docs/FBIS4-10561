This idea is included in a document for the guidance of the legislative debate presented yesterday by Camilo Escalona, the president of the PS, on the basis of the conclusions reached at the plenary session of the political commission of that party last Friday. Escalona maintained that to ensure the political stability of the country, what is needed is to bring about a series of changes designed, among other things, to establish "the presidential authority over the Armed Forces; a corrected proportional electoral system; a national security council with an advisory, rather than a tutelary, relationship to the president; and a parliament emanating entirely from the exercise of popular sovereignty." With specific regard to the semipresidential system, the socialists are saying it is the model best suited to the country, taking the Chilean sociocultural reality into account. This was made clear by Marcelo Schilling, the vice president of the PS, who explained that a semipresidential system would mean retaining for the president certain types of authority, particularly that pertaining the foreign and defense policies. The other policies would be left to a prime minister who, although he would have to enjoy the confidence of and be appointed by the president, would also require the approval of the parliament. "Excellent Prospects" Camilo Escalona explained that the socialists will propose initiation of the changes in the political system during the first six months of Eduardo Frei's government, a period he termed one "of grace" for the entire administration. He also said that the proposed changes have the support of the greater part of the public, which would mean more than 70 percent of the citizenry. They even have the approval of the more liberal sectors of the opposition. It is for this reason that Escalona predicted that the political-legislative positions of the PS will be "very well-received" by the Concertacion, especially since they are very close to the program of the government alliance. And in addition, the PPD [Party for Democracy] has already indicated that it views them favorably. In any case, Escalona admitted, the approaches or viewpoints of each group on the scheduling and timeliness of initiating the changes, and also the priorities concerning them, might be debated tomorrow, Monday. The Socialist Proposal The following are some of the proposals the socialists regard as essential: --A civic probity law, defining the crime of trafficking in influence, providing for prosecution of unexplained wealth, and penalizing corruption of government employees and bribery more harshly. --Elimination of the designated senators at the end of their terms in 1997, as well as the suspension now of their right to vote on substantial political issues. --Establishment of a corrected proportional electoral system and rejection of the formula for expanding the number of candidates within the framework of the binomial system. --Establishment of the exclusive confidence of the president of the Republic as a requirement for the commanders of the Armed Forces and the forces of law and order. --Renewed sponsorship of the interpretive law allowing removal of the obstacle represented by the 1978 Amnesty Law in the realm of human rights.
