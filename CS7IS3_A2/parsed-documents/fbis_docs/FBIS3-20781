Lekovic: "`1 December' Electronics Industry Enterprise, Pljevlja: New Program Despite Problems"] [Text] The sanctions and economic blockade have significantly diminished the usability of facilities for manufacturing modern electronic and microwave machines, equipment, and systems; enterprise experts have turned to new programs--they are producing laser systems and radio-relay equipment; after the sanctions are lifted, they will announce several new programs for their main customer--the Armed Forces of Yugoslavia [VJ], but also for export. When production began in 1985 at the "1 December" electronics industry enterprise plants in Pljevlja, one of the designated facilities of the military industry, no one could have suspected that after seven or eight years of full-swing operation and prosperity, production would be cut by more than half and only one-third of the facilities would be in use. The effect of sanctions and the economic blockade has been that the production of one part of the equipment at the collective involving especially highly trained staff has shut down, while part of production has been adapted to the existing possibilities of the VJ and of the Yugoslav market. Lately, cooperation has been reduced to electronics industry enterprises in the FRY. The fruit of this rapid adaptation and of the reaction of experts to secessionism has been the "pilot" series of a type of telephone-telegraph device. "1 December" will perform the finishing work, and the production of more than 100 such devices has already been contracted. The Pljevlja enterprise will soon begin repairs on several types of weaponry and military equipment, especially radar and radar systems, electronic countermeasure systems for VJ ships, thermovisual systems for MiG-23 warplanes, radar detonators for air-to-air missiles, and various radio systems. Development of Laser Equipment The "1 December" enterprise is concentrating on the production of optronic laser systems and radio-relay equipment in cooperation with domestic firms. Thus preparations are being made for the production of laser rangefinders for tanks. The production of laser systems and radio-relay equipment has been necessitated by the new demands and needs of the VJ, because previously this equipment was manufactured in Slovenia. Nevertheless, there are serious obstacles to be overcome in the production process. According to the director of the enterprise, engineer Rados Beljkas, the biggest problem is the shortage of money and the serious economic situation of the Armed Forces of Yugoslavia--the main customer. Acquiring intermediate goods from abroad is also creating problems. "All of this has meant that utilization of our facilities is at 20 to 30 percent, which is very bad, because we have at our disposal the most modern equipment and a highly skilled work force, of which any European factory would be proud," director Beljkas tells VOJSKA. Of the 186 employees, engineers account for one-fourth. They are not all sitting around waiting for the sanctions to be lifted. The director says that "1 December" has good prospects, and that contention is backed up by the existing and new programs for the needs of the VJ. Many countries are also interested in this collective's production--Egypt, India, the DPRK, Russia--especially its detectors and radars. Rapid Adaptation Although the enterprise has been forced to send part of its workers on mandatory leave, it is quickly coping with and adapting to current market needs. Thus facilities are being used to manufacture products that are essential to the Pljevlja economy, especially industry. As there is no machine industry in Pljevlja, it has come to the aid of many enterprises by manufacturing machine parts that were previously imported or manufactured in former Yugoslav republics. Production of a metal dormer window is under way for KID "Velimir Jakic," together with components for blinds, window reinforcements, and doors. "The worst thing is to sit around and complain. Wages must be and, we are convinced, can be earned through labor," says engineer Slavko Krezovic, the head of the machine plant. During our visit to the "1 December" enterprise, we saw that the collective was not giving in and succumbing to the problems that are present in abundance. The most valuable impression comes from the fact that the high-profile experts and all the employees are capable of independently producing very complex electronic equipment and systems under current circumstances. Nevertheless, renewed prosperity for the enterprise is expected only after the economic blockade is lifted. [Box, p 37] First-Rate Equipment The "1 December" enterprise produces modern electronic and microwave machines, equipment, and systems. It has a closed technological process for producing electronic equipment at three production plants--the electrical plant, the machine plant, and the surface protection plant--with well-organized and professionally qualified services for technical preparation and quality control. The development sector deals with preparing and applying new technologies and products. The factory is equipped with top-rate equipment from the world's best-known producers. The electrical production plant has equipment for manufacturing microwave integral cars and modules for preparing and assembling stamped cars, measurement equipment for digital signal-processing, as well as an anachronous measurement room for recording antenna radiation diagrams at long range, with an automatic system for gathering data. Mass production of the most complex parts and systems takes place in the modern machine plant using sheet metal of various thicknesses and qualities, while in the surface protection plant all sorts of galvanic and organic protection is done. [Box, p 37] Through Its Own Devices An ambitious beginning was made in the manufacture of a large number of electronic devices. The first products were reconnaissance radar, a portable radar detector, and mechanical components for a radio-teleprinter system. In recent years, the development sector, through its own devices, has brought into "pilot" production a passive radio-direction finder for the acquisition, direction-finding, and tracking of low-flying air targets by azimuth, and a subsystem in an antiair system valued at more than $100,000.
