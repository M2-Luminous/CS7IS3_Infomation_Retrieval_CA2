I would also like to know your opinion concerning the possible creation of a Cuban hard currency certificate, at an exchange rate still to be determined, and if this is possible, would it the exchange rate be adequate? [Carranza] You are asking two complex questions. And first of all, these are my personal opinions. I think any of these measures you mentioned would be valid but only to the extent that they come within a context of measures and are part of a sufficiently coherent strategy. As I had said before, the economy is a system, and the economy does not operate on singular measures, but on well-prepared strategies within which the different measures are interconnected, playing a supplementary role, and this is what makes the decisions within the economic policy effective in the medium- and long-term, and also in the short-term. Thus, concerning the question about a change in currency, or about the freeze of bank accounts, my answer is that it depends on the manner in which the measure is implemented; it depends on the context of the strategy adopted. Taking this into consideration, whether it is part of an adequate strategy, surely a change in currency could be one of the measures that would help restore the country's financial balance. However, this very answer leads me to a second consideration: that there can be different types of hard currency exchange systems. There are different ways of exchanging currency. It has to do with the amount of money, and the way to handle the future hard currency certificate. There are also a set of technical matters that must be considered, and they would also depend on the set of measures to be adopted. The same thing would happen concerning a freeze of bank accounts during a given period. I would say that discussions on a well-prepared proposal, concerning the strategy for the country's economic feasibility, contemplate these measures, but in a general manner and not as a specific singular measure. [Diaz] Would you say the same thing on the possible creation of a convertible Cuban hard currency certificate? [Carranza] Monetary problems of the economy are the most complex of any economic system. As a consequence of the necessary measures adopted over the past few years to counterbalance the current crisis, Cuba has in fact authorized the circulation of two different currencies in the country. That is, the peso and the rest of the other currencies, which are convertible currencies, the most common of which is the dollar, as you know. This brings into the economy an abnormal situation which has been necessary because of the crisis situation as we have already explained it on different occasions. I think that, concerning money circulation, the strategic idea would be to recover normalcy within the country's monetary structure, and to achieve this, we must seek the reestablishment of a single currency in the country. This is my opinion. And when I say a single currency, I am saying it in strategic terms, referring to a a single money, a Cuban currency that will have no other parallel. This does not mean, in strategic terms, that possession of currency will be penalized. Possession of currency is one thing, while circulation of currency is quite another thing. One thing is that a citizen can legally have a given amount of currency, but it is a different thing to have this money to use as a means of exchange in the economy. This money, or the circulation of it, is what I believe must be changed into a single currency. Between these currencies, there is the possibility of creating this Cuban currency you mentioned, which would create a better situation than what we have now, because it would be a Cuban currency which would be under better control. But in a more strategic context, I think we must strive for a single currency that would deal with the exchange rate of the Cuban peso, and which will comply with Cuba's true economic demands and its relations with other countries. [Diaz] But Julio, suppose the money is collected one way or another. I think nothing will be achieved with the money that remains and which has no commercial value. That is, we must necessarily try to increase production, to increase supply. How can the current economic situation be improved when there is a scarcity of resources and inefficiency prevails. And how long would this recovery take place? Could it be achieved this year? [Carranza] Look, every time this subject is brought up, many people rightly say that ultimately the crisis will be solved by increasing production. And I believe this is a correct opinion. But before that we must ask a question, which I think is a key question: How are we going to create the conditions to increase production? That is the problem. If production could be increased by decree, then the crisis would obviously be solved because the problem after all is a production problem. But what the economy must do is to restore the conditions for promoting production. And here is where all the discussions must focus on the measures to be adopted, either short- or long-term measures. I think in a first stage -- which will begin when the National Assembly of the People's Government adopts the appropriate measures -- the objective will not be and could not be to increase production, but to restore the balance. What do we have within the current situation of financial imbalance? The economic upturn process is a very complex task. Under a given condition of greater economic balance, where salaries will regain their purchasing power and where other conditions will be created, we would be creating better conditions -- not just conditions, but the best situation for a recovery process. Then, this is the first condition I mentioned. We must restore the financial balance and create the conditions to increase production. Everything that can be done, small actions that can allow us to take small steps to increase production, especially the efforts being made by workers following their revolutionary awareness, is very important. But in general terms, we must recover the balance to push national production forward. This is the first point, and I am going to the second point. Concerning financial recovery, in order to make an evaluation of a possible recovery of the economy, we need, among other things, statistical data which I do not have at hand at this moment. Had I known some details perhaps I could give you a more authoritative analysis, but I need some statistical data. But what I can say is that under current conditions production recovery is a complex and complicated problem. It demands much effort. I must also say that although the objective is to grow, we must focus on the recovery of the financial balance. I also think that we must also take into account the fact that the Cuban economy has dropped considerably over the past few years. I can say that it dropped approximately 40 percent, and so the economy is already experiencing a tremendous downswing, and going lower than that will be very difficult. That is, we are experiencing the lowest level, and for this reason I believe that a new process could begin in a medium-term, a process of change in the economic policy, of a slow upturn until, to the extent that the conditions are created, production is increased in a more effective manner in the medium term. I want to add something which I consider important. It has been said that the Cuban international situation is very complicated because of the blockade, and because of the severance of relations we used to have with the socialist block, therefore Cuba depends on a recovery of its production. I want to say that these factors are very important, but as I said the first day, regardless of the different forms of internal production, despite the different economic policies, and despite the difficult international relations, the country can give a different productive answer. And this is the effort I believe we must make, because the economic policy and the organization of the productive areas depend on us and not on the world situation, although the latter might be very important.
