"Anyone who makes an investment in this field will gain the land-use right in accordance with the measures concerning the leasing of state land-use rights, and enjoy preferential treatment," said a municipal official. Shanghai has 35 million sq m [square meters] of dilapidated housing and other old buildings where 1.46 million households, about 60 percent of the total households in the city, take shelter. These edifices, which generally lack kitchen and toilet facilities, account for one third of the total residential areas in the metropolis. "To enable all its residents to have a living space averaging 10 sq m per capita by the end of this century, the municipal government plans to raise funds through various channels to speed up the transformation of the old urban districts," the official said. He noted that foreign business people are welcomed to join in the transformation in forms of joint ventures, co-operation or with sole foreign investment.
