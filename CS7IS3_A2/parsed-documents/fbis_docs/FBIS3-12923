Is sorrow sufficient? Can a revolutionary stand idle, doing nothing, while his people are being killed before his eyes? ['Abbas] Revolutionaries are full of emotions. I believe that it is normal to experience emotions first, before other values and reactions, including retaliation. Consequently, it is natural for any human being to become angry over such a massacre when he sees his people being brutally killed while they are performing their prayers. This affects us as human beings. [passage omitted] The normal state of affairs during the stage of conflict is that we should expect losses, and the fall of martyrs. However, what saddens us in the face of such a massacre is the current political formulas, the stands that conflict with our real principles, and the current miserable Arab situation. Great sadness is a major tool for a consequent action. The men who were martyred, the children who were killed, and the widows who cried deserve balanced measures that will alleviate their suffering and prove that our determination is still strong to pursue struggle to terminate occupation and to achieve independence. ['Abd-al-Majid] You said consequent action. What is the nature of this action? Will you resort to another option other than the option of a political solution? ['Abbas] Struggle is an integral and indivisible whole. However, any action necessitates a reaction, especially when you see your people being slaughtered. You must then look for an appropriate action. We have not relinquished armed struggle. As an organization, we still believe that armed struggle is a major tool to attain our people's rights in Palestine. Developments are escalating, and they are all related to what has taken place. We have great hope that God will grant us success and help us wipe away the tears of the widows and console the children who have lost their fathers and brothers. ['Abd-al-Majid] Can our sadness console the victims? ['Abbas] Sadness is not condolence, it is a human expression. The holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre makes us sad. The condolence in such a national cause is to make our people confident that armed struggle is still continuing, that the objectives for which martyrs fell and for which our people were exposed to such a massacre will not be forgotten, and that our people's blood will not melt away uselessly. The martyrs' blood must be a torch, granting the revolution further strength and lighting the road toward our goals. ['Abd-al-Majid] The way you deal with the national Palestinian rights is to some extent similar to that of Hamas. Do you have contacts with this movement? ['Abbas] As an organization, we have carried out armed struggle for more than a quarter of a century in a continuous manner that has left its imprint in the national, Arab, and international arenas. We have never been negligent in this field. Our vision has always been clear and it will remain so. Hamas and other organizations have similar ideas. In one way or another, we have contacts with the Palestinian forces that work within the national framework, regardless of their political stands. The closer their stands become to ours, the closer we become to these Palestinian organizations. We view Hamas with special appreciation, and we have contacts with it. I say contacts and not an alliance. These contacts might be developed. This depends on how close our political stands become in the future regarding struggle in our homeland. ['Abd-al-Majid] But do not you see that there is a contradiction between armed struggle and political action within the PLO framework? ['Abbas] This is an integration, not a contradiction. We are represented in the PLO and the PLO Executive Committee. We have developed relations with factions and forces that are outside the PLO framework. We also have relations with factions that left the PLO or that have adopted a certain stand toward the PLO leadership such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Our concept of integration is based on our reading of the PLO's current situation. In our opinion, the PLO still constitutes the moral entity of the people. In other words, it is the state of the Palestinians. [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-Majid] Following the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, U.S. President Bill Clinton called on the parties to the settlement to resume negotiations in Washington. In your opinion, why this hasty invitation? ['Abbas] We should speak about the U.S. role, taking into consideration that America is the legitimate father of the current political settlement. In brief, we can say that the settlement is a U.S. settlement. We are aware of the changes and circumstances that have contributed to drawing the features of the stage that produced the so-called peace plan. Based on this, the United States must be very concerned about the success of its Middle Eastern plan, which is represented by the establishment of a regional Middle East complex in which Israel will be the center of gravity, because it has fateful ties with the United States. In light of the repercussions of the massacre, the U.S. President's invitation came as a quick reaction aimed at protecting whatever he can still protect of his programs in the region. ['Abd-al-Majid] Do you have any advice for the PLO leadership? ['Abbas] Everyday carries new evidence of the blind and erroneous political course -- its uselessness, the extent of the harm it has inflicted on our people and cause, and the losses which could have been averted if the PLO had redressed its course, especially since there are no signs or indications regarding substantive Israeli concessions. There were huge national losses, and the Israeli and American demands are pushing the PLO toward making still further concessions. In addition to this, repressive and oppressive measures are still continuing, and they were crowned by the Hebron massacre. The only advice I have to the PLO leadership is to leave, unhesitatingly, this quagmire that it has led our people into, before the catastrophe becomes complete. [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-Majid] The reason behind your relinquishment of your seat in the PLO Executive Committee is still unknown, why? ['Abbas] My departure of the PLO Executive Committee was linked to my reading of the situation; the Gulf war and the PLO's political program paved the way for what has followed. It was my choice not to stay with the leadership dominating the PLO. As an expression of our commitment to the PLO, we nominated another comrade to replace me. [passage omitted] Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] is a different man than the one I used to know. He expresses aspirations and concerns differently from how he used to express then in the past. He speaks in a language that is not the traditional language of his revolutionary conversation with us. He uses the politicians' language. Despite all these differences, we are still concerned about our relationship with brother Abu-'Ammar, which is based on frankness and sincerity. ['Abd-al-Majid] How do you view your other half; namely, Jordan -- people and government? ['Abbas] Regardless of the details, we believe that Jordan and Palestine are an integral whole, and that relations between the Palestinian and Jordanian peoples go far beyond relations between any two peoples in the region. Our relations are very interrelated and affect each other greatly.
