A report in the French magazine L'EXPRESS represents Cyprus as a transfer point for dirty money. Central Bank Governor Avxendiou categorically rejected the report and added that it is not the first time that something like this has happened. [Avxendiou] I cannot rule out that there are isolated cases, but I reject the possibility and the claim that Cyprus is a point of systematic laundering of dirty money. [Konstandinou] Have there even been isolated cases of which you are aware? [Avxendiou] No, not even one case has come to our attention because if we become aware of something like this, you realize that the measures that we would take would be really drastic. [Konstandinou] In order to safeguard the banking system, Avxendiou said, there is continuous and systematic control of both Cypriot and foreign banks. All officials of all banks, he said, have been given strict instructions to be very careful in their dealings. The banks have also been instructed not to open an account for anyone unless they first prove their identity. [end recording]
