FBIS4-34436 "drlat118_c_94012" FBIS-LAT-94-118 Daily Report 18 Jun 1994 MEXICO Demands Peace Efforts Continue Demands Peace Efforts Continue PA1806124094 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 18 Jun 94 PA1806124094 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network Spanish BFN [From the "Evening News Panorama" newscast] [Text] Ernesto Zedillo, Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, presidential candidate, has demanded the continuation of peace talks in Chiapas. Zedillo has said reconciliation is something that interests all Mexicans; therefore, this process must continue. The presidential candidate also commented on last night's statements by Manuel Camacho Solis: [Begin Zedillo recording] I believe that in relinquishing the responsibilities the president of the republic has given him, Manuel Camacho made the best decision for himself and the country. It seems strange the former commissioner is trying to blame me for quitting when all I did was demand a permanent and just peace. Furthermore, I have learned that before the Zapatist National Liberation Army issued its communique and before I made my statements, the former commissioner had already said he was planning to resign his commission in Chiapas and do other things. I hereby reiterate the peace efforts must continue. This is a matter for all Mexicans, not only for one person or group. In light of the government of the republic and the Mexican people's reconciliating spirit, the withdrawal of the former commissioner should not be an excuse for the reappearance of violence.
