The probe is being organized by the Environmental Protection Committees of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the State Council. All violators will be punished and their actions released to the media, said Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing committee. Wang said some people still work against State laws and stipulations on environmental protection. New industrial projects have been built without reporting to the local environmental departments and some have caused large amounts of pollution. The poaching, killing and sale of endangered animals under national protection is still rampant in some places. And inspectors will be looking to get rid of small cement plants, paper mills, petrochemical works and smelting furnaces that have been banned but are making a comeback. The new effort will target 10 provinces and autonomous regions: Hebei, Jilin, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hunan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, and Guangxi. The inspections will check on law enforcement, environmental controls and wildlife protection, in addition to the implementation of STate regulations on forestry, water and soil preservation. Song Jian, Director of the State council's Environment Protection Committee, called for changes in the law to include criminal penalties as severe as those faced by smugglers and drug traffickers. Such penalties should include jail, he said. Xie Zhenhua, director of the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), reported the illegal poaching, killing and smuggling of protected wild animals had survived despite repeated government sweeps. Some hotels and restaurants still make a fortune out of dishes based on rare animals. Xie said some regions have brought in foreign projects that fall short of Nepa requirements, while others have imported harmful waste. Technologically poor equipment and a lack of counter-pollution measures in many rural enterprises account for severe pollution and ecological disturbance in a wide range of areas, he said. City residents most often complain about pollution from waste water, waste gas and trash and noise. Some areas have eagerly launched high energy and pollution-prone projects at the expense of the environment as they greedily pursue short-term economic benefits, the official said. Air quality in only a few of the 500 major cities has reached the State's first-grade standard, he added, and acid rain has spread from South China to some hinterland districts.
