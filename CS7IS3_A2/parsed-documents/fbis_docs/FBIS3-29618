Four days before meeting finance leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations, Mieno said in a Tokyo speech that the recent resurgence of the yen had "clearly gone too far." The yen has eased against the dollar in recent days from last week's trade woes-prompted jump, with dealers citing apparently repeated yen-selling interventions by Japan's central bank. Mieno said that a surging yen could again dampen Japanese corporate sentiment, which he said had been showing glimmers of improvement since the year began. He said he wants to watch the effect of corporate sentiment on economic recovery, but repeated that no clear signs of a turnaround are visible. Mieno said the economy remains weak, repeating that corporate capital spending is still sluggish and personal consumption is weak overall, despite a few bright spots. The basis for recovery, however, is firming, he said. Capital stock adjustments will take time for full completion, but recovery can begin before that process is finished, he said. Mieno also appeared to quash expectations of an imminent interest rate cut, saying the central bank's record low official discount rate, as well as money market and bank lending rates, are all low enough to support corporate restructuring. He stressed that he is taking a long-term perspective in monetary policy to support sustainable, inflation-free growth and prevent a resurgence of the speculative "bubble" of the late 1980s. Banks remain reluctant to lend and companies reluctant to invest, Mieno said, adding that a "steep, large correction is needed" for financial institutions to clear their bad loans and corporations to improve their balance sheets. Moreover, financial institutions should not focus solely on liquidating bad loans but should also show entrepreneurship to revitalize their businesses, he said. Repeating that the main task rested with the efforts of corporations and institutions, Mieno said the authorities should pave the way. He said the central bank will do its part and called for government "leadership" in such areas as deregulations included in its recent fiscal stimulus package, saying he hopes deregulation does not remain simply a slogan. Deregulation would give companies and institutions the chance to use their "innovation potential" in new businesses and products, he said, calling deregulation and innovation the "wellspring of growth." Mieno said deregulation can also play an important role in reducing Japan's trade imbalances with other countries.
