FR940912-1-00049 FR940912-1-00011 Subsection J of the Fact Finders Act (43 U.S.C. 526) also required the revenues generated by the sale of surplus water under the Warren Act (43 U.S.C. 523) to be deposited as a credit to the project. Therefore, the disposition requirements of Subsection I were restricted to the revenues generated from the uses specified in that subsection. On May 9, 1938, Congress, with the passage of the Hayden-O'Mahoney Amendment to the Interior Department Appropriation Act of 1939, altered revenue crediting requirements by providing that all of the revenues generated in connection with any irrigation project, including the incidental power features, would thereafter be a credit to the Reclamation fund. This provision excepted those cases in which law or existing contract provisions provided for a different use of these revenues, such as reflected in the passage of legislation authorizing the establishment of special accounts, specific revenue crediting directions, and/or revolving funds that govern the management of revenues from specific projects. Additionally, the provision provided that when construction costs of the project that were allocated to power had been repaid and the revenues from the sale of power were no longer required to meet contractual obligations to the United States, the net revenues from the sale of power would be credited to the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts. Thus, the Hayden-O'Mahoney Amendment protected existing contracts with valid direct revenue crediting provisions, but removed the opportunity for future Subsection I application. The sources of the revenues covered by the Hayden-O'Mahoney Amendment are all inclusive as indicated by the language of the provision (43 U.S.C. 392a). It should be noted that during the years that the Fact Finders Act provisions were available, Reclamation projects started to become multi-purpose in scope. Due to this evolution from single purpose (irrigation) to multi-purpose (municipal and industrial, irrigation, power, flood control, etc.), the focus of project repayment no longer rested entirely with the irrigators. The repayment of project construction was now allocated among the various water users; municipal and industrial users and power facilities, as well as the irrigators. To further disperse the repayment responsibilities, Congress deemed certain purposes, such as flood control, to be in the public's best interest and as such made them nonreimbursable by the project beneficiaries. The passage of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 provided the next major impact on the repayment of Reclamation projects. Specifically, Sections 9 (c), (d)(3) and (e) introduced: (1) The 40-year repayment schedule as standard rather than on the ``as requested'' basis of the 1926 Act; and (2) the concept of ``ability to pay'' (43 U.S.C. 485). The concept of ``ability to pay'' allowed the revenues generated from approved project purposes, such as power, to be used to help repay the portion of the construction cost allocated to irrigation. This plan is implemented by assessing the financial resources of the water users and assigning to them responsibility to repay that portion of the construction costs allocated to irrigation on the basis of their ability to pay. The remainder of the construction cost allocated to irrigation was assigned to other project users. In this way the legal requirement for a full return of the project costs would be met. For example, power revenues in excess of the amount needed to repay the power component of project construction may be used to make up the difference between the amount the irrigators were able to pay and the costs allocated to the irrigation purpose. By introducing ``ability to pay'' Congress provided assistance to the irrigators that did not involve using revenues derived from Federal lands as a direct credit to the water users. Thus, while the direct crediting aspects of Subsection I of the Fact Finders Act of 1924 were removed by the enactment of the Hayden-O'Mahoney Amendment of the Interior Department Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 1939, which directed that all revenues would be a credit to the Reclamation fund, Congress did not abandon the needs of the irrigators. Indeed, the water users benefitted from the introduction of the concept of ``ability to pay'' in the Reclamation Project Act of 1939.
