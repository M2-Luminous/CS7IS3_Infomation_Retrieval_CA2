According to statistics, the office working personnel of the provincial party committee already have subscribed for the bonds worth 354,700 yuan or so, or an average per capita subscription of 300 yuan or more. To promote state treasury bond subscription work, on 14 April the general office of the provincial party committee held a special meeting of persons in charge of units directly under the provincial party committee and appointed selected persons to be responsible for the work and to contact banks, asking them to set up a distribution center in the office of the provincial party committee on 23 April. Principal leaders of the provincial party committee not only took the lead in subscribing for state treasury bonds, but also attached great importance to the work of subscribing for state treasury bonds. They have repeatedly instructed that it is necessary to mobilize the masses of people to subscribe for state treasury bonds. Xie Fei, secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed out at a recent provincial study class for city party committee secretaries that it is necessary to mobilize cadres and the masses of people to buy state treasury bonds energetically. This is a glorious task of making contributions to the state. Standing committee members of the provincial party committee and members of the leading bodies of units directly under the committee should take the lead in buying state treasury bonds so as to help bring the bond subscription work to a climax. It is necessary to organize forces to give wide publicity to the work, set up more distribution centers, do the work at subscribers' doorsteps, and make the work convenient for the masses of people. One should enhance the sense of urgency toward this work. At present, the cities of Zhongshan and Yangjiang have filled their state-assigned quotas for sales of 2-year state treasury bonds.
