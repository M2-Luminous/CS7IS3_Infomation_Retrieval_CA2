FR940207-1-00049 FR940207-1-00013 Monday February 7, 1994 Part II Environmental Protection Agency 40 CFR Part 61 National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 25␣/␣Monday, February 7, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 61 [FRL 48&hyph;357] RIN 2060&hyph;AE23 National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA is supplementing its December 31, 1991 proposal to rescind 40 CFR part 61, subpart T (subpart T) as it applies to owners and operators of uranium mill tailings disposal sites licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or an affected Agreement State (Agreement States). This document supplements, and does not withdraw EPA's prior proposal to rescind. This document describes and invites comment on provisions for reconsideration of rescission and reinstatement of subpart T, and describes relevant events that have occurred since the December 1991 proposal. Additionally, EPA invites comment on the Agency's proposed determination that the NRC regulatory program protects public health with an ample margin of safety, including specific aspects of that determination. Neither proposal applies to uranium mill tailings disposal sites regulated under subpart T that are also under the control of the Department of Energy (DOE). As a National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) promulgated on December 15, 1989, subpart T regulates emissions of radon-222 into the ambient air from uranium mill tailings disposal sites. EPA is requesting comments only on the contents of this notice and has included a specific request for comments as to certain aspects of this proposal. EPA is establishing a 45 day comment period for receipt of all comments. DATES: Comments concerning this proposal must be received by EPA on or before March 24, 1994. A public hearing will be held on March 9, 1994, in Washington, DC if a request for such a hearing is received by February 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted (in duplicate if possible) to: Central Docket Section LE&hyph;131, Environmental Protection Agency, Attn: Air Docket No. A&hyph;91&hyph;67, Washington, DC 20460.
