[Begin Alarcon recording] I want to say, first of all, that we must have a scientific approach, trying to do things rigorously, trying to get to the roots of the problem, as many have said. I can assure you that if the much ballyhooed measures existed in somebody's pocket -- please, give us the benefit of the doubt by not taking us to be so stupid as not to realize that the country's problems are so serious and complex that we have never thought of pulling those much discussed measures out of our pockets. This looks like a secondary issue, but it is not. We must be aware that these problems are not easy and simple; they will not be solved the day after the National Assembly meeting. [end recording] The parliament at the Cenic was not at the level of others insofar as analysis of the center's efficiency is concerned, and Alarcon said that the most important decisions must be adopted in the workers parliaments. [Begin Alarcon recording] I have seen measures adopted here by workers who do not have a dining room, who have no work clothes, who have no work shoes or protective gloves for handling harmful substances, but who have been able thoroughly to discuss the concrete problems of that factory or unit, to see ways to produce more at lower cost; or in the work centers where they have to pay 1.60 or 1.30 pesos a meal, they agreed to reduce that deficit -- because it is part of the country's deficit -- they agreed to pay for what they are receiving. These are two examples that come to my mind after participating in several dozen workers parliaments over the past few weeks. These are concrete measures our hard working people are adopting at this moment; and here there are people working under deplorable and difficult conditions and who also produce products that generate currency they never see, not even from a distance, and who neither can have, as is the case with some workers of the tobacco industry, working conditions like those in other areas of our country. [end recording] Alarcon also discussed adjustment measures implemented in other countries, based on reduced social expenditures and wages, on worker layoffs, and the closing of unprofitable companies. Alarcon said: [Begin Alarcon recording] The essential question is this: Do we want this? Do we want the free, universal education program to be eliminated? Do we want the free, public, and universal health program to be eliminated? Do we want the aged, the retired worker, or the worker who lost his job to be abandoned? If that is what we want, I think we do not need workers parliaments or ANPP meetings, if adjustment measures are adopted every day. The only thing we have to do then is to take the IMF model and implement it; that is all. In our case -- and I can tell you I am fully convinced that this is the opinion of the overwhelming majority of the workers of this country -- we can start from the basic element, that we must save this social project; that we must look for a socialist way to face this problem, and not by privatizing public education and health, abandoning the poor and the aged or disregarding their right for social solidarity, liberating prices, eliminating subsidies on production, etc. What will prevail then is the law of the jungle, which is capitalism. [end recording] The ANPP president stressed the double objective of the parliaments in work places. [Begin Alarcon recording] One important aspect of these workers parliaments, of these meetings, has been that each and every one has been able to express his or her opinion or point of view, or any idea on how to face the national, general problem of the country's financial situation, but also and above all, to analyze the specific set of problems of each center, to try to identify problems and solutions the unit might have, and especially to see that the solutions found to those problems are implemented. I can tell you that in some of those meetings in which we participated we have been able to verify with satisfaction that more than one of those measures adopted by the workers are in effect. Besides -- we have been able to verify this in the area of tobacco -- the same factories we visited in January and in February, factories that through their workers parliaments began to discuss concrete measures to be adopted in those factories, today are producing 110 and 115 [figures as heard] more, depending on the factory, as compared to their production before that date. [end recording] Alarcon said that we Cubans have grown accustomed to free and universal education and health programs, social security, and welfare. But these benefits cost the country 4.3 billion pesos every year. [Begin recording] Much has been said about the prices of some products on the black market. And it is true. It is also true that supply to the market controlled by the state is experiencing a slump. We are all aware of this. But for many years, and also today, the scarce products, with very few exceptions, have been subsidized for many years. That is, what we pay for rice today is not what it costs or what the state pays for it, because it must be bought from elsewhere in the world and must be paid for in hard currencies, currencies which are associated with the hard currency stores but do not exist for hard currency stores alone, but for many other things. We can also talk about bread, because many workers complain about the quality of bread, etc. But bread does not just fall from the sky as manna; it comes out of the oven, and wheat to become bread must be put into that oven. And wheat must be purchased at a price which is not what we pay for bread. Bread may be of poor quality and scarce, but for years these products have been subsidized by our society. By subsidizing that staple product the country has been spending more than 400 million pesos every year. [end recording] Alarcon said that 69 percent of our industries are not profitable, and that keeping them in operation costs more than they contribute, especially since they do not have the raw materials or input they had before, because they have lost the market. However, we are not going to follow the neoliberal policy of closing those industries and laying off workers, because they are not to blame for the drop in the country's import capacity from more than $8 billion to $1.7 billion in 1993. To solve the current economic situation, preserving the conquests of socialism, is very complex; but it is worth making all necessary effort. And for this reason the parliaments have been called in the work places. These were some of the basic ideas expressed by Ricardo Alarcon on closing the workers parliament at the Cenic.
