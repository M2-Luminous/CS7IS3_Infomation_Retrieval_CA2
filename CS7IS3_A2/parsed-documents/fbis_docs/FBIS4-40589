Kozyrev told State Duma deputies that the letter was evidence of "an intensive exchange of information through diplomatic channels" about the situation on the Korean peninsula. The former U.S. President met with the higher leadership of North Korea, including President Kim Il-song. As Christopher's message states, Carter's private mission seems to have given rise to some hope that the North Korean side is closer to an agreement with the world community concerning verification of its nuclear sites. "I think that can only be welcomed," said Kozyrev. He also added that Christopher, besides describing the results of the mission, cautioned that all the circumstances have yet to be made completely clear.
