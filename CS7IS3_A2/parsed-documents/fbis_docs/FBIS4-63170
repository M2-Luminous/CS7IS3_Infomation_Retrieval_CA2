In expert opinion, the situation at the works is controllable so far, but in three months all the available tanks for collecting the waste products will have been filled to capacity. The Russian Government instructed the ministries and departments concerned to suggest possible wayouts. The Ministry for Emergencies, the Ministry for Nuclear Industry, the Ministry of Public Health and naval forces proposed several ways to solve the problem, but they cannot be realised for lack of funding.
