FBIS4-20643 "jpjst015__l94022" JPRS-JST-94-015-L JPRS Science & Technology Japan 12 April 1994 AEROSPACE Present Status of Research Future on Space Transportation Present Status of Research Future on Space Transportation System 43070064E Tokyo NASDA REPORT in English Fall 93 p 6 43070064E Tokyo NASDA REPORT English CSO [Text] In July 1993, the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer and Return System (chaired by Shigebumi Saito, Professor Emeritus of the University of Tokyo) of the Space Activities Commission (SAC) concluded a report on Space Transfer and Return System. The report pointed out that, considering the variety of space activities in the 21st century, the research and development on an unmanned winged re-entry vehicle launched by an expendable launch vehicle to meet the needs of the early 2000s should be started. It also pointed out that it is important to conduct a flight test in this century using a transportation technology test vehicle. FIGURE The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) is conducting the space transportation system research in accordance with the SAC guidelines described below. - Design study on a transportation technology test vehicle which can be launched by H-II launch vehicle to establish system technology covering subjects from the launch of an unmanned winged re-entry vehicle to atmospheric re-entry and landing is being conducted. - The experiment vehicle, Orbital Re-entry Experiment (OREX), which simulates the structure of the nose portion of a winged space transportation vehicle, was trial-produced and is being serviced at the launch site for the orbit re-entry experiment. OREX will be launched by the H-II Launch Vehicle Test Flight No. 1 scheduled for launch on February 1, 1994. It will acquire data related to structural materials and designs which resist high temperature when it re-enters the atmosphere from orbit. - Preparation is being made to launch lift vehicle by the J-I rocket for flight at an altitude of 100km to acquire flight data during hypersonic flight (at mach 15) of the winged re-entry vehicle. - Preparation is being made for small-scale automatic landing experiments. A scale model of the winged transportation vehicle will be released from a high altitude and allowed to automatically land on the runway using a fully automatic guidance control.
