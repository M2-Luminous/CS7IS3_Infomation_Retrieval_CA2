Introducing the NP's manifesto at its federal congress on Thursday [3 February], he said only the NP possessed the experience, resources and expertise to meet the challenges ahead. The ANC [African National Congress] had no experience of government, was toying with discredited policies which had brought disaster wherever they had been tried and its leadership included many SA Communist Party members with their own hidden agendas. "I promised to lead the way to a new South Africa in which all would enjoy greater freedom. The transitional constitution, which has been negotiated by the NP, goes a long way toward fulfilling this promise. "It extends full political and civil rights to those who previously did not have them and greatly strengthens the rights of those who did. "I am calling on you to help the NP to defend, consolidate and build on the progress we have made." He says historic challenges will face the country after the election including those of stimulating rapid economic growth, providing decent facilities for millions of South Africans and that of national reconciliation. Mr de Klerk says the NP is open to all who support the common vision of peace and security based on the rule of law, a non-racial democracy which will promote the dignity and full development of all, freedom of religion, sound economic policies which include a fair tax system, protection of minority rights and decent, affordable and efficient education, health care and social services. "If you share this vision, then join me by voting for the NP. Work with us and support our vision for the future."
