[Stoiber] I will first mention management training for Hungarian entrepreneurs held by the Munich East-West Management Center -- the Hungarian side is making efficient use of this. There is close cooperation in education: I am referring to the exchange of kindergarten nurses and visits offered for teachers. Bavaria is helping to retrain Russian teachers and to teach the German language. [passage omitted] [Karcagi] What are the experiences of Bavarian investors: What difficulties should they expect? [Stoiber] They have very good experiences. It is favorable that the legal framework has been stabilized in Hungary. In my view, Bavarian investors are making use of the possibilities: Of the 3,000 German-Hungarian joint ventures, some 800 are operating with Bavarian firms, and Siemens has created 5,000 jobs in Hungary. There are minor problems, for example, Scholler and Audi should be paying customs duty on their deliveries retrospectively because the regulations have been changed in the meantime but, hopefully, this issue will now be settled. [Karcagi] What is the Bavarian reaction to Hungary's recent domestic political disputes, the battle over the media, the harsh tone of the election campaign, and the extreme right-wing statements? Has Hungary's image changed? [Stoiber] It has not become weaker; Hungary has a favorable image, that of a stabilizing democracy. The battles and the dispute are concomitant with the campaign that has started. This is normal in a democracy, and it is not my task to interfere in domestic political issues; however, I am certain that the polemics do not have a negative influence on Hungary's image. According to the indications, Hungary is progressing most consistently and is fastest on the road to democratic renewal. The situation is much more difficult in Romania, Bulgaria, and Slovakia.
