'Imran said he also hopes that the resolution will mark the beginning of a greater UN role in providing for the security needs of the occupied Arab territories prior to the transfer of these lands to their rightful owners. 'Imran, who was speaking on the sidelines of the opening session of the second Conference on Solidarity and Cooperation in the Mediterranean in the 1990's, remarked: We regret that a member of the Security Council abstained on a paragraph that affirms respect for the Geneva Conventions, particularly the Fourth Convention, which explicitly deals with the world community's responsibility for protecting people living under occupation from being killed, oppressed, or terrorized. 'Imran pointed out that not only are the Israeli settlers responsible for the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, but the Israeli authorities also are because of the prevailing settler mentality and the instructions given to the Israeli Army not to intervene to stop any Israeli murderer. He said the Security Council resolution on the incident should have been adopted in a more timely and urgent manner. The Arab League assistant secretary general asserted that Jerusalem is occupied territory according to Security Council resolutions. He said this issue must be given priority in the peace negotiations. He emphasized that Jerusalem's Arab identity is "beyond doubt" and said that all the Arab countries are committed to a full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem. 'Imran added: More important than resuming the negotiations is Israel's abandonment of its procrastination and evasiveness. The negotiations will be fruitless unless Israel foregoes its rejectionist mentality and complies with international legality. Explaining that the peace issue is a permanent item on the Arab League's agenda, he noted that the next Arab foreign ministers conference will discuss the Middle East peace process.
