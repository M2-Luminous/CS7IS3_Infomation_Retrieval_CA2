According to Liu Yingkuan, head of the provincial administration of power industry, by the end of last year the province had an installed capacity of 1.73 million kw, generating over 6 billion kwh [kilowatt hours] of electricity. The total production value of Qinghai's power industry last year was 639 million yuan (about 70 million U.S. dollars). Promoted by the advancing power industry, the province's gross national product (GNP) and total industrial and agricultural output value has exceeded 10 billion yuan (over one billion U.S. dollars) for the first time in history. As a resources-rich province, Qinghai boasts the country's largest reserves of salt, potassium, magnesium, lithium and asbestos as well as vast reserves of oil, natural gas and gold. Most of the mineral resources are located in the Qaidam Basin, dubbed the "treasure bowl" of China. The Yellow, Chang Jiang and Lancang Rivers flowing through the province promise great potential for development of the hydro-power industry. The province's proven exploitable reserves of water power stand at 21.65 million kw. Over ten large and medium-sized power stations can be built along 276 kilometers of the Yellow River between Longyang Gorge and Sigou Gorge. The Longyang Gorge Power Station with an installed capacity of 1.28 million kw has produced over 26 billion kwh of electricity since it was put into operation in 1989. That has relaxed the constricted supply of electric power in northwest China and also attracted over 30 big industrial enterprises, such as the Qinghai Aluminum Plant and the Minhe Magnesium Plant. Two key state power projects -- the Lijia Gorge Power Station on the Yellow River, with an installed capacity of 2 million kw, and the Xining Qiaotou Thermal Power Plant -- are now under construction in Qinghai. Construction of another medium-sized hydro-power station is scheduled to start this year. In order to bring the power industry into full play in local economic progress, the province has also attached importance to construction of small hydro-power stations along its 108 rivers including the Golmud, Longwu, Bayin, Baishui and Babao. Up to now, more than 160 small power stations, with a installed capacity of 110,000 kw each, have been built on the rivers.
