In their semi-annual report the so-called economic wise men said that while it is true that we are experiencing a recovery, there are still major problems that remain unsolved -- not least on the labor market where thousands are being kept out of employment because minimum wages are too high. According to the wise men, there is also the prospect of a significant fall in the balance of payments surplus that is under great pressure because we Danes have begun to spend money in earnest and are consequently boosting imports. At the same time the new vacation arrangements could -- if they are made permanent -- give rise to a need for tax increases or public spending cuts. Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft rejects the wise men's objections. "The wise men take too gloomy a view of the Danish economy and it looks to me as if the report is based on figures that are too pessimistic and data that is outdated when compared with the data made available by the government," Mogens Lykketoft said. The wise men's report comes as a welcome helping hand for the nonsocialist opposition that will use its conclusions in the Folketing session's closing debate today to attack the government's economic policy. "The government is squandering the economic recovery," Liberal Party deputy chairman Anders Fogh Rasmussen commented. He is backed by Conservative People's Party leader Hans Engell who believes that the wise men have documented some serious holes in the government's economic policy. Chief economist Jorgen Damgaard of the Jyske Bank shares the wise men's concern over developments: "The wise men had to call for adjustments in financial policy for a long time. Now I hope that they will not have to call for as long for a tightening-up of financial policy," he commented.
