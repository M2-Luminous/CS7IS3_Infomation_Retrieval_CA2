Mak and B.A. Hamzah: "Navy Blues" -- from "The 5th Column"] [Text] Since World War II, Thailand's defence has been focused landward, on the northwestern trans-Mekong region. Today that focus appears to have changed. As the Thai military expands and modernises its forces, it seems to have taken a heavy maritime bias. Such a shift is not immediately explicable, given that Thailand has no real external threats to its maritime security. So long as good relations exist with China, Bangkok need not fear Beijing, and even India's forces serve more as a counterweight to Indonesia than a threat to Thailand. The more likely explanation for the Thai navy's ambitious modernisation drive is Thailand's desire to protect its economic infrastructure, especially since the nation's industrial and economic zones are located along or near the coast. Whatever the reason, it is quite clear that the Thais are attempting to build a "two-ocean" navy to maintain simultaneous control over its eastern and western seaboards, respectively the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. Long-term plans include the acquisition of two helicopter carriers, the addition of three new naval bases, the construction of new frigates and, ultimately, a submarine programme. Together these plans suggest that Thailand may be thinking about more than simple protection of its economic interests. The country's former navy chief, Adm. Wichet Karunyawanit, has noted that although Thailand now enjoys "friendly relations with all its neighbours, we cannot afford to be complacent. We need to maintain our military preparedness." Some of Thailand's hardware choices appear to put steel into the admiral's words. For example, although the helicopter carrier contracted from Spain ostensibly would be used for disaster relief, it will be built with a 12-degree ski ramp. For helicopter operations such a ramp would be a distinct handicap. But it makes perfect sense for operating Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing aircraft such as the Harrier jet fighter. Indeed, sources say the navy is in fact considering the purchase of surplus Harriers from the Spanish navy. Likewise, a major port, north of Sattahip, includes a dockyard designed to do more than just support the helicopter carrier. Its mid-length gate design will also allow the simultaneous docking of two frigates. Altogether Thailand's naval expansion is the most dramatic within Asean. Naturally these moves have made some in Asean nervous. True enough, those who believe that Asean's future security needs will be met collectively may find Thailand's purchase of an aircraft carrier and more frigates reassuring. But Asean today remains far from any such arrangement and indeed cannot yet agree even on the establishment of a defence pact. And though the Thai navy's current chief, Adm. Prachet Siridet, has completed a regionwide visit to reassure his counterparts that Thailand's purchases are for purely defensive purposes, the question remains: defence against whom -- and what? An article last year in THE NATION, a leading Thai daily, may provide a clue. According to the article, by the year 2010 the U.S.-Thai security relationship would no longer be significant. Indeed, the U.S. by then would be Thailand's "Friendly Enemy Number One." The article further predicted that Thailand would re-ally itself with Japan, as it did during the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia more than a half-century ago. Most ominously, the article claimed that the Thai navy would become "the most influential policy decision-maker in 2010 -- since Thailand now has the world's third-largest fishing fleet" after Japan and Taiwan. This latter is not a comforting scenario for Thailand's neighbours. These neighbours harbour strong suspicions about Bangkok's aspirations for blue-water status, not least because Thailand over the past 300 years has had expansionist tendencies whenever it was militarily strong. Indeed, THE NATION even offered a scenario in the year 2008 in which a war is almost provoked when a Thai fishing trawler fitted with modern defence systems sinks a Malaysian patrol boat in the Malaysian fishery zone. Far-fetched? Not if you consider past incidents when Thai fishing trawlers deliberately rammed Malaysian patrol boats in an effort to escape arrest for poaching. In one incident last year, Thai fishermen abducted a Malaysian sailor to Hat Yai and released him only after official protests were made. One Malaysian sailor is still missing and believed to have been thrown overboard by the fisherman. The point is that Thailand has made a move to join the big league with its naval purchases, especially the carriers, and its neighbours need reassuring. Aircraft carriers, after all, can be regarded as offensive platforms for power projection, which is why all Southeast Asia fears China's planned acquisition of a carrier and why India's carriers provoked suspicion despite a substantive public relations effort to soothe fears. The one thing that is certain is that the Thai navy will make big waves when it takes delivery of its first carrier three years from now and embarks on its planned submarine programme. Will these be used to protect its fishing fleet? Are we witnessing the rise of a new maritime power flexing its muscles in Southeast Asian seas? Will the Thais trigger a new arms race? Or are they merely responding to Malaysia's purchase of two British frigates -- or China's expansion into the South China Sea? These are questions many in Asean are asking. And right now we have more questions than answers.
