FR940525-2-00178 FR940525-2-00100 Federal Highway Administration [FHWA Docket No. 92&hyph;24] Participation in the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Notice; extension of request for participation. SUMMARY: This notice extends the invitation to State or local governments or other public authorities to make applications for participation in the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program (Pilot Program) established by Section 1012(b) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). This document also contains a statement of future direction for the Pilot Program. DATES: The solicitation for participation in the Pilot Program will be held open indefinitely or until further notice. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. James R. Link or Mr. John T. Berg, Highway Revenue Analysis Branch, HPP&hyph;13, (202) 366&hyph;0570; or Mr. Wilbert Baccus, Office of the Chief Counsel, HCC&hyph;32, (202) 366&hyph;0780; Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 1012(b) of the ISTEA (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914) authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) to create a Pilot Program by entering into cooperative agreements with up to five State or local governments or other public authorities, to establish, maintain, and monitor congestion pricing pilot projects. Three of these agreements may involve the use of tolls on the Interstate System notwithstanding 23 U.S.C. 129, as amended, and 301. A maximum of $25 million is authorized for each of the fiscal years 1992 through 1997 to be made available to carry out program requirements. Not more than $15 million can be made available each fiscal year to fund any single cooperative agreement. In advance of completing its plan for implementing this program, the FHWA published a Federal Register notice on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22857), which presented general information about the Pilot Program and solicited public comment on a number of implementation issues [Docket No. 92&hyph;94]. The comment period closed on June 29, 1992. The FHWA published the initial solicitation for the Pilot Program in the Federal Register on November 24, 1992 (57 FR 55293). The solicitation period closed on January 25, 1993. The results of the first solicitation were summarized in the Federal Register on June 16, 1993 (58 FR 33293). The June 16 notice also extended the solicitation period until October 14, 1993. Extension of Solicitation Because the proposals received in response to the June 16 notice did not adequately meet the criteria for selection as pilot projects at this time, the FHWA has determined that the goals of the Pilot Program can best be advanced if the solicitation period is held open until further notice to encourage development of promising congestion pricing experiments. To promote development of projects, the FHWA will use a small amount of Pilot Program funds to assist a limited number of areas in carrying out pre-project activities, such as the development of public-involvement programs and activities designed to overcome institutional barriers to implementing congestion pricing. In addition, more attention will be given to parking pricing and other pricing experiments that would be supportive of future highway congestion pricing applications. The FHWA's program activities, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, will focus on nurturing the development of market pricing experiments in areas showing the most promise for implementing congestion pricing pilot projects.
