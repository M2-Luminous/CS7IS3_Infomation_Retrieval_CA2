From late April to early May, the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire [PDCI], which the late head of state led for nearly half a century, will hold an extraordinary congress to elect a new leader. The natural candidate to lead the ruling party is the new president, Henri Konan Bedie. This is first and foremost, it seems, an act of union. In reality, the PDCI, which had so far been able to contain its divisions, is showing them today in broad daylight. For the first time there is a strong protest movement within the ruling party, which has come out into the open. Djeny Kobina's Rally of Republicans [RDR] openly defies the leadership, particularly its secretary general, Laurent Dona-Fologo, the minister of state in charge of national integration, one of the new government's strongmen. Kobina and his friends do not want a head of state who is a party leader. They have their champion: Philippe Gregoire Yace, president of the Economic and Social Council. This man led the PDCI for several years and knows all its intricacies. If you know the relationship between Bedie and the president of the Economic and Social Council, this proposal might make you smile. In fact, the RDR pronounced itself especially in favor of a break with what it calls "a republic of injustices." It calls for the strict and clear management of public affairs, which should not be made any more difficult through the concentration of too much power. It does not want a return to the former practices of the old times of the Ivorian miracle. The era of cheap money is over. It has been replaced by a devaluation, which was preceded by economic difficulties which had already forced the government to be more realistic. Bedie is aware of the fact that he must hurry. He only has 18 months until the October 1995 presidential election, 18 months to move from the legality obtained by virtue of Article 11 to the legitimacy that obtained from the polls. [passage omitted] As an administrator Bedie must make the country move, but as a politician he has to win the election, which will be held within 18 months. In this field the new president and his team have left no stone unturned in occupying all the pillars of power, beginning with the media. Those which depend on the state have already put on new feathers. Ali Coulibaly and Yacouba Kebe have been relieved of their posts -- Coulibaly from Channel I of the National Television Network and Kebe from the FRATERNITE MATIN newspaper chain. The opposition press has not been spared either. Many of its more renowned writers are currently in prison. State television has regained the glorious moments it enjoyed under the one-party system. [passage omitted] The PDCI's extraordinary congress has given the president the opportunity to draw up "his friends" into the ranks. He does not want to lose sight of the party. He must, by any means, control it. This is one of his major war machines for the forthcoming election. In Bedie's entourage, it is commonly explained that: "We have a new president. We need to make him known and loved by the people. We are not going to give out power as a gift to those who are fighting us. Our opponents must fight legitimately to win. The congress is a good platform. It will be open and democratic. [passage omitted] The old political organization which he inherited is full of currents and divisions, whose origin is not just limited to the Bedie-Ouattara rivalry. Long before the violent demonstrations in March and April of 1990, and before the appointment of Alassane Ouattara as prime minister, the PDCI was already showing signs of internal strife. [passage omitted] It is up to the congressional delegates -- some 3,000 of them -- to play firemen, in order to enable Bedie to get a firm grip on the party and to use it as a weapon, especially against any eventual Gbagbo-Yace-Ouattara alliance, which some Ivorians are anxiously hoping for.
