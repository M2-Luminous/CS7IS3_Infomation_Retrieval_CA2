Why has this been forgotten in Russia? "The process of drafting a joint Russian-NATO document be dragged out for months or even years," a high-ranking Russian diplomat told IZVESTIYA. If that happens, there is little chance of signing a document: The closer the presidential elections come, the less desire there will be to establish partnership relations with NATO. Will Defense Minister Pavel Grachev drop a hint to the NATO members about this? He is awaited in Brussels, where they hope he will finally be able to explain to the North Americans and West Europeans what it is Russia wants from NATO. Although it does not seem that Moscow itself knows the answer to that question. "The signing of the Partnership for Peace program is secondary to Moscow," the Russian diplomat explained to IZVESTIYA. "The establishment of new relations with NATO in the political sphere and the recognition of Russia's special role on the continent and its right to influence decisionmaking are primary. NATO appreciates what has caused the delay in signing the Partnership for Peace document and is not putting pressure on us...." NATO's Partnership for Peace program, which has provoked a storm of objections in the Russian political world, emerged as a result of a request (not to say a demand) from Moscow that the East European and Baltic states not be admitted to NATO. At the end of last year this was a very important task for Russian diplomacy on the European plane. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel invited Andrey Kozyrev back to his own home in order to explain to him in an unofficial setting that all Moscow's former satellites wanted to join NATO and that NATO had no grounds whatsoever for refusing them. What did Moscow want from the West? Russia's vigorous diplomacy was crowned with the utter humiliation of East Europe and the Baltic states: At the top-level NATO forum in January the latter were not admitted to the North Atlantic bloc. Mindful here of Russia's interests, the Americans devised Partnership for Peace, a vacuous program which binds no one to anything. The lofty words uttered at the time about "the importance of the first move" were only going to fool the greenhorns. Only a few months have now passed, and Moscow, forgetting this background, is making complaints to the Americans and West Europeans: How dare you try to foist such a document on a great military power, a document which has been signed by the likes of Albania, Georgia, Lithuania, and other minor states? The games being played over Partnership for Peace are the result, first, of a knee-jerk desire on the part of the opposition to reject anything proposed by the president and government, and, second, an atavistic hatred and fear of NATO. The opposition refuses to understand here that the United States signed the same treaty establishing NATO in 1949 as Belgium or the Netherlands. However, this formal parity changes nothing as regards the correlation of real political weight and is forgotten when decisions are made. The vagueness of the NATO program is offensive to the East Europeans but convenient to Russia: You can negotiate about whatever you like. Cynically speaking, in the whole East European area NATO is really interested only in building relations with Russia. Our country's participation or nonparticipation in the Partnership for Peace program changes nothing in that regard. However, an ostentation reluctance to sign the program will have one obvious consequence: East Europe and the Baltic states will obtain yet another indisputable argument in their struggle to gain a NATO membership card. The readiness of above all the United States and Germany to oppose their pressure is in inverse proportion to Moscow's anti-NATO game.
