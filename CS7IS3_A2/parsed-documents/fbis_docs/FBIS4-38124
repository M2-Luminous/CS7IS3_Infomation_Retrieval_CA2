Iraqi Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi Jawad said that maintaining this pipeline should be done directly by the two sides. He asserted that Turkey should begin implementation of this agreement without consultation with the UN Security Council. The minister pointed out that the Iraqi-Turkish agreement on cleaning and maintaining the pipeline is not based on commercial considerations, asserting that the agreement was signed within a purely technical framework in order to maintain the pipeline which is liable to erosion and damage due to the Iraqi oil retained in it since early August 1990. The Iraqi minister said that Iraq and Turkey agreed to use part of the revenues of the oil contained in the pipeline to repay some debts which Iraq owes Turkey and to use the other part of the revenues to purchase food commodities, baby milk, and medical and pharmaceutical supplies from Turkish sources. The international resolutions do not ban Iraq from importing these items. In practice, however, they obstruct their importation because the Iraqi assets abroad are still frozen and Iraq is prevented from exporting its oil freely.
