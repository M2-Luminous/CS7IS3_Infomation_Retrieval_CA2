These differences are evident in the tone with which the peace process is "rejected." In the dialect of the entire external Hamas, rejection surfaces firmly and strongly. Rather, this tone harbors within its folds the features of a warning to the process supporters, whereas the tone of internal Hamas is characterized by moderation and projected with a sportsman-like spirit. The question that may occur to observers is: Is this difference a sign of a hidden and concealed split between Hamas' internal and external wings, or is it tantamount to a well-studied tactic that serves a specific purpose in the rhetoric with which the masses are addressed. To dot the i's and cross the t's, one must note the surprise which has resurfaced among observers now that the internal Hamas has clung to the principle of democratic opposition to the accord, declaring explicitly that its opposition has its redline, which is not to let opposition reach the point of internecine fighting and the use of violence between Palestinians. This surprise emanates from the fact that even before the peace process, violent opposition and clashes occurred because of issues much less significant than the process. The answer to this particular surprise leads to a basic fact, namely that the internal Hamas is fully aware of the proverb that, "He who receives the lashes is not like him who counts them." What this means is that even though the internal Hamas is in full agreement with the strategic position of the external Hamas, the former sees, with its awareness of the Palestinian people's real situation, that the "pain here is very great" and that the "majority of the Palestinian people," like Hamas, want their full rights. However, the people realize that within the given facts of the situation, it is impossible to attain this goal within the foreseeable future. It is certain that the people of the internal Hamas have developed the conviction that they, like all other Palestinians, are Palestinian in pain and hardship and that, simultaneously, they are Hamas people who, like all other Hamas people, cling to Hamas' strategy. This means that the internal Hamas realizes that the Palestinian people must not be pushed to the point of suicide and extinction and that, if there is a chance for ways of surviving the stormy sea of annihilation, then one must cling to them. I believe that with this move, Hamas adheres to its Palestinianism. Simultaneously, Hamas is fully eager to cling, along with its people, to the means of survival (the process), but without declaring that it is accountable for what follows. With this move, the internal Hamas maintains its lines of communication with the comprehensive Hamas strategy. One cannot interpret this position as being the result of Hamas' splitting into two parts. Rather, one can interpret it as part of the phenomenon of unity of the Palestinians on the need to preserve their survival as a people. The internal Hamas that is opposed to the accord, like the side that supports it, agrees that the Oslo solution erodes numerous Palestinian constants. However, it is certain that the Palestinian people at home want a breather. This position by Hamas toward the entire Palestinian situation, Hamas' adoption of a sportsman-like spirit in opposition, and its decision to avoid internecine fighting among Palestinians, all will leave their imprint on the future of the coming Palestinian entity, meaning that the internal Hamas will include preserving the Palestinian people's survival as a priority in its agenda. This question of keeping the Palestinian people within the bounds of the possible is some sort of a bond which, in my opinion, will enhance the Palestinian people's chance to prove to the world that they are capable of building a state, which is one of their rights in the first place. A meaningful summary of all we have said is that the hand of the internal Hamas, like that of Palestinians, is in the fire. The more Hamas crystallizes this fact in positions reflecting a sportsman-like spirit, the closer it will find itself to others, even to those who support the settlement, because [passage omitted, article incomplete].
