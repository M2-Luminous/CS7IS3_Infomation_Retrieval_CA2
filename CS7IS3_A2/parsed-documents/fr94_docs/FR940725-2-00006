SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Chapter 19 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace domestic judicial review of final determinations in antidumpting and countervailing duty cases involving imports from the other country with review by independent binational panels. When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel is established to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether it conforms with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination. Under Article 1904 of the Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1989, the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada established Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews (``Rules''). The Rules were published in the Federal Register on December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53212). The Rules were amended by Amendments to the Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews, published in the Federal Register on December 27, 1989 (54 FR 53165). A consolidated version of the amended Rules was published in the Federal Register on June 15, 1992 (57 FR 26698). The Rules were further amended and published in the Federal Register on February 8, 1994 (59 FR 5892). The panel review in this matter was conducted in accordance with the Rules. PANEL DECISION: On July 6, 1994, the Binational Panel issued its third decision in this review. The Panel affirmed in part and remanded in part the final injury determination and instructed the Commission to provide its determination on remand within 30 days of the decision (by August 5, 1994). Dated: July 18, 1994. James R. Holbein, United States Secretary NAFTA Secretariat. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17973 Filed 7&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;GT&hyph;M
