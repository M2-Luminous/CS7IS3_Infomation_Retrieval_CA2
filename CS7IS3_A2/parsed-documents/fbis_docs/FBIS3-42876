The parties that have support in the "towns and villages" have assembled their congresses. Of the democrats, Konstantin Borovoy (Party of Economic Freedom) (PEF) operated the most promptly, and he was followed by Gavriil Popov, who conducted the Second Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms (RMDR) Congress. It is interesting that the PEF congress was for the first time held behind closed doors. Party activists were clearly reluctant to present for general review the profound mutual discontent. The Yekaterinburg delegation accused the party leadership of having made a hash of the elections. This position was supported by PEF Cochairman Irina Khakamada in addition to rank-and-file delegates from the localities. She hinted that her party membership would depend on whether the PEF could work with the regions or would confine itself to the "individual political statements" of its leader. Yielding to the pressure of the obdurate regionals, the congress inserted in the leadership three cochairmen from the provinces. Konstantin Borovoy, despite the "intrigues," remains leader of the party and he called on his comrades for "strict opposition to the policy of the president and the government." The party hopes to rehabilitate itself as quickly as possible for the 12 December defeat by active participation in the local elections. The burden of the report of Gavriil Popov at the Second RMDR Congress amounted to the proposition that the Western idea of reforms in Russia had been defeated and that now "those who have made a mess of the reforms are being removed." Disagreements emerged over the assessment of the situation in the movement. Sergey Krasavchenko dissociated himself from the leader of the RMDR and declined to run for the Political Council. Popov formulated the reasons for the failure at the elections briefly: the RMDR had been too gentle in its criticism of the government and had failed to put forward its alternative, local structures had not been formed, too much time had been spent looking for allies, the propaganda campaign was insipid.... Judging by everything, the strategic miscalculations of the movement are connected with the protracted search for political self-identification. The RMDR simply cannot find its niche (or does it just not have one?). Were the government to be criticized harshly, how would the RMDR differ from "Yabloko" or the Democratic Party of Russia? If the pro-West course of the reforms does not suit the movement, why does it not form a bloc with the moderate patriots? Simply having failed to find for itself a place in the political spectrum, the congress decided "to strengthen party-mindedness" and expand the social base of the RMDR. In addition, the movement opposed early parliamentary and presidential elections and advocated a three- or fourth-month postponement of the local elections. The RMDR is proposing this timeout, probably, because it is well aware that it is not ready for the struggle for seats. The Russian Union of Youth (RUY), a founder of the Russia's Future-New Names election bloc, has also discussed its problems at a congress. The young people's thoughts on the election failure were, obviously, so bitter that as a result they decided to engage mainly not in political but cultural-educational activity. The reasoning is simple: The youth are apolitical, and the RUY has not found its niche. Against the background of the certain revitalization mimicked by the nonparliamentary parties of a democratic persuasion, the patriots have been totally inconspicuous. After not one patriotic party had made it to the second lap of the election marathon, they receded for a long time into the background. Why was this? As a rule, the leaders of the patriotic opposition attribute their failure to the unfair authorities. Mikhail Astafyev, chairman of the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP-PPF): "We collected 103,000 signatures, but we were debarred from the elections. We consider this step purely political, and its purpose, to clear the way for Zhirinovskiy." The patriots are themselves even embarrassed to acknowledge that they lost not so much to the authorities as to the LDPR and that Zhirinovskiy took away their electorate and put them on the sidelines. The traditional national-patriotic ideology appealing to the deep past proved less attractive than Zhirinovskiy's rhetoric addressed to the "glorious future." The doctrine has to be changed, of course, but in this case a modernized national-patriotic ideology could be a second edition of the LDPR program. This despite the fact that no patriot can rival Zhirinovskiy in a personal capacity. And these parties' "living space" is diminishing also. Sergey Baburin, for example, "has the impression that the government and the president are joining the patriotic movement." In his opinion, what the patriots have achieved over the course of two or three years is now recognized "even by Kozyrev." Virtually the sole patriotic organization that has retained its niche is the Congress of Russian Communities (CRC). No one, apart from it, bothers seriously with Russians from the near abroad, and the CRC has no rivals, therefore. In an interview with OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, Dmitriy Rogozin, the leader of this organization, declared: "The Second Congress of Russian Communities, which was held recently, showed that we are the sole mass organization which is developing rapidly. We are now working on separating out from the Congress an organization with purely political functions and uniting in it under the provisional name of Union of the Fatherland both patriot-fundamentalists and some democrats. And on the Congress retaining the function of a public ministry for the affairs of the Russian-speaking population in the near abroad." The Russian National Union (RNU) of Sergey Baburin is preparing a congress. It is contemplated introducing individual membership (it is not clear as yet how many members the RNU has), enhancing intra-Union discipline, and, generally, talking about what comes next. The activity of the RNU is today objectively receding into the background--for its leader, at least. The organization's main strategic mission, virtually, is the creation for the leader of a trampoline for a jump "into power." Baburin has "jumped" into the State Duma, and it is now important for him to assimilate this platform. He has formed the Russian Way group of deputies. It has just 17 members as yet, but Baburin is an optimist: "The Russia faction in the last parliament was formed over several months. I believe that our ranks will increase on this occasion also." The plans of the Russian Christian Democratic Movement (RCDM) are, as its leader, Viktor Aksyuchits, declared, "to unite and fight." Deprived of its headquarters, the movement has drifted apart into its separate quarters. Aksyuchits has complained that his own apartment is reminiscent of a party archives, and he does not have room to turn around. "How can a party lacking official channels of financing exist," the leader of the RCDM laments. According to him, the banks have been ordered, on pain of punitive measures, to freeze all accounts of patriotic organizations. The Constitutional Democrats (KDP-PPF) have split yet again. And although the split has not been recognized officially, no one is any longer in any doubt about it. At the recent KDP-PPF conference representatives of 11 regions (approximately half the party's active organizations) deemed the recent December party congress invalid and decided to hold it anew in March. The splitters are reproaching party leader Mikhail Astafyev with "left-extremist sentiments" and "nonparliamentary forms of work in the Supreme Soviet," which, in their opinion, caused a drift of supporters away from the party. In addition, Astafyev has been guilty of a "violation of intra-party democracy." The Kadets will in March, most likely, split into right and left--it could well be down the middle. Suspecting that they will not survive on their own, the patriots from time to time make attempts to unite. Without thus far the aid of the Communists, nothing has come of this. But the attempts have not been abandoned, and a new coalition began to be put together at the end of December. Its working name is the Movement of Civil and Patriotic Forces, the sponsors of the alliance including Viktor Aksyuchits, Oleg Rumyantsev, Aleksandr Tsipko, and Andrey Golovin. What brought together the RCDM and the social democrats and Astafyev's Kadets and the centrists who associated with the Civic Union? Only the severe shock following the election defeat, obviously. But as soon as the shock passed, the plan for unification began to crumble. Aksyuchits is now obsessed with the idea of resuscitating the Russian National Assembly, which was formed a year ago and which departed this life almost immediately. The patriots to the left of the RCDP and the Kadets (Rumyantsev, Tsipko, and others) intend to build an autonomous formation--a National Alliance. True, both give assurances that a union between them is still possible. The rest of the information is being kept most strictly secret. Insofar as it is hard to reproach the leaders of the future organizations with a dislike of publicity, it may be assumed that there is as yet nothing about which to speak in more detail. The contemplated association lacks not only an organizational basis but a theoretical base also. This is yet further testimony that the failures of the first multiparty elections were defeated for objective reasons. Some of them will attempt to restructure their organizations and modernize their programs, perhaps. But for many their best years are already behind them, and they will, most likely, depart the political arena without having found their electorate.
