The Decision sets forth the procedures that the DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $52,092.73, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Remedial Order that the DOE issued to Sunset Boulevard Car Wash (Sunset) on October 22, 1980.

Refunds will be granted to applicants who satisfactorily demonstrate they were injured by the pricing violations and who document the volume of gasoline they purchased from Sunset during the audit period. In the event that money remains after all first stage claims have been disposed of, the remaining funds will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 4501, the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA). Applications for Refund must be postmarked on or before June 1, 1995.
