Well, the other big money issue in Zimbabwe at the moment is a debate over who controls the economy. Many black business people complain that it is still controlled by a handful of whites and Asians. These racial overtones have been highlighted by outspoken speeches like the one by Vice President Joshua Nkomo recently. Now, an advert has appeared in the Sunday newspapers paid for by a local black businessman. The open letter is pretty hard hitting against the non-black business community and what it alleges is institutional racism in the financial sector, as Rachel Rawlings reports: [Begin Rawlings recording] According to the advert, today over 99 percent of Zimbabwe's post independence economy remains dangerously controlled and dominated by a mere 20,000 white and Asian minority business community. The advert goes on to say, what is more, some of our own black brothers and sisters in positions of trust and responsibility run the serious risk of being used as Uncle Toms by those who would wish to use them in defense of institutionalized racism. It is in reply to an advert placed in THE HERALD newspaper by the Bankers and Finance Houses Associations of Zimbabwe, which tried to counter allegations that banks were unwilling to lend to the black or indigenous business community. Although many banking institutions here are headed by black Zimbabweans, the advert claims they have been subverted to the interests of the white community, using the example of an extended simile: When you have some coffee and when it is truly black and too strong, what do you do? Of course you integrate it with white milk, you make it weak. It used to be hot, now it becomes cold, it used to be strong, now it becomes weak. This is how our black brothers as Uncle Toms would have been rendered tame and lame by the traditionally all white bankers associations, whose banks and financial institutions continue to practice institutional racism against majority indigenous owned businesses. The advert advocates militant measures: We can't tolerate any more of this misallocation of our resources when our children remain on the dump heap of unemployment. The people shall march on these banks and financial institutions to demonstrate against this continual indignity, wherever there are those who would continue to ignore the just aspiration of the 10 million blacks. The revolution toward indigenous economic empowerment can no longer be stopped or delayed, just as it was impossible to stop the Zimbabwe war of liberation. The advert comes at a time when the president has promised government will implement measures to help indigenous businesses and the government has issued a directive that 80 percent of shares in Stanbic Bank, Zimbabwe, should be owned by indigenous Zimbabweans. The strong words will raise the temperature of an already acrimonious debate in which race is playing an increasingly bitter part. [end recording]
