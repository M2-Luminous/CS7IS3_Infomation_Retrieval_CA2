This was how Grigoriy Karasin, the director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Press and Information Department, commented at a briefing today on reports of the arrival at the Zaporozhye AES [nuclear electric power station], the largest in Europe, of the first batch of fuel installations [toplivye sborki] from Russia as part of compensation for dismantled nuclear warheads. As the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said, all nuclear munitions had, in accordance with the statement by the presidents of the three countries, to be brought from Ukraine to Russia in order for them to be dismantled as rapidly as possible, while Russia for its part had to provide compensation in the form of nuclear fuel installation deliveries to Ukraine to meet the needs of Ukraine's nuclear power sector during the same period of time. In order to begin the process of compensating Ukraine, Russia had undertaken to supply it over 10 months with fuel installations containing 100 tonnes of low-level enriched [nizkoobogashchennyy] uranium for nuclear power stations. A minimum of 200 nuclear warheads off RC-18 and RS-22 missiles will be taken from Ukraine to Russia in the same period to be dismantled. In the opinion of Russian experts, the first consignment of fuel received by the Zaporozhye AES is enough to power one of the power units for a year, providing Ukraine with 5.5-5.6 billion kilowatt hours of electricity.
