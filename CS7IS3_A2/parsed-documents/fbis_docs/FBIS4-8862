More than 100 artillery shells were fired on Bosnian Serb positions in the area. The Serb side repulsed a Moslem infantry attack, in which it suffered no casualties, and the Moslems then continued to open artillery and machine-gun fire on Serb positions, the statement said. The attack proves correct the increasingly frequent reports about concentration of Bosnian Moslem and Croat forces towards Serb positions in the valley of the river Sava, where they are planning to cut the only land corridor between the Serb Krajina regions in the west and the federal republic of Yugoslavia in the east.
