The RS president also said that the crisis in the relations between the RS and the United Nations and the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] has been "overcome to a certain degree". After several hours of talks with special UN envoy Yasushi Akashi, Karadzic told journalists that it has been agreed that: An immediate cease-fire be ordered in the Gorazde area, as well as "certain separation of the forces, as far as this is possible," that maximum restraint be displayed in getting involved in any activities and provocation, and that everything possible be done in the humanitarian field. Karadzic said that UN helicopters will evacuate the wounded from Gorazde as early as tomorrow. "If we succeed in achieving a cease-fire and certain separation of the forces we can say that we are on our way to peace in Gorazde," the RS president said. According to the current agreement the parties in the conflict should withdraw from each other of their own accord, which should be a proof of goodwill by both sides, and then -- when the conditions are ripe to guarantee safety to UNPROFOR members -- some arrangement could be made to include UNPROFOR as well. The RS president also said that the crisis in the relations with UNPROFOR and the United Nations "is being overcome to a certain degree." "Some progress has been achieved today as regards the position of UN members in our territory. Everything has been done to enable their free movement," Karadzic said. He stressed that this order has not yet reached some command posts, "but it will in any case reach them." Yasushi Akashi confirmed that a cease-fire agreement with immediate effect in the Gorazde area has been reached. "We have also agreed that the forces have to be separated as soon as possible and that everyone should refrain from provocation and offensive activities. In the meantime we will continue with dialogue in order to reach an agreement which would lead to a more stabilized situation," Akashi said. He stressed that Karadzic agreed that an evacuation of the wounded from Gorazde will take place at 0800 tomorrow. "I suggested to Karadzic that relations with UNPROFOR be normalized," Akashi said, adding that UNPROFOR will remain impartial and its task will remain to bring the war to an end with the help of all sides in the conflict.
