New policies will permit foreign carriers to invest with Chinese airlines and also launch joint or cooperative airline companies. Foreign firms also can buy shares of Chinese airlines or help pay for setting up new airlines. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec) also announced in a circular yesterday that foreign businessmen will be allowed to invest in and build flying districts for civilian airports, including runways and taxiways and parking aprons. Foreign firms and individuals also will be encouraged to invest in other ground facilities--terminal buildings, freight warehouses, ground services, aircraft maintenance, air catering, hotels, restaurants and fuel. In constructing flying districts or terminal buildings, however, the Chinese side should have more than 51 per cent of registered capital, and both the board chairman and general manager should be Chinese. The Chinese agencies said that the government will continue exclusive jurisdiction over air traffic control. The CAAC will pick one or two domestic airlines as initial experiments in joint operations with foreigners. But in running a joint venture airline, the foreign investment will be limited to 35 per cent, and foreign voting rights cannot exceed 25 per cent. CAAC did not elaborate. The position of board chairman and general manager should also be undertaken by the Chinese part. The directives provide that the Chinese general manager can appoint foreigners as assistant managers and other subsidiary positions. Airlines with foreign investments will be treated equally with airlines owned and operated exclusively by the government The new policy also will allow foreign investment in aviation for crop and forestry spraying. Foreigners interested in such investments must obtain approval from CAAC. The contracts must be ratified by Moftec. Projects with investment beyond CAAC's approval power are subject to examination and endorsement of the State Planning Commission. CAAC did not specify the sum. Businesses from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao will be allowed to invest in the mainland's civil aviation on the same terms. Observers said that civil aviation sector is one of China's latest areas open to outside investors. They say the new rules are part of its efforts to open its aviation area wider to the outside world.
