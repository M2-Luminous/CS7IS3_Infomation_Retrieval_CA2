This is the first time for the country to provide reporters' names to the public en masse. The namelist was carried in a handbook entitled "Namelist of China's News Organizations and Reporters", edited by the PEOPLE'S DAILY, the Communist Party's official newspaper. Editors said that the publication benefits "the reinforcement of the relationship between media and the people, the improvement of social supervision on the news circle," and is "an action that holds responsibility to readers." An intensified information flow is pushing different walks of life to make frequent use of the media. The selected media include the most authoritative and influential newspapers, radio and television stations, and news agencies in modern China. China now has more than 2,000 newspapers and about 1,600 radio and television stations. "The publication helps us to know the basic situation of the media and improve management and morality in the media circle," said Liang Heng, vice-director of the Press and Publication Administration. The handbook lists the reporter's name, professional title, working department and reporting field. Photos were added for the leaders of certain news organizations. These names were provided to the editors by the personnel departments of news entities without informing the concerned correspondents beforehand.
