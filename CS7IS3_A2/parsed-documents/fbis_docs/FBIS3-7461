As of March 20, the Korean Silk Association had carried out its first quarterly plan at 101.2 percent. Setting itself the goal of fulfilling its plan for the first half of the year ahead of time, it is producing more silk yarn and textile than envisaged in the daily plan. The Taegak mine, the Unsan forestry station and the Kumchon disabled soldiers daily necessaries factory hit their first quarterly targets more than one month ahead of schedule. They had overfulfilled their daily quotas through an extensive movement for increased production from the beginning of the year. Notably, the October 13 youth smeltery has brought an unprecedented upswing in production by actively introducing new technology and advanced work methods into production, topping its first quarterly assignment 35.7 percent on February 15. First quarterly assignments have been fulfilled far ahead of schedule by many other units including the May 24 export fishery station, the Chiktong geological survey team and Unjon, Yonan, Paechon and Haeju youth railway stations.
