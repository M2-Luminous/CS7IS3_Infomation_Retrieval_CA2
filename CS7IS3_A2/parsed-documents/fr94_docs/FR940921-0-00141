(5) The specification range of the fuels to be used under paragraph (b) of this section shall be reported in accordance with §86.094&hyph;21(b)(3). (c) Methanol-fuel. (1) Methanol fuel used for exhaust and evaporative emission testing and in service accumulation of methanol-fueled engines shall be representative of commercially available methanol fuel and shall consist of at least 50 percent methanol by volume. (i) Manufacturers shall recommend the methanol fuel to be used for testing and service accumulation. (ii) The Administrator shall determine the methanol fuel to be used for testing and service accumulation. (2) Other methanol fuels may be used for testing and service accumulation provided: (i) They are commercially available; and (ii) Information, acceptable to the Administrator, is provided to show that only the designated fuel would be used in customer service; and (iii) Use of a fuel listed under paragraph (b)(4)(c)(1) of this section would have a detrimental effect on emissions or durability; and (iv) Written approval from the Administrator of the fuel specifications must be provided prior to the start of testing. (3) The specification range of the fuels to be used under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section shall be reported in accordance with §86.094&hyph;21(b)(3). (d) Mixtures of petroleum and methanol fuels for flexible fuel vehicles. (1) Mixtures of petroleum and methanol fuels used for exhaust and evaporative emission testing and service accumulation for flexible fuel vehicles shall be within the range of fuel mixtures for which the vehicle was designed. (2) Manufacturer testing and service accumulation may be performed using only those mixtures (mixtures may be different for exhaust testing, evaporative testing and service accumulation) expected to result in the highest emissions, provided: (i) The fuels which constitute the mixture will be used in customer service; (ii) Information, acceptable to the Administrator, is provided by the manufacturer to show that the designated fuel mixtures would result in the highest emissions; and (iii) Written approval from the Administrator of the fuel specifications must be provided prior to the start of testing. (3) The specification range of the fuels to be used under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be reported in accordance with §86.090&hyph;21(b)(3). (e) Natural gas-fuel. (1) Natural gas-fuel having the following specifications will be used by the Administrator for exhaust and evaporative emission testing of natural gas-fueled engines:
