FBIS4-43682 "drweu119__a94033" FBIS-WEU-94-119-A Daily Report 21 June 1994 ANNEX Germany Bundesbank: World Trade Improves Economy Bundesbank: World Trade Improves Economy AU1606124894 Hamburg DPA in German 0807 GMT 16 Jun 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLU AU1606124894 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- In the view of the Bundesbank, the evident recovery of international trade is now also pulling the Germany economy out of an economic low. "In the past few months, the west German economy seems to have overcome recession, and signs for sustained economic recovery are increasing," the Bundesbank writes in its recent monthly report. "In the weakest area of the economy -- the manufacturing industry -- the situation has improved lately." In the Bundesbank's view, the "harbingers of lasting economic recovery" have come mainly from foreign markets, whose stagnation was "one of the primary reasons for the recession." Starting in North America and Southeast Asia, impulses have spread to "a wide range of countries." "German exporters are obviously able to participate in the resulting acceleration of growth in world trade." Should export demands further rise, negative effects at home -- such as a drop in real income, rising taxes and rates -- would be more than set off. So far, the Bundesbank had assessed the prospects for the economy very cautiously. In its recent monthly report it now speaks of a "remarkable turn for the better," which, however, does not yet promise a change in the job market trend. The Bundesbank's national economy experts point out that, following the major slump, the west German economy was still at a very low level. "With regard to capacity utilization, we are now at the 1988 level, that is to say the period before German unification," and economic growth expected for 1994 is not sufficient "to prevent a further limited increase in unemployment." In eastern Germany upward development has clearly continued in the Bundesbank's view. "More and more enterprises are recovering shares in the east German market that they had temporarily lost, and are establishing themselves in western Germany," the monthly reports notes. "Successes on the domestic market are the first signs of increasing competitive strength for east German products following the restructuring of enterprises." The economy in the new laender, however, will require a lot more time in the search for new markets abroad. The Bundesbank argues that, in the long run, competitiveness and new jobs cannot be achieved with a one-time effort. "This will require a rather longer process, which also includes, not least, reduction of the tax and rate burden for enterprises." According to Bundesbank estimates, in 1995, the rate quota --taxes and social insurance contributions together -- will reach 45 percent of the GDP, compared to 40.5 percent in 1990, the tax reform year.
