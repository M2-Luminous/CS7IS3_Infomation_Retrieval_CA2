Sergey Filatov, leader of the President's Administration, now gives his opinion on the reasons for the conduct of Boris Yeltsin, his aides Yuriy Baturin and Georgiy Satarov, the State Duma deputies, and the leaders of the Prosecutor General's Office. A few days before the decision on the political amnesty was adopted, I attended the Duma Council session which discussed the draft of this document. No one supported the draft apart from Zhirinovskiy. Votes were cast against it by Shakhray, who predetermined the result of the 23 February vote, and by Lakhova and the representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation faction. They asked the same questions that we are asking today: What kind of political amnesty is this, is it not a cover for criminals to hide behind, and how is the decree to be implemented without causing distortions to the law? On the basis of these questions which remained unresolved in the draft decree, the deputies voted against it. However, a few days later they voted in favor of it. Yet the questions remained unanswered and the deputies were supposed to have adopted a document which would have addressed those questions. Who can explain this inconsistency? However, there is surely some consistency here. After all, by no means the least role in the adoption of the amnesty decision was played by those same people who opposed the president in the former Supreme Soviet. The only difference is that Viktor Ilyukhin, leader of the Security Committee and a member of the communist faction, came to the aid of Vladimir Isakov, leader of the Legislation Committee. There is a certain logic to the opposition's conduct. Its plan is this: Either the president does not intervene in its actions, in which case the opposition will achieve its goal, or the president does intervene, in which case he loses by setting himself against the legislative power. You can try that trick once, you can try it twice. But you cannot be sure that every time you do it all the senior officials will withdraw and leave the president one on one with that misunderstanding of the laws, which is what the opposition is doing. You cannot always count on the fact that the president will have the final say. There is a certain threshold, there are rules which every responsible official must abide by. But when you are expecting a normal constitutional process and they impose the complete opposite on you, this of course produces a certain shock. But it was agreed to refrain from such rules after the 12 December elections and work instead on the basis of constructive cooperation between the branches of power. But what has happened is that Baturin and Satarov, the president's aides, acted according to civilized rules and held talks with the State Duma, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Supreme Court but the latter merely played games with them. After all, the word "immediately" in the State Duma decision on the amnesty has nothing to do with jurisprudence. But instead of waiting for clarifications from the lower house of parliament on the mechanism for the enactment of its decree, it was set in motion straight away. I told Kazannik about this when I phoned him on the evening of Friday, 25 February. The first thing that he said to me was this: "At 0900 hours on 26 February I shall release them all from Lefortovo." I was worried that the decision was being implemented right away without clarification on the mechanism of its implementation. I put that question to Kazannik, and he replied: "If I do not release them, Kravtsev (deputy prosecutor general--T.Z. note) will." My second question was this: Why not hand the State Duma's decision over to the Constitutional Court, after all, it will continue its work on the basis of the new law any day now. Kazannik replied that this law does not exist at the moment. My third suggestion was to pass the Duma's decree to the Supreme Court, a structure that is in operation. To all these questions I received a negative reply. The final words which Kazannik said to me were these: "If I do not release them I will be charged under the article on exceeding my powers." No matter what one says about the need to obey the letter of the law, I am sure that the haste and inconsistency with which the Prosecutor General's Office acted are absolutely obvious. The judicial investigation which is now being conducted at the Russian Prosecutor General's Office on the instructions of its new leader, Aleksey Ilyushenko, will answer many of the questions about the circumstances of and reasons for the hasty implementation of the State Duma's decree on the political amnesty. I am also bound to note a certain aloofness on the part of the deputies, prosecutors, and judges to the reason why the amnesty was carried out. We have already been through this once before when Khasbulatov imposed his ideas and believed that he was acting in the interests of all society. If the reason for the amnesty was to achieve social accord, there is only one side which cannot take part in that process. After all, those people who left Lefortovo jail take no account of the fact that this was done for their sake. As a result, the last word has once again been left to the President, who to achieve real accord undertook the initiative to unite all the political forces in society for the elaboration of a charter on civil peace in the country.
