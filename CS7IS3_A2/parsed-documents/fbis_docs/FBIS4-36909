Speaking while on a visit to Abu Dhabi, Brahimi said that Sanaa had accepted southern proposals concerning the participation of neutral foreigners in a military committee tasked with supervising the cease-fire. Lakhdar Brahimi today briefed United Arab Emirates President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan on the recent efforts to resolve the Yemeni crisis. Following the meeting, Brahimi said that Sanaa accepted southern proposals concerning the participation of neutral observers in a military committee whose task would be to monitor the cease-fire. Brahimi said: I believe that it is a significant development that the north has accepted the idea of Yemenis and foreigners [monitoring the cease-fire]. Therefore, I think that progress has been made. Brahimi added that Sanaa's decision was conveyed to him early this morning. The decision represents a significant development because Sanaa had previously rejected any foreign role. According to a southern official, the team of observers may include officers representing several countries, including the five permanent members of the UN Security Council as well as Arab countries such as Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Oman.
