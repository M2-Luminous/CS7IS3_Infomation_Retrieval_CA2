Sangheli pointed out that we are brothers, but each of us has his own home and lives according to his own rules. Some representatives of Romania, as we know from our own sources, promote a two-faced policy concerning us, that is, openly they say that they acknowledge Moldova's independence, but behind our backs they claim that our republic is part of Romania, Sangheli stated. What strikes me most, he continued, is the stance adopted by Romania's Foreign Affairs Ministry, the representative of which a few days ago stated that in order to solve the fate of Moldova all Romanians should be consulted. I think that the best answer to such offensive assertions is the statement made by our president, Mircea Snegur, during the [5 February] meeting entitled "Our Home, the Republic of Moldova," in which he condemned the forces that support unification with Romania, after which he issued a presidential decree on organizing a public opinion poll among the republic's population with respect to the issue of Moldova's independence. It is regrettable that our desire to find out the opinion of our people has triggered such reactions on behalf of the Romanian press, proving that they do not understand history, and also triggered offensive assertions against Moldova's leaders. This is really foreign interference in the affairs of a sovereign state, the independence of which was first recognized by Romania, stated Sangheli in the interview he granted to ITAR-TASS.
