FR940111-0-00081 FR940111-0-00019 Record evidence indicates that ``casket handling fees'' prevent potential price competition and reduce consumer choice. Ninety-two percent of the casket seller respondents to the PAA Survey reported that their casket sales have declined since the imposition of handling fees; about one-third said that they have reduced or eliminated their casket marketing efforts as a result of those fees. 130 One industry observer testified that ``casket handling fees'' have caused the exit from the casket market of five small businesses who thought that they could gain market share by offering third-party caskets at lower prices. 131 Several casket retailers and others also asserted that these so-called ``handling fees'' impede price competition by removing consumers' incentive to price-shop for less costly caskets, and penalize consumers who do shop. 132 130 Radovich, HX&hyph;101 at 20&hyph;22 and Ex. B, pp. 8&hyph;9 (sales decreased by 20% for 54% of respondents, by 40% for 29% of sellers, and by 80% for 13% of respondents; although other market factors could have contributed to the decreases, the PAA attributed them to handling fees). 131 Showalter, Tr.

Vol. II, 109, HX&hyph;36 at 16&hyph;17; and R&hyph;B&hyph;27 (CAFMS Comment) at 5. Casket retailers and others provided evidence that many third-party sellers offer caskets at prices lower than those charged by funeral homes. About half of the seventeen PAA Survey respondents who answered the survey's price question said that their price for the ``same or similar'' casket was at least $250 less than funeral home prices in their market area. About one-quarter said that their prices were between $100 and $250 less, and another quarter said that their prices were comparable (within $100). See, Radovich, HX&hyph;101 at Ex. B, p. 10. One retailer who commented on the ANPR reported that a small casket manufacturer in Chicago was selling 90% of its retail caskets on an at-need basis, charging about half that of Chicago funeral homes_$250 for a cloth-covered casket and $650 for a sealed, metal casket. See, DeSoto, R&hyph;B&hyph;42. Finally, third-party sellers testified that market forces will not effectively regulate ``casket handling fees,'' and that the elimination of those discriminatory fees would result in increased competition in the sale of caskets and reduced casket prices. 133 Mr. Royal Keith, a funeral provider appearing for the NFDA, when asked on cross-examination about the effect of market forces on handling fees, responded that he was not aware of any cases where market forces have successfully reduced the amount of handling fees charged in a particular area. 134 133 See, e.g., Teck, Tr. Vol. II, 872&hyph;873; Drozda, Tr. Vol. II, 944, 974. 134 Tr. Vol. III, 1422. b. Providers' basis for imposing ``casket handling fees''. Proponents of handling fees did not provide evidence to refute that offered by casket retailers and others on the purpose, prevalence and impact of ``casket handling fees'' on the casket market. Funeral provider representatives, for example, did not dispute that ``casket handling fees'' are used to recoup profits and overhead costs lost to third-party casket sales, but defended that purpose on several grounds. 135 Providers' responses to third-party casket sales arise, the trade groups asserted, due to the industry's long-standing tradition of recovering much of its overhead costs and profits through the casket mark-up, and not by increasing service fees; lower service fees allow funeral homes to provide full service funerals, including lower-priced caskets, to those who might not otherwise be able to afford them. Although providers in recent years have shifted some of that casket mark-up to service fees, the shift has been very gradual. The industry groups concluded that providers who lose casket sales to third parties must, as a result, still forego the recovery of much of their costs and profits that would have been included in the casket sale. 135 Nor did the NFDA and NSM argue that ``casket handling fees'' are imposed for actual services rendered in ``handling'' consumer-supplied caskets. Many witnesses, including funeral directors, testified that providers incur no additional labor or insurance costs when third-party sellers provide a casket, and that the actual labor time spent handling any casket is minimal; the cost for that service is normally included in the non-declinable professional services fee.

Those groups asserted that the imposition of ``casket handling fees'' is an isolated, non-discriminatory practice that fairly allocates providers' overhead costs and profits; the purpose of the fee is to obtain from consumers who buy third-party caskets consumers' proportionate share of providers' costs and profits for rendering the funeral service. Providers' only alternative to handling fees, the industry groups argued, would be to raise service fees charged to all consumers, which, in effect, would require regular clients who purchase providers' caskets to subsidize the funerals of consumers who purchase their caskets elsewhere_by paying the mark-up on the casket as well as the higher service fee that would result from other consumers supplying their own caskets. Those groups further asserted that handling fees are not assessed for ship-ins, outer burial container sales traditionally lost to competing cemeteries, or for direct cremation/immediate burials where the consumer supplies the alternative container because, unlike the unexpected loss of a casket sale to a third-party seller, providers set prices for those services with the knowledge that they will not make a sale in those cases. Finally, the funeral groups concluded that the amount of ``casket handling fees'' is sufficiently regulated by the market, because providers that charge unreasonably high fees will offend consumers and lose market share. 136 136 R&hyph;M&hyph;9 at 181&hyph;189; R&hyph;G&hyph;6 at 80&hyph;83. Individual providers agreed with the NFDA and NSM position. See Hocker, HX&hyph;111 at 13; Franzen, Tr. Vol. II, 819&hyph;820, Tr. Vol. III, 1408; Hennessy, Tr. Vol. II, 997&hyph;998; Keith, Tr. Vol. III, 1419; Yurs, Tr. Vol. II, 530, 563; and Nilsen, Tr. Vol. III, 1414&hyph;1415. See also, Hahn, FFDA, Tr. Vol. II, 692&hyph;694. c. Commission's conclusion and amendment. The Commission has concluded that substantial ``casket handling fees'' are imposed on consumers by a significant proportion of providers wherever third-party casket sellers exist, and, as a result, frustrate the Rule's ``unbundling'' requirements and result in the reduction of potential competition in the sale of caskets fostered by the Funeral Rule. 137 Some providers are forced to impose handling fees because of their competitive reluctance to shift overhead costs and profit from the casket mark-up to professional service fees. 138 Others may use handling fees as a direct response to third-party competition. In either case, the issue to be determined in this proceeding was whether the Rule should allow providers to condition a consumer's right under the Rule to obtain a funeral service with a consumer-supplied casket upon the payment of a non-declinable fee, charged in addition to the basic professional services fee (already permitted under the Rule to be non-declinable), or whether the Rule should require providers to recoup costs and profits lost to third-party casket sales in ways that do not violate the intent of the Rule's ``unbundling'' provision. For example, providers under the Rule may recoup any unallocated costs or profits lost to third-party casket sales in the non-declinable professional services fee permitted by ยง453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C). The Commission has determined that the latter course is warranted to affirm the Rule's intent to increase consumer choice and reduce barriers to price competition. 137 Even if ``casket handling fees'' were not widespread, their coverage in the Rule would be necessary because they frustrate the original Rule's ``unbundling'' provision and impose substantial, unavoidable costs on consumers who make purchase decisions based on their rights under that provision. 138 The Commission disagrees with arguments made by funeral provider groups during the proceeding that regulation of handling fees would amount to ``price regulation.'' The primary issue is the propriety of the handling fee cost and profit adjustment, through the imposition of a separate, non-declinable fee charged in addition to the non-declinable fee for ``services of funeral director and staff,'' and not the amount of the handling fee.
