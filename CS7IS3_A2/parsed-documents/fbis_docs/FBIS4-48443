FBIS4-48443 "drafr097_a_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-097 Daily Report 18 May 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Critical of UNHCR Reports on Massacres RPF Critical of UNHCR Reports on Massacres EA1805162594 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in French to Rwanda 1030 GMT 18 May 94 EA1805162594 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura French BFN [Excerpts] The UNHCR has accused the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] of killing Rwandan civilians. This is according to a UNHCR member based in Tanzania, who received his information from refugees arriving in Tanzania. The so-called investigator claims to have received the information, but did not furnish any proof. [passage omitted] The UNHCR has not shown any credibility concerning these allegations, because they have not taken into account reports by those who have visited territory controlled by the Rwandan Patriotic Army, such as Mr. (Anderson) of the BBC, who declared that he had visited the area and witnessed that the RPF was not committing atrocities. If the UNHCR has seen civilians being massacred, why does it not send representatives to see what is happening in areas occupied by government forces? Why should the UNHCR condemn the RPF on the basis of false rumors without, up to now, condemning the Gitarama government? It is well known that the RPF allows anyone interested in visiting the territory under its control to do so freely. That is why international journalists continue to visit these areas. They have witnessed for themselves the brutality with which the puppet government of Rwanda committed genocide. The UNHCR, which acquired its information from the most partisan of sources -- fleeing criminals [words indistinct], is now accusing the RPF. This will just encourage the criminal Gitarama government. The same UNHCR has not even condemned the government. This is the first time that members of the organization have accused the RPF. It should be recalled that last month they spread lies, according to which the RPF had closed the Rusumo border, so as to stop people from fleeing to Tanzania. Fortunately, [words indistinct] and humanitarian organizations have done everything possible to show that this is not correct. One can ask why the UNHCR does not go to see what is happening in the area controlled by the government army, what is happening in Gikongoro, Cyangugu, and Kibuye, for example. It is well known that the genocide already has been completed in those three prefectures, according to the words of Mr. Theodore Sindikubwabo who, during his visit the day before yesterday to Kibuye and Cyangugu, thanked the killers for cleaning up Kibuye Prefecture. This refers to the extermination of all Tutsis and all non-extremist Hutus. It is regrettable that the UNHCR does not seem to give any importance to the horror, and just keeps on wrongly accusing the RPF of committing crimes, basing its opinion on the incoherent allegations of those killers who fled after decimating innocent people.
