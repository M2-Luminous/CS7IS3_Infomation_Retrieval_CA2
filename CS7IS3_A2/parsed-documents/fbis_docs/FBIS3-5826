In this connection, the director general of the Political Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy and expressed regret over the matter. The director general said that there are countless public and private radio stations in Asia broadcasting 24 hours per day. He said the latest developments on Myanmar are being reported by Radio Burma and foreign broadcasting stations, including VOA, and that they can be tuned in for 24 hours. Furthermore, those interested can get news on Myanmar and international events from the satellite service. Local people now have the right of continuous access to both Myanmar and international news. Therefore, the establishment of Radio Free Asia is not necessary and it amounts to interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries, including Myanmar. Such an attempt cannot be viewed as a constructive contribution toward promoting Myanmar-U.S. relations.
