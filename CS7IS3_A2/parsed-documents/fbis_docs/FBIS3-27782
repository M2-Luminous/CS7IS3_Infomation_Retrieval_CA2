The resolution was submitted by Democratic Senator John Kerry and Republican Senator John McCain. It was supported by senators who are war veterans to pass by a 62 to 38 vote margin. Afterwards, the Senate also voted 58 to 42 to reject another resolution submitted by Republican Senator Robert Smith requesting President Clinton to certify that the Vietnamese Government has provided the fullest possible accounting of missing Americans before the trade embargo can be lifted. The debate before passing these two resolutions lasted six hours on 25 and 26 January. Democratic Senators John Kerry, John McCain, and Bob Kerrey stressed that Vietnam is doing its best to cooperate with the U.S. in locating missing Americans and the U.S. is in danger of losing this cooperation if it continues the trade embargo. Other supporters of lifting the trade embargo also cited U.S. military personnel working in Vietnam who say they are receiving cooperation which they are sure will continue with the lifting of the embargo. Senator John McCain also stated that U.S. military personnel were working side by side with Vietnamese soldiers to locate missing Americans. The cooperation may be terminated if the U.S. does not show good cooperation. Senator John Kerry believes that the Senate's action will lead to more information on missing soldiers and help to close a bitter chapter in American history. The senators supporting the resolution calling for lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam held that such an action is in the best interests of the U.S. as well as Vietnam.
