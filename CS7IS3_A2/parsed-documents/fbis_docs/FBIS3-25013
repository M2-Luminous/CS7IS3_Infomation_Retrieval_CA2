How is the latest UN resolution being greeted in Mogadishu? [Kouyate] The resolution adopted by the UN Security Council is the one needed by Somalia today because it is absolutely necessary to put things in perspective. The international community is unable to impose peace on a population that will reject it. This is the sine qua non condition for this peace to be workable. The Somalis must take their fate in their own hands. I believe that this concept has been understood by the Security Council. [Diop] So the issue of the disarming will recede into the background; you are saying that the international community cannot impose peace if the Somalis do not want it while, in fact, those who are blocking peace, or rather the one who is blocking peace now is mainly General Aidid. [Kouyate] Yes, certainly. Now all Somalis must be invited to sit down together, and this is where the diplomatic and political roles will be underlined. They must patiently be made to understand that they have to sit around the same table. I believe that the incident with the Somali National Alliance was unfortunate, firstly, because it did not happen in the framework of a national disarmament plan, and also because it was focussed too much on Mogadishu, this gave the impression of a war against one man only, against one faction only. I believe that this needs correcting first. [Diop] The United Nations is still considering this roundtable between all Somalis, including General Aidid. For his part, General Aidid, who keeps playing the spoilsport, is considering turning against the United Nations once the Western contingents have left. Aren't we moving toward a dead end with this man? [Kouyate] There are rumors that the situation will get worse. I believe that, politically, we must cool things down, that the Somalis must know that their fate will not be decided before 30 March, but also after it, and that it is in their hands. Therefore, all the threats emanating from the Somali National Alliance may be groundless. One should not add fuel to the flames now, one should tread carefully. That being said, it is true that General Aidid refuses to get in touch with the United Nations today; however in Somalia, as elsewhere, changes occur all the time. I believe that the Security Council's reassessment of options for Somalia and the reinsertion of these in the framework of diplomatic and political action is also an asset. General Aidid, who was being hunted, is now free to move; the Somali National Alliance prisoners held by UNOSOM [UN Operation in Somalia] have been freed, and this new resolution is stressing the diplomatic and political approach. These are real assets. The United Nations is also making a huge effort to set up police forces. We have already received all the necessary equipment, uniforms, weapons, vehicles. I believe that we are doing tremendous work there. I believe that those who are opposing this will be [words indistinct] Somali forces but not the United Nations.
