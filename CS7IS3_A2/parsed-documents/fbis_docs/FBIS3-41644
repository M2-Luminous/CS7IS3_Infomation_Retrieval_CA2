People have abandoned the logic of refusal in favor of the assault of enticement,'' says Christian Bataille, deputy (PS [Socialist Party]) for Nord Department, who does not yet know whether he should be pleased or worried about this development. When Bataille arrived in Gard--the most heavily nuclearized department in France (Footnote 1. In particular, Gard is the site of the Marcoule center, the Eurodif [European Dissemination Agency] uranium enrichment plant, and the Phoenix breeder reactor)--he certainly did not expect to encounter much opposition on his mission of mediation with respect to the construction of underground laboratories for the management of high-level radioactive waste. But if you recall the disturbances that this issue caused in January 1990 in Vendee, it is indeed surprising to see a region almost unanimously--and with such conviction--clamoring for ``its'' waste. Appointed to the post of mediator by Pierre Beregovoy and retained in that capacity by Edouard Balladur, Bataille is charged with a very precise mission: that of ``de-emotionalizing the debate.'' Aided by the crisis and the unemployment situation, his task could indeed prove less difficult than anticipated. After visiting Gard Department on 7 and 8 October, he went to Marne on 19 October and Haute-Marne on 21 and 22 October. The elected officials--who had invited him ``to obtain information''--are now telling the mediation delegation that they hope to reinforce the candidacies of their respective departments. And although some associations and some elected officials of the Greens have expressed their opposition and reservations, they did so calmly, Bataille said, ``after having heard--sometimes at great length--the arguments of the mediator, who for his part took their positions into consideration.'' For the time being, the Bataille mission constitutes the final chapter in a story that began in 1983. Charged with conducting the studies looking toward the construction of an underground storage center for long-life, high-level radioactive waste, the National Agency for the Management of Radioactive Waste (ANDRA) selected--amid the greatest secrecy--a total of 28 favorable geologic sites. Of that total, Alain Madelin--who was serving as minister of industry--four years later chose four sites that corresponded to the four most suitable geologic formations: Neuvy-Bouin (Deux-Sevres) for granite; Le Bourg-d'Ire (Maine-et-Loire) for shale; Montcornet-Sissonne-en-Bresse (Aisne) for clay; and Montrevel (Ain) for salt. The geologists are charged with selecting the two ``finalists'' from among these four. At the respective sites, however, the geologists had to confront resolute opposition from the local populations and even veritable riots such as occurred at Bourg-d'Ire (LE MONDE, 30 January 1990). On 9 February 1990, Prime Minister Michel Rocard therefore ordered a moratorium ``of at least one year.'' Christian Bataille, deputy and vice president of the Regional Council of Nord Department, was charged with drafting a report that served as the basis of the law of 30 December 1991 ``relating to the research on the management of radioactive waste'' which sets forth the French position on this issue (see box). Approximately Thirty Candidacies Gard was the first of 15 departments that Bataille will visit before submitting his recommendations in mid-December to Minister of Industry, Posts, Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade Gerard Longuet, representing 15 sites chosen from approximately 30 spontaneous applications. ``Just one article in the GAZETTE DES COMMUNES brought in 20 applications,'' said a member of his team, still astonished at this unexpected success. Sites where the substratum was clearly unsuitable were obviously ruled out as a matter of course. All of the other sites will in principle be visited by the mediator. Bataille's coming was widely announced in the press and by personal letter to every person (pronuclear and antinuclear alike) of influence in the region. Once he was installed ``on neutral ground'' in the prefecture, the mediator received whoever had submitted an application--elected officials, labor union members, officials of associations, or even private citizens--provided they had a local constituency of some consequence. He then discussed the various points in the dossier, answered questions, and collected the opinions and positions of each person. During two days in Nimes, for example, Bataille met with at least 40 persons, only one of whom--Marie-Anne Sabatier (Greens), a member of the Regional Council--voiced strong opposition to the plan. On the other hand, elected officials of all tendencies--and the presidents of the commercial tribunals and employer organizations--explained how important the plan would be for the economy of the region. Even more unexpected was the fact that the environmental protection associations limited themselves to demanding ``the most complete openness,'' believing--in essence--that such a laboratory would create jobs without aggravating the pollution in a region that is already highly nuclearized. The winegrowers--who are used to expropriations resulting from urban or industrial development--hinted to the mediator that if the scales were tipped slightly to redefine the boundaries of the control areas on which trade names are based, they would regard it as an acceptable trade-off. Christian Bataille does not, of course, expect to receive the same welcome everywhere. ``Some applications come from a single mayor, or even from a member of a municipal council of a small municipality,'' he acknowledges. In such cases, the prefect Jacques Monestier, director of the team that is assisting Bataille, acts as an advance man to ``reconnoiter the terrain'' and unofficially establish contacts capable of enlarging the support base for a request that comes from too limited a source. ``Obviously,'' Monestier says, ``it is impossible for us to leave immediately with the mediator in response, for example, to the request of a single mayor of a municipality consisting of 65 residents. But,'' he smilingly adds, ``if that small village sits astride a magnificent dome of granite, nothing prevents us from contacting other elected officials and attempting to reach an agreement....'' ``Buying Consciences?'' It is all suggestions and advice, however. There is no attempt to force anyone's hand. In any case, the mediator does not go anywhere unless invited. The only exception to this golden rule is the four sites chosen previously by Alain Madelin. Bataille insists that the purpose of the visits is ``to determine the current state of mind of the local population and present the new points in a dossier that has evolved considerably.'' Where the opposition is too strong, the visit can be replaced by a simple interview in Paris with elected local officials. ``If there are any tensions, they will not originate with us,'' the mediator emphasizes. ``Let the opponents be reassured: there are plenty of candidacies.'' It is true that in these times of crisis the offer is somewhat seductive. Each of the two laboratories will represent an investment of at least Fr1.5 billion--plus Fr70 million per year of operation--and will provide 150 jobs ``with priority being given to job applications from local residents.'' ANDRA will also participate--to the extent of Fr60 million per year--in the financing of ``project realizations and supporting actions.'' This largesse will be managed by a public interest group (GIP) that brings together--alongside the state and ANDRA--the region, the department, and all the municipalities situated less than 10 km from the site. ``It is not a question of buying consciences,'' Christian Bataille counters. ``Anyway, what does Fr60 million represent? Scarcely five km of freeway constructed on a level surface. Most of the candidacies submitted are more farsighted and are based on a nobler logic of overall economic development.'' ``A Scientific History'' This is obviously true in the case of Gard Department where, with the projected closing--in 1998--of the unit for the reprocessing of fuels from UP1 graphite-gas power plants, several hundred jobs will disappear from the Marcoule site, despite the start-up of the Melox plant in early 1995. Gilbert Baumet, president of the general council, emphasizes that ``for the Rhone district of Gard Department, Marcoule is somewhat the equivalent of Renault.'' The site currently employs more than 3,000 persons, not counting the jobs in related industries. The labor unions sent a form letter to the elected officials--and to the executives of the commercial and employer organizations--requesting that they support Gard's candidacy in negotiations with the mediation mission. They explained to Christian Bataille that the Marcoule site ``possesses an infrastructure--and a scientific and technical history--that are propitious for siting the project here.'' Some university professors pointed to the existence nearby (at Montpellier) of university and CNRS [National Council for Scientific Research] laboratories--``especially those in the field of the earth sciences''--that are ready to participate in the research. Business executives cited the talent available at a local school for training engineers in the field of computer science, and most of them said quite frankly that in addition to the laboratory, they hope in fact to obtain the storage center properly speaking. ``Gard was the first department to accept a nuclear installation, in 1954,'' Gilbert Beaumet pointed out. ``It truly deserves to have the nation return the favor.'' It was an opinion that the mediator seemed to share, when he acknowledged that ``your social and human conditions make a good case for this department.'' It remains for the geologists to substantiate this favorable impression at the technical level. [Box, p 18] Fifteen Years of Research The law of 30 December 1991 defined with precision all the stages that will lead to the selection of a site for the deep underground storage of long-life, high level nuclear waste. The mediator, Christian Bataille, was initially assigned the task of conducting the dialogue leading to the selection of the sites where preliminary work on construction of an underground laboratory can be carried out. In December, Bataille will submit a number of conclusions on the basis of which the government will select two sites. At the conclusion of the two years of preliminary work (extensive geological investigations), two underground laboratories will be dug to a depth of from 200 to 1,000 meters, depending on the nature of the sites. This work will continue for five years. The scientists will then be able to set up shop there for eight years of research with the aim of verifying the behavior of the rocks. These laboratories will not receive any waste, although a few small sources or samples necessary for the experiments will be able to be lowered to the laboratories. Simultaneously, other research will be carried out in two complementary directions: reduction of the volume and life of the waste, and procedures for conditioning the waste with a view to possible future long-term surface storage. Finally, around the year 2006, Parliament will decide--on the basis of the results obtained--whether to pursue the research or to decide on a method of managing the waste, which could be to bury them underground. A center will then be dug, probably--but not necessarily--near one of the laboratories. Because the laboratories will have only one access well and a few galleries, they themselves cannot be converted into storage centers, which would have to be much larger: in fact, veritable underground cathedrals. The storage of waste in these centers will be reversible, so that the waste can be recovered if scientific progress permits its elimination in a more ecological manner.
