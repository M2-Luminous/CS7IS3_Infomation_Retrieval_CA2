FBIS4-13186 "drnes075_d_94001" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 Libya Al-Qadhdhafi Speech on UN, Lockerbie, Other Issues Al-Qadhdhafi Speech on UN, Lockerbie, Other Issues LD1704155594 Tripoli Great Jamahiriyah Radio Network in Arabic 1250 GMT 16 Apr 94 LD1704155594 Tripoli Great Jamahiriyah Radio Network Arabic BFN [Address by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in Tripoli on 15 April -- recording] [Excerpts] Today's rally is added to other mass rallies by various sections of the Libyan Arab people who have moved by themselves and said that they have joined the ranks of confrontation in order to be at the historical frontline so that they can face the enemies who beat the drums of war and threats and blow the trumpets of departure for war. They do this as it is their custom, which history has made us accustomed to, as they are barbaric and savage peoples who have not ceased to attack us from one century to another out of injustice and hostility. We, along with the whole world, do not belive that the problem is the so-called Pan Am or Lockerbie incident. This is only an excuse. When one of these countries -- namely Britain, which is one of the great powers confronting us now, confronting this small nation -- wanted to occupy an Arab country, Egypt in 1882, Britain said there was a fortress [tabiyah] in Alexandria that was in conflict with Britain's security and should be removed and that Egypt's building a fortress in Alexandria constituted a threat to Britain's security. When 'Urabi [Ahmad 'Urabi, an Egyptian nationalist who fought against British occupation] refused to remove that fortress, Britain attacked Egypt on the pretext of self-defense. This mockery was recorded in history, and convoys of martyrs became victims of it. Matters such as these are what made important sections of the Libyan people, such as writers, artists, religious jurists, and lawyers, along with great masses of revolutionary people in all the places I have visited [sentence as heard]. Because they realized that the issue here is an attempt to seek unjust aggression and find justification for this aggression. What adds to our steadfastness and strengthens our stance is that the struggling forces against injustice and insolence in all parts of the world stand by us. We salute today the presence of representatives of peoples and international organizations who raise their voices and say that America, Britain, and France are states that are transgressors and aggressors and have no right in anything they do against the Libyan people. The Libyan people are innocent people who have been wronged, and consequently, they deserve that all strugglers and honorable people stand by them. This is the reason of their presence with us today. [passage omitted] France rejects the Security Council, the so-called Security Council, resolution. It refuses to resolve its problem with Libya. It refused to solve the problem although the Security Council calls on Libya to respond to investigations by France. Libya responded but France refused to cooperate with Libya to resolve its problem concerning the French UTA plane. This is a clear violation by France of the Security Council resolution. The Security Council should hold a session and try France, which violated that resolution and refused to implement it. Sanctions should be imposed on it according to Article 7, since we are talking now about Article 7. It is false. This festival is taking place in conjunction with an international power to support the Libyan people's rights and to demonstrate clear international condemnation of the aggressive policies of Western states. It is taking place in the shadow of a type of mourning, sorrow, and pain that is cast over Tripoli, Benghazi, and Libya as a whole. Tens of families lost their children, on a day corresponding to today in 1986, when America and Britain violated UN resolutions prohibiting the use of force or threats for the use of force in international relations after World War II. They perpetrated unjustifiable barbaric aggression and a blatant violation of Article 7. This article should have been implemented on America and Britain. The UN Security Council could not implement this as long as the assaulting countries are the ones that can veto the Security Council resolutions. Therefore, what kind of a Security Council we are relying on? Brothers, from the legal aspect, this meeting is that of defiance. This is a nice thing and a law on facing force. We see it only as a meeting of defiance of a people, of an important part of a people who are exposed to injustice, attacks, and hostility. [passage omitted] After Western capitalist imperialism becomes a tyrant and wants to impose the impossible on the world, confrontation is no longer between money and law, but between money and blood. It said it was inevitable that blood replaced law. Exactly the amount of blood offered by peoples in their struggle in defending their dignity, humanity, and their right to life and existence becomes the deterrent law. There is no hope at all in this respect to resort to the UN charter. The UN charter has been destroyed. The 1986 raid on Tripoli burnt the UN charter. They had lied to us. America, France, and Britain had lied to us, and also the Soviet Union in the Stalin era. They had lied to us and said the United Nations is good news to the peoples of the world. [passage omitted] They told us that this is the United Nations Organization, come and join us. So, we the poor and good people came. Then, we found that this organization was a sword brandished over our necks and that nations are not equal. [passage omitted] Brothers, who would now dare to say that we are deceived and let's get out of the United Nations? We say it now. We (?explain) getting out of the United Nations because it has proved to be a lie. In the name of the United Nations, thousands of Iraq's children are dying. Children of Iraq were burnt (?in the occupation of Kuwait). Do Iraqi children still occupying Kuwait deserve to die by the thousands in the name of the United Nations? (?We) have left Kuwait and all of us said it was unjust and an invasion, and we were against all the things Iraq's ruler did in Kuwait. All was condemned. We are facing, without Kuwait, the same fate of Iraq. Did we occupy Iraq? We are facing the same tragedy. Did Korea occupy Kuwait? Is North Korea the only state on the earth that reached nuclear energy and thus makes them attack it, threaten it, and bomb it? It is the last state to reach nuclear energy, if it has reached it, that is. What is this abuse, law, and ethics. There is no such thing. When the Soviet deterrent came to an end, the Western states appeared in their true colors without any fear or shame and appeared barbaric and savage. When Khrushchev and Brezhnev were present, the Western states had ethics, and they respected international law within the UN framework because they were afraid of the missiles of Khrushchev and Brezhnev. Since the deaths of Khrushchev and Brezhnev and the demise of the Soviet Union, America, Britain, and France have no more ethics, human rights, or humaneness. [passage omitted] Can they answer why they killed dozens of children of Libya (?in a day like this one)? Who can even interview them? Let us go and submit it to the United Nations and inform Libya's delegate at the United Nations tomorrow to submit, on the occasion of this sinister anniversary, the following question: Why did America and Britain kill dozens of children while they were asleep? When they submit it to the UN Security Council tomorrow, America, and Britain will put their conditions because they have the right of veto. How can we be reassured about the UN and the UN Security Council? What is this Security Council? [Passage omitted] If there was a law, my brothers, do you think it would have been possible for America, Britain, and France, the plaintiffs, to vote in the Security Council? Never. In the Lockerbie case, they do not legally have the right to participate in the vote because they are the plaintiffs. They are not neutral towards Libya. [passage indistinct] If they vote, and they are the plaintiffs and have the right of veto, what is the meaning of the Security Council, what is its set-up and decisions that [words indistinct] Arabs adhere to. We, the Libyan people, condemn Arab governments that adhere to that resolution. The sanctions against Libya are Arab. Why don't they say that this is rubbish, this aggression. These are controlled [qararat manzura] resolutions that cannot be recognized, or they can at least be tolerated for some years after which Arabs should say enough. We should defy the deformities [a'hat]. Next to us are Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan, and Egypt. Let them bring their planes to us and Libyan planes go there. The sanctions will end, Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, too. Saudi Arabia is preventing the pilgrims. Mecca has become part of the sanctions. The house of God has become part of the sanctions. [passage indistinct] Is it possible for the house of God to become part of the sanctions? If a Libyan plane should take off with pilgrims, Saudi Arabia should say that it was a plane carrying pilgrims and allow it to land. But if it was for trade, tourism purposes, or carrying other passengers, I would abide by the sanctions. Saudi Arabia has the right to adhere to America's Security Council resolutions. Pilgrims cannot land in Riyadh or even in Jeddah. We can [words indistinct] in Medina and then have to go by foot to Mecca. They are pilgrims, but Saudis say no, Mecca is part of the sanctions. Didn't you bring American troops -- who did not have any control on Mecca and Medina -- on to the peninsula. Here you are, [word indistinct]. The American resolution has proved that it has control over Mecca and Medina. These are facts. But we cannot blame our brothers in Saudi Arabia for not defying Security Council sanctions. They may be wishing to be with us, and indeed we and them talk to each. We talk about American injustice, American tyranny, American contempt to the Arabs and all the peoples that want to liberate themselves. The poor, they cannot. Saudi Arabia does not dare defy America. Impossible. It is its destiny. Americans change governments, borders; they change, they assassinate, they unleash the CIA in the world to destroy at will. People raise a hue, a cry over the KGB and remain silent over the CIA. What is the difference between this and that, they are all evil. There is a law, gentlemen. America and Britain should not vote at the Security Council in this precise case [Lockerbie]. Besides, there is also this contempt for the world. Is not there justice in the world except in America and Britain? We said to them: try them in Malta, they say no; we say in Egypt, they say no; in France, no; in Holland, no. Justice in America and Britain only? This means that all other countries have no justice, and there is justice only in America and Britain. This is another contempt to all peoples. This is not permissible. From the legal point of view the two suspects cannot be tried in America and Britain. Why? Because over there they already guilty. When they speak now they do not say: the suspects, they say: those who have blown up the Pan Am and UTA planes. If they already say guilty then the case is no longer a case of accusation. They say: Libya committed the Lockerbie operation. Therefore that is it: the punishment of Libya, all these resolutions put an end to the case. They put an end to the case because they constitute punishment. Look, as far as international law is concerned, the air embargo, the blockade, and so on, including the losses incurred by Libya because of the Lockerbie affair, are tantamount to punishment. Normally when this punishment is over, the Lockerbie affair ends automatically. Some say Libya carried out Lockerbie and it has been punished for it. That's it then. The matter should have stopped there. You said Libya carried out the Lockerbie operation and you punished her for it. Fine then. You thought Libya carried out the operation and that Libya was guilty. If a person commits a crime and pays the price for it, well that's it; he has paid the price. If you tell someone: You have committed a crime and its punishment will be 10 years imprisonment; and if you jail that person for 10 years, he must be released at the end of that period. You cannot detain him again by telling him: No, we cannot release you because you committed that crime in the past. But if you committed it and served 10 years in jail for it, why should you be detained any longer? That should be it. Let us suppose Libya carried out Lockerbie. Well, they have already made her pay for it. The matter is over and there should be no further legal prosecution. If we need to use international law as an argument, then this is one of the arguments we are presenting to the world. We have paid the price and that's it; so don't talk about Lockerbie anymore and close the file. If there is a law, how come they forget the Montreal agreement? How can they make light of the Montreal agreement? The Montreal agreement allows Libya to try the suspects on Libyan soil. The agreement is clear. The Scottish prosecutor, the Scottish prosecutor general, says hand them to a court in Scotland because courts in Scotland are just and neutral. This prosecutor a month ago made a statement swearing at Libya as if he was a diplomat or a lowly journalist. Is it conceivable that this prosecutor general who should be making legal statements is so filled with anti-Semitic racist hatred? Semitism means Arabs. It should not be interpreted the way Israelis do. We are Semites. [passage omitted] The Scottish prosecutor says Libya is a liar and has no credibility or integrity. How could a suspect or the accused go to his court when the Scottish prosecutor general makes these statements? What would the judge be like when the prosecutor behaves in such a way? [passage omitted] He has said that the so-called Libyan parliament had rejected their trial in [word indistinct] and left it to public opinion. This a tendentious political action against Libya. He overstepped his position as a prosecutor general. Who is trying to gain time? Is it the accused who has been condemned politically and by the media before a trial and eager to be tried to prove his innocence before the world, or is it the person who has falsified the facts, doctored charge sheets? Maybe the falsification was carried out with the full knowledge of the prosecution itself. If there was a law, this case would not have been referred to the Security Council, just like a civil case, an ordinary crime. How was it referred to the Security Council? They have a political objective. This should not at all have been referred to the Security Council. When they spoke about referring it to the Security Council, all law experts, and you among them, said this was not possible. This is an ordinary crime, not a case to be referred to the Security Council. It is not a dispute between two states and should not have been referred to the Security Council. [passage omitted] Brothers, they have no scruples. This is not possible. They are hunting a small people, the Libyan people, who have been living under threats and infringement for so many years because it wants to live free. UN Security Council members think they could remain their slaves for ever. Could they protect the Israelis in the occupied territories? They could not. They could not because there is a people there that is struggling. There is an ordinary individual who is no governor or king, he has no power or medals, he is not prominent, an individual who is barefoot and has no identity who could carry out a suicide attack and kill whomever he likes among the enemies. When we told them that the Gaza-Jericho agreement was meaningless, they said: You are against peace. I replied I was for real peace and told them that they were the ones who were falsifying the truth and lying to the Jews and the Palestinians, because Jews are at risk because of this agreement. It showed that 'Arafat is not all of the Palestinian fighters; he is only the head of a single organization called Fatah and not of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 'Arafat is not a fighter. The solution is down to the fighters who have destroyed this agreement and showed that it was... [pauses]. The Palestinian people have now started to fight. They have said: To hell with the Gaza and Jericho agreement. A new power has emerged over which Yasir 'Arafat has no control. From the beginning, on the first day the Gaza-Jericho agreement was signed, I made a statement and said I would deceive neither the Jews nor the Palestinians and that the agreement was a big lie because Yasir 'Arafat does not represent all the Palestinians and because there is a power fighting in the arena now and it is the one to hold negotiations with if there are to be any negotiations. I said negotiations should be held with the Palestinian people and all of the Palestinian people have to return to their land. They said no, we want Fatah. There you are, that is what you got from Fatah. There even was a split within Fatah itself. Fatah hawks are now being killed by the Israelis and they are killing the Israelis [words indistinct]. Fatah are 'Arafat's followers, and they have revolted against him. He has even deceived the Jews. Why do [word indistinct] tell the Jews this is peace? This is swindling. By the way, they all hate the Jews, they all are Hitlers, all of them, from the United States to Russia. They all wish the Jews to be eradicated, and they tell us that those Jews are an evil that has to be eradicated; they hate them more than we do. We eventually say we and the Jews are both Semite and cousins, but they say that those ones are Semite and they have destroyed the world. This is what the French, English, and U.S. officials are saying; it is written in their agendas. [passage omitted] How do they give a machine gun to a doctor? Why did not the Security Council convene to say that Israel is a terrorist state? Why does the United States support terrorism? The United States gives billions of weapons to so-called Israel, and so-called Israel armed the doctor who perpetrated the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi mosque. How do they give a machine gun to a doctor? If an Arab country had armed a doctor and he was witnessed fighting, they would have immediately put it in the blacklist, declared it as a terrorist state, and put it under siege, ban exports to it, humiliate and wipe it out. Why? They would say because it had armed the doctor. [passage omitted] How come the government gave him a machine gun? Before the massacre, many days before, in front of the government, the army, the Israeli officials, he used to go out and address people and incite them. Are America, Britain, and France civilized states? America, of course, does not pretent to be civilized. It says we are [word indistinct], cowboys, and criminals. They say all criminals are there and they had formed America. America itself does not at all claim to be a civilized state, and no one can confer on it such a certificate, but are Britain and France civilized states? If Britain is civilized and if France is civilized, then to hell with civilization. This is not civilization. These are biased, very biased nations. [passage omitted] We defy the Americans to come and negotiate with Libya, and we will not negotiate secretely with them. We are not a gang. States negotiate openly. We challenge them to negotiate openly with Libya. Even if they want to negotiate, they would say let us negotiate secretly. We are not a gang to negotiate secretly. If you are a gang, we are not a gang. It is the Israeli and Palestinian gangs that go to Norway or Denmark or I do not know where, in Oslo, to negotiate secretly. They are right, they are gangs: the Zionist Hagana or I do not know what gangs and the Palestinian armed gangs. All gangs, and they have the right to negotiate secretly. They are all gangs struggling for Palestine. But we, independent states and members of the United Nations who do not negotiate secretly. What right has America to supply the Israelis with weapons? Against who? They say: it is to strike the Arab Maghreb, the Gulf, Sudan. They said to the Israelis: We have now done away with the ring countries, and now we give you weapons. Yesterday we saw a report on 25 aircraft whose range attains the Arab Maghreb, Sudan, Yemen, the Arab Peninsula. [passage omitted] The so-called Israel has admitted to possessing nuclear weapons, why then don't they treat it like Korea? Like the Rabta? This is not possible. The so-called Israel is exempt of article 7. No matter what crimes it may commit, which fall 100 percent under article 7, America cannot permit that article 7 is applied to Israel. Therefore, the charter of the UN is finished. [passage omitted] Therefore, it is not a case of justice or injustice and legality or illegality. The UN Security Council member states have told us that the United States had threatened and told them to vote against Libya otherwise they would suspend economic aid to them; vote against Libya to get economic aid. It is like a judge going to witnesses and members of a court and threatening them, ordering them to pass unjust sentences or else. [passage omitted] You hear statements made by the United States, Britain, and France; they say that Libya is against the international community. You three are against the international community and swimming against the current. You have been afflicted by conceit. However, this conceit will shatter on the rock of peoples' resistance and the Libyan people's [word indistinct]. This arrogance and superciliousness will escalate the resistance. This arrogance and audacity will inevitably shatter. We enter the battle with resilience, good patience, and unique courage. Let the battle between us and them continue until doomsday. They are the ones who are seeking quick profits and [word indistinct] without loss. They will lose in this battle. We are fighting on our land, while they are fighting outside their borders; in the seas, oceans, and continents. They are opening fronts to terrify the whole world. As a matter of fact, this gathering of Libyan men of law, supported and backed by honorable men outside Libya in the Arab homeland and the world, is an extremely important message directed to America, France, and Britain precisely, the arrogant and leagued states that have trampled under foot international law, the sovereignty of peoples, the UN charter and conventions, which do not permit comparison between what is done against the Israelis and against the Arab countries. Double standards. This is an extremely important message if they respect world public opinion. But it should be made clear that it is they who are isolated. Setting aside the [word indistinct] between Libya and America, Britain and France, all the world stands on the side of Libya. In reality they have served the Libyan people because the Libyan people were going along on their way, not paying attention. They have awakened you and told you that they wanted to harm you a second, third, and tenth time. They told you their ambitions have been continuous since Caesar's time, since the first century AD until today. They have warned you. In fact we thank them for warning the Libyan people, who were not vigilant. We have felt that their rifles were directed at the chest of each one of us. On a night like this, innocent young people were killed. Who blew up the the Berlin night club? In the end, it became clear that Libya had nothing to do with the Berlin nighclub. What should we do then about the dozens of young people who died that night? Does this mean that this is going to be repeated? Every Libyan is feeling that his child might be killed, that he might be killed, that his home might collapse on him at any time. He knows there is no Security Council any more, no United Nations or international law; there is a jungle. [passage omitted] We are resisting. Thank you. The struggle continues.
