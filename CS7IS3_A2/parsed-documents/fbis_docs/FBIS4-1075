Robert Makgatho and his mother Elsie, among at least 11 members of former ANC President Sefako Mapogo Makgotho's family who would vote for the NP, were introduced to the media at an NP news conference in Pretoria. A former Mamelodi councillor, Mr Makgotho said he had been a member of the United Democratic Front, a front organisation for the ANC, until 1990 when its "noble ideas had deteriorated into violence". The practices of the ANC and its allies were "atrocious", he said, adding that he did not agree with strikes, disruptions of education and intimidation. Some of his former colleagues had tried to discourage him from voting for the NP and he had received death threats. Three dockets had been opened against his intimidators, Mr Makgotho said. While still a councillor he had been "intimidated out of his job" by ANC-aligned civic organisations that, among other acts, twice petrol-bombed his house. Mr Makgotho said he believed if his great-grandfather had been alive he too would have voted for the NP because the ANC today bore no resemblance to the party he had helped found. "We believe he would have been appalled by the destruction of black education carried out by the ANC and its comrades in the name of revolution. "We believe he would have been ashamed of the violence and intimidation carried out by those same people against anyone who dares to disagree with them." Mr Makgotho said he had found a political home in the NP because of its ideals to create a peaceful and tolerant society. Although he was unemployed, his np support did not stem from material gain but "comes from my heart and soul". Mr Makgotho's mother Elsie, 62, said she would also cast her vote for the NP because ANC comrades had sent people to intimidate her at her place of work because of her son's former councillorship and NP allegiance. "They also stole my car, and when I got another one, they burnt it out." NP PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] election candidate Nana Masango, who organises in the Mamelodi community where the Makgothos reside, told the news conference the township was a NP "stronghold". ANC supporters had been won over to the NP because of the ANC's intimidatory, disruptive and violent tactics and lawlessness, she said. "If the comrades, civics and self-defence units carry out their activities while they are not in power yet, what will they do if they are? "We cannot allow these atrocities to continue. "The ANC is so power-drunk they will drive the country into anarchy," she said. ANC President Nelson Mandela had named his second son after Mr Sefako Mapogo Makgotho as a sign of respect, his great-grandson said. Mr Makgatho founded the African Native Political Union in 1906 and the Transvaal African Teachers Association shortly thereafter, according to a biographical document issued by the NP at the news conference. "He was one of the eight-strong caucus which called the conference in Bloemfontein in January 1912 out of which the ANC emerged. "He became a senior vice-president at that meeting and president of the ANC for a seven-year term in 1917. "He was a close friend of Chief Albert Luthuli (another former ANC president) and a father figure to many of the new wave of activists that emerged in the 1940s -- among them Mr Nelson mandela. "He died in 1951 and is buried in Mamelodi."
