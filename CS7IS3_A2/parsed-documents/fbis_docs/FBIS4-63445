The fall of Gagra [in Abkhazia] was the first serious blow to Eduard Shevardnadze's prestige. Since then, the head of state's popularity has been on the decline. He has bequeathed the return of Abkhazia and the restoration of [Georgia's] statehood to "grateful generations" and united a fragmented Georgia to the CIS. Joining the CIS has thinned out the parliamentary majority. On 5 May, the Liberal-Democratic National Party [LDNP] declared itself as [part of] the opposition. Party leader Batoni Mikheil Naneishvili delivered a report to Parliament in which he exposed the incorrectness of the political course chosen by Shevardnadze. Joining the CIS became the main reason for the Liberals' dissatisfaction. Their first protest followed the statement made by Speaker of Parliament Goguadze [on the necessity of Georgia joining the CIS]. "We felt that this idea was not implanted in him by the Holy Ghost," stated Batoni Naneishvili (in a speech delivered in Parliament, he assessed such an action by a deputy as a "minor prank"). The Liberal-Democrats had earlier been united with the Greens Party in an alliance of "liberals" and were viewed as supporters of the head of state, although, as Naneishvili said, they had often criticized Shevardnadze in private. Following the events connected with joining the CIS, their party was completely ignored. In spite of Naneishvili's statements, no one paid any attention to them. They, however, continued to wait and are still waiting for the government to see the results of the mistakes that have been made. The LDNP previously kept in the background. On 5 May, they decided to emerge from the shadows. In Naneishvili's statement of 5 May it is stated that the personnel policy chosen by the head of state is unable to satisfy the demands of the state. The Cabinet of Ministers approved by him is unable to conduct reforms. It is made up of old appointees who are used to "doing nothing." Shevardnadze and his government are demanding the restoration and expansion of "old ties," which the LDNP views as absurd: They are creating an association of enslaving ties characteristic of the Soviet period. Naneishvili called the policy being conducted by the head of state and his supporters as "reactionary." Following such a non-liberal statement, the LDNP is demanding, first and foremost, that Georgia leaves the CIS. They believe that it is necessary to follow a completely different political course, one that will be totally dissociated from the CIS. It is Mikheil Naneishvili's belief that it will be possible for Georgia to free itself completely from Russia's influence if the government shows itself to be resolute and if it orients itself toward the West. The LDNP has distanced itself from those supporting the government but it has also been unable to side with the opposition. According to Naneishvili, they have found themselves between the devil and the deep blue sea: They criticize Shevardnadze but do not demand his resignation. They are hoping to see something undone that cannot be undone. The Liberals remain liberals.
