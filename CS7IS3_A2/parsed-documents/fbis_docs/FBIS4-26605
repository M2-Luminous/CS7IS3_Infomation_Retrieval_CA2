Cholera, typhoid and dysentry have been reported in the city of Qingyuan, in northern Guangdong province, which has been hardest hit by the two weeks of flooding, a provincial government health official revealed. The official, who refused to be named, said 15 people in the city had contracted cholera, while an unspecified number had been affected by typhoid and dysentery, following the worst flooding in the area for a century. Drinking water in the area is contaminated, polluted by the rotting corpses of drowned livestock, he said. But people are still using the water for cooking and washing. But he insisted: "The outbreak is not serious, and we are monitoring the situation closely and taking additional measures to combat the spread of any disease." Another health official said bottled water, food and medical supplies were being rushed to the area from the provincial capital, Guangzhou, to alleviate chronic shortages in the worst-hit areas. He said a severe shortage of medicine had forced the authorities to raid warehouses and shops in search of extra supplies. Relief workers have called on both the provincial and central governments to ship in more emergency supplies to the disaster area, the official added. Meanwhile, soldiers continued to reinforce an embankment built to keep flood waters off the main Guangzhou and Sanshui railway line, by building a second line of defence at the point between the two cities where the Beijiang and Sijiang rivers meet. Provincial Communist Party secretary Xie Fei visited the Beijiang embankment where 500,000 soldiers and relief workers have been battling against the rising flood waters for the past week. He praised soldiers for their relief work. Sanshui is a strategic point as if it is overrun by the water, large parts of the prosperous Pearl River Delta will also be at risk of inundation. Rail services on the line were suspended indefinitely on Wednesday, cutting off a vital supply line to the flooded region, although roads to the area still remain open. Xie is expected in another affected city, Shaoquang, on the northernmost point of the province. Guangdong governor Zhu Senlen told reporters Wednesday the death toll in the province stood at 210, but government officials said Thursday it would rise further as relief workers reached villages marooned by floodwater. Zhu said 61 people were reported missing, 4,054 had been injured, and that direct economic loss in the area was estimated at more than 10 billion yuan (11.6 million dollars) In Guangzhou Thursday, the Pearl River continued to swell and overflowed its banks in some low-lying areas of the city as seasonal tides set in, forcing flood waters back into the city. City officials expected the tide to continue for a further three days, and are monitoring the level of the murky water in the provincial capital. Guests of some hotels in the city are meanwhile being warned not to drink tap water in case it is contaminated and carrying disease.
