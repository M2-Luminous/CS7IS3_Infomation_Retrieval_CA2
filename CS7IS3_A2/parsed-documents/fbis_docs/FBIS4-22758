Thus a good tradition of informal communication between high-ranking statesmen and KOMMERSANT experts was continued. Boris Fedorov started this tradition last year. However, two months after visiting KOMMERSANT Boris Fedorov left the government, whereas Aleksandr Shokhin originated a new tradition--one day after his visit to KOMMERSANT he was given the post of deputy prime minister with a portfolio in the government. However, we have always proceeded from the fact that status is not the only thing to grace a person, as long as he says interesting things. Shokhin on Camdessus, the Duma, and the People Naturally, the foremost desire of KOMMERSANT experts meeting with a man with whose participation credit exceeding $2 billion had just been shaken loose was to find out how this is done and how the outcome of negotiations with the IMF can determine the domestic array and correlation of forces with regard to economic reform. Regarding the intrigue itself involving negotiations about the second tranche of IMF systemic credit, Aleksandr Shokhin informed us that the Russian position on, or rather opposition to, G-7 was set forth in early December. A meeting was scheduled for 17 December at which it was planned to begin the development of a new plan for supporting Russian reform so as to begin a new cycle of financial stabilization scheduled literally day by day as early as 1 February. However, according to Aleksandr Shokhin, the Duma elections and subsequent events caused the negotiating schedule to fall through. In the opinion of the minister, the first blow to the progress of negotiations was struck by the former advisers to the government, Mr. Sachs and Mr. Oslund, who "tried to create an atmosphere such as not to provide financial support for this government--it is patently conservative and antireformist. If Gaydar and Fedorov are not in it, it would be better to delay assistance until they return to the government again." In the process, as our guest noted, "Yegor Timurovich and Boris Grigoryevich themselves support a line of this kind. Yegor Timurovich made a statement of this kind in Bonn; although he later denied this fact, the stenographic record says what it says." Touching on the contents of the negotiations with the IMF, Aleksandr Shokhin observed with some pride that for the first time they proceeded according to the scenario of (what we seemed to hear was virtually "to the dictation of") the Russian side. During a meeting with the prime minister, Michel Camdessus named certain parameters which the IMF considered acceptable as conditions for the extension of credit, in particular, a 7-8 percent rate of inflation by the end of the year. The minister noted: "In the process they of course did not fail to say that Mr. Yeltsin was setting correct tasks (3-5 percent by the end of the year) and, they said, the government should not be avoiding implementation of the president's message. Nonetheless, IMF experts grasped our arguments; this already amounted to readiness to shift their old dogmatic positions in a more realistic direction." Before finally making a determination as to how realistic the budget projections of the government for 1994 were, Michel Camdessus met at the Duma with Nikolay Rybkin and Sergey Glazyev, who fervently supported the government. Aleksandr Shokhin said: "This made a strong impression on Camdessus; it turned out that the Duma was monetarist, perhaps even more so than the government. Of course, it is hardly so, but he found no opposition to the government there nonetheless." Aleksandr Mikolayevich also told us that Mr. Camdessus "visited a working man in the village--he wanted to see how the people were doing. He happened upon a working man whose entire hut was overflowing with books, and he spun tales for Camdessus for three hours. I do not rule out that this was also a factor in moderating the position of the IMF. It was good that he did not drop into a neighboring hut." It turns out that this is how a creditor needs to be boxed in tightly, from three directions (the government, the Duma, and the people), so that he will loan more. Further on, we decided to cover in our conversation another aspect of the issue--debt repayment or, in other words, the manner in which the fact of signing the agreement with the IMF will influence negotiations concerning the foreign debt. The minister answered: At present the entire problem is that the agreement with the Paris Club, dated 2 April 1993, specifies that interest for the restructuring of the foreign debt in 1994 shall be set at 100 percent, whereas in 1994 we paid 40 percent, or $2 billion less. At the same time, a new round of negotiations just could not begin while Russia had no agreement with the IMF. As subsequently came out in our conversation, the club had, to put it mildly, certain grounds for this. Aleksandr Nikolayevich recalled how last year "we said: We have $2.5 billion in the budget for all of your business; we do not even know what the restructuring pattern will be; we do not know about your intricacies. Here is money for you, think yourselves about how to do it. They said: This is without precedent; it is not done this way, with payments being reduced to zero for entire items, including interest payments. This had never happened indeed. Nonetheless, at the time we pressed the point home with them." At this point we somehow legitimately recalled apprehensions which are now being voiced concerning the fate of repayment of the domestic foreign exchange loan of the VEB [Bank for Foreign Economic Relations] (see KOMMERSANT, No. 9, pp. 6-10). On one hand, if we succeed in economizing on payments to the Paris Club, and if money from the monetary fund arrives quite promptly (according to Shokhin it may arrive as early as late April), chances for the regular (on-time) servicing of the domestic foreign exchange debt will improve. On the other hand--you will know yourselves (see above).... As the saying goes, "debts follow debt," and thereafter the conversation smoothly moved on to the issue of ruble-denominated debt. Shokhin on Nonpayments and the Domestic Debt The issue of nonpayments surfaced in the conversation every now and then. Thus, when Mr. Shokhin was discussing the proposal of the Ministry of the Economy to eliminate quotas and licensing for oil exports, he directly indicated what caused this proposal to be made: In the immediate future, the combination of quota-setting and the nonpayments crisis may bring about a stoppage in the oil industry because the latter has no opportunity to compensate for the insolvency of Russian customers by increasing exports. It subsequently came out that, in the words of the minister, the current "semi-market" mechanism for carrying out intergovernmental agreements with CIS countries is breaking down because of the nonpayments crisis and the insolvency of Russian enterprises. For example, Roskontrakt purchases oil in Russia, pushes it through to Uzbekistan, sells it, buys cotton, and brings the latter here--and it turns out that nobody is in a position to buy cotton at these prices. "It is easier for precisely the Uzbeks and Kazakhs to meet such obligations. Everything is centralized there. This is why we should either change the arrangement, too, and use the arrangement for the administrative regulation of deliveries under such agreements, or altogether abandon them." The same topic resurfaced in the discussion on the need to augment budget revenues. Aleksandr Shokhin said that it is not simple to raise taxes and not only because "in some instances the physical limit for these taxes is being reached. There are other motives, too. For example, the excise tax on gas may be increased, but will this generate real revenues for the budget? Nobody knows whether the excise tax will become merely a calculated value because of nonpayments." At the same time, Mr. Shokhin clearly led us to understand that the government does not at all intend to undo the nonpayments crisis by the "traditional method." What is the situation with "nontraditional methods?" The deputy prime minister noted with satisfaction that "the mentality" of the captains of industry "has finally begun to change--they have already stopped seeking credit from the government and have rushed to commercial structures, and are indeed prepared to accept any terms in order to ensure the infusion of money into production." He himself added: "However, this is just beginning; we are not managing to make it through...." Since we are not making it, plants will be idled. This position of the minister of the economy makes a particularly strong impression against the background of data from his own ministry (see KOMMERSANT, No. 10, p. 11): The Ministry of the Economy calculates that each ruble of public debt generates 2-3 rubles [R] in the debt of enterprises. However, we hate like hell to pay back the debt. If, as we remember, Mr. Shokhin has managed to restructure the foreign debt brilliantly, if he has convinced hard-boiled Western creditors that a country with a trade budget surplus of approximately $20 billion is just not in a position to pay more than $2.5 billion on its obligations--will he really be intimidated by restructuring the domestic debt? Do Russian agrarians or defense sector people surpass the Paris and London Clubs in terms of negotiating steadfastness? Even if they do, it means that they are inferior to the Paris and London Clubs on some other score.... Shokhin On Attracting Nonstate Investment Aleksandr Shokhin answered our question about how the minister views restructuring and a pick-up in investment activities as straightforwardly as a Roman--there is no money in the budget, and for this reason, he views centralized investment as merely a continuous patching up of economic holes. The minister explained: Social projects (for example, housing) and conversion will account for the lion's share of investment outlays. As far as capital investment in effective production projects is concerned, according to the budget about R4 trillion will be allocated for it, which is mere scraps. Besides, the minister confirmed in principle the supposition of KOMMERSANT experts that the government also lacks a reliable mechanism for the placement of state investment; moreover, the investment arrangement proposed once again by the Ministry of the Economy is patently unworkable. Aleksandr Shokhin reasons absolutely soberly that a draft of the compilation of the state investment program which, in particular, calls for investment through state agents (the Gosinkor [expansion not identified] and the Russian Finance Corporation) does not ensure the main point--guarantees of the recovery of investment. "So, we will give money to Nechayev (president of the Russian Finance Corporation--note by KOMMERSANT), but he will not pay it back. Well, it did not work out. And what is the Russian Finance Corporation going to be liable with? Its building on Georgiyevskiy Lane?" It makes sense, and yet the minister has something up his sleeve. Aleksandr Shokhin stated that a draft decree on a contract between a government commission and a certain consortium of commercial banks is already on the prime minister's desk. As we understood from a not too extensive commentary by the minister, the idea of this contract is as follows. Shokhin believes that demand constraints have finally started working at this particular time--there are no sales, enterprises are screeching to a halt, but directors, on the contrary, have begun to hustle. If so, state investment for them, the directors, is no longer pennies from heaven but rather a rare genuine opportunity to survive. Therefore, it is logical to surmise that this investment should be fought for. And just how? By "matching" one's own or private funds with those of the state. The minister gave an example: The Tekhnokhim Association from St. Petersburg insisted on having its project financed from the budget; representatives of the enterprise showed up at the ministry on this business regularly. Ultimately a condition was set for them: Bring in a reputable foreign investor, and you will get money. An investor came along fast: In turn, he was promised that state funds would be invested in the project, and some foreign investors in certain places still believe on occasion that if the state is forking it over, recovery will be no problem. It is for this arrangement that the project with the participation of the bank consortium has apparently been developed; Shokhin thinks that each R1 in state funds must attract R4 in private capital. Of course, it is a good idea, if for no other reason than because it envisions some kind of partnership between the state and business. However, we are afraid that we will not go very far even with this idea. The reason is very simple. If total capital investment in the national economy is calculated with the fourfold investment multiplier--in keeping with Shokhin's arrangement--taken into account, it turns out that investment will "give off" 10 percent this year (an estimate of the Ministry of the Economy itself). It is clear that no investment policy can be made with such scant capital, and that the 12 percent projected drop ("active stabilization" scenario) which was "approved" by the government last Thursday (after the minister's visit to KOMMERSANT) will have to be discarded. Moreover, in this case there is perhaps no dodging a 20 percent drop, as presented in a different scenario of the projection. However, the saddest point which our conversation with the minister suggests: Shokhin is terribly averse to "working" the investment multiplier a little. Meanwhile, there are possibilities there: It is lucrative indeed to emit a ruble, place it with the mysterious consortium for an effective project, and tie up R4 in private capital. Of course, it is clear that the multiplier will decrease as emission proceeds: Private money is short, whereas emission will bring about the growth of the budget deficit. However, money will not be spent in vain, either. But the minister just will not budge. He talked with regret about the need to pay back the domestic debt, and with virtual horror about the growth of the budget deficit. Nonetheless, KOMMERSANT experts got the impression that ("I know that you know that I know") everything has not yet been lost, and that an affair between the minister and the economy is still possible. Of course, special piety has to be shown for the budget while Camdessus is around. After a period of time it will be possible to recall that "the tiger is made of paper": After all, the level of intake of taxes by the state budget dropped by a factor of two in the initial months of the year--from 18 percent of the gross domestic product last year to 9 percent this year. If the budget still cannot be implemented--with this kind of nonpayment--it may be treated more liberally. After all, a softer budget cannot be smuggled past the Duma and the IMF anyway, but life needs to go on....
