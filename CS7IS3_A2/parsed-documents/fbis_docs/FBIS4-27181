With the loss of dollar-denominated remittances, "one cannot say it is no hindrance to operations," said Toshio Morikawa, chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan. Morikawa was addressing a regular news conference a day after government sources said Japan may halt all remittances to North Korea if the United Nations imposes sanctions on Pyongyang for its refusal to permit inspections of its spent nuclear fuel rods. Private banks have already stopped sending dollars to the country after Utsunomiya-based Ashikaga Bank, which handles most North Korean remittances, decided not to serve as an intermediary for other Japanese banks, informed sources told KYODO NEWS SERVICE earlier this month. On measures to deal with the mountain of bad debts that Japanese banks hold, Morikawa said he was "quite cautious" about suggestions that banks accept one-time losses, a postwar taboo, in order to write off the loans more quickly. Saying he could only speak for Sumitomo Bank, of which he is president, Morikawa said it is necessary to consider how society would accept such a move and how it would affect operations. Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry leaders have said they support active loan writeoffs but they have avoided the direct question of going into the red to clear the problem loans, a legacy of the late 1980s lending spree. Japan's 21 leading banks said late last week they slashed their profits for the business year through March to write off 3.61 trillion yen in bad loans, up 2.6 times from fiscal 1992. The bad loan total at the 11 leading commercial banks, three long-term credit banks and seven trust banks was 13.58 trillion yen as of March 31, up 801.6 billion yen from a year before but down 184 billion yen from six months earlier. On the postponed signing of a planned merger of three second-tier regional banks in northeast Japan, Morikawa said banks must "get sufficient understanding from their employees and clients" but that mergers remain "an important option" for restructuring. Officials at Sendai-based Tokuyo City Bank, Kita-Nippon Bank of Morioka and Shokusan Bank of Yamagata said the indefinite delay of the signing, originally scheduled for Tuesday, resulted from a procedural delay. But banking sources said the merger ran into stiff opposition from employees' unions and customers of Kita-Nippon Bank. Morikawa also expressed support for continued corporate political contributions. "I do not think corporate contributions are completely bad," he said. "As things are now, making appropriate contributions to groups aiming to promote a free economy cannot be helped."
