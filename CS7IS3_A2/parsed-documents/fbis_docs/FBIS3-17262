Mirbobo Mirrakhimov, former chairman of the State Committee for Television and Radio and a candidate of historical sciences, was arrested on 8 January in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat]; Akhmadsho Komilov, former Dushanbe television studio director, and television analysts Khurshed Nazarov and Khayriddin Kosimov were arrested at the same time in the Kyrgyz city of Osh. Eduard Sagalayev, chairman of the International Confederation of Journalists Unions, and Aleksey Simonov, chairman of the Fund for the Protection of Glasnost, have signed an appeal to the CIS heads of state, pointing to the dubious criminal charges being pressed against the journalists. A few weeks ago, head of government Abdudzhalil Samadov promised that he would see to it that the arbitrary action would be stopped, but the promise has gone unfulfilled. The appeal calls on the CIS heads of state to help alleviate the journalists' predicament and to hold open court hearings as soon as possible to be attended by international observers.
