In 1993 alone nearly 50 projects were licensed with a total capital of more than USD 700 million, accounting for a half of the total amount of foreign capital invested in projects in the capital city. Different from previous years when foreigners focused on tourism service, one-third of the 1993 capital was invested in industrial production. Prominent among these projects are the Oriow-Hanel picture tube plant (a joint venture with S. Korea) which has a prescribed capital of USD 170.5 million and the (?Dkhha) Business Centre (a joint venture with South Korea), USD 64 million. Leading the 24 foreign investors in Hanoi is South Korea which has invested in six projects with a total capital of USD 43.8 million France, nine projects and USD 132,782,377 followed by Taiwan, and Singapore. Of these foreign-invested projects, totally or partly funded by foreigners, a large number are operational, while some are still under construction. Vietnam by collaborating with foreign partners in the past six years, has gained a work force which is now accustomed to modern industrial and management style. A number of managers have learnt both foreign languages and business administration. Also, joint ventures have created jobs for Vietnamese, contributing to efforts to reduce unemployment in the capital city. Some joint ventures have brought about evident socio-economuc effects and made considerable profits. They are the Thai-Vietnamese joint venture to produce adhesive bands for women, the Vietnamese-Danish joint venture to brew Carlsberg beer, and so on. Foreign investors are now inclined to invest in the north, Hanoi in particular. To encourage this inclination, the Vietnamese Government, besides simplifying the procedure for issuing licences, [words indistinct] upgrade the Noi Bai International Airport, the highway no. 5 that links Hanoi and the port city of Haiphong, and the Haiphong harbour.
