"We express our deep concern because North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA makes the already serious nuclear problem more serious," said Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku. Lee, who is also minister of the National Unification Board, made the statement at a press conference he held after presiding over a Unification and National Policy Coordinating Committee meeting Tuesday morning. North Korea is wriggling out of all nuclear safeguards arrangements that guarantee the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, he pointed out. "The government strongly urges North Korea to cooperate with all nuclear safeguards arrangements laid down by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)." Yi noted that no unusual military movements have been detected in North Korea and said the Seoul government will continue working for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear dispute. With regard to the government's response to the latest North Korean move, he said the international community was already moving toward sanctions, indicating that Seoul will continue to push for the plan at the U.N. Security Council. Yi added, however, that North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA would not hasten the adoption of U.N. sanctions. "We will keep a close watch on any development in the coming two to three weeks," he said.
