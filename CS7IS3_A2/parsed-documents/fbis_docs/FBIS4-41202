As for the political status of Abkhazia, noted Shevardnadze, we can look at any proposal by the Abkhazian side within the framework of a united and indivisible Georgia. We are willing to grant Abkhazia the kind of status that would be in line with the highest world standards. Commenting on the recent Georgian-Ossetian talks in Vladikavkaz, Shevardnadze gave a positive assessment of their results, which have made agreement possible on the issues of the reopening of transport links, the movement of people on the territory of the conflict zone, joint work to combat crime, etc. Regarding conflicts in other regions of the Caucasus and the Karabakh problem in particular, the head of state said that the success of the peacekeeping mission in Abkhazia could well stimulate positive processes in Karabakh as well. Analyzing the causes of the tragedies that have befallen Georgia in recent years, Shevardnadze said that they followed from the incorrect and erroneous policy toward Russia chosen by Georgia after the break-up of the USSR. He stressed that it was because of this policy that the country had become totally isolated, which had led, in particular, to the loss of Abkhazia.
