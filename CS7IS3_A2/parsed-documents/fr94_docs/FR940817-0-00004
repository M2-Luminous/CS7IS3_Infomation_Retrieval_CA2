ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending the poultry products inspection regulations to require the use of numbered official badges to identify persons authorized to conduct Federal inspection under the Poultry Products Inspection Act. Such persons may be our employees or employees of other Federal agencies or State agencies working under agreements with us. The amendment confirms our current practice of issuing badges to such persons and removes an inconsistency between the meat and the poultry products inspection regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Lester Nordyke, Director, Federal-State Relations, Inspection Operations, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 20250; telephone, Area Code (202) 720&hyph;6313.
