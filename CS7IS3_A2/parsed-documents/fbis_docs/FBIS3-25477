They have also proposed the insertion of a constitutional principle on self-determination which, along with the 33 other principles in the interim constitution, will underpin the final constitution to be drafted after the election. "The constitution may give expression to any particular form of self-determination provided there is substantial proven support within the community concerned for such a form of self-determination," the proposed principle states. Government and ANC negotiators said at the weekend that the proposal should meet the compromise demands of Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] co-leader Gen Constand Viljoen and it was now up to Viljoen to sell the package to his constituency. However, some negotiators do not expect the CP [Conservative Party] and AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] to accept the deal, but are hoping Viljoen will lead the rest of the Volksfront into the elections to prove his claims that 75 percent of Afrikaners support the demand for a volkstaat. A previous compromise deal on a volkstaat made between the ANC and Viljoen was rejected at a mass meeting of the Volksfront in Pretoria earlier this month. Today's meeting of the negotiating council at Kempton Park will discuss these and other government/ANC proposals aimed at securing the Freedom Alliance's participation in the transition process. The proposal for a volkstaat council forms part of a new section to be inserted in the chapter of the interim constitution dealing with traditional authorities. "There is hereby established a volkstaat council consisting of 20 members elected by members of Parliament who support the establishment of an Afrikaner volkstaat," the proposal states. The council will conduct its affairs "according to rules made by the council" and will service as a "constitutional mechanism" to enable proponents of a volkstaat to pursue its establishment constitutionally. It will, for this purpose, be permitted to: - Gather, process and make available information regarding proposed boundaries, powers and functions and legislative, executive and other structures of such a volkstaat, its proposed relationship with government at national and provincial level "and any other matter directly relevant to the establishment" of the volkstaat; - Make feasibility and "other relevant" studies; - Submit representations to and advise the constitution-making body, or constituent assembly, and the Commission on Provincial Government "with regard to the possible establishment of a volkstaat and any matter in connection therewith", and - Perform other functions as may be prescribed by an Act of Parliament. The proposal adds the procedures to be followed by the volkstaat council in performing its functions will be prescribed by Parliament. It further adds: "The procedures provided in this constitution with regard to the finalisation of provincial boundaries shall not be construed as preventing the establishment of such a volkstaat, and in the event of the acceptance of a volkstaat alternative provision shall be made by an Act of Parliament for the finalisation of the boundaries of any affected province or provinces."
