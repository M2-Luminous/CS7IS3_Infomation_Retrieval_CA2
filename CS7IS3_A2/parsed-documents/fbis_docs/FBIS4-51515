The political situation is likely to become insecure, and there is spreading concern regarding matters like North Korea over which the ruling and opposition parties are expected to differ. According to an official of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF]: "Now the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] has returned to the opposition camp, the bureaucrats' power might become weaker than under the Hosokawa government." An official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] admitted: "If the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ get together, the Diet will become shaky; it will be difficult to implement policies." The Hosokawa government, which had the SDPJ on its side, was able to actively pursue policies on rice market liberalization and programs on the taxation system and pension reform, led by bureaucrats, but under the new government there is concern because "it is unclear how the SDPJ will act," as an official of the Ministry of Health and Welfare noted. Another official of the MAFF said: "It will become difficult for us to work not only on opposition parties but also on ruling parties; it will not be easy to implement policies." There are also many who think that with the birth of the new coalition government a change will occur in the present trend of "bureaucrats having more power than politicians." But as far as such issues as Japan-U.S. relations--an area where there are almost no policy differences between the ruling and opposition parties--are concerned, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] said: "All we have to do is continue to do the things we were doing." Officials of MOFA are pleased to have Koji Kakizawa as their new minister, saying, "It should be easy to work with him since he is familiar with foreign affairs." Likewise, the Economic Planning Agency has many expectations of its new director general, Yoshio Terazawa, who is well versed in economics and known for his "fine background" including his time as president of Nomura Securities U.S.A. (according to a senior official of the agency). Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance, which has the task ahead of reforming the taxation system, is happy that its minister will remain in post. Vice Minister Jiro Saito said: "He is my senior as a bureaucrat, and we can work like one man." The views of ministries differ regarding the fact that the Hata government strongly favors Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] members. In MITI, which experienced the "incident of intervention" by former MITI Minister Kumagai to remove a senior official, the general response was: "The man whom the vice ministers have to watch closely has changed from Kumagai (known to be close to Ozawa) to Hata (known to be close to Prime Minister Hata); we should be able to work with him better." In the case of the Ministry of Transport, which has a new minister from Komeito, the picture was one of relieved ministry officials. The officials said: "If we had someone from Shinseito, we would have the difficult problem of what distance we should maintain with Shinseito on the one hand, and with the LDP on the other."
