FR940526-2-00093 FR940526-2-00063 Executive Summary This report culminates the fourth living-cost comparison study undertaken by Runzheimer International for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) under contract OPM&hyph;90&hyph;0705. The contract requires Runzheimer to: (1) Survey living costs in 7 cost-of-living allowance (COLA) areas and the Washington, DC, area, and (2) Compare living costs between the areas and the DC area. To determine living costs in the identified areas and build this report, Runzheimer researched over 3,000 outlets and gathered more than 12,000 price quotes. This report presents the results of the living-cost surveys conducted during the summer of 1993. The results of the winter 1994 living-cost surveys will be presented in a subsequent report to be provided to OPM in mid-1994. To ease interpretation of the research results, we display the outcome of the comparisons as living-cost indexes in the table below. In addition, the table shows living-cost indexes for federal employees who have unlimited access to commissary and exchange facilities because of their employment. The index for the Washington, DC, area (not shown) is 100.00 because it is, by definition, the reference area.
