The following is a report on the meeting by Laurent Kagimbi: [Begin Kagimbi recording] After an introductory speech by the president of the Republic, the council first studied a draft of the internal rules. The council then exchanged general views on the state of security prevailing in the entire country, particularly in Bujumbura. While discussing other business, it examined the modalities of going on meet-the-people visits to work toward a return to peace. Concerning the internal rules, the council members examined the proposed draft, contributed to it, and referred its adoption to the next session. On the problem of security in the entire territory, and in particular in the capital, the security members studied the issue in all its aspects and found that it was a priority concern for the country's leaders and the population. The council sadly noted that if peace and security were not restored swiftly, the country would inexorably slip into perdition. The council expressed its deep sympathy for the victims of this destructive madness, which has befallen our dear motherland since the coup attempt in which the elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, was killed. In order to restore security and peace in the country, the National Security Council proposes to the government the following: First, all the institutions of the Republic and political and moral leaders of society must permanently speak the language of peace and reconciliation. The spirit of solidarity must be revived and reinforced so that the people, irrespective of their ethnic affiliations, can cultivate a spirit of mutual help in the face of danger, fighting together against criminals and all types of wrongdoers, and reject the enticement of those who want to once more drag them into ethnic violence and vengeance. Second, all the institutions charged with public order, whether magistrates, administrative leaders or security forces, must carry out their tasks with discipline, work in permanent consultation, and act with the utmost firmness to neutralize all troublemakers and all wrongdoers who kill, loot, and destroy. In this respect, the government must establish a crisis committee which will meet daily to assess the situation, identify those responsible for the tragic events we are experiencing, propose strategies for fighting them, and report daily to the president of the Republic. The crisis committee will include the minister of state for the interior and public security, the minister of national defense, the minister of justice, and the general administrator in charge of national documentation and immigation. Third, concerning disarmament, the government must study methods and appropriate working structures so that this operation, which is indispensable, does not become an occasion for confrontation but rather an operation which, with the participation of everyone, aims to restore peace. Concerning Bujumbura, the government must put in place the following measures: One, the establishment and revival of administrative structures which must cooperate closely with the security forces. To this end, every zone leader will be delegated an Army officer charged with assisting him in security matters and in the intervention of security forces. Two, a patronage committee will be set up in every zone, and will be charged with administrative problems and security forces to restore the peace. The committee will consist of a government member [as heard], a National Assembly member, a National Security Council member, and a field officer of the Armed Forces or the Gendarmerie. Three, there will be a gradual reduction in military checkpoints and a placing of intervention groups on alert in the barracks, so that these forces can quickly swing into action to rescue the populace at the request of the administrative authorities, or in case of emergency. Concerning some foreigners, particularly groups of young Rwandans who sow insecurity, the government must strictly apply the laws in force at the national and international levels. In conclusion, the National Security Council called upon all the Burundian people to commit themselves fully to the return of peace and reconciliation. If this is not done, our motherland will inexorably head towards its destruction. [end recording]
