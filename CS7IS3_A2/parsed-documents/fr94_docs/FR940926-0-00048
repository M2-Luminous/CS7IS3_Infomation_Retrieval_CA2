FR940926-0-00048 FR940926-0-00010 S5.4.2.2␣ The wall thickness of a liner to a Type 2 container shall be at least an amount such that the compressive stress in the sidewall of the finished container at zero pressure shall not exceed 95 percent of the yield strength of the liner as determined in S5.7 and S5.7.1 or 95 percent of the minimum design yield strength shown in S5.7.3. The maximum tensile stress in the liner at service pressure shall not exceed 66 percent of the yield strength. S5.4.2.3␣Stresses at the end designs at internal pressures between no more than 10 percent of service pressure and service pressure shall be less than the maximum stress limits in the sidewall as prescribed above. S5.4.3␣Type 3 containers. The wall thickness of a liner to a Type 3 container shall be such that the compressive stress in the sidewall of the finished container at zero pressure shall not exceed 95 percent of the minimum yield strength of the liner as determined in S5.7 and S5.7.1 or 95 percent of the minimum design yield strength shown in S5.7.3 S5.4.4␣ Type 4 containers. The wall thickness of a liner to a Type 4 container shall be such that the permeation rate requirements of this specification are met. S5.5␣ Composite reinforcement for Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4 Containers. S5.5.1␣Compute stresses in the liner and composite reinforcement using National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) NAS 3&hyph;6292, Computer Program for the Analysis of Filament Reinforced Metal-Shell Pressure Vessels , (May 1966). S5.5.2␣The composite overwrap shall meet or exceed the following composite reinforcement stress ratio values shown in Table 3. S5.6␣ Thermal treatment. S5.6.1␣ Steel containers or liners. S5.6.1.1␣After all metal forming and welding operations, completed containers or liners shall be uniformly and properly heat treated under the same conditions of time, temperature and atmosphere prior to all tests. S5.6.1.2␣All containers or liners of steel grades ``Chrome-Molybdenum'' or ``Carbon Boron'' shall be quenched in a medium having a cooling rate not in excess of 80 percent that of water. ``Carbon-Manganese'' steel grades shall be normalized and do not require tempering after normalizing. S5.6.1.3␣All steel temperature on quenching shall not exceed 926 C (1700 F). S5.6.1.4␣All containers or liners or steel grades ``Chrome-Molybdenum'' or ``Carbon Boron'' shall be tempered after quenching at a temperature below the transformation ranges, but not less than 482 C (900 F) for ``Carbon-Boron'' steel or 565 C (1050 F) for ``Chrome-Molybdenum'' steel. ``Carbon Manganese'' steel grades do not require tempering after normalizing. S5.6.2␣ Aluminum containers or liners (seamless and welded). After all forming and welding operations, aluminum containers or liners shall be solution heat treated and aged to the T6 temper. The liner and composite overwrap shall meet the cycle life and strength requirements set forth in S7.1 and S7.2 of this standard. S5.7␣ Yield strength, tensile strength, material elongation (metal containers and metal liners only). To determine yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation of the material, cut two specimens from one container or liner. The specimen either has (a) a gauge length of 50 mm (2 inches) and a width not over 38 mm (1.5 inches), or (b) a gauge length of four times the specimen diameter, provided that a gauge length which is at least 24 times the thickness with a width not over 6 times the thickness is permitted when the liner wall is not over 5 mm (3/16 inch) thick. The specimen shall not be flattened, except that grip ends may be flattened to within 25 mm (1 inch) of each end of the reduced section. Heating of specimens is prohibited. S5.7.1␣ Yield strength. The yield strength in tension shall be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent based on the gauge length. S5.7.1.1␣The yield strength shall be determined by either the ``offset'' method or the ``extension under load'' method as prescribed by Standard Test Methods for Tension Testing of Metallic Materials , ASTM E8 1993. S5.7.1.2␣In using the ``extension under load'' method, the total strain or ``extension under load'' corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations shall be based on an elastic modulus of 69 GPa (10,000,000 psi) for aluminum, or 207 GPa (30,000,000 psi) for steel. If the elastic extension calculation does not provide a conclusive result, the entire stress strain diagram shall be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset. S5.7.1.3␣For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain is set while the test specimen is under a stress of 41 MPa (6,000 psi) for aluminum, and 83 MPa (12,000 psi) for steel. The strain indicator reading is set at the calculated corresponding strain. S5.7.1.4␣Cross-head speed of the testing machine is 3.2 mm (1/8 inch) per minute or less during yield strength determination. S5.7.2␣ Elongation. Elongation of material, when tested in accordance with S5.7, shall be at least 14 percent for aluminum or at least 20 percent for steel; except that an elongation of 10 percent is acceptable for both aluminum and steel when the authorized specimen size is 24t gauge length x 6t wide, where ``t'' equals specimen thickness. S5.7.3␣ Tensile strength. Tensile strength shall not exceed 725 MPa (105,000 psi) for ``Carbon Manganese'' and 966 MPa (140,000 psi) for ``Chrome-Molybdenum'' and ``Carbon-Boron.'' S6␣ General requirements.
