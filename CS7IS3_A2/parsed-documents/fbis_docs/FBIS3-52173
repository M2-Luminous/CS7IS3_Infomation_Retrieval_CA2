Thousands of copies have been distributed to soldiers by a body calling itself The Popular Committee -- the IDF [Hava'ada Ha'amamit -- Tzahal]. The leaflet says: "We, a group of reserve officers and soldiers, have decided to organize against this trend. We appeal to anyone who is ready to take action and to anyone who has information about such phenomena, asking him to contact The Popular Committee -- the IDF, which is a body affiliated with recently established action committees that monitor the political exploitation of state organizations and state budgets. We need every piece of information and are willing to help soldiers who want to fight against the phenomenon." The soldiers are requested to send their information to Jerusalem post office boxes whose numbers are listed in the leaflet. According to the leaflet, the IDF is ceasing to be a popular army and becoming an army in the service of the left wing. The leaflet notes that the troops orders drafted by the chief education officer and disseminated in every army sector infuriated the right wing. Furthermore, reserves troops beginning a tour of duty receive instructions in which settlers are presented in one category with terrorist organizations, it says. It goes on to say that IDF generals and other senior officers, who oppose the peace process, are not allowed to voice their views, while dovish senior officers are constantly permitted to do the same. The latter include Major General 'Uzi Dayan, Brigadier General Yomtov Sami', Brig. Gen. Doron Almog, Southern Command Commander Matan Vilna'i, "and the worst was when that general who holds plainly left-wing views, Major General Shahaq, the deputy chief of staff, went to Oslo to make gestures and concessions to terrorists." The leaflet adds that "it is no wonder that in such an atmosphere, the introduction of a Torah scroll into a place as sacred to Judaism as Joseph's Tomb in Nabulus is seen as provocation by the leftist-Arab government, and that IDF soldiers are ordered to bar the celebrations in the midst of Hanukkah. It is no wonder that in such an atmosphere, IDF troops are summoned to block the way to Joseph's Tomb although it involves a desecration of the Sabbath." The leaflet further says that while the IDF was reluctant to appoint Dani Nave as its spokesman, it did appoint Avi Bnayahu, "who works for the left-wing 'AL HAMISHMAR newspaper, promoting him to colonel. The IDF Radio is a left-wing bastion and a training ground for future left-wing reporters, and [IDF Radio director] Moshe Shlonsky, who was brought in from that left-wing television, is running the place as if it was a private Peace Now estate, and an announcer who said on air that Rabbi Levinger is the murderer from Hebron has kept his job, receiving a mere reprimand." MAPAM [United Workers Party] Chairman Hanan Erez has warned against the attempts by anonymous radical circles going under the name of The Popular Committee -- the IDF, to exploit the army, undermining its standing and the public confidence in it and its senior commander through their efforts to sabotage the peace process. Hanan Erez called on Ori Or, chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, to take immediate action against the dangerous phenomenon.
