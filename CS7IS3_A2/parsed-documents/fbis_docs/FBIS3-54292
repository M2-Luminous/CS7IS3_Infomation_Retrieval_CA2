That was the first reaction to the document announced by the National Dialogue Committee for the settlement of the crisis between Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Brig. Gen. Baras also requested a percentage of the oil royalties for Hadramaut. Observers fear that that demand might hinder the agreement as the Follow-up Committee holds its first meeting today to name the venue and set a date for the signing of the agreement by the Yemeni president, vice president, and House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. In his capacity as chairman of the national conference in the governorate of Hadramaut, Brig. Gen. Baras told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the document was not as broad as we had expected. He urged reconsideration on the question of the percentage that the governorate or district should get of the oil and mineral wealth it produces and of its fishing resources, no matter how small. Speaking on behalf of the Hadramaut Governorate, the biggest governorate and richest in oil, fish, and agricultural products, Brig. Gen. Baras said that giving a reasonable portion of the revenues of the wealth produced by each governorate to that governorate was a point included in the recommendations and demands of the Hadramaut national conference held in mid-December. Baras is a veteran politician who recently resigned from the General Committee (Central Committee) of the General People's Congress led by Yemen's president because of the party's policies resulting in the country's crisis. He said: The districts should be granted more powers including promulgation of laws to safeguards many rights of the inhabitants. [passage omitted]
