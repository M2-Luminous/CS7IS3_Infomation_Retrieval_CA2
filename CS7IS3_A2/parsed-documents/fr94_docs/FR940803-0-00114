FR940803-0-00114 FR940803-0-00040 VI. Administrative Requirements A. Administrative Designation Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 1, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. This regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the old Executive Order 12291. It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866. OMB reviewed this document under Executive Order 12866 and had no comment. B. Reporting & Recordkeeping Requirement The information collection requirements in this rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICR NO. 783.29) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch; EPA, 401 M Street, SW., 2740. These requirements are not effective until OMB approves them and a technical amendment to that effect is published in the Federal Register . This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 14,600 hours per response and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 1,250 hours per respondent. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the date needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The regulations do not impose any new significant reporting or recordkeeping burden. They provide for the inclusion of alternative-fueled automobiles in the current fuel economy programs. The reporting and recordkeeping burdens associated with fuel economy of alternative-fueled and current automobiles are identical with the exception of minor changes in fuel economy label wording for alternative-fueled automobiles. In addition, it is difficult to accurately separate the total burden of the fuel economy program, because much of the testing and data input for determining fuel economy is coincident to that of the emissions program. In summary, the current impact of the final regulations' testing, recordkeeping and reporting burden is negligible. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch (PM&hyph;2136); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' C. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of federal regulations upon small entities. In instances where significant impacts are possible on a substantial number of these entities, agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA). Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The fuel economy regulation revisions herein provide Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) credits to manufacturers of alternative-fueled vehicles who are subject to the CAFE program, most of which are large automobile manufacturers and therefore will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
