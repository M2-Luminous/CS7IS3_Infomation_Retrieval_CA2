Negotiations are under way between the SDP, a chief opponent of the 7 percent "national welfare tax" proposed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and other groups in Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, the EPA director general told a press conference. But an early settlement is possible only if the coalition parties agree to revise the content of the new tax, particularly its purpose and the rate of taxation, Kubota said. Kubota strongly dismissed the new tax as a source of financing for the 6 trillion yen income tax cut expected in the government's new pump-priming package, branding it "a consumption tax increase in disguise." It is "very regrettable" that the prime minister decided to introduce the new tax without going through "due process," including full discussion among the coalition parties and working to achieve a national consensus, Kubota said. She said the EPA is prepared to announce the new economic package as soon as the dispute over the new tax is settled. Kubota said the new tax should be modified so that the use of its proceeds is limited to social welfare-related areas. Hosokawa's new tax does not oblige the government to use the proceeds in specific ways even if it is called a welfare tax. She also sought a revision of the tax rate, explaining the need for full-fledged discussions to justify a specific rate. As for the timing of the tax's enforcement, she said it should be delayed as long as possible in view of the economic impact. Kubota said she is prepared to resign as EPA chief if the national welfare tax is endorsed as it currently stands. In reference to the 6 trillion yen tax cut, Kubota said the scale of the measures should have an impact on the Japanese economy, especially on stagnant personal spending.
