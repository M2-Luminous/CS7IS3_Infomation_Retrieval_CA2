FR940419-2-00115 FR940419-2-00067 (b) Whether, on the basis of such violations and the additional violations set forth in the Notice of Violation that the Licensee admitted, this order should be sustained. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 8th day of April 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. James Lieberman, Director, Office of Enforcement. Appendix_Evaluations and Conclusion On September 13, 1993, a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was issued for three violations identified during an investigation conducted by the NRC Office of Investigations (OI) from October 9, 1991 through September 14, 1992. Department of Veterans Affairs (Licensee) responded to the Notice in two letters dated November 9, 1993. In its responses, the Licensee admitted Violations A and C.1, denied Violations B and C.2, and requested partial mitigation of the civil penalty based on its prior performance and lack of evidence of actual harm to any patient or member of the public. The NRC's evaluations and conclusion regarding the Licensee's requests are as follows: Restatement of Violation B 10 CFR 35.53 requires, in part, that a licensee measure the activity of each radiopharmaceutical dose that contains more than 10 microcuries of a photon-emitting radionuclide before medical use. Contrary to the above, the technologist failed to measure three radiopharmaceutical doses that contained more than 10 microcuries of a photon-emitting radionuclide administered to patients on July 22, 1991. Summary of Licensee Response to Violation B The Licensee denied this violation and indicated that the evidence does not support the technologist's alleged failure to measure the radiopharmaceutical doses on July 22, 1991. In support of its denial, the Licensee stated that the count rates of these doses when compared with the count rates of seven doses administered within sixty days of July 22, 1991, reflect doses within acceptable limits. Therefore, argues the Licensee, it is not credible that this could be a chance result in the absence of measuring by the technologist. NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Response to Violation B The Licensee presented data to indicate that the doses administered on July 22, 1991, had count rates similar to those previously administered. This data, however, provides no information which would indicate that the does administered to patients on July 22, 1991, were measured in a dose calibrator at the appropriate setting for Technetium&hyph;99m. The information is not material to Violation B in that your analyses provides information relating to the activity of material as measured during the scans themselves, but not whether activity was measured in the dose calibrator prior to administration.
