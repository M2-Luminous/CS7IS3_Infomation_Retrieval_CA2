Thus, factual natural gas supplies over the above period amounted to 2,445.2 million cu. m. [cubic meters] versus the expected figure of 1,606.8 million cu. m. Turkmenistan's natural gas exports to Ukraine, which were stopped on February 22, have not been resumed, the negotiation process underway notwithstanding. Turkmenistan is reported as adamant in its decision not to resume its natural gas supplies to Ukraine before Ukraine has repaid its debt for Turkmen natural gas supplies in 1993. Under the thus repudiated agreement the Central Asian nation was to supply 1,087.1 million cu. m. of natural gas to Ukrgazprom during the 11-24 March period. As a result of an agreement, which the Ukrainian [word indistinct] reached with Russia's Gazprom joint-stock society on 10 March, the Russian party undertook to supply additional natural gas to Ukraine in amounts sufficient to temporarily offset about 80 per cent of what Turkmenistan would have supplied to Ukraine, had it not discontinued natural gas exports to Ukraine. The agreement will remain effective until 10 April, when Russia and Ukraine are supposed to hold talks about their account settling. Gazprom is reported to have laid down its terms, which the two [word indistinct] have refused to make public, though. It has been tipped off, however, that the Ukrainian party has been discussing not only a compromise decision, but also its likely having to accept the Russian party's terms, if the former variant proves impossible. According to Ukrgazprom, the Russian party has been sticking to its temporary commitment almost fully and unswervingly having supplied additional 837.4 million cu. m. of natural gas between 11 and 24 March, which is about 77.2 per cent of the amount Ukraine was supposed to be supplied by Turkmenistan. Ukraine's natural gas consumption over the same period was 4,096.8 million cu. m. versus the expected figure 4,747.4 million cu. m., according to Ukrgazprom, due both to the warmer weather conditions and more stringent fuel- and power saving moves by the government along with some enterprises having transferred to alternative fuels. As spokespersons of the Ukrainian State Committee for oil and gas maintain, despite these temporarily stabilized natural gas supplies to Ukraine, the overall situation remains rather precarious because of Ukraine's faulty and inefficient fuel clearance system and the fuel consumers' formidable domestic indebtedness. Moreover so, that the outcome of the 10 April talks with Russia is too hard to predict.
