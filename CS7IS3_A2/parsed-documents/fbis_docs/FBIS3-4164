At a working conference of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) held earlier this month in Beijing, it was announced that the CAAC plans to invest 3.58 billion yuan ($411.5 million) this year in improving airports, 59.4 percent more than in 1993. The conference mapped out detailed airport construction and expansion schemes around the country. But the status of the expansion of Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport and construction of a second airport in the Pudong New Area were left vague in the CAAC's documents, which merely say "preparations should be continued." A source at the Hongqiao Airport told Business Weekly that airport construction in Shanghai faces two uncertainties that may hamper development. First, it is unclear whether expanding Hongqiao or building the new airport is more beneficial to the city. Since the chances of starting both at the same time are slim, supporters are fiercely lobbying for each scheme. Government officials are leaning toward the Pudong airport, and Business Weekly has learned that the Japanese Government may finance the project. The second uncertainty is over who will take charge of Hongqiao Airport. About two years ago, the CAAC decided to hand control of airports over to local governments. By gaining full rights to administer airports, local authorities also assume responsibility for raising construction capital. Progress in this reform has been slow. In Shanghai, in fact, the CAAC still manages Hongqiao Airport. Because of this, both the CAAC and the Shanghai government hesitate to inject money into airport renovation. Aviation experts don't expect these two uncertainties to be resolved for at least half a year. But by then, Hongqiao Airport must be operating at full capacity.
