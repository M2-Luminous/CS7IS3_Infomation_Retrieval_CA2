On 27 april, we launched a sweep operation against the two-headed elements along Route 10 beginning from the west. After fighting for the whole day from 0600 at dawn to 0630 in the evening, we smashed and liberated the 4th Division command post at Treng on Route 10. This area has been a strategic position of the communist Vietnamese, communist Vietnamese puppets, and two-headed government since 1979. Treng, the bridgehead of the defense line of Battambang town, has vanished. Hul Savoan, four-star general and commander of Battambang's 5th Military Region, who fled from Pailin to hide in Treng after being routed, has disappeared from this area. We also totally swept the enemy positions at Phlov Meas and Phum Tuol. We seized four 37-mm, three 76.2-mm, and six 12.7-mm artillery pieces and a large quantity of small guns. We are pushing forward.
