Yemen's position on any resolution that the council may pass will be influenced by its wording, the minister told Radio Qatar during an interview it carried today. Asked to comment on a political initiative by the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP], the minister said he thought Sanaa and unionists within the YSP in Aden were in touch in an attempt to fashion a mutually agreeable formula. If such a formula is worked out, he added, it will mark a point of departure. The minister stressed that any such arrangement should provide for Yemen's unity, preserve legitimacy, produce a cease-fire, and ensure the unity of the military. These are key elements of the consultations, he pointed out. A decision about whether the forces of legitimacy would enter Aden, al-Iryani said, would be made with reference to political considerations and a concern to spare civilians the horrors of war. The Arab League's approach to the developments in Yemen must respect the country's national unity, Constitutional legitimacy, and the unity of the Armed Forces. Any Arab mediation effort not grounded in these principles will be non-productive, the foreign minister stressed. Arab mediation efforts have yet to go beyond exhortations to stop fighting to a well-defined plan for a practical solution. This kind of approach was plausible before the war broke out. However, with a war now raging, there is a need for a political agreement that will rule out a future recourse to force of arms. Dr. al-Iryani praised Qatar's position underscoring Yemen's unity and Constitutional legitimacy.
