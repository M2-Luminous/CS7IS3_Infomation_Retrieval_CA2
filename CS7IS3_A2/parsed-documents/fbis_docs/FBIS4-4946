FBIS4-4946 "dreas066_d_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 South Korea DPRK Ambassador to India Interviewed DPRK Ambassador to India Interviewed SK0604132694 Seoul YONHAP in English 1045 GMT 6 Apr 94 SK0604132694 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] New Delhi, April 6 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean ambassador here, asserting "threat of nuclear arms development by South Korea and Japan is becoming a reality," said Wednesday his country will determine whether to develop nuclear weapons depending on the extent of the effect such a threat would have on their sovereignty. Ambassador Cha Pong-chu said in an exclusive interview with the YONHAP News Agency that at the moment North Korea has no plan to develop nuclear arms. "We hope to resolve the nuclear question through dialogue," Cha said. "To this end, a third-round North Korea-U.S. meeting should be held at an early date to discuss the issue." He claimed that Japan's intent of getting nuclearly armed is an openly-known thing. "Japan will rise up (militarily) again under all circumstances," he said. Cha said even if North Korea develops nuclear arms, they would not be directed against other part of the Korean peninsula where he said the same brethren live or against the United States across the Pacific. "Our nuclear arms, if developed, would be primarily designed to contain Japan," he said. The ambassador said North Korea's official position toward the issue of nuclear development is that "we have neither the intent nor the ability of developing nculear weapons." In particualr, he said, North Korea has no expertise to develop nuclear weapons. Cha said North Korea will not attack South Korea first. "But, if we were attacked, we will not sit idly by," he said, adding that if a war recurs, there will be no winner or loser. "We all will have no choice but to die," he said. He further said North Korea has already gone through all IAEA inspections, the outcome of which he said showed there is no nuclear suspicion. "IAEA's demand for additional inspection notwithstanding is an undue pressure stemming from a scheme of the United States to eliminate us," the North Korean ambassador said.
