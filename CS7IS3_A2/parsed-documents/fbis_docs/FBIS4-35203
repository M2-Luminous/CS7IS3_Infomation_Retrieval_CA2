The PLO added in a statement, a copy which has reached KUNA, that it has become necessary to reiterate clearly and publicly that there was no foundation whatsoever to the reports on the deportation of thousands of people to East European counties, to al-Hirmil, to the Biqa' valley, or anywhere else. The statement went on to say: It is important that our people everywhere, particularly in Lebanon, should know that the PLO did not reach agreement with anyone on the problem of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon or elsewhere. The statement described such reports as fabrications which could only be hatched by people with bad intentions who fish for rumors in order to use them to the detriment of the Palestinian people's unity. It added that the "problem of refugees is a sacred topic which no one should manipulate. It is furthermore an issue which revolves around the sacred right of return which is cherished by the PLO and every Palestinian."
