In the declaration approved at the meeting, participants demand expanding the jurisdiction of local government and a new territorial-administrative arrangement in Slovakia. Representatives of the Hungarian minority are asking for either one territorial-administrative unit stretching from Bratislava to Kosice or three separate units. Either variant would give ethnic Hungarians a significant majority in those regions. Meeting participants also demanded that the rights of the Hungarian minority be anchored in the Slovak Constitution, stating that they consider the use of Hungarian as an official language everywhere that Hungarians make up at least one-tenth of the population to be vital for the development of the Hungarian community. A 1991 census in Slovakia found that more than 600,000 Hungarians -- 11.5 percent of the population -- live in Slovakia. They are represented in 522 towns and villages. Almost 98 percent of all ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia live in the region along Slovakia's southern border, where they make up close to 70 percent of the population.
