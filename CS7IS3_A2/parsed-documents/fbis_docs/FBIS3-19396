Lambeck report: "Rexrodt Becoming Target of FDP Criticism"] [Text] Bonn -- After the lost Lower Saxony elections, criticism of Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt is increasing within the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. The party's leading circles complain that Rexrodt has not done enough to improve the FDP's profile in his department. They say that the words that FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel said after the election defeat, "We simply have to get better," were directed at him. The FDP management says: "Rexrodt should finally show that he is not only a minister in the federal government, but also an FDP politician." The economics minister was criticized by Honorary Chairman Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Deputy Chairwoman Irmgard Schwaetzer, and former Interior Minister Gerhart Rudolf Baum. After all, the economy is a central issue in the 1994 super election year. Rexrodt has given in to the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] in the back room of the coalition too often. It has to become obvious that the FDP stands for more jobs in the coalition. According to information available to DIE WELT, Kinkel personally demanded: "We need a more aggressive economic policy." On the FDP's reliability as coalition partner, leadership circles say: "We are not a party of people wanting to commit political suicide." A shift of the Liberals is practically impossible at this point. In Monday's [14 March] management meeting, FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer said: "A coalition decision is not a single decision, but a process." What is striking in this context is the restraint shown by North Rhine-Westphalian FDP chairman and Kinkel opponent Juergen Moellemann. In the 23 May Federal Assembly, Moellemann wants to vote for Social Democrat Johannes Rau. Moellemann does not want to use the crushing defeat in the Lower Saxony elections against Kinkel. The reason: At the Rostock party conference in June, Moellemann wants to take the place of Carola von Braun, who retired from the presidium. The FDP is concerned about its weak position in the laender organizations. The Liberals must be prevented from becoming a mere federal party. They say: "The Liberals must not become a woman without reproductive organs."
