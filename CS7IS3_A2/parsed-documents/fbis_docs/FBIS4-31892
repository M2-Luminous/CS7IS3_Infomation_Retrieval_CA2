FBIS4-31892 "dreeu116__a94019" FBIS-EEU-94-116-A Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 ANNEX Poland IMF To Approve Draft Stand-By Agreement IMF To Approve Draft Stand-By Agreement LD1506172594 Warsaw PAP in English 1706 GMT 15 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD1506172594 Warsaw PAP English BFN [Text] Warsaw, June 15 -- A mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led by Deputy Head of the IMF's European Department Michael Deppler has agreed with the Polish side a draft stand-by agreement, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko and Deppler announced on Wednesday. It is expected that Poland and the IMF will sign the 18-month stand-by agreement end of July, early August, 1994. By the end of 1995, Poland is to obtain 900 million dollars for the financing of imports and agreements with the London Club on the buying back of the Polish debt. Deppler stated that the IMF mission familiarized itself with the "Strategy for Poland" economic development plan and praised its approach on the issues concerning the agreement with the IMF. The "strategy" is a realistic programme, Deppler said at the end of the mission's two-week visit but added that the agreed draft is an initial version and the final outcome will hinge on the results of talks with the London Club. The draft has to be approved by the IMF managing director and the Polish Government. Deppler announced that the new agreement is likely to be approved by the IMF's board of executive directors in early August. Kolodko claimed that the medium-term agreement with the IMF will concern the targets Poland wants to achieve, which are also included in the "Strategy for Poland," including a fall of inflation rate, the budget deficit and the defining of an active credit policy plus the level of interest rates. The draft also envisages the stability of Poland's foreign exchange reserves, Kolodko added. Asked about the agreement's performance criteria, Kolodko said the 1994 budget deficit is to agree with the level set by the budget law and in 1995 it should not exceed 3.7 per cent of the GDP. The inflation rate fixed at 16 per cent is also in accordance with the "Strategy" guidelines. Kolodko went on to say that the draft stand-by agreement does not envisage non-financial criteria but the "implementation of monetary targets depends on difficult measures in the sphere of social security," the finance minister argued.
