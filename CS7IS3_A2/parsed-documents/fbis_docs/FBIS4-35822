This emerged in a statement issued by the Central Committee today. The statement reviews the threats, objectives, and dimensions of the Israeli military escalation against Lebanon at this time in particular and the Western world's silence about it. The statement says: This escalation comes in continuation of the attempts by Israel and the hostile forces to strike at the forces that oppose the Gaza-Jericho agreement in order to implement this agreement, pave the way for it, and market it through the Palestinian gate to our Arab region. The statement praises the heroism and steadfastness of the national and Islamic resistance in Lebanon and warns our masses against the dimensions and threats of the new Israeli military escalation. It stresses that struggle will continue until the occupied territories are liberated. The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] also stressed that the Israeli attacks against Lebanon confirm the weakness of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and the true intentions of Israel's phony calls for peace with Lebanon and the Arabs. In a statement issued today on the anniversary of the 5 June 1967 Israeli aggression against the Arab nation, the DFLP says it urges everyone to confront Israel's schemes and savage aggression, in a manner that bolsters the march of the valiant intifadah in the occupied territories and ensures the implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy, which guarantee to the Palestinian people the right to liberate their land, determine their own future, and establish their independent state.
