The humanitarian situation in the area is a cause for concern, Boban says in his letter to the UN high commissioner, and adds that almost 100,000 people are facing death by starvation. Boban informs Sadako Ogata that in the past 50 days each inhabitant of the besieged Croat area in cental Bosnia has received less than 4 kg of food. Mate Boban goes on to accuse the UNHCR of not delivering humanitarian aid to the besieged central Bosnia populated by the Croats, since the Muslim attacks in the area have made the Vitez-Busovaca road impassable, and the UNHCR has kept silent about this. Boban also says that the UNHCR is resuming aid deliveries to Zenica, and that the largest part of the aid is taken by the Muslim army. Despite the promises given by the UNHCR regarding this, nothing has changed, Boban says, and adds that the humanitarian aid is used by the Muslim army to continue the war.
