On Monday they will be joined by Swedish specialists, and consultations will continue until June 22. Latvia wishes to start the dismantling of the complex as soon as possible. Its construction was started in 1976 and stopped in 1990. Production forms and records for those two buildings, which have a height of seven and 18 floors, have already been turned over to Latvia, as envisaged by bilateral agreements, signed in Moscow on April 30. The Latvian Government announced a contest among firms. It is going to place the order with the firm which undertakes to dismantle the buildings quicker than others with minimal expenditures. Americans promised to finance the project. It is not clear, however, how much money will be needed and in exactly what way the buildings will be dismantled. The problem is being discussed with the participation of officials from the U.S. Department of Defence. The agreements signed in the Kremlin have not yet been ratified by parliaments of the two countries. Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs was asked: "If the legislators do not support the agreements, how will it affect the dismantling process?" He said that the facility already belonged to Latvia, irrespective of the future of the treaty. Under the agreements, the old radar will function for another four years.
