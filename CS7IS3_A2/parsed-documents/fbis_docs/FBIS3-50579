This means that slightly more than 600,000 foreigners visited tourist spots in Cuba during the past 12 months -- a period that, according to Enrique Rodriguez, vice president of the National Tourist Institute (INTUR), showed results that came from very hard work. In brief statements to local reporters, Rodriguez said Cuba's tourism enterprises (INTUR, Cubanacan Corporation, and Gaviota Corporation) will work together in 1994 to boost tourism by some 40 percent. Special emphasis will be made (in 1994) to develop ecotourism and water activities (marinas and diving centers), Rodriguez said. A noticeable gain in 1993 tourist activities also was registered by Cubana de Aviacion airlines, which, according to Director General Heriberto Prieto, carried more than 450,000 travelers. According to Prieto, aside from Cubana de Aviacion, 29 foreign airlines fly to Cuba with 95 flights a week to nine tourist hubs.
