Now a new U.S. military strategy is beginning to take shape. Specifically, its contents are: Full attention to "economic security," maintaining reasonable military superiority, and strengthening the power to intervene in regional conflicts. What confronted Clinton when he entered the White House was a combination of weakening American economic power and a further destabilized situation in international security. He holds that the United States should stop approaching national security in the narrow, Cold War-style military terms. National security is above all economic security, and economic revitalization should be an overwhelming priority. The United States could not speak of itself "as a world leader" if it did not do that. To realize the strategic goal that "national security means primarily economic security," the Clinton Administration decided to conduct an overhaul of U.S. military structure. The military structure of the Cold War era will be replaced by a smaller but more flexible military force. The first step is to effect a reasonable cut in military force. By 1997, total troops on active service will have been cut to 1.4 million. Second, scale down the procurement of strategic nuclear weapons and high-tech conventional weapons, stop the enormously costly Strategic Defense Initiative project, and propose to reduce national defense expenditures by one third. Third, implement the "military-to-civilian conversion" plan to trim the national defense work force. Fourth, reduce the size of U.S. forces stationed in Europe and Asia, including slashing overseas military bases, installations, and troop strength. Fifth, heighten military attention to areas of concern to U.S. economic interests. But, in sharp contrast to U.S. overall troop cuts, troops stationed in the Middle East have been increased from the original 5,000 to 30,000 at present, indicating U.S. seriousness about safeguarding its lifeline -- oil. To ensure that the economic security strategy achieves its objectives, Clinton has vigorously tried to maintain the United States' status as the world's only superpower by calling for adjustment in four areas of its military force. One, while reducing the nuclear arsenal, the military will maintain a vital deterrent nuclear force. In line with its nuclear force deployment principles, this may reduce the targets for nuclear attack plans but will include Third-World countries possessing or possibly possessing nuclear weapons as targets for strategic nuclear weapons. Regarding policies for nuclear force development, the goal is guaranteed quality, reasonable curtailment, maintaining research and development, halting production, scrapping the Strategic Defense Initiative project, and implementing the "anti-missile defense" plan. Two, changing the conventional force into a rapid-deployment force ready to move into areas where U.S. interests are under threat, this will enable the U.S. to intervene in regional crisis and conflicts anywhere around the world. Three, maintaining the superior military quality of the U.S. Army and its advanced weapons. Funding for developing new weapons technology will continue even during ongoing military expenditure cuts, the focus being weapon systems dealing with regional conflicts. Four, building an intelligence system capable of providing prompt, accurate analysis of the military, political, economic, and cultural conditions of an area of potential conflicts. One notable feature of the Clinton Administration's military strategy is the increase in the strength of intervention in regional affairs. This forestalls any change in the international security structure that may be inimical to the United States. The Bush Administration's approach to regional conflicts was premised on the international balance of power and its use of force was often reactive. Whereas Clinton believes in limited state sovereignty,favors preemptive measures, and advocates the legitimacy and efficacy of supra-national military intervention. To prevent a global proliferation of ballistic missile technology and weapons of massive destruction, the United States will exert pressure on, and even "punish," companies and countries it believes are selling such technology. The United States is also stepping up negotiations with all concerned countries for a strict mandatory international nonproliferation treaty. Apart from continuing to stress the role of allies, the Clinton Administration has repeatedly stressed: Launching peace diplomacy, its readiness to act alone if necessary, reserving the right to "selective intervention"--with a majority of military interventions carrying a distinctivly economic color. In handling relations with allies, the United States favors equal emphasis on cooperation and competition; that is, full cooperation in solving regional conflicts and expenditure and risk sharing among allies; but competition in economic fields to force allies to open up their markets. The United States also stresses the goal of controlling regional conflicts through the United Nations; different arrangements for security in different regions; and, above all, maintaining a powerful military presence in key conflict areas, such as the Middle East, viewed as a potential model for a regional security pattern.
