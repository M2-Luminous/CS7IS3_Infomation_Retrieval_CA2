FR941107-2-00138 FR941107-2-00081 Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? These changes increase the maximum pressure for performing the low pressure test on the HPCI pump from approximately 150 psig to [less than or equal to] 175 psig. For reason stated above, HPCI pump testing must be performed when the [electro-hydraulic control] EHC System for the main turbine is available and capable of regulating reactor pressure. Operating experience has demonstrated that reactor pressures as high as 175 psig may be required before the EHC system is capable of maintaining stable pressure during the performance of the HPCI test. The probability of an accident is not increased because the proposed changes will not involve any physical changes to plant systems, structures, or components (SSC), or the manner in which these SSC are operated, maintained, modified, or inspected. In addition, the pressure at which the HPCI System is tested is not assumed to be an initiator of any analyzed event. The role of the HPCI System is in the mitigation of accident consequences. The consequences of an accident are not increased because a small increase in the pressure at which the HPCI pump performance to design specifications is verified will not significantly delay or otherwise affect the validity of the test to determine that the pump and turbine are still operating at the design specifications. In addition, it is overly conservative to assume a component is inoperable when a surveillance has not been performed. In fact, in most cases, it is a matter of component operability not yet being demonstrated since the usual outcome of the performance of a surveillance is the validation of conformance with surveillance requirements. Therefore, these changes will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
