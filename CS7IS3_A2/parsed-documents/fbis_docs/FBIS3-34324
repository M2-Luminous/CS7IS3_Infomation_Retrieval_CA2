Fallahian, quoted on Monday [7 February] by HAMSHAHRI newspaper, said the suspects either knew about the plot or played a direct role in the failed bid last Tuesday. A gunman fired several shots as the president addressed a gathering in the shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni to mark the 15th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, but nobody was hurt. The 26-year-old gunman, Kurosh Nik-Akhtar, was arrested immediately after the incident. His picture was published for the first time Monday on HAMSHAHRI's front page. Fallahian said all of the people arrested in connection with the shooting had confessed to having "ominous and counter-revolutionary aims." Several of the suspects are former members of leftist groups who served jail terms because of their "immoral and corrupt records," he said. The minister added that the suspects had held a meeting the night before the incident to coordinate the attack and to ensure its success.
