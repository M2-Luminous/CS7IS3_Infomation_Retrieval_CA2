Hata is scheduled to have talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on Monday. All indications are that Tokyo and Moscow will achieve no major breakthrough on a territorial row during Hata's three-day visit, since the new Russian parliament is dominated by ultrarightists and conservatives opposed to returning the four disputed islands to Japan.
