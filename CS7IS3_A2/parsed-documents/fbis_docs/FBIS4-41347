Every presidential candidate toured virtually all the regions of Ukraine and had many meetings with our electors. I was doing the same thing, which I am going to tell you about, about something I am today, as they say, deeply convinced of. First. People want to have hope. They want to have hope in the future. Unfortunately, they do not have it today. People want to live so that there is order in the country and decency in all the echelons of power. Today, this is unavailable. And, second, which is most important, actually everybody wants to live in an independent, sovereign and democratic Ukraine. But what is needed for this? For this we must create a strong economy. Because all issues dealing with science, culture and spirituality can only be solved if a strong economy is created. If one looks today at every candidate's program, they are virtually [word indistinct]; the difference is very slight. The algorithms, as they say, of getting out of this protracted crisis are virtually the same. And I am very glad that my views one year ago and today are that the future way of our state toward a strong economy lies through a single economic space with all the republics of the former Soviet Union, including Russia. And our relations with Russia should not be maintained at the expense of our relations with other states. In truth, our economy was developing in the former Soviet Union as a single organism, and it is from there that we receive virtually all our raw materials, and the markets for our goods are, as a matter of fact, in Russia and other republics of the former Soviet Union, and if we want to be civilized in the world, among the civilized countries of the world, then, really, our state should become a civilized bridge between the countries of the West and the countries of the former Soviet Union, between the latest Western technologies and what we have today. Our economy today, as a matter of fact, cannot live in the world economic space due to our technological backwardness. Actually, the views of all the candidates have become more or less uniform from the point of view of solving the Crimea issue, and from the point of view of the Black Sea Fleet and from the point of view of bilingualism. I would really like us to have a conversation today in terms of concepts so that we would also have an opportunity to look at these years of our [word indistinct], of our independence and, really, to determine, at least strategically, the main thing -- the way our state develops. I am convinced that we are all similar in respect to this. Thank you. I am ready for cooperation.
