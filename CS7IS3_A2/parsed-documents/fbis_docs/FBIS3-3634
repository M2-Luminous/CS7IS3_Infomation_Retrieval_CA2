Official sources here said that nearly 90 percent of the region's 420,000 herdsman families, who once lived as nomads, have settled down in permanent housing. In 1993, the income for each of the region's 1.895 million pastoral population averaged 1,164 yuan. An official survey shows that there were 58 television sets, 36 motorcycles and 47 sets of windmill power generators per 100 families. Rising living standards are the result of much improved farm conditions, the sources said. Since 1987, the region has upgraded nearly two million ha [hectare] of poor grassland into high-yielding pastures and built irrigation facilities on 80,000 ha of pastures. The region has also built 32.87 million square m of barns, which now accommodate 80 percent of its farm stock. On average, every 38 herdsman families now possess a feed warehouse and every 13 families a set of feed harvesting and processing machines, according to the sources. The sources said all these have helped put herdsmen in a better position to combat snow, frost and other natural disasters. With the improvement in efficiency in stock raising, the sources said, some 300,000 herdsmen in the region have given up herding for industrial or commercial positions.
