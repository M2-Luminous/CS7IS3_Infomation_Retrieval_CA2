Ideas on Better Improving Telecommunications Service Market Management To adapt to the needs of reform, opening, and socialist modernization, by better conforming to and serving our economic development focus, the posts and telecommunications sector, while striving to build a uniform, complete, and advanced national communications network, needs to fully tap all specific communications network potentials, by arousing the initiative of all parties, to speed up communications industry development. In recent years, China has opened up to the public some telecommunications service operations. The telecommunications services that are now open to public operation are: wireless call-finder services; 800 MHz (megahertz) colony phone services; 450 MHz (megahertz) wireless mobile communications services; domestic VSAT (very small antenna terminal) communications services; telephone information service business; computer information service business; electronic mailbox services; electronic data exchange services; video chart and document services; other telecommunications services approved or permitted by the State Council or MPT. To preserve normal communications order, ensure state and user communications safety and communications service quality, and create a climate of fair competition, we need to improve our management of telecommunications service markets that have been opened to operation. So we are setting forth the following ideas: 1. For open-operating [deregulated-operation] telecommunications services, we should practice declaration and operating license systems. For all operations at the provincial, autonomous regional, or municipal level, local posts and telecommunications management departments should take declarations, be responsible for examining, approving, and issuing operating licenses, and report to MPT for the record. For trans-provincial (-autonomous regional, -municipal) operations, MPT should take declarations, and be responsible for examining, approving, and issuing operating licenses [permits]. Without examination and approval, no unit or individual should be allowed to operate the abovementioned telecommunications services without authorization. As to specific application regulations for declaration and operating permit systems, MPT will draw up and publish them according to the abovementioned ideas. Units already operating the abovementioned telecommunications services should make up the pertinent formalities per provision. 2. Units applying to operate wireless communications services must apply for operating permits to the MPT or their local posts and telecommunications management departments according to the stipulated examination and approval jurisdiction, and can operate only after obtaining operating frequencies approved by the wireless management sector based on operating permits. 3. Departments and individuals that obtain approval to operate the abovementioned telecommunications services may not set up regional barriers, and must observe the pertinent national communications policies, laws, and regulations, submit to trade management, oversight, and inspection by the responsible state communications department, guarantee telecommunications service quality, strictly execute state expense policy and pertinent fee-collection [charge] standards, pay taxes according to law, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of users. Service operations may not obstruct the normal operation of the national public telecommunications network or communications development, or impede the regular operations of other specific communications networks. 4. The responsible state communications departments must create a climate of fair competition for posts and telecommunications enterprises and other enterprises that operate communications services. Posts and telecommunictions enterprises at all levels should act according to the principles of compensated use and reciprocity and the state of supply and demand, and cooperate with each other. Units approved by the responsible state communications departments and holding telecommunications service operating permits must provide items, such as the basic relay equipment and lines necessary for service, to ensure that they provide good telecommunications service to the public. 5. Foreign firms may not operate or participate in the operation of communications services in China. No cable or wireless communications services of the public and specific communications networks in China may by operated or participated in by any outside group, enterprise or individual, or by the wholly foreign-owned enterprises or Sino-foreign joint or contractual joint ventures already in operation in China, nor may they attract foreign investment in any form for shareholding operation. 6. MPT and all provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal posts and telecommunications management departments must oversee and inspect the execution of the abovementioned provisions. Posts and telecommunications enterprises and other units operating telecommunications services that violate the abovementioned provisions will be respectively warned, criticized by circular, given deadlines by which to put things right, ordered to stop operating, have their illegal operating income confiscated, and be subjected to administrative fines, all the way to penalties, such as revocation of operating permits. Posts and telecommunications departments at all levels are absolutely forbidden to exploit license-issuance opportunities for personal gain, or to secure advantages through pull or influence, and once discovered doing so will be punished severely.
