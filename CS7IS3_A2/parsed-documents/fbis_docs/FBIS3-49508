He spoke after today's meeting between members of the committee, those of the Defense and Security Committee, member of the U.S. Government and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright, and head of the U.S. Armed Forces John Shalikashvili. Partnership for Peace is an answer to the Central European states' demands for NATO membership, Payne said, adding, "this is the first time people have given serious consideration to the issue and come up with a certain approach to it." We have succeeded in breaking through a barrier, he said, quoting Shalikashvili's remark that three months ago something like that would have been impossible. The project has been conceived so that each state could set its own pace of integration into security structures, Payne said. The project includes the evaluation of individual countries' political conditions, namely progress on respect for democratic political system and frontiers, civil and human rights, budget transparency and civilian control of the military, Defense and Security Committee Chairman Vladimir Suman said. It will also include concrete aspect of military cooperation, such as army maneuvers and the sending of Czech representatives to NATO's political and military organs, Suman added.
