The report, obtained by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry Friday, showed that China exported 600 million dollars worth of goods to North Korea, up 11.3 percent from 1992, with crude oil accounting for 240 million dollars followed by grain (100 million dollars) and electric and electronic products (20 million dollars). In particular, North Korea's grain imports recorded a 44.1-percent increase last year from 1992, showing the North suffered greatly from food shortages caused by cold weather. The statistics also show that Pyongyang has switched to China from Russia for oil and ore imports since the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Meanwhile, North Korea shipped 300 million dollars worth of products to China last year, a 91.2-percent rise compared with the previous year, the report said. The total amount breaks down to 210 million dollars in steel, 20 million dollars in cement and 10 million dollars in sea products.
