The decision to hold prior coordination among the Arab sides to a four-party (Palestinian-Jordanian-Egyptian-Israeli) committee, which is proposed in the Sept. 13 autonomy agreement between Israel and the PLO, was taken during last week's Jordan-PLO meetings, the officials said. A sub-committee on refugees and displaced persons met on the sidelines of meetings of the higher Jordan-PLO Joint Committee attended by Deputy Prime Minister Sa'id al-Tall and PLO foreign affairs chief Faruq Qaddumi. Minister of State 'Adil Irshayd and PLO Executive Committee member Samir Ghawshah (Popular Struggle Front) chaired the sub-committee meetings, which submitted its recommendations to the higher committee, the official said. The Jordanian stand during the meeting was that prior coordination was a must among the Arab parties concerned before launching the proposed four-party committee and this was accepted by the PLO side, they said. Jordan has been refusing to entertain the idea of the four-party committee, which was sprung as a surprise to the Kingdom along with the secret autonomy accord negotiated by Israel and the PLO. Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said: "We believe in the conceptual approach to the issue; coordination between ourselves (Jordan and the PLO) first and then with Egypt before proceeding further." Dr. al-'Anani said no date had been set for the first meeting of the proposed four-party committee. Reports from Cairo and Tunis said it could take place in April. But Dr. al-'Anani indicated that the meeting would not take place until Jordan is satisfied that the Kingdom, the PLO and Egypt have coordinated their positions and are able to present a common stand to present in this context. The Jordan-PLO coordination is expected to be consolidated during a meeting next week of the joint sub-committee before the two sides approach Egypt, said Omar Khatib, the deputy chief of mission at the Palestinian embassy here. "The decision of the sub-committee was clear. Any negotiations with Israel over the fate of Palestinian refugees and displaced persons should be based on related U.N. resolutions regardless of any other considerations," Mr. Khatib told the JORDAN TIMES. U.N. Resolution 194 upholds the right of the Palestinian refugees of 1948 to return home or receive compensation. Resolutions issued since then uphold the same principle and call for an equitable solution to the problem of refugees. Mr. Khatib said Jordan and the PLO were awaiting the outcome of the ongoing Israel-PLO negotiations in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba before formulating further steps. He indicated that the Taba talks could produce a clear Israeli stand on how the Jewish state intended to handle the issue of displaced Palestinians. "We have to have a very clear perception of our own positions and options before we sit down with Israel (in the four-party committee); that is what Jordan and the PLO are trying to acheive," said Mr. Khatib. During last week's talks, Jordan agreed to conduct a census of displaced Palestinians living in the Kingdom for documentation purposes and eventually to find out how many of them would like to return to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. On Feb. 1, Egypt launched a similar survey of Palestinians from Gaza living in Arab countries after starting a census in its own teritory. It plans to close the enumeration on April 15. Response to the Egyptian census in Jordan has been very slow, diplomatic sources said. Palestinian "refugees" are classified as those who fled or were forced to flee their homes in Palestine when the state of Israel was created in 1948. Many of them ended up in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank only to be turned out again and forced across the Jordan River in the 1967 war. They were joined by many natives of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the flight; and these are classified as "displaced persons"-- meaning that they were displaced from their homes, not refugee camps, in the occupied territories. According to PLO statistics, the number of Palestinians "displaced" from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip during the 1967 war and their dependents now stands at 875,000. "The majority of them are living in Jordan, and the rest are in Egypt," said Mr. Khatib. "Very few of them are in Syria or elswhere." The Sep. 13 autonomy accord puts off any Israel-PLO discussion of the "refugees" until the "final status negotiations slated to be in in the third year of Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. But the issue of refugees and displaced persons is a prominent item on the agenda signed on Sept. 14 for peace negotiations between Jordan and Israel, thus making the Kingdom the only Arab party dealing with the subject until the final status negotiations. Jordanian officials say it was a significant achievement for Jordan that it managed to include the issue as a topic for bilateral negotiations. They say that Jordan's approach to the issue with Israel is on a state-to-state level with no prejudice of the right of the refugees to return home or receive compensation. Jordan is demanding compensation for having hosted Palestinian refugees on its soil. It points out that the refugee problem was a result of the creation of the state of Israel and as such Israel has a direct responsibility to address its consequences. Israel has ruled out the return of any massive number of Palestinians, but has agreed to consider allowing an unspecified but limited number to return, and both Jordnaian and PLO officials say they expect the issue to be one of the most thorny in negotiations.
