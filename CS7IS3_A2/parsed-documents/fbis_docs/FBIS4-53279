"Prime Minister Hata is unlikely to visit the United States prior to the summit meeting," the source said. Tokyo and Washington are currently trying to arrange a meeting between the two leaders during the Group of Seven summit slated for July 8-10 in Naples, or at another location in Europe, the source said. Japan, in bracing itself for the summit, has to work out specific proposals to alleviate the global unemployment problem, expand government investment, bolster the anemic economy, reform its taxation system and proceed with deregulation, he said. "Japan will make steadfast efforts to sketch out economic measures to bolster private consumption," he said.
