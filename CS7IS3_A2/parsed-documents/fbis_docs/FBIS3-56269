Mamedov said in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Friday [14 January] that the characteristic feature of the present talks was that "Russian-American relations came to the end of a period when bilateral ties focused, due to circumstances connected with the initial stage of Russian reforms, on rendering aid to Russia in the humanitarian and other spheres". "We witness now a switch to macroeconomic partnership, assistance in structural changes of the Russian economy, in restructuring of Russia's relations with close neighbours and major countries in the world as well as in a change of the attitude of international economic organisations to reforms in our country with a greater edge on social programmes," the deputy minister noted. According to Mamedov, Clinton "put forth a package of specific measures, to be taken by the United States together with other countries and international economic organisations, to help change radically attitudes to Russia in order to ensure a greater foothold for it on world markets and to ease Russia's economic relations with former Soviet republics. Mamedov noted that, thanks to U.S. assistance, international economic organisations will appropriate funds to countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States to purchase energy carriers from Russia at higher prices. "There is also a programme for converting the munitions industry to prevent greater unemployment. Funds released as a result of conversion will be channeled for social programmes, including creation of jobs," he continued. "You see, the package provides not for canned meat deliveries but serious measures which will help restructure the Russian economy and simultaneously create 'a social insurance system'." Incidentally, Mamedov added, Clinton, guided by an analysis of the situation made by American agencies, said during a discussion of the economic situation in Russia that Russia would make a powerful breakthrough in two years' time. In this connection, the sides discussed changing the seven most industrialised countries into a G-8. "This issue is difficult enough," Mamedov admitted. "The American side expressed support for such a change in the political resepect. It also noted that structural changes in the economy should lead to turning the G-7 into a G-8 also economically." ITAR-TASS learnt from a member of the Russian delegation at the talks, who refused to be identified, that the U.S. expressed support for Russia's admission to GATT during the second round of the summit. It was also made known that customs restrictions on nearly 4,400 types of Russian goods will be lifted on the American market. Mamedov noted that the Russian president supported the "Partnership for Peace" initiative put forth by Clinton.
