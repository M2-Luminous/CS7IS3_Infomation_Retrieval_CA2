On December 20, 1993, as supplemented on February 23, 1994, Keystone Energy Service Company, L.P. (Keystone) filed a power sale agreement with Atlantic City Electric Company. Keystone also requested waiver of various Commission Regulations. In particular, Keystone requested that the Commission grant blanket approval under 18 CFR part 34 of all future issuances of securities and assumptions of liability by Keystone. On April 28, 1994, the Commission granted the request for blanket approval under 18 CFR part 34, subject to the following: Within thirty days of the date of the order, any person desiring to be heard or to protest the blanket approval of issuances of securities or assumptions of liability by Keystone should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). Absent a request for hearing within this period, Keystone is authorized to issue securities and assume obligations or liabilities as a guarantor, indorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of any security of another person; provided that such issuance or assumption is for some lawful object within the corporate purposes of the applicant, and compatible with the public interest, and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for such purposes. The Commission reserves the right to require a further showing that neither public nor private interests will be adversely affected by continued approval of Keystone's issuances of securities or assumptions of liability. Notice is hereby given that the deadline for filing motions to intervene or protests, as set forth above, is May 31, 1994. Copies of the full text of the Order are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, room 3308, 941 North Capital Street N.E., Washington, DC 20426. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
