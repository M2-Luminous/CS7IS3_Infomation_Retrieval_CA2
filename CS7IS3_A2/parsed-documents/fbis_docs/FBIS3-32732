He said the statement represents interference in the country's internal affairs. Torres y Torres Lara held a news conference in which he decried U.S. President Bill Clinton's statements in connection with the implementation of the Law on Venue Dispute, which deals with the La Cantuta case. He also said he rejects the attack perpetrated against Deputy Chu Meriz's home. [Begin Torres y Torres Lara recording] I deeply deplore the statement released by President Clinton's administration, a friendly nation -- meaning the U.S. people -- in a way that it represents direct interference in Peru's internal affairs. We may err in Peru, and we may err many times, but we cannot allow, just as the United States would not allow, statements to be made regarding our internal affairs. This is very deplorable. [end recording] Moreover, Torres y Torres Lara said the Penal Court made its decision with complete independence. He added that the CCD will closely monitor the trial, which will now take place in a military court and should yield its first results within a month. [Begin Torres y Torres Lara recording] Our concern and decision to monitor the case is compelled by our desire to ensure that the military court fulfills its duty by drastically punishing those responsible. We will closely follow the case so that it does not turn out as other cases have on various occasions in other governments, meaning that neither a civilian nor a military venue punished the crime. The CCD will be fully provided with the necessary means to guarantee that justice prevails in Peru, whether through a civilian or a military venue. [end recording]
