While the reform packages are designed to support a market economy, it may be hard to carry them out smoothly. Since this year's reforms are vital, economists have warned the central government about possible problems that may emerge. Some departments may misunderstand the reform messages and others may fail to carry out changes to safeguard their vested interests. Economists said these actions could ruin the central government's reform plan. Also, an eye should be kept on the economy to prevent it from overheating, which will lead to high inflation. Chinese entrepreneurs and overseas experts are apparently more optimistic about China's reforms. They say changes are inevitable. Their view is based on the past 15 years of reform experience. Each time reform steps were taken, many people, particularly economists, were worried. But in the end the packages turned out basically well. "We have longed for such audacious reforms (of 1994) for years and the programme looks good," economist Wu Jinglian told China Daily over the weekend. Wu is a senior researcher with the Development and Research Centre, a major think tank of the State Council. But Wu warned about possible problems: "Reforms in some fields are being undertaken by the same people and organizations that are accustomed to the planned economy. "As there is no model for them to copy to create a socialist market economy, they could distort the reforms in practice," he said. Another problem is some people who are opposed to reform. Although they do not openly voice their dissatisfaction, they try to slow the reform process down in every possible way, Wu said. More dangerous, however, are those who flaunt the banner of reform while sabotaging or illegally profiting from programmes. "They have taken advantage of loopholes of reform at its initial stage," Wu said. "They are setting and seeking rents to pocket money by using their administrative powers in the immature market." These people hope the market does not open wider and refuse to support laws and regulations governing market activities. Wu said such types of people could be found last year in the banking and real estate sectors. "It is hoped that new laws which have been issued, or are to be announced, will prevent such loopholes," Wu said. At the same time, the relationship between the central and local governments should be improved because further reforms, especially financial ones, focus on re-distributing money between them. If localities resent sending the central government more money, the reforms will fail. In fact, central authorities, to avoid friction, have promised that this year's financial reform will not dampen regional interests. Observers say the announcement will console local officials and decrease the cost of reform. "No matter how difficult it will be, reforms in finance and taxation must be pushed ahead," said Ding Ningning, an economist with the Development and Research Centre. Most economists agree with Wu that the success of reforms, no matter how cleverly devised, depends on enforcement. Fan Hengshan, of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System, said "risks co-exist with success since this year's reform steps are the biggest. "There is the possibility that things may go contrary to our wishes when enforcement is carried out. This requires subtle handling." Another possible problem is that an overheated economy may upset a calm reform environment. This year's plan has set the fastest pace ever for China's growth and reforms. It requires the central government to keep control over the economy and a vigilant eye on inflation. Ding believes it will be difficult to achieve this goal. Control of the money supply has been relaxed since last September, when most State-owned enterprises were crying for funds. According to the State Statistics Bureau, banks increased 69.8 billion yuan ($8.0 billion) of loans as working capital to industrial enterprises between September and November last year. During the same period in 1992, the figure was only 25.2 billion yuan ($2.9 billion). With the increase in lending, industry grew 29.8 percent last December as against the same month of 1992. This was the second highest monthly growth rate registered in 1993. Industrial analysts say this is not great news because growth is too high for a period of economic readjustment. The readjustment programme started last July when the central government issued a package of measures to cool down the overheating economy. Finally, rapid growth fueled by huge investments may translate into high inflation. "Unwanted high inflation may emerge around the third quarter of this year if the central government fails to control the economy effectively," said Wu Jinglian. Meanwhile, the elimination of the two-tiered foreign exchange rate system has raised the likelihood of inflation. If prices run out of control, the central government will have to shift its attention and efforts from reform to fighting inflation. This may strand reforms. China experienced this in the late 1980s. At that time, the central government tightened control of the economy, which was then followed by a slow growth rate and a delay in further reforms. "It seems that the central government has drawn a lesson from this as it reaffirmed it would continue to enhance its macro control over the economy," said Fan Hengshan.
