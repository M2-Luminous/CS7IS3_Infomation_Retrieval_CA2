A Fatah source told AL-DUSTUR that there are undeclared real divisions in the Fatah Movement ranks, the most acute of which is that the Fatah command outside the territories has lost control over the Fatah strike forces in the occupied territories which call for suspending the negotiations with Israel. The sources added that several Fatah military officials might announce stands completely different from Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's stands if the Revolutionary Council does not convene.
