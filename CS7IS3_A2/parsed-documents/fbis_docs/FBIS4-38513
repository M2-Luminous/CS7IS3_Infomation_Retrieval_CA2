The statement notes, in particular, that "of late gross violations of law and order, explosions of military equipment, shellings of the Russian Army's peace-making forces and seizures of hostages have become more frequent in the area of the emergency situation." Lozovoi has called upon the relatives and friends of the captured men to remain calm and restrained and assured them that all necessary steps would be taken for their release. The head of the provisional administration stressed that the appropriate measures would be taken with regard to the authorities and heads of law-enforcement bodies of Northern Ossetia and Ingushetia who are unable or unwilling to carry out their duties in introducing law and order. The inactivity of the authorities of both republics may lead to an aggravation of the situation in the entire south of Russia, the statement notes.
