In a statement to our radio, he pointed out that failing to include the question of settlements in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks will make these talks pointless. He noted that the Palestinian side had called for the need to discuss the question of settlements before the Oslo agreement was signed to ensure protection for the Palestinians. Dr. 'Urayqat added that the Palestinian people want peace more than any other party. He expressed fears for the possible recurrence of the Israeli massacres against citizens in the occupied Arab territories. He emphasized the need for international protection to ensure that such incidents may not recur in the future.
