Chinese buyers are mainly interested in Vietnam's foodstuff for preparing specialities such as trionychil turtles, frogs, tortoises, eels, snakes, dogs, cats, chicken, illicium, green bananas and cashew nuts, and raw materials such as rubber, natural silk yarn. Meanwhile there is a wide range of consumer goods flowing from China to Vietnam. They include mechanical goods, processed foodstuffs, fresh fruits, motors, electric fans, hot water vacuum bottles, beer, mineral water, confectionery, medicinal herbs, garments, cosmetics, bicycles and so on. Goods were exchanged through official border gates as well as footpaths. Taking the lead in the cross-border goods exchange among the six northern border provinces is Lang Son. A market managing official in Lang Son revealed that Vietnamese and Chinese traders and transporters are seen everywhere along the 253 km of the provincial border line. The two-way flow of goods across the border is uncontrollable. In 1993 the province could collect import-exported taxes on only one-third of the volume of goods exchanged, namely VND [Vietnamese dong] 170 billion (roughly USD 17 million). At the small border gate of Tan Thanh, the quantity of exchanged goods every day is worth half a VND billion nearly USD 50,000, and there are about a hundred of such border gates in Lang Son Province. Opposite to Vietnam's border gates, it has been reported that there are big markets and export-import centres springing up on Chinese border areas specially in service of the cross-border trade.
