Petr Filippov Proposes an Interparty Purge"] [Text] According to INTERFAX, the Analytical Center on Socioeconomic Policy under the Russian Federation presidential administration has recommended that Boris Yeltsin to come out with a legislative initiative to introduce changes in the current legislation on political parties and elections to the State Duma and the election of the head of state. The aim of the proposed adjustment is to "do away with the hypertrophied multiparty practice." According to Petr Filippov, head of the analytical center and member of the Presidential Council, the implementation of this project will inhibit the further existence of "dwarf" parties and will also affect the interests of "leaders with disproportionate ambitions who have now become State Duma deputies." Mr. Filippov believes that in Russia there are no full-fledged political parties at present. "What we are used to calling a party is nothing but small groups of politically engaged citizens, united around one or several personalities. The president's main task, according to Petr Filippov, is to pass through the Federal Assembly draft laws which "would close one-man shows and drive political forces to concentrate within three or four large political parties." The authors of an analytical memorandum sent to the president deem it expedient to reregister parties before elections to the State Duma. It is proposed to make registration of a political party contingent on its concrete action program in the event that it comes to power. A party may be admitted to elections only if its plans have evoked a certain public response. To this end a party will need to publish its program in the central press as a paid commercial announcement, as well as no less than 10 articles discussing and commenting on it. The document gives special attention to the problem of party financing, which, in the authors' opinion, cannot be done by legal entities. Analytical center experts propose to extend the right to contribute to party funds exclusively to private individuals. The latter, should the sum exceed a certain amount, will have to present their income return. Parties that have complied with all the above requirements and entered the political arena will be entitled to state support. At the same time the Legislative Initiatives Commission under the Russian Federation president has advised SEGODNYA's correspondent that the draft law on political parties does not exist yet and that all discussions about the supposed rights and obligations of political associations are being centered around its concept. At the end of January the commission held public hearings attended by representatives of 23 political parties. Various opinions were expressed while matters of registration and financing evoked particular interest. Work on the draft law, commission officials promised, will be continued, taking into account the wishes of participants in the hearings.
