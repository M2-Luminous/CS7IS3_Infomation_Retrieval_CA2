According to the admiral, all ships took their assigned positions and started fulfilling their duties. The poaching-control operation is being conducted on the Barents, Baltic, Black, Azov and Caspian seas, Lake Chudskoye, the Amur and Ussuri rivers. It involves, along with border forces, ships of the Russian Navy, Aviation, the Customs Service and other state structures. In the opinion of Skalinov, experience accumulated during the first stage of a previous poaching-control operation which was carried out in the Pacific, enabled military authorities to deploy forces in a short period of time and establish cooperation between them. The admiral said that the second stage of the poaching-control operation in the Pacific was launched successfully on Monday. Vice-Admiral Nikolay Kudinov, commander of naval forces of Russian border troops, is in charge of this operation. "The main task of these large-scale operations is to prevent the pillage of Russia's national wealth, along with strict observance of international norms and rules," the admiral concluded.
