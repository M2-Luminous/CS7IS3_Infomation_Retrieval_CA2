General Petr Deinekin told Interfax on Wednesday that Russian military experts had predicted that air attacks in Bosnia would produce no positive results, the warring sides there not being properly separated. He cited data according to which the U.S. aircraft, F-16's in the first raid and F/A-18's in the second, had used 300-kg bombs with laser homing heads, able to hit human targets at a distance of up to 30 meters. Citing information obtained by the Russian Air Force high command, Deinekin said that on April 10 the American planes were planning to raid armored units, but, seeing none, bombed an artillery command post instead. He said the second strike, made on April 11, was a failure since only one of the three dropped bombs exploded. Commenting on the Bosnian Serb command's statement that NATO aircraft making new raids would be downed, the general said the Serb forces positioned in the Gorazde area had no air defenses or fighter planes. He said the Americans had used an AWACS control system during the raids.
