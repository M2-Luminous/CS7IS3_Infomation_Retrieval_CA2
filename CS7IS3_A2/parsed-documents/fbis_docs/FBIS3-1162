Since the unbanning of the ANC [African National Congress] the revolutionaries' plan to break the power of the police has succeeded, assisted to a considerable degree by the De Klerk government. The replacement of former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok by Mr. Hernus Kriel is only one of the demands of the ANC-SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance that have been met, and one could mention several more examples of a planned strategy to undermine the effectiveness and morale of the police. These developments only serve to strengthen the impression that Mr. F. W. de Klerk's government has betrayed the police. In September 1990, Police Commissioner General Johan van der Merwe stated that it is important for a government to be able to depend on the absolute loyalty of each member of the police force. Loyalty is only possible if the members of the force trust the government, he added. He must surely remember those words now that his generals are being placed under the microscope by Goldstone. Justice Goldstone's report this weekend contains allegations which have not been tested in a court of law. The judge seems to be making a habit of releasing reports critical of the country's security forces. His report two years ago about particular South African Defense Force actions was first presented to the ANC before he took it to the government. Despite Justice Goldstone's public image as a liberal, he was chosen by the government to carry out a number of investigations into the security forces. His findings on the Seboking shootings in 1991 dealt largely with greater control over the South African Police. As a result of the report nine policemen were charged with murder. At present more than 300 policemen are in prison for carrying out their duties. Some are in Death Row. Hundreds of policemen are murdered every year. In 1991 the SAP introduced voluntary psychological support for stressed and traumatized policemen. Between 1991 and 1993, 132 policemen committed suicide, and the incidence of dismissals due to depression and tension has increased by 300 percent. In 1991 a law was passed by Parliament barring policemen from membership of any political party. This measure was apparently aimed at policemen with right- wing sympathies. Yet a mere two years later, the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union, Popcru, was openly allowed to take part in the marches organized by the ANC-SACP alliance. AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL stated in 1992 that a purging of generals in the defense and police forces who were unsympathetic toward the new South Africa was imminent. In June of 1993 the ANC warned the SAP that a new government would get rid of any policeman with, quote, blood on his hands. Last month, at the obvious insistence of the ANC, SAP headquarters was asked for a list of all policemen who had fired their weapons at least twice in the course of duty. Despite the loss of more than 14,000 policemen in the past two years, more policemen announced their intention to resign after this incident. Many of them told the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] that they could no longer serve a National Party government, in spite of the increased salaries they are being offered in the election campaign. The SAP is in tatters and reeling. While APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army -- military wing of the Pan-Africanist Congress] and MK [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] are causing havoc, the police are subjected to strict codes of conduct, overseas watchdogs, civilian monitoring councils, prosecution, prison sentences, and called to account at the World Trade Center and, worst of all, betrayed by their own. Thousands of members of the police force worry about their future. They know inwardly that they cannot support communism in whatever guise. They belong among their own people where they can defend their heritage. They are welcome in the republic of the Boer Afrikaners.
