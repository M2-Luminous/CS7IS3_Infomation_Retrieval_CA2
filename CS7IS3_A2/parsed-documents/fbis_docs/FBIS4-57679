Handal said that despite differing ideas within the FMLN, this violent act was not carried out by FMLN members. He, however, did not rule out that it was politically motivated: [Begin Handal recording] I rule that out totally and absolutely. It was a dirty maneuver to cover up impunity, to keep impunity alive. I rule that out completely. My arguments are: one, we know each other in the FMLN. We know that an action of this sort is morally impossible. Second, this is a repeat of a similar operation. Thus, since then it has been clear that this is a typical case of a politically motivated action. This is among the cases that the Joint Group is handling. I reject that totally and absolutely. I even reject that this could happen among us at any time. [end recording] Handal added that this morning's action, which left a member of Nidia Diaz' security team injured, is part of the political situation facing the country at present: [Begin Handal recording] Second, I must stress that companera Nidia Diaz, as a deputy, is currently chairing the Legislative Assembly Justice and Human Rights Committee. At this time the Legislative Assembly is concluding debate on the elimination of secret presidency expenses and is about to start debating the problem of exemptions granted to deputies in order to start cleaning up their (?image). This is something that focuses our attention. Another thing that focuses attention is that this act was perpetrated at a time when there is an ongoing debate within the FMLN. There is a debate within the FMLN. These are, I think, the first things that must be taken into account. I have little doubt, although one must always leave room for doubt, that this is politically motivated. In fact, speaking about the other crimes committed since the latter part of 1993, since the latter half of 1993.... [pauses] that is, if we link this to the kind of campaign carried out by the right wing during the electoral campaign, I would conclude that all this was related.... [pauses] that there was a message in all that. The message is: Look, we can still kill! We have the means to do so; we can do so, and impunity still reigns in this country. [end recording] The politician pointed out that no current investigation into politically motivated crimes has yet produced positive results. Handal added that as long as perpetrators are protected, the country will not be able to overcome impunity.
