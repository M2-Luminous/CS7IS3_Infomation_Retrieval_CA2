Toward this end, the government has sent or will send presidential envoys to Africa, the Middle East, and Central and South America. The government has sent No Yong-chan, Foreign Ministry ambassador-at-large, to a UN African Economic Committee meeting scheduled from 2 to 5 May. In the capacity of a ROK presidential envoy, he will deliver a keynote speech and call on participants to support the ROK's bid to become a nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council. Ambassador No will later visit Nigeria and Zaire, major players in Africa. The government will also send a presidential envoy to a UN Asian Economic and Social Committee meeting that will open on 27 May in Jordan. He will carry out activities to gain support for ROK's bid for a UN Security Council seat from Middle East countries. The government will also send Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong and First Assistant Foreign Minister Choe Tong-chin to Central and South America to visit five to six countries to attract votes. A government official concerned said: "A country should get two- thirds of votes at the UN General Assembly to become a nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council." He added: "We must try to win votes from countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Central and South America, where there are many UN members." In the meantime, the government officially notified the UN Secretariat last February that it would run for a UN Security Council seat for the 1996-97 period.
