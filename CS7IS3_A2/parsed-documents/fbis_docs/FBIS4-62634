The statement says that eleven employees of the immigration service in the port have been charged with "neglecting their duties". The ship arrived in the port two weeks ago, and 81 persons suspected of being mercenaries disembarked, the statement says. They landed and disappeared before the immigration service employees had time to understand what was happening. It was not immediately known from what country they arrived and what was Zolotitsa's last port of call before Monrovia. Asked by ITAR-TASS to comment on the incident, a Liberian Embassy official in Cote d'Ivoire replied that "he does not have any details of the case". The other day the leader of one of the military-political groupings of Liberia's United Liberation Movement for Democracy Roosevelt Johnson accused the leader of another faction of the same grouping, Alhaji Kromah and his supporters from the Mandingo tribe of using the services of foreign mercenaries in fighting the ethnic group of Kran. Kromah rejected the allegations as "groundless, slanderous and aimed at provoking unrest".
