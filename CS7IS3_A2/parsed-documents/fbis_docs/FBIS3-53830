Shahaq asserted that the disagreements between the parties centered on security arrangements at the crossings. Our correspondent Netan'el Semrik reports from Taba: [Begin recording] [Semrik] Major General Amnon Shahaq, in his first public announcement this week, made it clear that the issue of the border crossings remained stuck. This, after an initial round of talks at Taba, the subsequent understandings reached at Oslo, Paris, and Cairo, and even after two days of negotiations at Taba this week. [Shahaq] As for the security issues, we are still stuck on the issue of the border crossings. We are currently still trying to find ways to achieve maximum understanding and agreement; however, there are several matters of principle on which we disagree with the Palestinian delegation. We regard these issues as crucial to maintain the level of security we desire. There are several issues pertaining to the border crossings themselves which are tied to security arrangements. The disagreements between the two parties focus on these issues. [Semrik] Do you think that the intervention of the prime minister and Yasir 'Arafat will be necessary on these issues? [Shahaq] In my opinion, both parties are familiar with each other's position on the issue of the border crossings. We know what the Palestinians want and they know what we want. We have to find a way to agree or else there can be no accord. [end recording] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 19 January adds that "Major General Shahaq told our correspondent Moti Amir that the document detailing the points of agreement and disagreement between the two parties will be passed up to higher echelons. In the committee on civilian affairs, agreement was reached on transferring 25 out of the 35 Civil Administration offices to Palestinian control."]
