During the attempted suppression of the "Chechen revolution" by force on the part of Moscow, he was acting defense minister. In December 1992, he switched to opposition to President Dzhokhar Dudayev. Like many leaders of the Chechen opposition, he currently lives outside the republic. [Vasilyeva] Could you assess the stability of President Dudayev's positions? [Soslambekov] Neither the opposition nor Dudayev controls the situation throughout the republic. But the situation is similar in all the new CIS states, and this argument could not, most likely, serve as a criterion of a leader's stability. I would assess Dudayev's position in Chechnya as being very stable. Support for the opposition on the part of society is greatly exaggerated: Umar Avturkhanov, for example, a leader of the opposition, does not have unconditional support even in Nadterechnyy Rayon, where he is mayor. Support for Avturkhanov by other rayons in opposition to President Dudayev--Urus-Martanovskiy, Gudermeskiy, Sherinskiy, the rural Groznenskiy (although it is a long time since this rayon existed), and Vedenskiy--is altogether out of the question. I am sure that the idea of the formation of a provisional committee of opposition rayons was "tossed" to Avturkhanov: Russian politicians need some trump card for pressure on Dudayev. This idea will enable Russian leaders to negotiate with an actual opposition, but the legitimacy of the provisional committee is greatly in doubt. Political methods of struggle against the Dudayev regime are today exhausted, nor is there a force capable of removing it from power and restoring the constitutional system in Chechnya. Those who believe that the Chechnya issue may be settled by force within 24 hours are mistaken. With the modern types of arms, a conflict cannot be settled by numerical superiority. Practically all conflicts that we are observing currently in Bosnia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ossetia, Iraq, or Somalia are insoluble. There will be no military victory at the current stage. [Vasilyeva] Let us, nonetheless, imagine a situation where Russia has decided to plant a governor general in Groznyy--Zavgayev or Khasbulatov, for example. What would happen? [Soslambekov] As far as Khasbulatov is concerned, Russian politicians would hardly be longing to see him even in Chechnya: Khasbulatov is a delayed-action mine for Russia. In terms of scale, Chechnya is one administrative district of Moscow. But Chechnya in Khasbulatov's hands would signify the destruction of modern Russia: Khasbulatov could quickly establish interaction with the leaders of the North Caucasus republics, with the Cossacks. And this is the south of Russia, which has historically opposed the center. As far as Zavgayev is concerned, his imposition by force on Moscow's part would not signify peace in Chechnya: It is sufficient to recall how he was removed in the fall of 1991. He or Avturkhanov would be supported only by Nadterechnyy Rayon. Besides, the Russian leadership has no interest in the removal of Dudayev. [Vasilyeva] Why? [Soslambekov] There is no one with whom to replace him: it is impossible to find a person capable of controlling the situation in Chechnya and at the same time to abide by the policy of present-day Russia.
