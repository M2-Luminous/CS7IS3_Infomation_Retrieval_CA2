There is a simple reason for Sumitomo's particular interest in further development of the Spanish technique. Since the Japanese railways were split up and privatized in 1987, competition between the railroad companies has increased a great deal. The declared goal of numerous railroad enterprises is to attract more passengers with a higher level of comfort. Since with the traditionally overfilled Japanese trains it will hardly be possible to improve the comfort of the cars themselves, the railroad companies are primarily intent on eliminating the need for many transfers. In numerous cases, however, this is only possible if at certain points the trains can change their track gauge rapidly. The Spanish Talgo system originated out of the necessity of changing tracks for foreign trains when transferring to the broader Spanish gauge. In order to do so, the train runs at slow speed over a 15-meter-long gauge conversion track. In addition to the normal rails, additional rails have here been mounted on both sides. The railroad car also has so-called yoke elements mounted on the wheels, also on both sides. The yoke elements are lowered at the rail section parallel with the actual track. In so doing they lift the train slightly. This leaves the wheels free for a brief moment. At this moment the guide rails press the wheels into the new position--that is to say either onto the narrower or, in the opposite direction, onto the broader track. Sumitomo and Talgo now want jointly to improve this technique and, according to their own information, initially aim particularly for the Japanese market, where in this respect demand is extremely intense. In Japan a truck with four wheels dominates, while in Spain there are two-wheel elements. Further, in Japan on countless trains the wheels of the trucks of individual cars are directly driven, while in Spain the trains are almost exclusively pulled or pushed by separate locomotives. Consequently, trucks and driving wheels must now be developed--based on the Talgo system described--which can be similarly automatically adapted. The prototypes of powered, convertible trucks are to be ready for testing during the course of 1995.
