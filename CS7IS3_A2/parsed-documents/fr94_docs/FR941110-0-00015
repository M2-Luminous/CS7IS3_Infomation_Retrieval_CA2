FR941110-0-00015 FR941110-0-00007 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;44; Amendment 39&hyph;9006; AD 94&hyph;01&hyph;03 R1] Airworthiness Directives; Teledyne Continental Motors (Formerly Bendix) S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200 Series Magnetos AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This document makes a correction to Airworthiness Directive (AD) 94&hyph;17&hyph;11 applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) (formerly Bendix) S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200 series magnetos that was published in the Federal Register on August 22, 1994 (59 FR 43029). The AD number is incorrect. This document corrects the error in the AD number. In all other respects, the original document remains the same. DATES: Effective November 10, 1994. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A final rule airworthiness directive (AD) applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) (formerly Bendix) S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200 series magnetos, was published in the Federal Register on August 22, 1994 (59 FR 43029). The AD was inadvertently assigned a new number, 94&hyph;17&hyph;11. Since the AD is a revision to a current AD, it should retain the original AD number, 94&hyph;01&hyph;03, with the suffix R1. The following correction is needed: On page 43029, in the center column, in the header, in the second line, ``AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;11'' should read ``AD 94&hyph;01&hyph;03 R1.'' On page 43030, in the right column, in the title of the compliance section, in the first line, ``94&hyph;17&hyph;11'' should read ``94&hyph;01&hyph;03 R1.'' Issued in Burlington, MA, on November 3, 1994. Jay J. Pardee, Manager, Engine and Propeller Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
