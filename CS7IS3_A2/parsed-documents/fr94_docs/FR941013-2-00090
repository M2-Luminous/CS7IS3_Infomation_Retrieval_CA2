FR941013-2-00090 FR941013-2-00069 Factor two applies because Mr. Ehule's experience in dispensing controlled substances was dismal. Based upon the practitioner interviews, it was established that there were 117 unauthorized controlled substance prescriptions filled between August 1990 and September 1992. Mr. Ehule's pattern of dispensing without making any bona fide attempts to verify prescriptions was confirmed when an undercover person presented Mr. Ehule with a controlled substance prescription that had entirely fictitious information on it. The unauthorized dispensing was not limited to one specific problem but included diverse violations such as dispensing unauthorized refills, increasing the dosage units authorized, increasing the strength of the controlled substance from what was authorized and even dispensing different types of controlled substances in addition to what was authorized. One prescription for a Schedule III controlled substance had an annotation that it had been refilled eleven times and four of those refills were for 100 dosage units more than authorized by the original prescription. Factor four is applicable based upon the numerous violations of controlled substance regulations by Mr. Ehule while operating the All In One Stop Pharmacy between August 1990 and September 1992. He filled 163 controlled substance prescriptions which did not include the date, patient information and practitioner information (including prescriptions which did not even have a DEA number on them) in violation of 21 CFR 1306.05(a). Eighty-five initial prescriptions either did not have the initials of the dispensing pharmacist or failed to denote a date when the controlled substances were dispensed in violation of 21 CFR 1304.24(d). Six refill prescriptions did not have the date of refill and 137 refills did not have the initials of the dispensing pharmacist in violation of 21 CFR 1306.22(a). Seventy-eight Schedule III and IV controlled substance prescriptions were interspersed with non-controlled substance prescriptions and did not contain the letter ``C'' in the right hand corner. Thus these prescriptions were not readily retrievable as required under 21 U.S.C. 827(b) and 21 CFR 1304.04(h)(2). Four controlled substance prescriptions were refilled more than five times within a six month period in violation of 21 CFR 1306.22(a). In one case, the prescription was refilled eleven times. The audit revealed over 7,500 shortages of various Schedule III and IV controlled substances. Under these circumstances, there is no question that had Mr. Ehule simply applied for a transfer of the DEA Certificate of Registration from All In One Stop Pharmacy to Respondent (The Medicine Shoppe) such transfer would have been denied and All In One Stop Pharmacy's registration revoked. The issue to be addressed, then, is the effect of the transfer of Real Vitality, Inc., d/b/a Respondent to Mrs. Ehule. Given the circumstances of this transfer, the Deputy Administrator concludes that the transfer does not protect the public interest and thus, the application must be denied.
