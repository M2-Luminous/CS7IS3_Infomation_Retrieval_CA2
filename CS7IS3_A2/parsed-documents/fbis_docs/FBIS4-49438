Ye has composed a magnificent song of youth with her blood, sweat, and tears, and has set a brilliant example of patriotism to a generation of youth. A feeble girl, who made light of her major injury and refused to be outdone by her strong rivals, made amazing achievements in the world-level competition. Where did her strength come from? Ye answered: "What I have done is done for my beloved motherland." What a noble heart she has! She consciously regarded rendering service to her motherland as her highest ambition, and was ready to exchange her youth for her motherland's honor and her nation's dignity. It was her passionate patriotism that constituted the abundant source of her heroism. Patriotism has always been a spiritual prop for a strong and prosperous country and a rising nation. The implications of patriotism vary from nation to nation. For the younger generation of the Chinese nation, loving their country has the particular meaning of loving socialism. Historical experience and the reality of reform and opening up to the outside world have told us that socialism cannot only save, but also develop China. Ye has been to a dozen countries and regions, and has witnessed Western societies of every description. While abroad, she did not improperly belittle herself, worship and have blind faith in everything foreign, and still less shake her conviction. Instead, she bore in mind "I am my motherland's loyal daughter," took pride in it, and displayed a national integrity that was neither arrogant nor obsequious, and "made one above the power of poverty and mean conditions to cause a deviation from principle, one who could not be subdued by force." Loving one's country means linking one's career and future with one's motherland, and changing fervent patriotism into the real action of dedicating oneself to the service of one's country. Ye dedicated herself to the service of her country by applying herself to sports -- her career -- and by trying hard to win a "gold medal" for her country. She has worked hard and dauntlessly on speed skating -- her difficult and glorious career -- for 20 years, and has made great achievements time and again in scaling new heights in speed skating. People work at different posts, but they can have the same wish to render service to their motherland despite the fact that they will carry out the wish on different occasions and in different ways. To carry out the wish, one must base oneself on one's work post and start with little things so as to make outstanding achievements at one's ordinary work post. Loving one's country means rendering great service to reform and the opening up. Ye always cherished a high aspiration for winning honor for her motherland and set the highest target for herself. After winning honor for her motherland on many occasions and becoming a glorious sportswoman in the sports field, many people told her to resolutely retire at the height of her career, but Ye declined their advice. She felt she had not realized her ambition and wanted to convert her dream of obtaining a gold medal for her motherland into reality -- a dream, in fact, of turning China into a prosperous country. How striking a contrast she brought out between herself and those who pride themselves on their merits or are content with small achievements! Being patriotic means combating decadent ideas, such as individualism and money worship. To render service to repay her motherland's kindness, Ye bore hardships unbearable for ordinary people and buried the happiness ordinary people deserve. She regarded her motherland's honor as a weight like unto Mount Tai, and her own interests weighing as lightly as a goose feather. Such a noble virtue, which "enables a patriot to dash ahead regardless of his own safety," is all the more precious in the current period when a new system is replacing the old. "One must not forget one's duty to take care of the country's interests, no matter how insignificant one may be." Youth represent the future of the country and are to bring the country's major plans to fruition. Ye's heroism has shown the broad masses of young people a correct and glorious way for them to render loyal service to the motherland. This is the great trust history has placed in them and also what the current reform era expects of them. Like Ye, we should keep the motherland's interests at heart, carry forward the revolutionary cause pioneered by our predecessors, forge ahead into the future, and participate in the country's great reform and development plans with enormous enthusiasm and creativity. We should work hard to make progress and achievements at our own posts. We should inject our precious youth into the motherland's great cause of reform and development to put on a first-rate work performance!
