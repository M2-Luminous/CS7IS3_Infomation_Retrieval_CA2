The government plans to embark on making preparations for the construction project, starting off with sending a preliminary mission to the SRV on 20 March. It also plans to extend yen loans to help fund the construction of the Hanoi industrial zone, which is scheduled to begin as early as in 1996. Investments in the SRV by foreign private firms have concentrated in the southern part of the country, primarily around Ho Chi Minh City. This has further widened the economic gap between the thriving southern regions and the underdeveloped northern regions -- a factor which has begun to cause instability in the country. The government mission, consisting mainly of members of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), plans to work with the Hanoi People's Committee to finalize details on such points as the following: 1) the current situation in the Hanoi area and future outlook; 2) selecting prospective industries; 3) investment demands; 4) determining the location of the industrial zone; and 5) the schedule for construction of the industrial zone. The government mission plans to begin actual investigations in June. It hopes to draw up a basic outline of the project by January 1996 and present it to the SRV. The SRV Government has sounded out the Japanese Government for its support in funding the construction of the industrial zone. The Japanese Government plans to respond favorably to this request. Construction costs are expected to total around $100 million. In terms of total cost, the project, including construction of ancillary facilities, is expected to be of the greatest scale for a single project among projects for which Japan has decided to apply its yen loan program for the SRV. Japan resumed this program in 1992 after suspending it for about 14 years. There has traditionally been an economic imbalance between the northern and southern regions of the SRV. The per capita annual national income in Ho Chi Minh City is $350, while it is only $250 in Hanoi. A worker in Ho Chi Minh City earns an average monthly salary of $38.80, while a worker in Hanoi makes only $22.40, or only about two-thirds of his counterpart in the south. Moreover, ever since the country enacted its Foreign Investment Act in 1988, over 70 percent of foreign investment in the SRV has concentrated in its southern regions, primarily around Ho Chi Minh City. If left unattended, the situation could turn out to be like as it was before the country's unification in 1975 when "the south prospered and the north remained poor." In early February 1994, the United States decided to lift economic sanctions it had imposed against the SRV. As a result, there are now hardly any barriers against direct foreign investment. Although the SRV is expected to make rapid growth among the East Asian countries, along with the PRC, its leaders are faced with the problem of an economic imbalance between its northern and southern regions. The Japanese Government considers that "the promotion of development in the northern regions is urgent for a well-balanced economic growth," (as stated by a Foreign Ministry source). Therefore, in carrying out its economic aid program for the SRV, the government has decided to hammer out a plan to place priority on the development of the country's northern regions, primarily around Hanoi.
