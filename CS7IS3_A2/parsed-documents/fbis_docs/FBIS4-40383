These figures were disclosed at a Wednesday news conference in Moscow by the Deputy Minister of Nuclear Energy Lev Ryabev. According to the official, nuclear power engineering is going to expand as the production of oil and coal is going to decline; experts predict that only gas extraction is going to grow: from 620 billion cubic meters now to 780 billion in 2010. Between 2001 and 2009 Russia will shut down all nuclear power plants of the first generation. All of them were designed before 1973 and do not meet modern safety norms. Such generators are located at the Leningrad, Kursk, Novovoronezh and Kola stations. Ryabev said that power units of the third generation are now being developed and are equipped with safety systems which do not rely on human actions. The first power station of the third generation should be built in 2000 or 2002. The ministry is also working on reactors of the fourth generation which according to Ryabev will be based on principles of "natural safety." These plants would be designed so that no escape of radiation is possible under any condition, the minister said. Russia is determined to develop a closed production circuit in nuclear power engineering: Usable uranium will be extracted from used fuel and most of the highly active wastes burned in fast reactors. Ryabev stressed that Russia has enough nuclear fuel to last till the year 2020 and the uranium ore extracted in the Chita Region is being exported. He said the ministry is open to the question of changing forms of ownership. "So far nuclear facilities are government property, but we are not ruling out the possibility that they can be turned into joint-stock companies or sold to private owners," Ryabev said.
