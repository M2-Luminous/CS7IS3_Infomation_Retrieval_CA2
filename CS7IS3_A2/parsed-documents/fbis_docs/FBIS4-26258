More than 180,000 people live by the lake. The few tourists are found walking on the dried-up lake bed and tourism boats are laid up. Hotels, restaurants and holiday villages are closed. The present time would normally be the high season for local tourism. But the 390-sq-km lake, which used to be famous for its aquatic products, is now nearly bare of visitors. Zhu Weijue, a deputy chief engineer with the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, said that the present drought, starting in 1991, has been the worst in 50 years. Water from rivers feeding the lake has been diverted for agricultural and industrial use. The Hebei provincial government is making efforts to help local people fight the drought and try to reduce the damage to the minimum. The lake was dry for five years from 1983 to 1987, its longest dry period. In 1988, the lake was again filled with water. Zhu said weather forecast shows that it will be a dry year for the central and southern parts of northern China, including Baiyangdian lake. Rainfall will be far from enough to refill the lake in the near future, he noted.
