SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Sections 104(i)(7) and (9) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended [42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(7) and (9)], provide the Administrator of ATSDR with the authority to conduct pilot studies, epidemiologic and other health studies, and to initiate health surveillance programs to determine the relationship between human exposure to hazardous substances in the environment and adverse health outcomes. On February 13, 1990, ATSDR published in the Federal Register [55 FR 5136] a final rule entitled, ``Health Assessments and Health Effects Studies of Hazardous Substances Releases and Facilities.'' The primary purpose of that rule, which created a new regulation at 42 CFR Part 90, was to set forth general procedures that ATSDR will follow relating to certain agency activities, including the conduct of health effects studies. Section 90.11 of the regulation, which concerns the reporting of results of health assessments and health effects studies, provides that reports of health effects studies conducted under section 104(i) of the CERCLA shall be available to the general public upon request. Availability The reports of the health effects studies listed below are now available through the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22151, telephone: 1&hyph;800&hyph;553&hyph;6847.
