FBIS4-1298 "drafr080_c_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA ANC's Mbeki Blames Police for Terror Escalation ANC's Mbeki Blames Police for Terror Escalation LD2604095794 London ITV Television Network in English 1900 GMT 25 Apr 94 LD2604095794 London ITV Television Network English BFN [Interview with ANC National Chairman Thabo Mbeki by announcer Jon Snow in Johannesburg on 25 April -- recorded] [Text] [Snow] I've been speaking to the chairman of the ANC, Thabo Mbeki, and I asked him if he thought he was being told the whole truth about what was happening and whether he was confident that the bombings could be stopped? [Mbeki] The problem, Jon, is either the incapacity or the unwillingness of the police to deal with this problem. Fortunately what is happening now is that a fair amount of information is beginning to accumulate as to who is involved. That's more than 50 percent of the battle -- to discover who actually is involved in a sense of planning the activities of this third force leading it, controlling it, and I'm saying that a fair amount of information is getting accumulated, much of which the police might indeed have had, but have been either unwilling or for some reason or other incapable of acting against them, a new government.... [Snow, interrupting] Is the unwillingness though because the police are too close to these people? [Mbeki] Because many of them come from within the police force. They come from within the police force and I think that many of the police are unwilling to act against their colleagues. [Snow] So how can you change that? You can't do it overnight. [Mbeki] It'll change, it'll change because the rot does not affect the entirety of the police force. But the way the police have been structured up to now is in a sense like a military organization, where junior officers get afraid to act until a more senior officer acts, and aware the senior officer is a person involved in third force activities then the organization gets paralyzed. No it's not as though the whole police force was in that sort of position, I think there will be many police, policemen and women who will be quite ready to act against this third force even out of a sense of restoring the professional integrity of the service. [Snow] Is a large measure of what's happening basically a very frustrated extreme, rightwing white community that want's to set up a volkstaat, and is there any prospect of them ever being able to do so? [Mbeki] I don't think it's the people who want to establish a volkstaat, I think it's the people who don't accept that there should be change. People who cannot accept that you can have a democratic government which because of the demography of this country will be in the majority black. They don't want that. They don't want any alteration of this system, and therefore say that we make sure that we shoot and kill so hard that such alteration will not occur. [Snow] But then that suggests that if these people aren't prepared even before the election to accept the principle of a black majority government after the election, you may be forced to issue banning orders and then start arresting these people. [Mbeki] No. You see we have to get to the leadership, the organizers, the planners of this kind of violent activity that we are seeing now in the run-up to the elections. I don't think it's a matter of banning organizations. [Snow] You see I interviewed Mr. Terreblanche [Afrikaner Resistance Movement leader] over the weekend and he said: Well, I don't encourage it, but this is going to happen, and I can understand why it's going to happen, and there will be more and more of it. That's exactly what he said. Now this is almost tantamount to encouraging it, therefore will you not be forced to move against people like Mr. Terreblanche? [Mbeki] Sure, Terreblanche is encouraging it, but what I'm saying, Jon, is that what's critically important is not so much Terreblanche, it's the people who are actually planning, organizing, accumulating weapons, accumulating explosives, distributing them, training people, ordering people to go and place a bomb here or there, ordering somebody to go and assassinate and so on, we need to get to those people.
