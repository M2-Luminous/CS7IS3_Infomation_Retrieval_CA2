The circular stated: Following the nationwide implementation of new work hours, it will be appropriate for various schools at the secondary and above levels to first implement, on a trial basis, a system of five-and-a-half-day work weeks, in light of their special work conditions and teaching rules, provided there are no particular problems in doing so. Schools in the same district should try their best to implement a unified work-hour system. Provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, or authorized prefectures and cities should make unified plans. Schools should appropriately modify the contents of their courses and curricula in accordance with the guidelines of the new work-hour system. The circular urged educational administrative departments at all levels to make all kinds of preparations in earnest in accordance with the demands of the new work-hour system so as to ensure normal working and teaching order in schools after the new work-hour system is implemented.
