The Palestinian people under the PLO have the right to walk with sure steps. This is because they have faith in their invincible, strong, and unconquerable will. They are sure of their steps toward a free independent Palestinian state. The Palestinian people's self-confidence is drawn from, among other things, their national unity and great intifadah, which gives the Palestinian national consciousness an idea about its future prospects, and qualifies it to proceed with efforts to build the future. At present, the Palestinian people are about to take firm and decisive steps toward independence. The Palestinian people under the PLO have made preparations for all eventualities. They are ready to thwart all obstacles that could stand in their way, preventing them from achieving their sublime objectives. This requires, among other things, enhanced national unity and further vigilance against any malicious instigation promoting discord, a pestilence that has failed in its attempts to plague the Palestinian national consciousness and the Palestinian national unity since the inception of our liberation march. O masses of our lofty people, let self-confidence and the giant national will be among the slogans of this phase while we proceed firmly toward the extrication of our legitimate national rights to achieve total independence. While looking forward to the future, which we are bound to extricate, let us repeat with our leader Abu-'Ammar the following verse: Those with sure steps are unshakable. Yes, our people are walking the path leading to the state of Palestinian right and truth, unified and united. Their steps are unfaltering.
