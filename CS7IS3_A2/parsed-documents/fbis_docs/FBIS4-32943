Juan Fleites, director of Cupet, which is negotiating a joint venture for the plant with its Mexican counterpart, Mex-Petrol, told NOTIMEX the following: "Should we reach an agreement on the refinery, we could start receiving Mexican crude oil." Since March, Cupet and Mex-Petrol have been studying alternatives to extending and modernizing the Cienfuegos refinery, the country's largest refinery, located on the south-central coast. Yesterday, Carlos Ferrer Argote, Mexican Foreign Relations Secretariat Caribbean affairs director, said the negotiations could include the supply of crude oil. He added: "Both parties are working to yield results in the best of interests. We are trying to conclude as soon as possible, but it is difficult to conduct studies." The lack of oil and the shortage of spare parts for its Soviet-made infrastructure are keeping the refinery, which can refine 3 million tons annually, almost halted. Cuba is also negotiating with Colombia the supply of oil to offset the fuel deficit that emerged from the drop of purchases from the defunct Soviet Union. The purchases dropped from 13 million tons to less than half that amount between 1991 and 1992. According to the agreement, Cupet and Mex-Petrol will invest $200 million to start production at the extended and modernized plant, to supply the domestic market, and to export surpluses. Ferrer, who was in Merida, Yucatan State, attending the 19th Caribbean Studies Association Congress, pointed out exports could be sold to countries in the region. He also said the Cuban-Mexican study is analyzing "an ample spectrum of crude oils, from the lightest to the heaviest, to match the quality of supply to the prices of hydrocarbons and their byproducts." Cupet's director confirmed the project has already determined its investment strategy: Each party will invest $100 million, half the total investment. The Mexican contribution will be as follows: 50 percent in resources and 50 percent in joint venture assets, which will be charged to the Cuban debt. The Cuban and Mexican central banks have an agreement that, among other issues, allows the settling of the $310 million Cuban debt through "swap" [previous word in English] operations.
