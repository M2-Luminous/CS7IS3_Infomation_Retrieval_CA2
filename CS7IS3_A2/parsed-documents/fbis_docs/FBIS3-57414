Literally on the eve of this, MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS' correspondent has interviewed Boris Fedorov. [Yurova] Boris Grigoryevich, you have sent a letter with proposals to the president. Has there been a response? [Fedorov] There has been neither written nor oral response. Apparently he has left this fully to Chernomyrdin. [Yurova] You presented the same proposals at a meeting with Chernomyrdin. What, in your opinion, did not suit him about your option? [Fedorov] Zaveryukha and Gerashchenko have proved to be so close to him that he could not agree to their resignation. [Yurova] Who, in your opinion, will now take the post of finance minister and who would you prefer to see in this chair? [Fedorov] They say that the post of minister will be taken by Shcherbakov, Pavlov's former deputy. I do not understand why Pavlov himself could not be appointed in this situation. Generally, it would be more logical to bring back the union government. And also replace Gaydar with Abalkin. As for who I would like to see in this chair, I will never say, because otherwise nothing will ever be offered to this person. [Yurova] Some news media report that you have already visited the U.S. ambassador, allegedly asking him to find you a place in some international organization? [Fedorov] Absolute nonsense! Our country has apparently brought forth the largest number of provocateurs in the world and is still using their services. Meanwhile this fabrication continues to be aired. I am a deputy of the Duma. I will now work there, think, and watch the economic situation and study it. [Yurova] For a long time our parliament has been playing a reactionary role while the government has acted as a counterbalance to it, as it were. Now that a substantial number of reformers are in the Duma, will it be able to play a more progressive role? [Fedorov] The correlation of forces in the Duma is such that reformers are far from being in the lead. I think that one should not expect any great results from the Duma in terms of its influence on economic policy. I hope that it will not try, like the former Supreme Soviet, to supersede the government. The Duma's duty is to stop violations of the law. But in current politics the government should have enough independence or otherwise it will be impossible to call it to account, as was the case in 1993 when the government was constantly blaming the Supreme Soviet: It has been standing in our way and therefore we have failed to do this and that. A very convenient cover. Let the government have all the power, and with it responsibility. [Yurova] Do you think the leaders of various factions in the Duma will be able to collaborate fruitfully on economic matters? [Fedorov] Some concrete decisions will apparently be made without any particular problem. I doubt, however, that all the leaders are well disposed toward collaboration. Clearly, the communists will always have a position different from the others. It will hardly be possible to work out a single ideology on economic policy. [Yurova] What is your prediction for the rate of inflation and the rate of the dollar in the new conditions? [Fedorov] In the next few months nothing is threatening us because all the foundations were laid back in November. According to my estimates, recession will begin in April to May. Inflation will grow to 30 percent a month. Recently Chernomyrdin promised that in the first half of the year inflation will be at 15 to 18 percent. I use this opportunity to bet that these figures will be at least twice as high. Everyone must be responsible for his words. I bet $100. Naturally, the dollar rate will be growing. When the Central Bank exhausts its resources, it will stop dumping hard currency on the market. According to our forecasts, if the proposed policy continues, by January 1995 the dollar will be worth between 10,000 and 12,000 rubles. It will be very easy to make calculations: one dollar -- one 10,000-ruble bill. [Yurova] But perhaps there is some slight chance of prosperity lying in store for our industry: After all, the new government is going to hand out credits to industrialists. [Fedorov] Even my opponents from the Economy Ministry, when they were questioned by the premier whether production would grow if finances are relaxed, responded in the negative. [Yurova] In your conversation with Chernomyrdin, did the premier make any arguments in favor of the new course? [Fedorov] Chernomyrdin is not an economist and it is difficult for him to make any arguments. Apparently he will be fighting with the "sluggish-fluctuating character of inflation." I do not know that this means; nor do I understand the meaning of "nonmonetarist methods of action." For a normal industrial policy it is necessary to have willpower. After all, enterprises will have to be closed, the production structure changed, and people moved across the country. Why has this not been done up till now? I was not responsible for industrial policy. The same people will be in charge of it. Why should anything change then? [Yurova] Policy in this country changes just like the weather, and therefore it is quite likely that in a couple of months it will again confront you. What would you say if you were again -- for the third time -- invited into the government? [Fedorov] I am always ready. This country is ours and it must be helped. The main result of 1993 for me is that whereas in the past we knew the economy better in theory, now we have seen it in practice. The market economy has been built in the country. And it must be regulated by market relations. But it is not clear how the old Soviet levers can be applied to it again. Now let the "red" economic managers try to regulate it with their "nonmonetarist methods." Then we shall see how it will work out. I am not sneering. Quite the contrary, I am upset that our country again has to face the consequences of other people's mistakes. P.S. Boris Fedorov's press secretary has clarified for MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS that the offer to occupy the post of finance minister has been made on the same terms. Fedorov still sticks to his guns. The question has been left open and most likely it will be decided in the president's office.
