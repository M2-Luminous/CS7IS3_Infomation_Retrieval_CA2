FR940802-0-00017 FR940802-0-00008 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 80 [AMS&hyph;FRL&hyph;5017&hyph;1] Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Renewable Oxygenate Requirement for Reformulated Gasoline AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA's regulations for reformulated gasoline (RFG) based on the Clean Air Act, as amended, requires that gasoline sold in certain areas be reformulated to achieve the greatest possible reductions in vehicle emissions of toxic and ozone-forming compounds. Among other things, EPA's regulations establish standards requiring a specified oxygen content in reformulated gasoline. This rule promulgates additional regulations which require that 30 percent of the oxygen required by the Clean Air Act to be used in reformulated gasoline be derived from renewable feedstocks. This renewable oxygenate requirement will assure that implementation of the RFG program is consistent with the longstanding federal policy of promoting renewable fuels. The renewable oxygenate requirement is expected to have a positive energy impact by reducing the amount of fossil energy needed to meet the requirements of the reformulated gasoline program. In addition, this program is expected to stimulate the development of new technologies which would lead to reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and further reductions in fossil energy consumption. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective on September 1, 1994, except §§80.83 (g) and (h) are not effective until OMB has approved the Information Collection Requirements contained in them. EPA will publish a document in the Federal Register following OMB approval of the information collection requirements. ADDRESSES: Materials relevant to this final rule (FRM) are contained in Public Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;49, located at Room M&hyph;1500, Waterside Mall (ground floor), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.
