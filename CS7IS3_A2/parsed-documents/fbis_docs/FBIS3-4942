He said it is very difficult for the British press to report the truth. He said Malaysia is not asking British Premier John Major to apologize or anyone else to do anything to solve the existing relations between the two countries. However, the prime minister said this is the time for the British press to do the right thing. He was replying to questions posed by newsmen after attending the breaking of fast with the orphaned and handicapped children in Kuala Lumpur. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said that the decision made in the cabinet meeting last Friday has nothing to do with the British Government, people, and its businessmen. When asked about Major's statement that Malaysia is shortsighted and unjustified in banning British firms from new government contracts, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said he will find out whether Major's statement was true or just misreported by the British press.
