Very early in the morning, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, came to Qihe County, with which he had established ties, to visit local cadres and people. He also visited villages and households to learn about peasants' production and life and to hear their voice, opinions, and suggestions. Secretary Jiang first went to the (Maozhuang) Village of (Shouzhong) Township. The economy of the village was rather backward and people's life rather difficult due to its saline-alkali soil and the influence of the Huang He water diversion project. Secretary Jiang visited the home of an old woman (Ma Chuanwei) at a little pass nine in the morning. With deep concern, he asked about the old woman's health and asked her whether she had difficulties. The old woman said: You, provincial leaders, have come to see us despite your tight schedule. I am so moved that I do now know what to say. The income of my family declined this year because of the cold weather. However, we still earned more than 1,000 yuan and have more than 2,500 jin of grain. Our life is not so bad. Please do not worry about us. Secretary Jiang said with a deep feeling: We will work out ways to address whatever difficulties you have so that you can achieve affluence as soon as possible. At the home of (Zhu Zhaoshi), who had difficulty in life, (Zhu's) wife told Secretary Jiang: We have wheat and cabbage. Although we have little money at our disposal, our life is not too bad. We have no problem in spending the Spring Festival. After visiting (Maozhuang) Village, Secretary Jiang again came to (Dayang) Village. This village became prosperous thanks to greenhouse cultivation of vegetables in the past few years. The secretary of the village party branch said to Secretary Jiang happily: Our village, which has a population of more than 1,000, has built more than 83 greenhouses to grow 200 mu of (?fine vegetables) and 320 mu of (?ordinary) vegetables. Our per capita net income was 1,630 yuan in 1993. Hearing this, Secretary Jiang smiled and said: Let's go to your greenhouse. At the vegetable greenhouse, Secretary was very happy to see the fresh cucumbers. He said: When delivered to Jinan, the cucumbers can be sold at good prices. The more you earn, the happier we will be. You may grow strawberries and [word indistinct] in the greenhouses to increase your income. After visiting the greenhouse, Secretary Jiang came to the home of villager (Yang Chengming). He asked whether the village had collected plenty of accumulation funds. (Yang Chengming) answered: No. We, a family of four members, earn 9,000 yuan a year. Each of us pay merely 70 yuan as the village's accumulation funds. Secretary Jiang said: The more prosperous the village becomes, the less the masses have to pay as the accumulation funds. Grass-roots cadres must do more solid work for the masses, attend to the two civilizations simultaneously, firmly embrace the mass viewpoint, and maintain close ties with the masses. In doing work, they should attach importance to methods and refrain from doing work in an oversimplified and crude way or through administrative orders. When the cadre-populace ties are good, it will be easier to do work. After shaking hands with the people who came to say good-by at (Dayang) Village, Secretary Jiang continued his trip to another village.
