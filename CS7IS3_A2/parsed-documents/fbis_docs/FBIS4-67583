Kuznetsov, Crimean Ecological Center Chairman V. Rysich, and V. Tarasenko, chairman of the "Ecology and Peace" association: "Crimean `Russian Island?'"] [Excerpts] The "Ecology and Peace" association in the Crimea has repeatedly expressed its justified concerns over the environmental situation in areas of our peninsula occupied by military units and facilities. It is also alarming that there is no environmental control on these areas. Whereas Crimea's civil ecological service has an efficient scientific and practical potential (even though certain shortcomings still exist), the corresponding service carried out by the military in, for example, the Odessa Military District, is performed by...two specialists, as we have already reported. The "Ecology and Peace" association has expressed its concern in a letter to the Ukrainian defense minister. In response, the military department concurred with the Crimean specialists' assessment of the situation at military bases, has expressed its full understanding, and concluded that there is no money for action. We are not, however, facing a case that if someone does not want to do something he cannot be forced to do so. We must act! This is why the three seemingly different specialists have united under the one "roof" of this article, to tell readers the truth about the environmental situation in military towns. [passage omitted on nuclear tests conducted by the USSR in the 1950's] Do not think, however, that all the misery is far away from the Crimea. Similar events are taking place at the Bagerovsk military range (it is now a radioactive dumping ground). At a briefing in the Crimean Supreme Council, the range's deputy commander announced that personnel protecting the radioactive dump site are slightly inert and sleepy, and that something resembling lichen has appeared on the servicemen's skin. The statement was made on 14 May 1993. Even though our specialists requested that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry examine the facility, nobody has so far bothered to do so. The response is always the same--there is no money. Regretfully, this response has not been presented to the mothers whose children are serving at the Bagerovsk range. We would not envy those who would have to do that! As a matter of fact, this is just another version of the Russian island in the Pacific Ocean [site of nuclear tests]. In that case, however, more than 50 admirals and officers were brought to account. One official document of the former General Headquarters dated 1988--a protocol on military facilities' harmful impact on the Crimean environment--listed many garrisons, facilities, and units in which other environmental "dangers" had been discovered. The document included advice and recommendations as well. Absolutely nothing has changed since then. Our recent survey has revealed that no environmental certificates are held in military towns, oil warehouses do not have appropriate capacities to store oil sediment, sewage systems do not work in most military units, etc. Another extraordinary accident has recently occurred--the spilling of oil products in Sevastopol Bay. On the same day as we had a conversation at the State Committee for Environment Protection, reports of a new spill came in. In one of the military units deployed in the city of Saki, according to witnesses, 240 tonnes of oil products seeped into a resort lake. Meanwhile, there is a document in force, signed by all the "power" ministers, which obligates all civilian and military leaders to exchange information on emergency environmental situations. Apparently, however, nobody has been demanding its implementation. The authors of the article not only approve and support the president's program for gradual demilitarization of the Crimea, they can also provide a specific program for implementing it. Resources released in this process could be used in resolving social needs and environmental problems. The program for gradual demilitarization will contradict neither Ukraine's laws nor its Defense Ministry's military doctrine.
