The Cambodian people, who are victims of the 15 year Vietnamese war of aggression, yearn for national reconciliation and peace so they can live again in peace. As before, however, the enemies of our nation and people do not want us to unite and have peace. They intend further to fan the flames of war in order to massacre the people, which will permit them to have the opportunity to grab the interests of our nation and people at will. Look, while His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk is striving to convene a roundtable meeting, the communist Vietnamese puppets are actively seeking foreign arms aid -- the puppet Sar Kheng's recent visit to the United States is conspicuous evidence, and so on. Moreover, Winston Lord, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, recently disclosed that he was currently holding talks with France, Australia, and others about the possibility of sending armaments for the two-headed government further to attack Democratic Kampuchea. The above activities and utterances are evidence that the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and alliance never want us, the Cambodians, to unite and to live peacefully. They will continue to inflame war with a view to doing away with our nation and killing our people. Should the Pyongyang roundtable meeting fail, it will be due to the continuing opposition by the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and alliance to the national reconciliation plan of the king. All in all, the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and alliance can never act unchecked. The trend of peace and national reconciliation against war is becoming more and more zealous with each passing day. This tendency is immensely forceful and absolutely unstoppable. Those opposing national reconciliation and peace by further inflaming war are all traitors of the nation and people. One day, they will, at all costs, be crushed to pieces by the trend of national reconciliation and peace among the nation and people. National reconciliation, peace, independence, and Cambodia's genuine national unity then will be restored.
