[Boross] I cannot give you a percentage. I believe that it has a chance -- undoubtedly, after a series of unpopular measures. A question mark always hangs over a chance like this. However, it is certain that the public view of the MDF has improved. This is, somewhat, also supported by the economic situation and the hopes based on this, therefore, if this continues, we might reach a better result in May than has previously been predicted by many people. [Pozsgai] Can you expect a strong shift to the left in Parliament as happened in Poland, Lithuania, and Russia? [Boross] Certainly not as strong, in my view. In addition, the left wing is rather divided. Certain coalition versions exist on the left wing but, I dare say, I do not think this will actually happen when the time comes. Hungary does not have a party that is so clearly committed to the successor party that it would also be suitable for coalition. As far as I can see, some of its members would welcome this, while other would not. Therefore, the Polish analogy does not apply to us. In the meantime, we also have to consider that the non-compliance with left-wing needs has its consequences in Poland and the Hungarian public is informed about this through television. [Pozsgai] In 1993, we received unfavorable economic news from Hungary: Export reduction, agricultural decline, and the continuation of a restrictive monetary policy that reduces production, demand, and thus state revenue. It is self-evident that this monetary policy leads to further increases in the state's foreign debts. What is the justification for continuing this economic policy? [Boross] In my view, the Hungarian monetary policy is not restrictive. This statement is certainly not true. Anyone who is familiar with the Hungarian economic conditions knows very well that Hungary is forced to be part of international trade. The ratio of exports and imports in the Hungarian economy is extremely high. The problem arose mainly from the fact that the Western economic recession induced reduced demand for Hungarian export products, and the often mentioned motor of Europe, Germany, did not show its best side with its economic growth being around zero percent instead of being higher. Evidently, all this is supplemented by the fact that we convert the economy at a certain speed and this is impossible without temporary losses, including the uneconomic export bases. [Pozsgai] If the European Union continues to refuse the increase of imports from Eastern Europe, would it not be possible at least for the "Visegrad countries" to create a "common market" for themselves the way the six Western European countries began to set up the EEC in 1957? This could even accelerate gaining membership of NATO. [Boross] Those were six developed West-European countries with very well developed economies. We once were part of a bloc based on an undeveloped economic basis, which destroyed the Hungarian economy. All Visegrad countries are in a state of change. Therefore, it is in their vital interests that they not only coordinate affairs between themselves (where, of course, practical relations do exist that have to be used and even improved), but they also adjust to the most developed region of the world that draws the Hungarian technical level, product quality, and therefore, many factors, toward its level. It makes demands against the Hungarian economy. We need these demands so that one day we will become suitable for common market membership, which, naturally, is one of our ambitions. [Pozsgai] How are relations between Budapest and Bonn just now? I am asking this on the occasion of your forthcoming visit to Bonn. According to our information, relations were excellent at the time of the change of the regime, during the fuel crisis [not further specified], and even after that, but later they became more quiet. [Boross] Fortunately, events do not always occur that would specially highlight good relations. During these crises, Germany did indeed support us, but this is continuing. Chancellor Kohl and former Prime Minister Jozsef Antall had a special relationship. I think that this is widely known. When Chancellor Kohl was here at the funeral, I had an opportunity to meet him and I was glad to see that he applied the same intimate style with me. This gives me hopes that this good relationship will continue on the same level. It is self-evident that, in a relationship, it is not possible only to ask for things and request donations. This is not my goal. I would like a cooperation that has more advantages for us -- simply because of the power conditions -- but I am certainly not thinking of relations that would embarrass Germany because we might not be able to keep within the limits. We are. I will be talking to the chancellor on these terms. [Pozsgai] In the German television and press, it is mainly the Hungarian left wing that represents Hungary and it often gives a distorted picture of the domestic situation. Why is the Hungarian center passive in this area? [Boross] Because we are lagging behind in communication. This communication is essentially the heritage of the former regime, including a large section of its personnel -- mainly in the first two years of our operation. The result is that a keen political battle is going on here. The left wing suffered a great disappointment at the 1990 elections because it had been almost certain of its victory and, because of this, it often oversteps the limits that are adhered to by the communications experts of other countries' oppositions. Indeed, these actions that damage our image are very disturbing for us. Many of our domestic political battles are also on this issue. Occasionally, astonishing news can appear in Germany, and I can read striking distortions of my words in newspapers. Similar images are shown on television, for example, on the Gypsy issue. As far as I can remember, this did happen, although it has nothing to do with the truth. We are not in a good position regarding communications. [Pozsgai] So the media war is still on. In my view, the main reason for this is that the change of the regime has not been implemented in the area of the media. The daily newspapers had largely been privatized before the change of the regime, therefore, they avoided the change of the regime. [Boross] First of all, I would like to say that I can remember that the Springer concern was a main enemy in the previous, socialist-communist system in the West because of the level of its anti-communism. Then Springer bought six communist newspapers, and these are still edited by the same people as before. I can only placet a large question mark next to this, nothing else. This kind of problem did not exist in Germany. The staff of the East German television was fundamentally changed, and the Czechs did the same. This did not happen in Hungary. There are many reasons for this, and we are now suffering the consequences. The Hungarian transformation insisted on legality and this prevailed during the changes. In fact, as opposed to the eastern part of Germany, this change actually began in the previous regime. Therefore, here, the government never made any illegal or anti-constitutional measures and was always moderate. This has many advantages, but some disadvantages too, as is shown by the media issue. [Pozsgai] The political developments in Russia understandably worry the West. What do you think about Zhirinovskiy? Can he become Yeltsin's successor? [Boross] I dare not predict this, because political personalities sometimes appear and then disappear from public life. However, I dare say that the imperialist view and the slogans corresponding to this may bring lasting popularity in Russia, and this might mean a special advantage in politics -- even its extreme version. Therefore, in Russia, the imperial mentality is stronger than the Russian mentality in people's general views. A nationalist version of communism appeared there -- I am now talking about the left wing. [Pozsgai] Was Foreign Minister Jeszenszky's visit to Belgrade unavoidable right now when the Bosnian conflict has become more tense and the Serbs have been internationally isolated? [Boross] Let us be precise! Jeszenszky's visit and the state secretary's visit preceding it took place before the events you mentioned. Certain factors could have been taken into consideration if communication in international politics had been adequate. However, we also had to remember after all that 400,000 Hungarians are living in fear in Vojvodina. I think that we waited long enough. The foreign ministers of other countries, for example of the NATO member Greece, had been to Belgrade long before our visit was made. Hungary's interest in putting the Vojvodina Hungarians at ease was expressed in this visit -- some 100,000 members of this community have already left, some of them to Hungary, others to all parts of the world. In these circumstances, and recognizing that we will still be living next to each other for centuries, and historical experience also shows that it is dangerous to live in hostility, especially with Serbia, therefore, I believe that we had to make this step. We need peace here, on our southern border, and peace is needed for the Hungarians in Yugoslavia. We do not want to struggle with the problems of masses of refugees. They should stay at home and the feeling of danger that they have been living with for years should be reduced. Therefore, rump Yugoslavia is our neighbor and it will remain so. It is, of course, possible to give various pieces of advice. However, the advice is coming from many thousands of kilometers away from here. In such a case, we always have a strange feeling that they might not be living the situation as we have to live through it.
