More details from Paulo Barbosa: [Barbosa] [passage omitted] The prime minister spoke about foreign policy and Angola: [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] We continue to follow closely the Lusaka peace talks and to support the UN envoy's efforts. These efforts are aimed at reaching an agreement that may allow the existence of a fair and long-lasting peace process in that tormented country. The situation in Angola is truly tragic: A lot more people are dying in Angola than in the Bosnian conflict. Therefore, it is imperative that the international community does not abandon Angola, that it keeps showing an interest in the ongoing negotiations, and that it shows its readiness -- in case an agreement is reached -- to give the necessary assurances for its compliance, namely the availabilty on the ground of a UN peace force. We have not yet signed a military cooperation agreement with Angola because of the situation of armed conflict that still coexists with the endless Lusaka peace negotiations.
