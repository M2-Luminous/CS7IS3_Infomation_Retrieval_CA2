The main signs are: --Cross-strait economic links became closer, the number of Taiwan businessmen coming to the mainland for investment greatly increased, and cross-strait trade interactions rapidly developed. Over the past year, our country's political situation was steady, our society was stable, and our national economy maintained strong growth. Amid various reforms aimed at building the socialist market economic system, investment environment continuously improved. The great potential in economic development and the broad prospects which had been revealed continuously attracted numerous investors, traders, and industrial and commercial entrepreneurs from Taiwan. Investments made by Taiwan businessmen once again greatly increased in 1993, on the basis of 1992, a year in which the number of investment projects and the agreed upon funds all surpassed the sums of former years. According to statistics provided by a relevant department, from January to June 1993 the state approved a total of 4,891 Taiwan-funded projects, and the agreed upon investment funds reached $4.637 billion, an 187 percent increase and a 251 percent increase respectively over the same period in 1992. A relevant person has estimated that in 1993 newly added Taiwan-funded projects might reach 10,000, and the agreed upon investment funds might exceed $10 billion, ranking Taiwan second on the mainland in the drive to attract and utilize foreign funds. Another gratifying change in Taiwan investments in the mainland during 1993 was that investors developed from medium and small enterprises to large consortia and large enterprises, and the investment regions rapidly developed from the coastal areas and large and medium cities to the interior, remote areas, prefectures, counties, towns, and townships. Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong are still the areas attracting most Taiwan investments, while Qinghai and Tibet also succeeded in absorbing and utilizing Taiwan funds for the first time. Taiwan-funded enterprises can be found in every province, autonomous region, and municipality in the country. Many large consortia and enterprises in Taiwan rushed to the mainland for inspections and talks, and this undoubtedly created a broader perspective for Taiwan businessmen to invest in the mainland. Public opinion on the island held that "it was the largest scale in collectively going to the mainland for investments" since the Taiwan authorities lifted the ban on contacts with the mainland in 1987. In the area of cross-strait trade, according to the statistics provided by the relevant department, from January to September 1993 the total trade volume between the two sides passing through the entrepot of Hong Kong reached $6.39 billion, a 21.18 percent increase over the same period in 1992. The supplementary and reciprocal feature of trade and economic development across the strait has already become a common understanding on both sides. In order to further promote economic cooperation between the two sides of the strait, at the end of last year the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC] began to discuss the "PRC Law on Protecting Investments by Taiwan Compatriots (draft)." It can be predicted that once this bill is adopted and implemented, it will greatly promote cross-strait trade and economic development in the direction to standardization and institutionalization. --The coming and going of personnel across the strait became more frequent, the level continuously rose, and various exchanges continuously expanded, bringing in a new phase in which the two sides of the strait carried out special discussions and academic research together on various domains such as politics, economy, science, technology, education, culture, and society. According to the statistics provided by the relevant department, from January to September 1993 1.155 million Taiwan residents visited the mainland, and the figure is expected to top 1.6 million for the whole year, thus greatly surpassing the 1.36 million in 1992, whereas the cumulative sum in the past six years would exceed 5 million people. The number of mainland residents going to Taiwan also rose greatly. According to statistics, 3,309 persons went to Taiwan in 1993 for various exchange activities, 3.6 times the figure of 926 in 1992. The two prominent characteristics of the coming and going of personnel are the great increase in number and the continuous upgrading of level. In June 1993 the Taiwan authorities, succumbing to the pressure of opinions from various quarters, could not but allow Zhang Kehui, member of NPC Standing Committee and president of All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, to hasten home to Taiwan for the funeral of his parent, and this was a breakthrough in the visits to Taiwan by senior personnel from the mainland. The visits to Taiwan for exchanges activities by well-known mainland personnel such as Wang Fosong, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Liu Ji, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; He Zhenliang, president of the Chinese Olympic Committee; Wang Meng, former culture minister; Ying Ruocheng, former vice minister of culture; and Bao Yujun, deputy editor in chief of RENMIN RIBAO, all aroused greater responses on the island. The number of senior personnel coming from Taiwan to the mainland for exchange activities also markedly increased over 1992, and among them were "members of the National Assembly," "members of the Legislative Yuan," "adviser to the presidential palace," members of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, and main leaders of other political parties. Seeing for oneself is a hundred times better than hearing from others. The frequent exchanges of personnel across the strait and the upgrading of level are helpful to enhancing mutual understanding between the people on both sides of the strait, as well as among persons of various circles of the society, so that they can foster compassion and increase consensus. Their significance and influence are obvious and profound. When the coming and going of personnel from both sides of the strait became more frequent, various exchanges across the strait also continuously expanded and deepened, scoring rich results. Last year, apart from the bilateral exchanges in the domains such as culture, education, science, technology, film, television, news, and health, which continued to develop, other domains such as religion, tourism, architecture, finance, securities, land management, sports, and social customs also realized bilateral exchanges. What must be mentioned in particular is cultural exchange, which involved a large number of people and large projects, and had good effects. The performances by the China School of Beijing Opera, the Beijing School of Beijing Opera, Sichuan's Sichuan Opera Troupe, Hubei's Hankou Troupe, Beijing People's Arts Troupe, and Young Chinese Arts Troupe, as well as the exhibition of wood and clay figures of ancient warriors and horses, the exhibition of the jade clothes sewn with gold thread, the visit by Yunmen Dance Performing Troupe to Taiwan, and the first cross-strait movies show all had great impacts and changed the past pattern whereby Taiwan pop singers "dominated" the mainland. The cultural exchanges between the two sides of the strait are developing in the multilevel, multi-domain, and high- taste direction. The success in the cross-strait cultural exchanges illustrated that Chinese culture has tremendous rallying force, and is an important foundation for the two sides of the strait to establish consensus and mutual trust. Another feature of the continuously deepening bilateral exchanges across the strait last year was that there was an increasing number of various seminars jointly held by both sides of the strait, and the contents became richer and touched on cross-strait relations, as well as economic, industrial, cultural, educational, scientific, and technological topics....The discussions on areas and topics by various quarters from both sides of the strait will undoubtedly play a positive role in developing cross-strait economic, social, and cultural ties, and in strengthening the links and interactions among various circles on both sides of the strait. They can also enlighten both sides when they sit down for consultations and negotiations, and seek peaceful reunification of the country. --Smoothly holding the "talks between Wang Daohan and Koo Cheng- fu," realizing official contacts and discussions between the senior- level persons of the nongovernmental domain, and making an historic and important step forward in the development of relations between the two sides of the strait. The "Wang-Ku talks" were the most eye-catching event in the development of relations between the two sides of the strait in 1993. It was held at the end of April last year in Singapore, after efforts made jointly by both sides. It was the first meeting of the most senior persons of the empowered nongovernmental organizations on both sides of the strait, as well as the first open contact and discussion between the senior-level persons in nongovernmental capacity in more than 40 years. It had great significance and profound impact, and it drew a widespread attention from both sides of the strait and the international community. As part of that nongovernmental, economic, routine, and functional meeting, basing themselves on the spirit of mutual respect, of consultation on equal footing, of being practical, and of seeking common point while allowing differences, both sides seriously discussed the relevant problems, reached consensus on many areas, and signed the four documents of the "Wang-Ku Talks Joint Accord," the "Agreement on Ties and System of Talks Between the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF]," the "Agreement on Examination and Verification of Notarial Deeds in Use on Both Sides of the Strait," and the "Agreement on Cross-Strait Enquiry Into Registered Mail and the Matter of Compensation," scoring results which satisfied both sides. The complete success in this round of talks played a positive role in promoting forward development of cross- strait relations and in fostering peaceful reunification of the country. President Jiang Zemin spoke highly of it, and he said: "The Wang-Ku meeting is successful and fruitful, signifying that the development of cross-strait relations has made a historic and important step." In order to thoroughly implement the relevant agreements reached by the talks, the ARATS and SEF held work meetings in late August, early November, and mid-December in Beijing, Xiamen, and Taipei. Both sides discussed the matters such as repatriation of personnel, fishing disputes, repatriation of hijackers, and the way to arrange trips for the work personnel from the ARATS and SEF. Both sides also exchanged ideas and reached some consensus on protecting the rights and benefits of Taiwan investors on the mainland, as well as the related problems, and on the issue of visits by the persons of industrial and commercial circles from both sides of the strait. This enabled the routine talks between the two sides of the strait to be further deepened. --The publishing of the white paper on "The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification," has for the first time systematically and openly explained the cause of the Taiwan question, its current situation, and the crux of the problem. It also explained the Chinese Government's position, idea, and basic policy on solving the Taiwan question. The white paper resolutely safeguarded state sovereignty and territorial integrity, sternly refuted the fallacious theories such as "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," and "Taiwan independence." The white paper also clearly pointed out: "The wishes of Taiwan compatriots to become masters of their homes and to administer Taiwan are reasonable and proper, and this is not like `Taiwan independence' and they are basically different from a very small handful of those who insist on following the road of `Taiwan independence.'" The white paper, after being published, aroused enthusiastic responses in the international community and on the island of Taiwan, and scored very good results. It has already produced -- and will continue to produce -- a more profound impact on the development of cross-strait ties and reunification of the country. In conclusion, 1993 was a year in which the development of cross- strait ties made a new breakthrough and important headway. The situation continues to develop in the direction which is conducive to the peaceful reunification of the country. Over the past year, in order to promote the development of ties across the strait and to realize peaceful reunification of the country sooner, the CPC and the Chinese Government adopted a series of important measures to promote various exchanges and interactions across the strait, as well as nongovernmental contacts and talks, and to promote direct "three links," winning the support and approval from people on both sides of the strait. At the same time, the Taiwan authorities also further lifted certain restrictions on cross-strait exchanges and interactions, and adopted some measures which helped fostering communications and understanding, and this is in accordance with the wishes and interests of the people in the whole country, including the compatriots in Taiwan, and this is also conducive to the benevolent development of ties between the two sides of the strait. However, over the past year, the development of relations between the two sides of the strait still experienced some twists, turns, obstructions, and variables. The main reason rested on the island of Taiwan. Over the past year, the struggle among various political forces on the island intensified, in particular, the Taiwan authorities advocated "participation in the United Nations," put forward so-called "phase-nature policy of two Chinas," and fell back on the one-China position, while the trend of thought of "Taiwan independence" ran rampant on the island. This produced unfavorable influence on the development of cross-strait ties, and met with the strong opposition from the people on both sides of the strait, as well as from Overseas Chinese. There is only one China in this world, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, any attempt to pursue "two Chinas" "one China, one Taiwan," or "Taiwan independence" cannot succeed. Although things are not always smooth in the course of reunification of the country, reunification of the country accords with the will of the people, and this general trend of history is one which cannot be changed by any force. We believe that in the new year, cross-strait ties will continue to have a bigger development, and cross-strait interactions and cooperation will still maintain the tendency of rapid development. We hope that, proceeding from the basic interest of the Chinese nation, the Taiwan authorities will continue to uphold the principle of one China, further remove various artificial obstacles to political contacts and negotiations between the two sides of the strait, and do more practical things in order to develop cross-strait relations and foster reunification of the country.
