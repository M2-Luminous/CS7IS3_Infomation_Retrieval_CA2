The accusation was made in the House of Representatives Budget Committee by Hiromu Nonaka, a member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. Nonaka said Fujii made the remark in an informal meeting with reporters at his home last December. Nonaka also quoted Fujii as saying last year's harvest, the worst in the postwar era, spared the government extra efforts in working out ways to reduce the country's annual rice output by 400,000 tons. Fujii also was alleged to have said no one in the government considers it necessary to subsidize farmers who convert their paddies to grow other produce because they will be gone in 10 or 15 years. Fujii did not confirm or deny the allegation but said he wanted to stress the importance of the government's agricultural policy and political reforms.
