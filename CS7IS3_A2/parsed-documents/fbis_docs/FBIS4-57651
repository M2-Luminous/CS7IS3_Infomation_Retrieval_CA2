FBIS4-57651 "drlat099_r_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-099 Daily Report 12 May 1994 Peru Chilean Talks on Lima Conventions Suspended Chilean Talks on Lima Conventions Suspended PY1805153794 Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 12 May 94 p A4 PY1805153794 Lima EL COMERCIO Spanish BFN [Text] Yesterday, Oswaldo Sandoval (NM C-90) [New Majority-Change 90], CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] Foreign Relations Committee chairman, rejected any kind of deadline or pressure for approving the Lima Conventions signed between Chile and Peru. The conventions seek to iron out disagreements derived from the 1929 Treaty. The opposition, meanwhile, proposed canceling the implementation of the documents. These comments were made on the occasion of the first anniversary of the signing of the documents by the Peruvian and Chilean Governments. The NM-C90 legislator said talks between the two countries' foreign ministries aimed at improving the text of the document have been suspended since the new government took over in Chile. "We (the committee) are waiting for the Foreign Ministry to inform us about any possible progress," Sandoval said. He recalled that the foreign minister told him about a month ago that talks had been suspended temporarily due to the change in government in Chile. Sandoval said the only limitations that can be imposed on an issue of this nature are those represented by the level of consensus in the committee, in Congress, or in the population." [no opening quotation mark as published] Congressman Julio Dias Palacios (MDI) [Democratic Left Movement], also a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, noted he had presented a draft bill to have the diplomatic notes and decrees on the Lima Convention be declared without effect. "The government desire to solve the problems derived from the 1929 Treaty must be done within a framework where national sovereignty comes first, and the agreements included in the Treaty are respected, as we have been demanding," Palacios argued. The legislator said that in practice the process has been thwarted, as Chile does not accept the observations made in Peru. "Before we restart the process it would be preferable to have everything done in the past annulled, so that we can start negotiating conventions that are favorable to the country," Palacios said.
