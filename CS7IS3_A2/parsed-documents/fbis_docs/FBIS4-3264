The number of these operators was 224,000, an increase of 68.4 percent over 1990. Furthermore, an official from the bureau said, cases of tax evasion have declined drastically. He attributed all this to improved tax regulations as well as the heightened awareness of the importance of paying taxes on the part of the public. Statistics show that the income tax paid by individuals has increased by 58.2 percent since 1990 and hit 123 million yuan in 1993. The official said the main part of the individual income tax comes from highly paid Chinese employees of foreign-funded ventures. The number of private enterprises increased to about 4,000 in 1993 from only eight in 1988, while the tax they turned over increased from about 100,000 yuan to 130 million yuan. He admitted that tax returns from people in entertainment circles, contractors of construction enterprises and commodity brokers are far from satisfactory.
