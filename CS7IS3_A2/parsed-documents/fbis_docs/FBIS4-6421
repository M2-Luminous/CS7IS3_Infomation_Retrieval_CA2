FBIS4-6421 "dreas077aa_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-077 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS ASEAN Members Agree To More Active World Role ASEAN Members Agree To More Active World Role BK1404053694 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 14 Apr 94 pp 13, 20 BK1404053694 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [By Peter Mytri Ungphakon] [Text] Marrakech -- Thailand and other members of ASEAN have agreed to play a substantially more active role in the new world trade system that will emerge from the Uruguay Round agreements that are due to be signed tomorrow. Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak says he is going to propose that Thailand chairs the agricultural committee of the new World Trade Organisation [WTO] due to be established on January 1. This would put Thailand and its allies in the 14-nation Cairns Group in a position to influence the agenda of a committee handling one of the more contentious issues facing the new organisation. And at an informal meeting of ASEAN economic ministers on Tuesday, Singapore received support from fellow-members in its bid to host the first WTO ministerial meeting. These ministerial meetings, to be held every two years, will be the forum for ultimate control of the new organisation created by the Uruguay Round of world trade talks that concludes formally in Marrakech this week. Both bids are still at a formative stage and in Thailand's case no formal discussions have yet taken place with any other country. So there has been no reaction so far from others among the more than 100 countries attending this week's Uruguay Round meeting. The process of setting up the WTO will only begin today when a preparatory committee is due to be appointed. So far, the only ministerial meetings of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) -- the forerunner of the WTO -- that have been held outside Switzerland have been those that are part of a round of trade negotiations. All other routine GATT ministerial meetings have been held in Geneva. Singapore's bid to hold the 1996 WTO meeting would therefore set a new precedent. Unconfirmed reports say China also wants to host the 1996 meeting. It hopes also to be granted readmission to the GATT system so that it can be a founding member of the WTO. China helped to found GATT, but its membership lapsed following the communist takeover. The WTO agricultural committee that Thailand hopes to chair will initially be responsible for monitoring how the Uruguay Round's 125 participants implement the round's agreement on reducing subsidies and lowering trade barriers in farm trade. This is an issue that has caused some of the biggest controversies throughout the seven years of the Uruguay Round. Dr Suphachai said the idea of Thailand's candidature came from two meetings on Tuesday: the informal meeting of ASEAN economic ministers where he proposed that Thailand should be ASEAN's spokesman on agriculture in the WTO, and a bilateral meeting with Australian trade minister Bob McMullen who said the committee's chairman should come from the Cairns Group. Thai officials say that out of the Cairns Group's 14 members, one from ASEAN could prove to be the most acceptable to the major participants in the sometimes bitter agricultural negotiations. And among the four ASEAN countries that are also in the Cairns Group -- Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines -- Thailand has been by far the most active in the farm trade talks. The United States, which has been pressing for sharp cuts in subsidies and protectionist trade barriers, is likely to support anyone from the Cairns Group because the group shares that objective, the officials say. The European Union has resisted radical reform and could find a country from ASEAN, which has tended to take a more moderate position in the Cairns Group, more acceptable, they say. The officials believe that Australia, chairman of the Cairns Group, will not want simultaneously to chair the WTO committee, and that the group's five Latin American countries could be too aggressively critical of agricultural protectionism to be acceptable to the European Union. The five -- Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay -- twice walked out of Uruguay Round ministerial meetings in protest against the failure of the United States and European Union to reach agreement on agriculture. Dr Suphachai said he had not yet put forward the idea to any other country. But he has already shown a keenness for Thailand to assert itself in this issue, himself playing a particularly active part in Cairns Group affairs since his appointment as deputy prime minister in 1992. Chairing a WTO committee could require a substantial bureaucratic change for Thailand since the country's representative would have to be senior, probably with the rank of ambassador. The choice facing the Government would be to have a diplomat take the position, or a trade specialist. At present Thailand's ambassador to Geneva is a Foreign Ministry diplomat whose duties cover a wide range of subjects handled by the various UN agencies there, ranging from human rights and disarmament to labour and trade. Thai trade officials are discussing the possibility of appointing an experienced trade negotiator as ambassador either in place of the present diplomat, or preferably as a second ambassador assigned specifically to GATT or the WTO. They point out that more than half the countries represented in Geneva have ambassadors from economic ministries, some as their countries' sole envoys in the city. The question of whether the new WTO should link trade concessions with the observance of international standards of labour rights has turned out to be one of the most controversial issues in the main Marrakech meeting, with virtually all ministers referring to it in their formal statements. Broadly, developing countries opposed the move which is proposed by the United States and France, and is largely supported by developed countries. Dr Suphachai said that in discussions with the Australians, he was told that Canberra would not actively promote the idea, but that Canberra would not oppose it either because the Australian governing party is Labor. But the bulk of attention in Marrakech this week has turned to the many issues being discussed in side meetings. In the main conference room, more than 100 ministers are scheduled to plough through their formal statements over a scheduled period of almost four days, culminating in tomorrow's signing ceremonies. In addition to discussions with ASEAN and Australia, Dr Suphachai has also been involved in breakfast and lunch meetings yesterday of ministers from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group and the Cairns Group. Members of the Cairns Group agree that the group should continue in existence so that the implementation of the Uruguay Round agricultural deal can be monitored. But differences are emerging within the group over a Latin American proposal that the group be reorganised so that the chairmanship rotates instead of remaining with Australia. The Latin Americans also want to expand the group's membership to other agricultural exporting countries. Brazil and Argentina in particular are thought to be sufficiently dissatisfied with the Uruguay Round's compromise on agriculture to seek a more aggressive chairmanship. However, Dr Suphachai said Thailand preferred to keep Australia as chairman. The group is due to meet formally in Uruguay next month. Discussions here in Marrakech this week have served as preparation. Dr Suphachai was also scheduled to meet delegation heads from Italy, China, Hungary and the Czech Republic during this week. Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon, who is also in the Thai delegation, has been meeting counterparts from Hong Kong and India. Bigger players on the world trade scene have been discussing more serious issues. The United States and European Union have been trying to narrow their differences on commitments related to a new deal on government purchases due to be signed tomorrow by 20-30 countries; and the United States and Japan have been tackling the US demand for greater access to the Japanese market.
