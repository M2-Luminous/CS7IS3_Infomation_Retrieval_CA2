Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy told reporters that during talks with the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, it was decided to hold joint military exercises and establish a direct communications line between the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and the U.S. defense Department. It was also agreed that U.S. defense Secretary William Perry would visit Ukraine on March 21-23. According to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, the two countries' relations have risen to a "new level." "The American administration has completely revised its policy towards Ukraine," Zlenko said. The United States saw it as essential that "Ukraine should remain an independent and sovereign state," because Ukraine's loss of independence "may upset the balance of power in Europe," he said. Zlenko said the two nations had considerably stepped up their economic relations. Thus, America had allocated $700 mn as aid to Ukraine, and the latter would also receive assistance from the World Bank and other international financial bodies, he said. A team of U.S. experts is shortly due to arrive in Ukraine to determine priorities in the two countries' economic relations, Zlenko said.
