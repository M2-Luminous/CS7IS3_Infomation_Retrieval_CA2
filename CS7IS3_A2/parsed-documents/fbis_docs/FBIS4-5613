Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa called the bilateral relations a "mature relationship." However, according to the results of a public opinion poll conducted by MAINICHI SHIMBUN, together with a survey on the economic situation and the employment issue, about 30 percent of respondents, who are top corporate executives, thought the current Japan-U.S. relations are in a "serious" situation. The other 70 percent also expressed their anxieties, saying "they are rather concerned about the situation." Moves for preventing trade frictions, such as the settlement of the mobile phone issue, and the automakers' voluntary plans to expand procurement of foreign-made auto parts, have been made one after another. The cabinet also approved in late March the "outline of external economic policy reforms" as measures to promote deregulation and market opening. Yet, only one executive answered "Japan-U.S. relationship will improve" through this outline, while 90 percent expressed disappointment, saying: "It will not change." Three respondents even said "it will worsen." In answer to a question on measures Japan should take (multiple-choice answer), about 90 percent of those polled cited the implementation of "large-scale relaxation and abolition of regulations." About 70 percent pointed out the need for "extensive market opening." With regard to expanding domestic demand, 50 percent sought "large-scale tax reduction," and 30 percent, "further increase in public investment." While the majority tended to rely on the government to take some measures, about 20 percent pointed out the need for "cooperation at the private-sector level." Only one respondent answered there was no other choice but "to accept the numerical targets" which caused the rupture of the economic framework talks.
