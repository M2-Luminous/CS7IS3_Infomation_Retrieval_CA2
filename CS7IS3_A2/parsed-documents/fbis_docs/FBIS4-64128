This is connected with the fact that on May 25 at about 9 p.m. unidentified persons shot at a Zhiguliy car with two people inside near the village of Yuznyy situated in the security zone. Both people died of mortal gunshot wounds. The incident is being investigated. The situation in the zone under state of emergency is aggravated by acts of terrorism, bandit attacks and incessant taking of hostages, a spokesman for the press service of the president and the government of North Ossetia told ITAR-TASS. Unfortunately, so far the fate of three citizens of North Ossetia taken hostages in the village of Maiskiy of the Prigorodnyy district on March 30 this year, is not known yet. The measures carried out to search and liberate six Ingushes who were taken hostages by criminals on May 19 in the city of Vladikavkaz have not produced positive results either. Today President of North Ossetia Akhsarbek Galazov met with members of the presidiums of the government and the parliament of the republic, representatives of the law enforcement bodies of North Ossetia and the temporary administration. They discussed urgent measures to search for the hostages. The president expressed an extremely negative attitude to the unlawful actions of persons involved in the crimes in the Maiskiy village and in Vladikavkaz, and stated that the leadership of North Ossetia would do everything in its power to find hostages and take additional measures to ensure security of residents of the republic.
