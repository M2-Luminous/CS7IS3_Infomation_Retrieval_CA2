There is no other method of operation in a confrontation with masked and uniformed persons, the two said. The two also recommended that the commanders of the undercover unit give their soldiers a citation of merit for their performance. The recommendation was made at the close of the full debriefing of the incident. A senior officer who was at the debriefing noted: "We made it clear to the force that its performance was remarkable. We must remember, especially the bleeding hearts, that on Passover eve one of our officers was shot in the abdomen and is still in grave condition. The undercover unit was praised by the chief of staff as well. It is impossible to make a distinction between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]." Following are the findings of the IDF debriefing: -- Two hours before the incident, a hand grenade was thrown at the IDF outpost in Jabalyah. -- Over the past two weeks, 11 hand grenades and explosive charges were thrown at that post. -- The incident was not initiated by the undercover unit. Its task was to guard the outpost. -- The unit spotted six men who were wearing checkered uniforms and masks -- in contradiction to the agreements made over the past months between the IDF and Fatah. -- The force opened fire at the six, four of whom were holding loaded guns in their hands and aiming them at the soldiers. Despite the satisfaction in the IDF over the way the soldiers performed, there is serious embarrassment over the fact that the dead men were senior Fatah members who supported the peace process. Immediately after the incident, Gen. Almog met with the Gaza Strip Fatah commanders. Among others, he met with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah. Almog made it clear to Abu-Zayidah that the standing IDF orders compelled the soldiers to react the way they did. He expressed his regret over the incident, and stated that cooperation between Fatah and the IDF should continue. Abu-Zayidah found it hard to accept the remarks: "This was one big massacre which could have been prevented," he said. "The Army has no business being in Jabalyah. The soldiers should not have been there in the first place. These men wanted peace very much and supported it." At the end of their meeting, Gen. Almog and Abu-Zayidah agreed that operational coordination between Fatah and the IDF troops in the Gaza Strip will expand. A cooperation mechanism -- a sort of a "hot line" -- may possibly be set up to facilitate the exchange of ongoing information between the parties. A senior Southern Command officer said yesterday that early coordination between Fatah and the IDF could have prevented the killing of the six Fatah members. "Let them make no accusations," the senior officer said. "Fatah should have coordinated the presence of its men in the region. It should not have sent armed and uniformed men into the heart of the 'hot' region. "There have been incidents in the past when we allowed Fatah men to stage marches while carrying their guns, as long as this was done for their internal purposes. Unnecessary victims can be spared when things are coordinated," he said.
