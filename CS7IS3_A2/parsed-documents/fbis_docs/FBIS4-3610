FBIS4-3610 "drchi078_w_94008" FBIS-CHI-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Commission Boosts Land Area Released for Housing Purposes Commission Boosts Land Area Released for Housing Purposes HK2204071294 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 22 Apr 94 pp 1, 6 HK2204071294 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By Linda Choy and Kenneth Ko] [Text] The Sino-British Land Commission yesterday approved the release of 56.81 hectares of land for private and assisted housing Although the overall amount of land -- 117.27 hectares -- endorsed in the disposal programme for 1994-95 is eight per cent down on last year's 127 hectares, the grant for residential use has been increased by 23 per cent, or 10.8 hectares. British team leader Tony Eason described the three hour meeting as a "positive and co- operative" exchange with his Chinese counterpart, Chen Rongchun. The extra land supply for residential housing was greeted enthusiastically by the chairman of the Hong Kong Bank John Gray, who said that the Government was heading in the right direction in combatting property speculation. Big developers also hailed the increase as a significant step towards moderating housing prices, which have reached unaffordable levels for most families. A spokesman for the Real Estate Developers' Association of Hong Kong, Stewart Leung, called the increase in private residential land supply "substantial". However, he stressed that to make domestic apartments available sooner, the Government should try to streamline the increasingly complicated and time-consuming procedures for processing developments. The chairman of the Legislative Council housing panel, Lee Wing- tat, also welcomed the news as a "good sign". Yesterday, both the Chinese and British team leaders were cautious in commenting on the effect on property prices. However, they said the land grant should be seen as a positive sign of each government's will to solve the housing shortage. Of the 56.81 hectares of residential land, 31.43 hectares was granted for assisted-housing programmes such as the Home Ownership Scheme, the private sector participation scheme, the sandwich-class housing scheme, the housing society development and village housing. This represents a 14 per cent, or 3.8-hectare, increase on last year's grant for Government-assisted housing. Another 25.38 hectares for private residential construction was included in the 31 hectares set aside for commercial, residential and industrial development. According to Mr Eason, about 20 hectares will be used for high- density development. But he refused to estimate the number of flats nor the total floor area of the residential housing that might be provided. He refused also to specify where the sites were, apart from saying that most of them were likely to be in the New Territories. Asked whether the increase would cool the property prices, Mr Eason said: "I do expect the market to see this as a...positive step to inject additional supply into the market. "[As to] what effect there is on the market sentiment, of course, this is not the only factor that people in the market will take into account," he said. "So I think we shall have to wait and see exactly what its effect is." Mr Chen said the extra land grant would ease property prices. However, he said the property price-rise was a complicated problem to be solved by the Hong Kong British Government. The question of the Container Terminal 9, which requires about 60 hectares of land, remained unresolved. Both Mr Chen and Mr Eason said it would be discussed at another forum. Mr Chen said: "China and Britain are discussing the issue through other channels. Before there is a result, the Land Commission will not consider that." Mr Eason said he was not disappointed by the lack of agreement on a land grant for the container terminal. Until discussions elsewhere had been concluded, the Land Commission had postponed its consideration, he said. Other categories of land grant included 17.67 hectares for public utilities including educational, welfare, religious, recreational and other uses. Another 37.16 hectares of land is allocated for special requirements. This more than doubled last year's grant of 16.51 hectares.
