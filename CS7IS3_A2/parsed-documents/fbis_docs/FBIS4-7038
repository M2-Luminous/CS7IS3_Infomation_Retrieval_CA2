On this day, all people across the country extend the greatest honor to our Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il, who leads the Army and people with boundless boldness, steel-like will, and outstanding resourcefulness and, thus, strongly defends the country's independence and national dignity. They also extend warm congratulations to the heroic People's Army officers and men who are defending the fatherland's defense lines like an impregnable fortress. The invincibility of the revolutionary cause of the working class depends, to an important degree, on the invincibility of the revolutionary armed forces which guarantee the fulfillment of this cause with the force of arms. To people who aspire for independence and are building socialism, nothing is more honorable and prouder than having an powerful revolutionary army. The bright future of the chuche revolutionary cause and our fatherland's invincible might and high dignity are firmly ensured militarily by the heroic KPA. The might of our People's Army has not been further strengthened any other time than today when it is marching under respected and beloved Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il. This is the great pride of our people who are carrying out the revolution. The respected and beloved leader and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il are great in that they have raised our People's Army into an invincible powerful army that can defeat any aggression forces. This is also their great achievement. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song founded the Korean People's Revolutionary Forces on 25 April in 1932, 62 years ago. This was a historic event that gave birth to our party's revolutionary armed forces, genuine chuche-type revolutionary forces. As a result of the founding of the Korean People's Revolutionary Forces, our people's long-cherished desire to have their own powerful armed forces was fulfilled brilliantly, and, from that time, the proud history of the heroic KPA started. Our revolutionary forces have walked along an honorable road of struggle since declaring their birth throughout the world. The over 60 years of the KPA's march were an honorable road along which the KPA has won victory after victory while overcoming numerous trials as dictated by the party and the leader [suryong]. They were also brilliant annals in which it has brought about immortal achievements for the fatherland and the nation and the era and the revolution. Our People's Army has always been able to honorably fulfill its noble mission along a long road and has strengthened and developed into a revolutionary invincible army. This was only possible because there was the wise leadership of the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. Our Army could win the two wars against powerful enemies and strongly defend the independence of the country and the nation because it was led by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. All brilliant revolutionary feats on this land are filled with the blood and sweat of our People's Army officers and men who have devotedly fought for the fatherland's freedom and independence, the people's happiness, and a victory in the anti-imperialist cause of independence. The People's Army's immortal achievements--that it honorably fulfilled its historic mission for the era and the revolution and the fatherland and the people by displaying boundless loyalty toward the party and the leader [suryong], a spirit of sacrifice, and indomitable patriotism--will be eternally brilliant with the proud history of the Korean revolution. Our revolutionary armed forces, which were founded under the leadership of the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song and have traversed the path to glorious victory, have come to a new high level in their own development by upholding the great iron-willed commander General Kim Chong-il [widaehan kangchorui yongjang Kim Chong-il changgun] as the supreme commander. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Comrade Kim Chong-il has the indomitable will, mettle, distinguished resourcefulness and tactics [yonggunsul] befitting the supreme commander of the revolutionary armed forces. Herein lies the guarantee for the endless consolidation and development of and ever-victoriousness of our revolutionary armed forces. The invincibility of the revolutionary armed forces depends upon the greatness of the supreme commander who is leading them. When they uphold the great supreme commander, the armed forces can become (?matchless) strong ones. Today, our revolutionary armed forces pride themselves upon being the ever-victorious, invincible revolutionary armed forces which can smash any formidable enemy [kuotton chonha taejokto chobushilsuinnun]. This is totally because we are upholding the iron-willed commander General Kim Chong-il as our revolutionary armed forces' supreme commander who embodies the features of an outstanding military strategist and distinguished commander [yongjang] at the noblest level. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, equipped with both literary and military accomplishments, has paid much attention to the work to consolidate and develop the People's Army--the core of the self-reliant national defense capabilities--with the fate of the country and the people on his shoulders from the early days on, thereby carrying out energetic activities and making immortal achievements. Without the dear comrade leader's outstanding wisdom [yeji] and refined tactics, we cannot talk about our People's Army being the ranks of loyalty which are fighting by dedicating their lives to the party and the leader [suryong] and about its having been consolidated and developed into a one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary armed force which can smash any enemy, nor can we think of the fact that we have come to have a firm military guarantee on which the socialist cause of chuche can be firmly defended from generation to generation. The immortal achievements made by our supreme commander General Kim Chong-il in the implementation of the cause of building our revolutionary armed forces lie, above all, in the fact that he has brightly illuminated the future path, which our People's Army should traverse, by putting forth the most correct and original military ideologies and theories. To illuminate the correct path to the building of our revolutionary armed forces and to the victory of the revolutionary war by putting forth correct military ideologies and theories is the primary mission of the commander [yongyang] who is leading the armed forces. The greatness of the commander lies right in the greatness of military ideologies and of strategies and tactics. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has developed and enriched the chuche-oriented military ideologies and theories, which the great leader created, on a wholesale scale with his matchless, outstanding military wisdom and with his activities denying himself sleep and rest. The military ideologies and theories put forth by our supreme commander General Kim Chong-il are, in a thoroughgoing manner, the chuche-oriented military ideologies based on the masses-centered philosophical principle; are the encyclopedic theories encompassing all sectors and all fields of building the armed forces; and are the most scientific and revolutionary theories whose justness and invincible vitality have remarkably been corroborated in the revolutionary practice of our era. Herein lies a comprehesive compilation about the theoretical, practical matters arising from the building of the revolutionary armed foces of our era, ranging from the mission of the revolutionary armed forces of the working class, to the principles and methods in building the armed forces, and to the complete displaying of the might of the revolutionary armed forces. To have the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's outstanding military ideologies and theories, which are consistent in terms of their revolutionary and scientic nature, is the great fortune of our people and People's Army. As long as the chuche-oriented military ideologies and theories illuminated by the dear comrade leader exist, our revolutionary armed forces will reliably safeguard our socialist cause, while firmly defending in an unflinching way their revolutionary nature as the armed forces of the leader [suryong], the party and the people under any circumstances. Another immortal achievement of the iron-willed sagacious supreme commander General Kim Chong-il accumulated along the road of strengthening and developing our People's Army is having strengthened and developed our revolutionary armed forces into a matchlessly strong army fully prepared in political, ideological, military, and technological aspects with his outstanding and tested leadership. The might of the revolutionary army is the political and ideological might which can be most highly displayed when it is combined with modern military technology. While ensuring priority on the work of firmly preparing the People's Army in political and ideological aspects, our comrade supreme commander energetically led the work of strengthening its military and technological aspects. Due to the wise leadership of the supreme commander General Kim Chong-il, our People's Army has been strengthened and developed into a victorious army fully prepared in political and ideological aspects as well as in military and technological aspects. Today, our People's Army's political and moral trait is excellent. The entire Army is filled with loyalty toward the party and the leader, and revolutionary military discipline is being firmly maintained. All the officers and men of the People's Army are highly upholding the leadership of the comrade supreme commander with revolutionary will of becoming bullets and bombshells to defend the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander with their lives, and are creating heroic feats and miracles in carrying out their military duties. There is no such an invincible army in this world like our People's Army, which bears ardent loyalty and absolute worship toward its supreme commander, and of which revolutionary military discipline is thoroughly established so as to unconditionally implement the supreme commander's order and guidance without any ups and downs anytime under any circumstances. Our People's Army is fully prepared in military and technological aspects. The People's Army is equipped with modern weapons and combat technology equipment. All the soldiers are skillfully handling their weapons and combat technology equipment with deep military knowledge and technology. It is a proud aspect of our People's Army to display the mighty appearance of invincible revolutionary armed forces possessing powerful offensive and defensive means, and unique chuche-motivated war method. Today, the might of our People's Army, which has been strengthened and developed into a victorious army, gives faith to our people and the world's revolutionary people. Our party is able to persistently push forward with the struggle to complete the chuche cause with firm determination because there is the mighty People's Army. Our people are able to accelerate the socialist construction with high spirit and strong confidence in the fierce confrontation against the enemies because they have the firm faith in the invincible might of the People's Army. In addition to strengthening the People's Army in various ways, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, chairman of the DPRK Defense Commission and supreme commander of the KPA, brilliantly achieved the work of making all the people armored and fortifying the entire country, thus firmly established an all-people, all-country defensive system across the country, and wisely led the work of building up a mighty, self-reliant national defense industry. As a result, the entire country has been literally turned into an impregnable fortress. As long as we have our mighty, self-reliant national defense power which has the matchless People's Army as the core, no enemy can intrude our fatherland's security. Another immortal achievement of our supreme commander General Kim Chong-il accumulated during the days of leading the cause of military construction to brilliant victory is having further consolidated the unity of ideology and will between the Army and the people by thoroughly embodying the idea of the Army-people unity. How the Army and the people firmly unite in one mind and one will is a decisive factor of the victory of revolution. An army that does not receive support from the people cannot sufficiently manifest its might even though it has up-to-date equipment and will be defeated in every war. In our country, the traditional virtue of Army-people unity is wholly blossoming at a new high stage by highly upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the benevolent father [chaaeroun oboi] of our people and officers and men of the People's Army, as the supreme commander. The officers and men of our People's Army love the people whenever and wherever, are devoting everything for the people's interest, and our people are actively supporting and encouraging the People's Army both materially and morally. Our People's Army and people are verbally united together in which they cannot be separated even it they wanted to, and there is no power in this world that can break this great single-hearted unity. We are able to easily defeat any powerful enemy because of the single-hearted unity of the Army and people impregnably united around the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander. Truly, General Kim Chong-il, the ever-victorious iron-willed military commander, is an extraordinary military genius who leads our revolutionary force toward brilliant victories and glory. Through extraordinary wisdom and outstanding art of commanding the Army, our comrade supreme commander has brilliantly solved all problems arising in the construction of the revolutionary armed force, and he resolutely smashed [chitbusyoborisiotta] the enemies' challenge through our peerless courage and iron-like will. Even under the especially difficult condition in frustrating the U.S. imperialists' maneuver of aggression and provocation and in constructing socialism, the dear comrade leader provided a peerless powerful army that can smash [ttaeryo pusilsuinnun] any kind of enemy. Such achievement by the dear comrade leader will eternally shed light along with the victorious advance of the chuche cause. While reflecting with deep sentiment upon the proud history in which our revolutionary armed forces had walked, the officers and men of our People's Army and all the people are feeling in their hearts the extraordinary greatness of General Kim Chong-il who is wholly embodying the trait and temperament of an iron-like military commander, and are overflowing with the firm determination to carry out the revolution to the end according to the leadership of the comrade supreme commander. Today we are faced with the heavy and honorary task of further strengthening the revolutionary armed forces and to achieve ahead of schedule the fatherland's independent reunification and the ultimate victory in the chuche revolutionary cause in accordance with the demand of the prevailing situation. Currently in our country, a tense situation is being created in which we do not know when a war may break out at any time because of the imperialists' vicious antisocialist and antirepublic maneuvers. Reality demands that the might of our People's Army must be all the more strengthened. The People's Army is the core of the self-defensive national defense capacity and a reliable defender of our party's cause. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has firm faith in the People's Army and is exerting efforts night and day to strengthen and develop it so that the chuche revolutionary cause can be completed to the end. We must all the more strengthen our revolutionary armed force by brilliantly succeeding and developing the immortal achievements in accumulating the cause of military building by the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander. The comrade supreme commander's leadership is the life of the People's Army and a decisive element in the victory in military building and military activities. All the officers and men of the People's Army must highly uphold the comrade supreme commander's leadership and must consistently adhere to the party's line of modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea. All the soldiers must firmly arm themselves with the great General Kim Chong-il's ideology and theory of military building, and assimilate loyalty toward the comrade supreme commander as their faith, consciousness, morality, and life to further strengthen the political and ideological might of the People's Army. Along with this, the whole Army's revolutionary army trait of fulfilling to the end the order and instruction of the comrade supreme commander by going through fire and water must be all the more firmly established, and all the soldiers must be prepared to become a man of combative spirit of one-a-match-for-100. Highly manifesting the virtue of unity between officers and men and unity between the party and society is an important guarantee in strengthening the might of our People's Army. [Text] Commanders of the People's Army should treasure and love their soldiers, sharing their fate, joys, and sorrows, and soldiers should respect and follow their commanders. All party members in the People's Army should be a model in their military life and properly help and lead members of the Socialist Working Youth League in the Army. Members of the league should emulate the model of party members and should become models in implementing the party's army building ideology and policy. Singehearted unity is the basic principle of our revolution and is an ever-victorious banner. We have consistently advanced our revolution with the might of singlehearted unity around the party and the leader [suryong] while surmounting multilayered barriers. Our people and all officers and men of the People's Army should firmly safeguard and defend the tradition of our proud singlehearted unity and glorify it generation after generation. All people and officers and men of the People's Army should uphold the leadership of General Kim Chong-il, the respected and beloved supreme commander, with the single mind of loyalty and filial piety and with the faith in certain victory that as long as General Kim Chong-il, the respected and beloved supreme commander, is with us we will win without fail. Thus, all the people and all the Army should firmly unite as one mind and resolutely defend the party and the leader [suryong]. Unity between the Army and the people is the source of our singlehearted unity. It is also a firm guarantee for the victory of the revolutionary war. The laudable tradition of the unity between the Army and the people which is being enhanced in our society today is an expression of their lofty mental world to share to the end destiny with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il under any difficult circumstances. All the people and officers and men of the People's Army should further bring our party's great ideology of unity between the Army and the people into fuller bloom. Soldiers of the People's Army should become genuine sons and daughters who love the people and who fight for the people, devoting their lives. The people should treasure and love soldiers of the People's Army like blood brothers and should actively help it. Defending the socialist fatherland is a task by all of the people. As long as imperialism remains and as long as the reckless war provocation maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and their stooges continue we should not mitigate our alertness. All party members and the working people should firmly arm themselves with our party's chuche-oriented view on war and should firmly establish in the whole society the ethos of attaching importance to military affairs and learning military affairs fervently. Thus, they should fully have political and ideological preparations and military preparations, that is, material preparations so as to cope with any unexpected situation. National reunification is our people's supreme task that should not be delayed even for a moment. Today, the South Korean puppet clique is advancing toward the road of relying on outside forces, not toward the road of national independence, while turning away the desire for reunification of the nation. It is attempting to stage a nuclear war exercise against our republic in collusion with the U.S. imperialists. However, no matter what a large-scale war exercise the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique may try to stage and, thus, to drive North-South relations to a dangerous phase they cannot block the unanimous desire of the whole nation for reunification. All of the people should sternly smash the antireunification forces' maneuvers and should more vigorously fight to expedite the day of national reunification. The internal and external situation of our revolution is still complicated and tense. However, we have nothing to fear. Our revolutionary armed forces are the ones which have the habit of being always victorious for some 60 long years. They are also the ever-victorious revolutionary armed forces which uphold General Kim Chong-il, the most famous general in the world, as their supreme commander. The future of our People's Army which is reliably defending the chuche revolutionary cause under the leadership of the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who is the most veteran and great leader of our times, and General Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander, will await only brilliant victory and glory. Long live the 62d anniversary of the founding of the heroic KPA.
