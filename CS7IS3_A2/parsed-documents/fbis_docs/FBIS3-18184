After his meeting with Slovakian Premier Vladimir Meciar in his office, Cetin told reporters that Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was the victim of the conflict in the region, had actually voiced a request for Turkey's participation in the forces, besides the request made by Turkey to Western countries on the issue. Cetin recalled that Turkey had been a country which had an active stand towards the issue since the beginning and was the only country which supported the Bosnians since then. "We spent intensive efforts to bring Croatians and Bosnians together and we went to Sarajevo at a time no one had the courage to do so. We issued a Sarajevo declaration there. We believe, as stated by our premier, Turkey's contributions are vital for a lasting peace in the region," he said
