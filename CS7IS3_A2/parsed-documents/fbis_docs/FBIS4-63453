It will be recalled that the media gave significant coverage to the protocol for many days. The speaker of the parliament outlined his position by saying that a debate on the protocol is unnecessary, that a lengthy debate had already been held. The debate of the protocol was not included on the agenda, and seventeen deputies walked out of the meeting. Commenting on the matter, Deputy Kamuran Rakhimov said the following: [Begin Rakhimov recording] Creating a confrontation when our country and people are faced with complex problems is meaningless. The Bishkek protocol and the effects it will have on Azerbaijan's future were discussed at the meeting. It was noted that the protocol's main objective is to end the fighting. That is in the interest of all the people in Azerbaijan. How long should we prolong the war? How long should we witness the death of our young men and attend the funerals of the martyrs? So, the main objective should be to end the war and establish peace. In fact, that is the Bishkek protocol's main objective. The walk-out by a group of deputies from the National Assembly cannot be justified in any way. I am convinced that they will realize that state of affairs. [end recording]
