FR941121-1-00015 FR941121-1-00006 The cost to replace two replaceable bulb headlamps can equal 10 percent of the value of an entire car after it is 5 to 8 years old. Consumers used to the cost of sealed beam headlamps are critical of state vehicle inspection programs when they force the replacement of headlamps at costs which far exceed those of sealed beams. When Standard No. 108 was amended to permit replaceable bulb headlamps, the economic consequences of lens/reflector assembly replacement were not considered to be relevant to safety, and the ability to replace the light source gave some promise of consumer benefit. Ironically, the economic burden to consumers now fuels a safety debate about whether the reluctance of owners to replace expensive cracked lamps or the possibility of degraded performance of relensed lamps is the greater threat to safety. The styling benefits of replaceable bulb headlamps over sealed beams have resulted in large potential cost penalties and an unquantifiable degree of performance loss when the headlamps are damaged. Volkswagen commented that the cost to replace a headlamp is 7 to 8 times that of the lens alone. It cited examples of lamps costing $215 to $270 and estimated the cost of replaceable lenses in the $30 to $40 range. Mercedes estimated the cost of replaceable lenses at $126 to $150 and complete headlamps at $250 to $640 with on-board aiming. While the cost of headlamps with the fasteners, gaskets, and indexing features required for replaceable lens designs would be higher than the cost of headlamps with simple bonded lenses, reductions in repair costs of 50% to 85% appear to be likely. The agency anticipates that replaceable lens designs would be attractive only for headlamps using glass lenses. These are predominantly used on imported vehicles. Replaceable bulb headlamps which have coated polycarbonate plastic lenses are extremely resistant to cracking and chipping. AAMA commented that the impact resistance of plastic lenses significantly reduces any servicing need to provide replaceable lenses. Glass lenses are less expensive than coated plastic lenses, and they have greater resistance to high operating temperatures and abrasion by headlamp wipers. However, the additional cost of a replaceable lens design would probably negate the economic advantage a manufacturer might achieve by changing to a less expensive replaceable glass lens when it had been using bonded plastic lenses. It is likely that the market for replaceable bulb headlamps with replaceable lenses would be confined to a small segment of the import market in which headlamp wipers or high operating temperatures dictate the choice of glass lenses. Bosch's petition covered only replaceable bulb headlamps. However, AAMA commented that a greater economic benefit of replaceable lenses could be found in integral beam headlamps. High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps are being developed for use as integral beam headlamps, and their operating temperatures are expected to dictate the use of glass lenses. An integral beam headlamp is required to be manufactured with the lens, bulb, reflector, cable and high voltage source configured as an indivisible whole. HID headlamps are much more costly than replaceable bulb headlamps, and the prospect of replacing the whole lamp (at perhaps $1000) in order to repair a cracked lens may be a significant impediment to introduction of the technology. Since the industry-imposed economic burden on the consumer is the agency's primary reason for considering replaceable lens headlamps, it is appropriate to include integral beam headlamps in the proposal. Proposed Amendments NHTSA is implementing its conclusions by proposing appropriate amendments to Standard No. 108. As noted above, the proposed amendments cover integral beam headlamps as well as those with replaceable bulbs. The proposal requires redefinitions of ``integral beam headlamp'' and ``replaceable bulb headlamp'' to clarify that some types of these headlamps need not have a bonded lens reflector assembly, those with a vehicle headlamp aiming device (VHAD) conforming to Standard No. 108. Under the proposal, each replacement lens would also have to be accompanied by an appropriate replacement seal, and instructions to the user on how to remove and replace the lens, clean the reflector, and seal the lens to the lamp. Manufacturers of replacement lenses would mark them with a DOT symbol which will be the manufacturer's certification that installation of the lens on the headlamp for which it is intended will not create a noncompliance with Standard No. 108. A new section is proposed that would add the chemical and corrosion resistance tests discussed above. The greatest impact of the proposal will be on future HID integral beam headlamps which may require heat resistant glass lenses rather than impact resistant plastic lenses. These head-lamps will be very costly and their replacement will involve high voltage components. The development of durable reflectors to make them suitable for replaceable lens will be an important step in making HID lamps practical. Additionally, should future changes to the standard accommodate HID light sources in replaceable bulb headlamps, the ability to have replaceable lenses would enhance their economic viability as well. The comments suggest that it is not critical to require replacement lenses to be identical to original lenses in order to maintain photometric performance in compliance with the standard. The only necessary requirement is that the replacement lens maintain compliance of an otherwise compliant headlamp in all respects including sealing. An additional practical requirement is that a replacement lens be supplied with a new seal and instructions for cleaning the reflector and installing the lens and seal. Request for Comments Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted.
