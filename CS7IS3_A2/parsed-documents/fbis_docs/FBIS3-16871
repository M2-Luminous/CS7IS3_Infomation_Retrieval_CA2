Although the primary cause of the plane crash is not definitely clear yet and the state authorities are waiting for the investigation results from the dispatched group, agency reports and statements by local authorities indicate that it is likely that the plane crashed after being hit by a rocket. According to a Central News Unit report, official Azeri authorities say that the Iranian C-130 was downed by Armenian anti-aircraft artillery positioned in the Khankendi area, which is a disputed area in Karabakh. Nevertheless, those reports have been rejected by Armenian authorities. Our correspondent has been informed by an aviation expert that the Iranian captain had established contact with the Yerevan airport, but the contact was unsuccessful. The captain had also made contact with a Russian aircraft flying in the vicinity in order to coordinate with the airport with his assistance. The aviation experts believe it is unlikely that the C-130 plane crashed as a result of a technical fault.
