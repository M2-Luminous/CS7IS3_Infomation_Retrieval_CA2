A spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in Ankara on 27 June that "Turkey is disappointed at the fact that the demonstration was changed into an action of a terrorist organization." Turkey did not understand that following the ban on the PKK in Germany, the flags of the PKK and photos of its leader, Abdullah Ocalan, could have been shown unhindered in a demonstration against Turkey, he said. "We do not want a terrorist organization to be encouraged to carry out new acts of violence, because the ban imposed upon them has been watered down. That is why we will lodge complaints with German authorities in Ankara, Bonn, and Frankfurt in the next few days," the spokesman said. The PKK has for 10 years waged a guerrilla war against Turkey for an independent Kurdistan, which has claimed more than 12,000 lives. It is also held responsible for the increasing bomb terror in Turkish holiday resorts.
