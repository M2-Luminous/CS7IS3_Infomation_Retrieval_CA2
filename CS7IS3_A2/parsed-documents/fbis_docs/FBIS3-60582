And although at present they have no flight missions, specialists believe that combat use of such missiles is quite possible. For this to happen it is enough for strategic bombers to deliver them to an enemy's territory and carry out emergency dropping. There will be no "classic" nuclear explosion but the radioactive pollution of the territory will be almost the same as with one. The probability of such a dangerous course of events is discussed by Major General Vitaliy Yakovlev, deputy chief of staff of the Russian Defense Ministry's Main Directorate, in a talk with MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI's correspondent. [Zhilin] There has been much controversy over the Ukrainian nuclear charges. What can you say about this as a specialist? [Yakovlev] Nothing reassuring. Today there are approximately 2,000 nuclear charges in Ukraine. Their technical condition can no longer be called satisfactory. Their warrantee service life is not more than six years, and some it is already running out. This calls for constant attention by maintenance and service personnel. In particular it is necessary to replace the obsolete components with new ones, which Ukraine does not have. [Zhilin] But the Ukrainian nuclear warheads are serviced by Russian specialists. [Yakovlev] Were serviced. After the Ukrainian parliament legitimized its ownership of the nuclear weapons and its defense minister issued orders to place the so-called S-type installations under his control, the Russian Defense Ministry lost the possibility to monitor the condition of the nuclear ammunition. There are no more Russian military units there. In other words, Russia can no longer be responsible for nuclear security on Ukraine's territory, while the latter for its part is incapable of ensuring nuclear security in handling these charges. [Zhilin] What specific dangers does this involve? [Yakovlev] Even the chief designers will not answer this question accurately. Nuclear charges whose service life has expired may not be safe to dismantle. Neither scientific research nor practical tests have been conducted on this count. No one could even expect such circumstances to arise. In the current year designers and our specialists have visited a nuclear ammunition depot in Pervomaysk. The warheads there have begun to "run a high temperature." The reason is violation of the storage conditions. In particular there were eight times as many warheads in the storage as is allowed by the rules. The chief designers in their report insisted that all them be urgently sent for destruction. But the Ukrainian side did not agree. It should be noted here that the rules for storing nuclear weapons are being breached not only in Pervomaysk. [Zhilin] If the expired service life makes the dismantling of nuclear warheads so dangerous, why then should Russia do it? [Yakovlev] This is exactly what we have been talking about with our Ukrainian colleagues. If all the agreements on destroying the Ukrainian nuclear weapons concluded in Massandra are thwarted and the guaranteed service life expires, it is not ruled out that Russian enterprises may refuse to process the warheads. [Zhilin] Does Russia supply components to replace the old ones on Ukrainian nuclear warheads? [Yakovlev] Russia will supply them if Ukraine strictly adheres to the Massandra agreements. [Zhilin] Can Ukraine use the nuclear forces for military purposes? [Yakovlev] Last May part of the strategic bombers and also nuclear technical units operating approximately 600 air-based strategic nuclear charges swore the Ukrainian oath of allegiance. This means that Ukraine became potentially capable of using air nuclear weapons. True, to this end it has to resolve a number of technical problems. But as radiological weapons these charges can be used already now. [Zhilin] What is the way out then? [Yakovlev] There is only one: observance of the Massandra agreements. The Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic Energy is ready to dismantle all the nuclear charges stationed in Ukraine within 24 months. [Zhilin] Can a situation arise wherein the nuclear warhead will "go" from Ukraine's territory to other countries? [Yakovlev] I would like to stress once again that Russia does not control the condition and maintenance of these charges. In other words, should this happen, we may not even know about it. These are dangerous games fraught with a terrible disaster. I am saying this not as a politician but as a specialist on nuclear weapons.
