CONTENTS: 1. Popular, Student Demonstrations Condemn Hebron Massacre 2. Lawyers Association, Professional Unions Urge Boycott, Reject Normalization 3. Information Says IDF Chiefs Preplanned Massacre 4. Islamic Group Claims Operations To Avenge Massacre 5. Party Secretary Expects Islamic Victory Against Injustice, Rulers' Corruption POPULAR, STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS CONDEMN HEBRON MASSACRE The 4 March edition of AL-SHA'B, mouthpiece of the opposition Labor Party, is almost entirely devoted to local reaction to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. A 1,000-word report on page 1 by 'Abd-al-Rahman Isma'il and Mu'tazz al-Hadidi gives a detailed account of the "massive demonstration" involving tens of thousands of members of the Islamic current in al-Tahrir Square in central Cairo on 3 March. The report notes that demonstrators burned the Israeli flag, condemned the "Zionists," called on the government to expel the Israeli ambassador, close the Embassy, and abrogate the Camp David Accord, and urged Arab rulers to stop dealing with "Zionists." The report also notes that demonstrators hurled stones at the police, who were ordered to "fire live and rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse demonstrators." The security forces arrested hundreds and attacked citizens brutally with clubs, according to the report. Under the headline "Week of Anger in Egypt," a page 2 feature carries several reports on popular and student demonstrations and rallies criticizing the "slack Egyptian and Arab official stance on the Hebron massacre," and calling for closing the "Zionist" embassy. A feature entitled "Revenge on the Zionists Is a pan-Arab and Islamic Duty" appears on pages 4-5, including more reports of a week of demonstrations at the universities of Cairo, Alexandria, 'Ayn Shams, al-Azhar, and Hulwan and several other reports about popular rallies to support the massacre victims and denounce such crimes. LAWYERS ASSOCIATION, PROFESSIONAL UNIONS URGE BOYCOTT, REJECT NORMALIZATION On page 11, the paper publishes a boxed 150-word "statement by the Lawyers Association," which calls on Arab and Islamic states to "adopt a unified stance and demand international protection for the Palestinian people." The statement calls on Arab states to withdraw from the peace talks now that the incident has uncovered "the aggressive nature of the Israeli Government and people and proved that Israel is not serious about seeking peace." The statement also appeals to Arab and Islamic states to "stand firmly against the normalization process with Israel and to stop all kinds of dealings with it." Page 12 features a framed 200-word statement by "The coordination Committee of the Egyptian Professional Unions," which urges Arab and Islamic states to "maintain the full boycott of the usurping Zionist enemy" and "reject all forms of normalization." The statement calls on the Egyptian Government to "expel the Zionist ambassador and close the embassy of the criminal Jews." It calls on the PLO and Arab governments to withdraw immediately from the "farcical talks that are led by the United States, the major supporter of Zionist terrorism." INFORMATION SAYS IDF CHIEFS PLANNED MASSACRE A 200-word report by Mahmud Bakri on page 3 cites "information" obtained by the paper that Israeli Army chiefs planned the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. ISLAMIC GROUP CLAIMS OPERATIONS TO AVENGE MASSACRE A 100-word report on page 7 cites an Islamic Group statement claiming responsibility for detonations in retaliation for the Hebron massacre. PARTY SECRETARY EXPECTS ISLAMIC VICTORY AGAINST INJUSTICE, RULERS' CORRUPTION In a 4,000-word article on page 2, Labor Party Secretary General 'Adil Husayn writes that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is a warning to every Arab and Muslim that "Israel does not develop missiles and nuclear bombs to use against Palestinians in the territories, but to threaten the Arab nation, particularly Egypt, if they dare disobey the orders or raise their heads in pride." Addressing the United States, Husayn says: "We will not be fooled by your denunciations, even if the Security Council issues a strongly worded resolution condemning the enemy (it will not do), because words are no longer enough." He warns "our corrupt rulers" that the United States will not save them if the masses decide to punish and overthrow them, noting that popular demonstrations prove that "Egypt will not lead the march of capitulation" and that it will continue to be "the fort of the Arabs and Muslims." Husayn refutes the view that the world has joined forces against Islam and Muslims because, according to him, that view prevailed "in the first spell of dizziness after the sudden, thunderous collapse of the Soviet bloc." Things are different today and will keep changing daily, because yesterday's allies of the Western bloc are no longer a bloc, he says. He contends that Europe is breaking away from the United States, thus speeding up NATO's collapse; that an economic war is raging between the United States and Japan; that China is becoming a great economic power and enhancing its nuclear power; that India is developing militarily and economically; and that Russia will not be in chaos forever and that its crises might prompt it to take a more hostile attitude toward the United States. He concludes that the American dream of power has been shattered. He maintains that of all regions, the Arab region is the one surrounded by the Americans, who want to display their might and support the Zionist expansionist plan. He attributes this desire to God almighty's will ruling that "oil will be an Islamic product." Apart from Venezuela, all OPEC states are Muslim. Major non-OPEC reserves are in Somalia and the Muslim republics that belonged to the Soviet Union. And Chinese oil is concentrated in a region inhabited by Muslims, he explains. Admitting that oil is a vital strategic product and that whoever controls its output can control the world, he says that the Islamic states' monopoly of oil can turn them into a very influential political power. That is why major states try to avert this eventuality. The United States wants to monopolize Arab oil to control Europe and Japan's supply and thus subjugate these states as it pillages Arab wealth, Husayn claims. With oil, we can join the ranks of major states and mobilize billions of oppressed people for the Islamic awakening, he says. Claiming the existence of a battle between Islam as a religion and civilization and the secularist, materialist West, Husayn says that Islam is "the right alternative, maintaining the balance between the materialist and the immaterialist and providing the solution for all mankind's suffering under Western control." Reminding readers of the establishment of the Islamic state in Iran and Sudan, of Iraq's "steady development into a regime that is fully bound by Islamic shari'ah," and of events in Algeria, he says he sees a "belt of struggling Islamic states extending from the Arab Maghreb to Sudan and Somalia, then to Iraq and Iran, at the core of the Gulf and its oil." He notes that the "Islamic states' belt will not relinquish Palestine or Jerusalem once it expands." Turning to Egypt, Husayn asserts that the people are fighting courageously under the Islamic banner. "Despite years of misleading campaigns, the youths have proven in their recent rallies and demonstrations that they firmly reject plans of capitulation to the U.S.-Zionist alliance," he says. He adds: "The coming stage will witness an escalation of rejection and resistance." Addressing the ruling group, he states that the masses will not be deceived by the denunciation of the crime in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. He assails the leadership, asking: What use is denunciation when it was you who led us to the current state? "We will not denounce with statements, but with organized action that removes you from your posts so that a new faithful, courageous, and clean government can rise and join the mujahidin in the Arab and Muslim nation," he says, adding: This will happen when we wrestle our right to hold free elections that will bring you down.
