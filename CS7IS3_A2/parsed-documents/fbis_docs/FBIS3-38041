For almost eight years, the person in charge of counterintelligence against the Soviet KGB was passing his country's topmost secrets to his Moscow masters -- for which he received from them more than $1.5 million. Although on the previous evening, this prime news item did not leave the television screens, and the life of the married couple, in which not only the husband but also the wife were CIA staffers, had been subjected to thorough and almost month-by-month analysis, something substantial was added Wednesday. Citing official sources, radio stations reported that Aldrich Ames' activity had led, in particular, to the tragic deaths not so long ago of two Russian citizens who were CIA agents working for the United States. They were executed for treason -- without trial or investigation. The U.S. President repeated once again that he regards this as a very serious case and that the scale of the damage to the government is not yet clear, although it is already known to be great. Clinton said that he has not spoken about this with Russian President B. Yeltsin, so as to give the Russian authorities time to consider an official response. According to B. Clinton's statements, the special feature of the case consists in the fact that it is a question not of an "ordinary spy" but of a CIA veteran with 31 years' service. It was possible to understand from the President's retort that recruitment of a high official is a violation of certain accords. The fact that there have been accords of this kind between the two governments is indirectly borne out by the fact that over the past two years quite a few U.S. counterintelligence staffers have been moved to the sphere of combating drugs, including A. Ames himself. It was possible to conclude from the comments of one former State Department staffer that the Russians had promised at a high level -- if not the presidential level, then very close to it -- to change the rules of the game and to get away from the usual espionage of the "Cold War" style. And now this turn of events.... President Clinton said at the news conference that there are at least two reasons to demand appropriate actions from Russia. The first is already known -- the recruitment of a high official. The President said of the second reason only that he cannot speak of it yet, but he will when the time comes. U.S. Secretary of State W. Christopher, who usually treads delicately and avoids harsh statements, endeavored to appear as fierce as possible when he maintained that the United States will never be able to reconcile itself to "this way of acting by Russia." In the absence of the ambassador (V. Lukin quit this post after being elected to that of chairman of a Duma committee, and Yu. Vorontsov has not yet completed the thorny path of being confirmed), the young diplomat V.I. Chkhikvishvili, Russian charge d'affaires ad interim, is being summoned to the State Department several times a day. Jim Collins, an expert on Russia and the former No. 2 man at the U.S. Embassy on Ulitsa Chaykovskogo, has insistently recommended, so certain sources maintain, that Moscow refrain from the traditional countermeasure -- the expulsion of their present CIA resident agent. Moreover, it is proposed that Russian intelligence voluntarily recall or "call to order" those of its staffers who had contacts with Aldrich Ames "under diploamtic cover." One high-ranking State Department staffer said: Immediate and voluntary "special steps by Russia" will make it possible to avoid the serious threat hanging over bilateral relations. Commentators point out, however, that "the sunny relationship between Bill and Boris has receded into the Bosnian shade." Clinton himself, however carefully he chose his terms, made a very transparent allusion to the likelihood of a revision of "the whole policy (with regard to Yeltsin) which we have long followed." The U.S. mass media regard the Duma's proclaimed pardon for the participants in two procommunist actions as a threat to Yeltsin and the reform process. This eases the bitterness somewhat and elicits some sympathy with the Russian president. The opposition in Congress, however, is stepping up pressure on the administration. Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, has accused Clinton of placating the Kremlin for too long. Senator DeConcini, who once advocated giving Russia broad assistance, has now abruptly changed his stance. Why is it that we Americans are indignant at Russia and are threatening to stop aid if we ourselves are doing the same thing against them? This question was asked over the telephone by a viewer of an evening television program entirely devoted to examining Mr. and Mrs. Ames. The commentator's reply, which followed at once, reflects the views of very many people in the United States. The gist of it was that the Russians are making fools of the Americans and abusing their kindness. By allocating billions in aid for Russia the United States is, as it were, paying for Russian espionage against itself and maintaining traitors with taxpayers' money. Aldrich Ames and his wife, who appeared before a judge Tuesday, have not repented or asked for leniency. Maria, the 41-year-old wife of the former leader of counterintelligence directed against the USSR, comes from a well-off family. The Ames' attorneys will most likely ascribe the large purchases, which are far in excess of what a cadre CIA staffer can afford on his wages, to her family means. Neither A. Ames' place of birth nor the educational institution from which he graduated have yet been divulged by the CIA leadership. But Aldrich's father is known also to have worked for this department and also been an intelligence officer but, unlike his son, to have been a "good guy." U.S. officials and mass media are accusing Russian television and newspapers of concealing from the Russian public the seriousness of this case and the arguments of the U.S. Administration. If the charge against the Ames is corroborated in court, they are both threatened with life imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
