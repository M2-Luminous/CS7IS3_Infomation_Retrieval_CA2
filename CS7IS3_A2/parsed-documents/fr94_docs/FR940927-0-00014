FR940927-0-00014 FR940927-0-00002 (3) One comment stated that it is hard to understand why the written agreement deadline is 15 days prior to the time a producer has to purchase coverage and that a more appropriate date should be established. The comment also stated that the sales closing dates are not listed in the proposed crop provisions. If these are to be the same dates as the cancellation and termination dates, the policy should so indicate. Response: The proposed definition was intended to require that requests for written agreements be made far enough ahead of the sales closing date to allow the insurer to make the offer, and the insured to accept the offer, by the sales closing date. Since the insurance policy is a written contract, both parties must have a meeting of the minds before the contract is valid. The terms and conditions of the policy must be known by the final date for establishing the insurance contract. In this program, the final date is the sales closing date. FCIC has determined that some situations may allow written agreements at other times. FCIC is preparing proposed written agreement regulations which will specify when written agreements must be completed. Until these regulations have been published, the written agreement must be completed by the sale closing date, or, in specific instances, a written agreement may be requested or approved after the sales closing date if the crop is physically inspected and a determination made that the crop has an expectancy of making the guaranteed yield. No prevented planting liability will be established as a result of any request submitted after the sales closing date. FCIC does not agree that the final sentence should be deleted. Specifying all variable terms in the written agreement is necessary to assure a clear understanding of the terms in effect. Although the sales closing dates normally will be the same as the cancellation and termination dates, this is not always the case. Therefore, the sales closing dates will not be included in the crop provisions. Federal regulations authorize the Manager of FCIC to extend the sales closing date in any county upon the Manager's determination that no adverse selection will result during the extended period. The extended date is placed on file in the applicable service offices and a notice is placed in the Federal Register . If the sales closing dates were contained in the crop provisions, the crop provisions would need to be amended each time a sales closing date is extended. Comment: One comment stated that unit division language contained in subsection 2.(b) should allow for situations where the insured creates a discernible break by some tillage operation. The proposed provision states that the insured must plant the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundaries of each optional unit. There is no required method of creating a boundary as long as a discernible break is provided. Response: The intent of the policy language is to allow separate optional units if acreage is farmed separately. Farming separately includes planting separately and keeping separate records of inputs, production, etc. Creating a boundary after the crop is planted by means of a tillage operation along a section line may or may not meet the policy requirement of planting the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernable break at the units boundary. FCIC believes the present language clearly sets out the requirements for unit division. Comment: One comment stated that subsection 3.(b) requires the application to be revised when corn is harvested in a manner other than reported, and that procedure should indicate how this revision is to be made. Response: Language in subsection 3.(b) does not require the application to be revised to elect a price election for the method of harvest (grain/silage) when the insured did not select an appropriate price election. The price specified in this provision will only be used to establish ``the dollar amount of production to count for indemnity purposes.'' If an insured only selected a grain price election and reported the acreage as intended for harvest as grain, but harvested the acreage for silage, the amount of insurance is determined by multiplying the production guarantee for grain by the price election selected by the insured for grain. The value of any silage production is determined by multiplying the number of tons of silage to count by a price that bears the same relationship to the maximum silage price election as the selected price for grain does to the maximum grain price. FCIC has amended this subsection to clarify that this price is assigned by us only for the purpose of determining the dollar value of production to count for indemnity purposes and will not affect the premium or amount of insurance. Comment: One comment assumed that since cancellation and termination dates were changed, that the sales closing dates will be changed to align with the new cancellation and termination dates. Response: The sales closing dates as contained in the Special Provisions will be changed generally to be the same as, but no later than, the new cancellation and termination dates.
