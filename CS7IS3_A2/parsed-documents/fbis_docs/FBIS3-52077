Vice Presidents and board secretaries; honorable deputies; Madame Foreign Minister of Colombia; members of the government cabinet; members of the diplomatic corps; Salvadoran friends: It is a source of great satisfaction for me to stand here today before the Salvadoran Legislative Assembly, the forum par excellence of Salvadoran democracy. I have spent a major part of my public life within the rooms of the Colombian Congress. Many of the ideas and plans that have inspired my administration were conceived during fruitful debates, harsh controversies, nights and days of full devotion to the noble task of legislating. I have also suffered defeats; who hasn't? Defeat in the legislature, hammer pounding an anvil, does not leave wounds, however, but forges and strengthens democratic convictions. In these times, when it has become so common to say that legislatures are inefficient, archaic, and even unnecessary, when authoritarian forces frequently blame deputies and congressmen for all the ills that governments have been unable to resolve, I must reiterate my faith in the validity of Congress as an irreplaceable expression of popular will. I want you to know that here, among you, I somehow feel that I am among colleagues. Last night, during a dinner in my honor hosted by President Cristiani, I had the opportunity to praise the Salvadoran peace process. There is no question that the end of the Cold War has made peace possible in many places, because the people who encouraged war and who with their hatred fed rivalries among brothers were suddenly left without a purpose. Justifications for arming insurgents, supporting tyrants, denying freedom, and preventing coexistence ended, and an era of hope thus began for our America. Peace in El Salvador would not have been possible without the iron will of the conflicting sides, who were able to look beyond themselves to discover what the future held for the good, hardworking people of this country, the peace of mind and prosperity they deserved for a thousand reasons and which for such a long time had been denied them. The peace all of you fought so hard to achieve is an example that shows the world that reconciliation is possible if men undertake to achieve it without revanchist designs. This is perhaps the most visible success we have witnessed in the area of peace during these post-Cold War times. Undoubtedly, our region is undergoing a crucial period, and in the days that lie ahead we will have to make important decisions that will test our character and vision of the future. I will not punish you today with an endless speech. I would like instead to share with you some of my thoughts concerning those issues which, in my opinion, will be among the major issues on the hemisphere's political agenda over the next few years. Among these are free trade, reformation and modernization of the state, and the defense, strengthening, and consolidation of democracy. A few weeks ago our countries experienced considerable uncertainty, because, on one hand, the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement was unclear, and on the other hand the final result of the GATT Uruguay Round was still a mystery. Today, fortunately, the panorama is much clearer; NAFTA's approval has renewed our hopes for the creation sooner or later of a hemispheric free trade zone, while the culmination of the Uruguay Round not only guarantees the existence of the multilateral trade system but provides the necessary confidence and stability for the world economy to advance toward its definitive recovery. For our countries, which have believed in the goodness of free trade and have thus struggled so much for its enforcement, NAFTA is the best proof that we are capable of reading the future and that we have managed to figure out the true signs of the times from our history books. Free trade is the best way to achieve economic growth and greater well-being for our people. I have personally studied all the integration processes under way on this continent: NAFTA, the Group of Three, the Central American Common Market, the Caribbean Common Market, the Andean Pact, the South American Common Market, and bilateral processes. These are efforts that truly lead to the common objective of building a great hemispheric free trade zone. All of us have noted how Latin America has been for several years involved in aggressive policies for the opening, modernization, and internationalization of their economies, increasingly betting on the benefits that the promotion of the private sector, free trade, competition, productivity, and efficiency offer. In this regard, to mention the Colombian case, in only three years we have made significant progress on many fronts. The opening of our economy, by changing our former closed economic model to one open to the world, was a result of the decline of the model that called for the substitution of imports. This opening took place in a context different from that of our neighbors. Our decisions were not the result of a crisis or of an imposition. Our economy is the one that grew the most from 1980 to 1990. We knew, however, that to grow more rapidly and to eliminate poverty in Colombia in a few years, it was necessary to integrate our economy to the global economy, to open markets for our export products, to compete, to open up to foreign investments, and to create conditions to encourage private local investments. We reduced our customs and we adopted competitive labor laws and foreign investment programs. The results have been satisfactory. We have diversified and expanded our exports, diminished inflation, reduced unemployment by 15 percent in the past four months, and increased our economic growth to levels above the 5 percent level. We have adopted an aggressive commercial policy that has yielded integration with Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia in the framework of the revitalization of the Andean Pact; we signed a trade agreement with Chile; concluded the Group of Three negotiations; and have made much progress in the negotiations for trade agreements with Caricom and the Central American Common Market. I have said that we are prepared to reach with these two markets a two-way trade agreement that should mirror the various economic development levels. This is usually called asymmetrical relations. There is no better opportunity than this one, here, in El Salvador, to reiterate our political will and to ask the Central American authorities to do so too in order to work jointly to turn dreams of a great trade treaty between Colombia, Venezuela, and the Central American common market into a reality to encourage a new flux of trade and productive investments for the benefit of our nations. Much political will and a true commitment by all the countries of this hemisphere will be necessary to give form to the puzzle of a single market from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. This is why I believe that in the next few months, the continent must work to secure and recreate the integration processes for the purpose, as I have said, bringing about a grand hemispheric free trade zone. This requires that our governments and the international organizations to which we belong act vigorously and decisively to turn what now appears an option we cannot ignore into a tangible reality. Preliminary studies indicate that with the culmination of the GATT Uruguay Round and the World Trade Organization round, global trade will increase rapidly at an annual rate of 6 percent, approximately $200 billion annually. Our challenge is to take advantage, as much as possible, of this increase so that our countries, which belong to what is nowadays viewed as the world's second most dynamic region in the field of economic development -- second only to Asian South Pacific -- may secure greater participation in world trade. I am sure that we can attain higher achievements unitedly rather than separately and that any increase in participation in global trade will bring social and economic benefits to our people in the form of jobs and new investment opportunities. However, the truth is that this is only one of the basic aspects our continent will have to face in the coming days and months now that virtually all countries in the area have agreed on an economic liberalization, which guarantees greater growth; winds of commercial opening blowing from north to south; and there is a relative consensus regarding the role the private sectors of our countries will play in the struggle for development and so on. Now that there is striking clarity on the benefits of the market, Latin American politicians cannot continue forever to discuss topics of which we are already aware. When I refer to the pivotal role of the market, I want to clarify that it is not that I am downgrading the central role of the state. On the contrary, I want to emphasize that as it happens in a game of cards, once the moment of shuffling and dealing comes along, some cards will go to the market and others to the state. In our countries, we should make sure that these cards are divided fairly because a state without a market generates inefficiencies while a market without a state results in inequality. We know that market laws are unable to solve the many problems that still affect our society such as extreme poverty, class divisions, and lack of opportunities. Consequently, we need a strong state, that will not only control, on behalf of the public interest, what takes place in the market, but that will also lead a strong investment initiative to generate human resources, that is, to invest in our people. It is fair to recognize that our states still need to become more efficient and competitive so as to strengthen the democracies of the area. To enable our democracies to face successfully the challenge of promoting an egalitarian social development, it is necessary for states to modernize and for the way politics is conducted to be changed.
