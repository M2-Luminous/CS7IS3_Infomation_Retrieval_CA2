Ulundi, Durban and Maritzburg are being considered. Premier Frank Mdlalose says the members of the provincial legislature should decide the issue -- but his decision to hold the next cabinet meeting in Ulundi has been interpreted as indicating his own preference. ANC officials have objected to Ulundi, saying they would not be safe there. ANC provincial cabinet minister S'bu Ndebele said it would not make sense to travel for six hours to attend cabinet meetings in Ulundi. The notorious road and bad phone connections are further obstacles to making Ulundi the capital, say critics.
