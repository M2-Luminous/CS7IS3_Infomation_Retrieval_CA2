It asks if the UN Charter has been amended to bless aggression against nations and human rights violations and reward aggressors. In its editorial today, the newspaper says that the United Nations, the Security Council, and the major powers are adopting an unbelievable position and that the massacres inflicted on the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina over the past two years reveal that the international organization established in 1945 to defend security and prevent aggression is now only a scarecrow, like that which farmers set up to scare off crows. The paper urges the Islamic countries not to remain spectators to this tragedy. The blood of a Muslim nation is being shed and its territory has become a human slaughterhouse.
