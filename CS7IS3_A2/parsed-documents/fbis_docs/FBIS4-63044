"The state programme of arms production and export needs a serious revision for the benefit of producers", he stressed. According to Soskovets, there is "an abyss of misunderstanding" between arms producers and exporters and suggested to grant the producers "certain rights in selling their products independently". "It is hard to explain to directors of defence enterprises which are the property of the state why the problem of financing is so acute in the industry when only one of the enterprises has in its warehouse submachine guns worth 200 million dollars and there is a big demand for them in the world", Soskovets said after returning from the Republic of Chuvashia where he visited defence enterprises.
