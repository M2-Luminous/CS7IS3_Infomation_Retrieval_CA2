During the news conference at the cabinet of minister he said that "Anta has commited a number of inaccuracies which cannot be made good by any other means". The resignation of the president's press secretary is directly linked with her comments in the telephone interview to Martins Kibilds, a reporter of the daily "DIENA". He asked Busa to comment on president's response to the protest voiced by the Latvian Russian-language press due to the fact that the President Guntis Ulmanis had donated to the Latvian schools books by Adolfs Silde. It turned out that during the Nazi occupation Silde had published anti-semitic articles hailing the massacres of Jews. The answer Kibilds got from the press secretary was the following exclamation: "It would be better if the Jews could finally leave us alone. We have trembled and knelt before them long enough. It should be stopped once and for all." In the interview to the Latvian Radio Busa said that she was forced to tender her resignation because the ruling party, the Latvian Way, was worried about her influence on the president as well as the increasing role of the president in the political life of Latvia. Busa said that her persecution was inspired directly by the Minister of Special Tasks Edvins Inkens. Inkens in his turn remarked that none of the ministers would be able to interview as Busa had said.
