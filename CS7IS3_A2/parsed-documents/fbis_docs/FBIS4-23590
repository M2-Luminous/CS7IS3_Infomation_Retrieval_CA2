The chief of general staff, Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya, stated this in Lagos. Gen. Diya maintained that the law would deal ruthlessly with persons agitating for open rebellion against the government. He therefore asked pressure groups and agitators for the installation of any person they conceive as the winner of the June 12 election to refrain from such acts, in the interest of the nation. The chief of general staff reminded such political activists and social critics that the annulled June 12 election was now history.
