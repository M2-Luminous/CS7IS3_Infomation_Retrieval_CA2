The business community, after closely watching the inter-Korean contacts on exchanging special envoys in the expectation that they might pave the way for cross-border establishment of economic offices or trade representatives, was deeply disappointed at the rupture. Large enterprises including Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo and Sunkyung as well as many small- and medium-sized businesses have already formed task forces to prepare for economic links with Pyongyang and have worked for more than a year to realize actural cooperation including joint investment in the North. However, their efforts are unlikely to bear fruit for now after northern delegates unexpectedly walked out of the inter-Korean contact and in light of the South's quick shift to a hard-line policy. One source said, "the large enterprises are expected to continue their processing-on-commission trade with the North for the time being through third countries, including China and Hong Kong." Processing-on-commission trade involves South Korean businesses providing raw materials or half-finished goods to the North and later importing finished goods through third countries. But even this kind of trade may decrease with the deterioration of inter-Korean relations, the sources expected.
