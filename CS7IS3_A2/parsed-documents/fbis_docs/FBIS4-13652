The Central Committee members' escorts who were outside the meeting room heard the heated debates and arguments between Hani al-Hasan on the one hand and Ahmad Quray' (Abu-'Ala'), Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), and Hakam Bal'awi on the other. The sources said that Abu-'Ala', director of the PLO Economic Department and head of the Palestinian delegation to the Paris economic negotiations with Israel, lost his nerve, became angry, and threatened not to go back to Paris. He violently threw the file of the Palestinian-Israeli economic negotiations on the table as an indication of his refusal to follow up this issue. According to the same sources, a dispute raged between al-Hasan and Quray' after the latter delivered the report on the Paris negotiations and the economic situation, stressing the importance of the achievements he had made. Al-Hasan's protest was at the fact that this report was delivered verbally in a few minutes. He pointed out that the head of the Israeli delegation to the Paris negotiations "held a television seminar one day before our meeting during which he briefed the Israelis on the content of the Paris negotiations, highlighting the economic and political achievements made by the Israeli side, especially with regard to issuing a Palestinian currency, part of whose reserve would be deposited in the Israeli Central Bank." Al-Hasan said that "this very serious issue should not be discussed in such a manner. The economic agreement with all its stipulations should be put on the table and distributed to Fatah Central Committee members in order to study it clause by clause." Asked about his opinion of the economic agreement being prepared in Paris, he said: "The intifadah aimed to sever the economic link and demographic coexistence between the Israelis and the Palestinians, while the economic agreement aims to link the Palestinian economy with the Israeli economy." In his remarks to Central Committee members, al-Hasan said: "Based on the theory `tell me what your economy is, and I will tell you what your policy is,' instead of the present transitional phase resulting in the handover of the land and economy, the economic linkage means that at the end of the transitional phase there will be no independence, but, rather, a Palestinian entity within an Israeli framework."
