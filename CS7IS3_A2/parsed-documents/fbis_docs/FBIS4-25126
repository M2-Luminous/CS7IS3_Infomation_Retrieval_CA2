NATO was not willing to compromise and so the two sides laid aside the issue of signing the "plan" once more. NATO's "partnership for peace plan" was put forward in January this year. To date, 18 East European countries, countries separated from the former Soviet Union, and neutral countries of Europe have signed the "plan" with NATO and five of the partners have submitted "memoranda of cooperation" to NATO. The "Partnership for Peace Plan Coordination Group" formed by military officers of the partnership states was set up at NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe on 18 April, the liaison group will start work at NATO headquarters on 3 June, and the partnership states will carry out joint military exercises in the next few months. The implementation of the "partnership for peace plan" will undoubtedly strengthen NATO's position and role in modeling a new pattern for the future security of Europe. However, the plan has also met many problems: a crisis of confidence in the "plan" among East European countries; different views among NATO member states, difficulties in raising the large amount of funds needed for the implementation of the plan, and so on. However, the greatest difficulty is how Russia should join the "partnership for peace." Since the beginning of this year, many negotiations on Russia joining the "plan" have been held within NATO and between NATO and Russia. Russia has changed its position on several occasions and this has greatly troubled NATO. The two sides have reached an impasse on the issue of a "special relationship." In the beginning, Russia adopted an attitude of opposing the "plan" and later expressed on 21 April its willingness to sign the "plan" with NATO under the condition that NATO should give Russia the "status of a special partnership state." Because NATO did not agree to meet Russia's demand and other factors, Russia did not sign as scheduled. In addition, Russia also formulated a "document on cooperation projects" which it intended to sign with NATO. The document demands that NATO should inform Russia about bilateral activities with other partnership states and that should NATO take any action which involves the security and interests of Russia or other members of the CIS, it first obtains the agreement of Russia, and Russia may carry out joint exercises with NATO within the scope of peace-keeping and other humanitarian activities, but will not cooperate with NATO in the formulation of military strategies, defense budgets, the modernization and standardization of weapons, training of military officers, and so on. On 6 May, Grachev announced in Moscow that Russia had drafted new ideas on the "partnership for peace" concerning the security of Europe which would enable Russia to "play its role in the establishment of a collective security structure in Europe." It appears that the main considerations which have caused Russia to change its attitude of opposing the "plan" to joining it on certain conditions are as follows: The first is to avoid being isolated and to maintain a distance in relations between NATO and the countries of central and Eastern Europe. The second is to try to establish a special relationship with NATO, to jointly manage the countries of central and Eastern Europe with NATO, and to gradually turn NATO's plan into Russia's strategic idea of a "pan-European partnership relationship" so that Russia can play a greater role in any European security system in the future. The third is to alleviate differences and contradictions on this issue within Russia. At present, NATO can be said to be in a dilemma. On the one hand, NATO knows full well that it is impossible to stabilize security in Europe without Russia, and it therefore hopes Russia will join the "plan." This would make use of Russia's strength and influence and could also transform and restrain Russia. On the other hand, NATO does not want to give a special position to Russia. Otherwise, other partnership states will be disappointed and dissatisfied. At the same time, NATO wants to prevent Russia from making use of such a special relationship to take an equal footing and to change the original objective of the "plan." At present, people at NATO's highest level are stepping up negotiations with various sides and are striving to reach special cooperation with Russia while not openly recognizing Russia's special position. Since neither NATO nor Russia wants to return to a state of hostility, they may eventually sign the "plan" on the basis of compromise, but this does not mean differences between the two sides will be removed. Cooperating with each other while struggling against each other will be a major characteristics of the "partnership for peace" between NATO and Russia. As for how things develop, the "plan" may be like the Conference on Security and Cooperation of Europe or the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and could become merely nominal. At the least, the original idea of the United States and the NATO states will be changed.
