In the letter, released to the press on Wednesday, he said: "The TAU stresses the fact that failure to accept these demands will result in farmers becoming part of South Africa's problem and not still part of the solution. If farmers are left no other choice they will not hesitate to resist with all means available." Mr Bruwer said it was in the interests of all that Mr Mbeki urgently attend to these facts to work out a peaceful solution. Transvaal farmers had for years played an indispensable role in stabilising rural areas and it was an acknowledged fact the future existence of 60 percent of rural towns was dependent on the farming community, Mr Bruwer said. Farmers had been and still were committed to maintaining peaceful labour relations with the more than seven million black people who worked and lived on farms, he added. The Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Union]-affiliated TAU demanded that farmers' "reasonable demands" which included the recognition and establishment of a volkstaat with self-determination be accommodated. Mr Bruwer said farmers and the ANC had come close to signing an agreement which would have provided for self-determination for Afrikaners in a volkstaat. The agreement, which also provided for blacks remaining in an Afrikaner volkstaat, had been scuttled as a result of the bogged-down trilateral Freedom Alliance/ANC/government talks. Mr Bruwer said he enjoyed good relations with the ANC and liaised personally with Mr Mbeki.
