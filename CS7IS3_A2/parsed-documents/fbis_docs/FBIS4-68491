Yalovenko, chief of the Chelyabinsk Oblast Regional Organization of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia and member of the Central Committee of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia, under the rubric "Point of View": "Elections, After All!"] [Text] The Regulations on Elections in Chelyabinsk Oblast have been confirmed by a decree of the head of the oblast administration. Its main principles differ considerably from the proposals that were developed by a working group under representative of the president V.V. Seleznev consisting of the activists of various parties and movements. The regulations are being vigorously discussed in the local newspaper. An interview with deputy head of the Oblast Administration B.A. Mizrakhi has been published in which he tried to justify individual provisions of the regulations. Notes have been published in which the author scares readers with the strength and cohesion of opposition parties before the election to the oblast duma. All this was preceded by a heated debate and discussions among the representatives of various parties and movements concerning development of the draft regulations on the duma itself. Surprisingly, parties that are absolutely different in terms of their directions found a common language in developing the regulations; mutually satisfactory compromises were found. Parties with a democratic orientation also took part in this: There were representatives of the RDDR [Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms] and the Republican Party. B.A. Mizrakhi also participated. Strangely, following attacks against him, B.A. Mizrakhi by way of justifying himself made the quite strange assertion that proposals for the Regulations on Elections had been developed mainly by the representatives of communist and national-patriotic parties and movements. The very process of the development of proposals for the Regulations on Elections exemplified the fact that the parties can cooperate fruitfully in the oblast duma. Thus, the LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] proposed to insert restrictive requirements for candidates for oblast duma deputy into the Regulations on Elections in terms of age (no younger than 30), educational standard (higher education), specific activities (mostly economists, lawyers, economic managers), and residence (residing in the oblast for no less than five years). Although these requirements were not adopted, the LDPR did agree to compromise proposals that were worked out jointly. It is sad that the oblast administration was not aware or did not wish to be aware of this effort of the parties and movements and did not take into account the jointly developed proposals. It is now becoming clear that the executive authorities cannot and do not want to yield to the representative authorities. The main principles of the Regulations on Elections confirmed by the oblast administration facilitate this. First of all, nomination of candidates by party lists is omitted, and only the majority system is used. So, what is happening: They used to talk about the development of a multiparty system all the time, but after receiving the results of elections by party lists on 12 December 1993, which they (but not everyone else) found strange, they began to talk about parties and movements being underdeveloped here, about their not reflecting the interests of the population. Of course, it might be that the parties with a democratic orientation are weak in our oblast. However, that the parties of an opposition variety are gaining strength is a real fact which neither the administration nor the press rejects. To our mind, this was the only reason for using solely the majority system in the forthcoming elections to the oblast duma. Second, there is the numerical strength of the representative organ. In his interview B.A. Mizrakhi gives examples of the numerical strength of the dumas in various oblasts of Russia while failing to mention the oblasts in which the numerical strength of the duma has been confirmed to be 50 deputies; meanwhile, about one-half of the oblasts are that way. The design in this instance is also clear: The small numerical strength of the duma gives the administration an opportunity to manage it, to make it a "puppet" duma. It is clear to all that the smaller numerical strength of the duma means taking a small number of opinions into account, frequently failing to get a quorum, and having a poor connection between the duma and all strata of the population. After all, even in Tsarist Russia, proportionate numbers of representatives from various social strata--the merchants, the nobility, the craftsmen, the Cossacks, and so on--were elected to the Chelyabinsk Duma. Third, there is the introduction of very stringent requirements for the collection of signatures in favor of nominating a candidate. After all, 4 percent of the total number of voters in the district translates into a number upward of 7,000 signatures. It sufficed to collect 5,000 signatures for nomination even in the election to the State Duma. Of course, it is good for the oblast administration to believe that the traits of a candidate for the oblast duma should be superior to those of our candidates to the State Duma; however, common sense seems to be absent in this instance. After all, collecting this number of signatures will prevent the participation of many knowledgeable, sensible specialists in the election to the oblast duma who are not associated with the executive authorities or parties and movements because the collection of signatures calls for a great organizational effort and considerable financial outlays. It would be interesting to learn what financial outlays are required for this purpose if the press printed the financial reports of contenders for deputy positions in the 12 December 1993 election. Besides, the employees of personnel departments and housing maintenance offices could tell a lot about the collection of signatures in favor of individual candidates for deputies and blocs of parties and movements. It is clear that either candidates with ties to the administration or those abusing their official position in the process will have the advantage. The existence of these "strange" shortcomings in the Regulations on Elections was also noted by our State Duma deputies at a meeting with the TV viewers of the oblast. It is now possible to discuss the shortcomings or virtues of the Regulations on Elections. However, they have been approved and have the force of a local law from which we should proceed. Given that compliance with the law is one of the main principles of the LDPR, the Chelyabinsk Regional Organization of the LDPR will strictly proceed from the approved Regulations on Elections, all their shortcomings notwithstanding. With cooperation from the leading specialists of the oblast, the activists of our LDPR organization have completed the development of an election program of the party for activities in the oblast duma. We expect to make it available for publication in the press shortly. Our aspiration to have a greater number of LDPR members working in the oblast duma is natural. At present the party has at its disposal in Chelyabinsk Oblast skilled economists and lawyers, economic managers and workers, clerical employees, and also representatives of the creative arts intelligentsia, that is, an active contingent that can accomplish a lot in these difficult times in the oblast. Spring is coming, and the time of renewal in nature along with it. We would very much like this to be also springtime in politics, economics, and the social sphere, so that renewal will affect every one of us, so that everyone will perceive the measure of his responsibility for the future and for Russia.
