The balance of payments comprises current transactions (international trade of goods and services) and capital transactions (international trade of securities and debts). To increase foreign-exchange loans for increased corporate investment overseas, the Bank of Korea will improve the terms, including lower interest rates and longer repayment periods than foreign bank loans, Economic Planning Board officials said Tuesday. The introduction of foreign commercial (bank) loans will be limited to those importing equipment needed in infrastructure expansion projects. The settlement period for imports on a deferred payment basis will be extended and the ceiling on export advance receipts will be raised to increase trade on a short-term credit basis, the officials said. To expedite overseas investment, the number of corporations eligible to invest overseas will be increased, restrictions on real estate investment abroad will be eased and support will be given to those investing in agricultural and resources development projects overseas. The number of institutional investors eligible to invest in foreign capital markets will be expanded, along with an increase in their overseas investment ceiling, while the Bank of Korea's swap system, whereby investors buy foreign exchange from the central bank with resale agreement, will be expanded for increased investment in the foreign securities market. In addition, the export-import Bank of Korea's funds supporting exports on a medium- and long-term credit basis will be increased, restrictions on settlement of current transactions in foreign exchange will be eased and rules governing the raising of funds denominated in foreign currencies in the countries where a company operates will be improved to their advantage.
