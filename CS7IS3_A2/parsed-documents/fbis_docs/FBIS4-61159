The committee wants the bill to be considered on Thursday [5 May], said its head Aivars Endzins. After the third reading, the law could take effect 27 or 28 May, Endzins prognosticated. The law would be used to test the alleged KGB collaboration of five MPs, among them Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs and Minister for Special Tasks Edvins Inkens. The committee supplemented the bill with rights for defense lawyer and the order of appeal. If the court finds that the deputies were KGB operatives, their mandates will be nullified and the ruling can be regarded as basis to break work or service relations. The fact that the deputies were mentioned in KGB files alone does not testify about their collaboration because information on results of cooperation is lacking.
