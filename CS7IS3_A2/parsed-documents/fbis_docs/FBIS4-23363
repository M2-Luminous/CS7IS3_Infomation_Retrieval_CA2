Yesterday, you heard the positions of the various political bodies of the country, the [word indistinct] the government coalition, and the opposition coalition. Today, the prime minister disclosed his stand to Marie-Jose Niyonzima. [Begin Kanyenkiko recording] [Words indistinct] soon it will be 10 days since the beginning of talks with all social, political, moral, and socioeconomic forces in order to discuss the best way of establishing the presidential institution. Why is this happening today? It is because all the political, moral, and socioeconomic forces understand that we cannot organize competitive general elections in the entire national territory due to the fact that our country has just experienced a deep crisis. It is therefore impossible to organize such elections. The elections would also require many funds which the country does not have. So, we first gathered suggestions from the moral and socioeconomic forces and today we are at the level of negotiations with political parties. The agenda is, first, to know what the new head of state and his government will implement, and second, to know what the mode for the setting up of the presidential institution will be. That is what I can say. Currently we are holding talks on the two subjects. [passage omitted] [end recording]
