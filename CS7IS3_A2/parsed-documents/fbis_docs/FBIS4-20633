Its mission: The creation of a new industry "vision." Behind this decision is the simmering of fine-ceramics development fever in recent years, prompted in part by the recession. We think a fresh, long-range vision is needed, and applaud the industry's rise to the challenge. The trouble with the industry's original vision goes back to 1989, when, based on a JFCA forecast, Symposium on Basic Problems of Fine Ceramics Industry (advisory body to MITI) predicted the fine-ceramics market would expand to Â¥6 trillion by 2000. Many companies then developed fine ceramics blindly, and forged their strategies around this rosy forecast in the absence of other indicators. Now, four years later, virtually all of these firms have lost sight of the original vision's aims. What has changed in only four years? For one thing, the vision itself was formed during a period of high economic growth which has since subsided considerably. But probably the biggest factor was mistaken judgment. Fine-ceramics makers, in pursuing the materials' excellent properties, were too hasty in assessing the practical-application possibilities within user industries. Any new vision must first start with an explanation from JFCA regarding why the initial approaches failed. This will require an elaborate inquiry in which not only materials suppliers, but also -- from a practical-application standpoint as well -- product makers and component manufacturers should take part. In conducting the inquiry, a one-by-one examination of fine-ceramic materials and components in practical use today is essential for reassessing the industry's true status. The results can then provide companies with uniform-level targets as they restructure their development operations. It is now more than 10 years since the new-materials rage caught on, and those companies with nothing to show for their efforts need a healthy dose of determination to survive the lingering recession. Some in the fields of advanced materials centered on plastics are drastically restructuring, while others are withdrawing or forming alliances with others. A similar trend is taking shape among fine-ceramics makers. Under the circumstances, the new JFCA vision can present valuable guidance for companies revamping their strategies. We look to the vision to provide new ideas to direct them.
