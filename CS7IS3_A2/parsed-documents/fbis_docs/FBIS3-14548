He said "we are now preparing the ground for serious negotiations with Syria." According to the source "the price for peace with Syria is obvious, but there is no point in declaring it before negotiations start." The source said he believes that Israel will reach a peace agreement with Syria this year. In Jerusalem's contacts with Washington, it was suggested that Secretary of State Warren Christopher come to the region prior to the completion of the talks with the Palestinians, participate in the signing ceremony of the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal agreement, and go on to Damascus. In this way, Christopher's trip would symbolize transferring the emphasis in the peace process from the Palestinian track to the Syrian one. Israel expects at this stage additional public moves by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad as an opening to negotiations and in order to help convince public opinion to support an agreement between the two sides. Al-Asad's agreement to renew the talks with Israel, even before the Palestinians announce the resumption of their talks, is seen in Jerusalem as a sign of the Syrian president's seriousness and as a proper response to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remarks on Syria during his recent visit to the United States. Rabin said that "the time has come for painful decisions over Syria. We will agree to do what is required of us if the Syrians do what is required of them." Nevertheless, analysts recently reiterated the evaluation they passed on to the political echelon in Jerusalem that al-Asad will not advance significantly in the peace process with Israel before he is convinced that Israel intends to withdraw from the Golan Heights. Israel hopes that speeding up the talks with the Syrians will also find expression in a change in the negotiating format and character. Israel called on Syria to replace Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, its representative to the negotiations, claiming that its delegate, Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, is a Rabin confidant while al-'Allaf does not have a similar status with al-Asad. Another Israeli request, raised by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres during his recent visit to Washington, was that a peace settlement with Syria lead to peace arrangements with Jordan and Lebanon, and normalization of relations with the other Arab states, except for Libya and Iraq. Israel will not, however, present that as a condition to the Syrians so that the agreement with Damascus will "stand on its own two feet." Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said recently in talks with western sources that Syria opposes a separate agreement with Israel, but will be able to make do with "progress" along the other tracks. Al-Shar' made it clear that Syria will oppose the lifting or easing of the Arab boycott on Israel at the present time. He explained that such an action depended on progress in the peace process and that the Arabs would not give up such an important card at this stage of the negotiations. Syria also ties its participation in the multilateral talks to progress in the bilateral negotiations with Israel.
