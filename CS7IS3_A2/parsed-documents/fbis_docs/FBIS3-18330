Among the best-known personalities excluded are Vittorio Sgarbi, who will however be standing in two other constituencies, and Berlusconi's spokesman Antonio Tajani. Berlusconi has expressed his "great displeasure" at being turned down in Puglia (where he had good hopes), also because, he admits, "this is due to our technical mistake." But at the same time Segni's Pact, already drastically reduced in number, is leaving illustrious victims on the field: In Turin his list will be unable to participate in the proportional vote for the lower house, and for this reason will not include former mayor Giovanna Cattaneo Incisa and Anselmo Zanalda, who was responsible for the reform of the Popular Party. Also out of the running, in the race for the Senate, is the "League for Piedmont" formed from Northern League dissidents. The Communist Renewal also had reason to be displeased: In Eastern Sicily the list headed by Secretary Fausto Bertinotti will not compete for the proportional vote (though Bertinotti himself is also standing in Rome and Turin). In the meantime the League is announcing an appeal to the regional administrative tribunal to have the elections suspended because its appeal against Lazio's exclusion from the list has been rejected, in its view, "without motivation." Forza Italia's failure in Umbria is due to a delay in informing the Interior Ministry of the substitution of one of the persons appointed to file the list with the Court of Appeal. Bitter, because they were convinced they would be readmitted, are the five excluded candidates: Paolo Cicchini, Sergio Filipponi, Lanfranco Rosati, Torquato Terracina, and Francesco Trio. In Puglia, the Forza Italia list was excluded because more than 750 signatures were reported on "irregular" forms, that is on paper on which the National Alliance heading had been struck out by pen and replaced by Forza Italia. In vain, Berlusconi's representative produced new documents which are in order: the Court of Appeal stated that "new documents" had to be "of a clarifying or corrective" nature and not substituting those judged invalid. Sgarbi took the decision philosophically; "the only thing which displeases me is that I will be unable to visit the splendid monuments in Puglia, and then I am a fatalist, and hence I do not hide a little bit of relief." Tajani, too, does not make a drama out of this: "This means that I will carry out better my job as Berlusconi's spokesman," he observed. On the other hand, Nicola Colaianni, PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] deputy and author of the anti-Forza Italia statement, was delighted: "I was sure," she declared, "because the fraud was obvious. There were two witnesses ready to confirm that the signatures had been obtained by the National Alliance and that the correction had been made afterwards. Moreover, this demonstrates that the electoral campaign does not live on advertising spots alone." On the other hand, Berlusconi's list has been readmitted in the Marches, for the uninominal constituencies for the lower house, though candidates must all present themselves under the Forza Italia symbol, whereas candidates from the CCD [Christian Democratic Center], the Sgarbi for Italy list, and from the UDC [Center Union] all disappear. Other persons back again in the lists, apart from Sgarbi (who is also present in Calabria), are neurologist and political commentator Antonio Guidi (a frequent host of the Funari broadcasts of Berlusconi's TV programs), former CNR [National Research Council] Chairman Luigi Rossi Bernardi, and industrialist Stefano Clementoni, known as the "puppet king." In the Marches, on the other hand, appeals were rejected from the three League members Paolini, Tirabassi, and Savarese, as well as from Sassaroli (Pannella list) and Giausa (Communist Renewal). In Trentino Alto Adige four appeals were rejected, and one only accepted, that of the ADA (Autonomous Democratic Aggregation), which had presented too many signatures. The Court of Cassation wisely considered that the decree substantially reducing the number of signatures had been introduced to make life easier for those presenting candidates, and therefore related only to the minimum number. Which is probably also why seven out of the eight lists which failed to make it in Veneto 2 have been reinstated: League, Forza Italia, PSI [Italian Socialist Party], PPI [Italian Popular Party], the Communist Renewal, the Autonomous League, and the Pannella List, whereas the Rete, which had few signatures, has remained outside. In Trentino, on the other hand, appeals by the progressives and the AD [Democratic Alliance] were rejected. For the Democratic Alliance, Marina Salamon has not been allowed onto the proportional list (too few signatures). Nor has progressive Maurizio Zeni, whose certificate of registration in the electoral list arrived too late. Rejected, too, were the appeals by the Pannella List and the liberal nationalists of the Freedom Party [Freiheitliche], as their signatures were presented after the deadline. All the appeals coming from Sardinia were rejected.
