"What Craxi is trying to do," Occhetto continued, "is harm the PDS and its leadership group. I solemnly declare here and now that we feel united by this charge brought by someone who is seeking to lay obstacles and traps in the path of justice. In the presence of this blackguardly and clumsy initiative, let it be known that the position of all the comrades slandered by Craxi -- from Occhetto to D'Alema, Stefanini, and the rest -- is the same. It is the position of someone who proclaims his own innocence and aloofness from the Bribe City system, the very system of which Craxi was no less than the main architect and leading representative." Having dealt with Craxi, the secretariat also issued an appeal to the judiciary urging them not to allow themselves to be used by "meddlers" and to ensure that at least those working on delicate inquiries "maintain full control over and full responsibility for information relating to their work and decisions. This would prevent the creation of any areas of uncertainty" that could be occupied by those wanting "to irremediably undermine the election campaign." For the sake "of democracy," the PDS calls for a "rigorous, honest, and correct" election campaign. And it "trusts" that "everyone will understand this supreme necessity." [passage omitted]
