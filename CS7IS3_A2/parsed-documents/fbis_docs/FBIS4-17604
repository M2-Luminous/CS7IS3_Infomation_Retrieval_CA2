This was stated to INTERFAX by Guliyev after a one and a half hour-long conversation with Kozyrev, most of which was face to face. Asked by INTERFAX correspondent whether Azerbaijan's attitude to the Russian settlement plan changed after the meeting, Guliyev said: "I have always had a positive attitude to this plan. I have always supported Russia's peacekeeping efforts. Another problem is that the plan should take into account the methods of liberating the seized Azeri territories." According to Guliyev, Kozyrev agreed with his arguments. Guliyev also said that he had not discussed with Kozyrev the timetable and all the technical aspects of the Russian plan. "These issues will be handled by the special envoy of the Russian president, special ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov and the Azeri Foreign Ministry," the speaker of the Azeri parliament said. In turn, ambassador Kazimirov told INTERFAX that "the introduction of modifications to the Russian plan for the settlement of the conflict is continuing on a constant basis." "This is...a natural course (for such negotiations), so there is nothing extraordinary in Azerbaijan's position on this issue," the Russian diplomat said.
