Intelligence Branch Chief Uri Sagi has made two trips to Washington recently, and one of his visits has been kept secret until now. The meetings are part of the drafting of a working paper entitled The Israel-Syria Peace Package, and it outlines the Israeli stands on an agreement with Syria. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports that the proposal will be submitted to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is slated to arrive in the region in about 10 days. Likud elements asserted that by proposing to withdraw from the Golan while al-Asad-inspired katyushas are being launched at the Galilee, Rabin is behaving with obduracy.
