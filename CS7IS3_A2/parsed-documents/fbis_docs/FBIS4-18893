The country's four bishops were to have taken part in the African Synod which has opened here. In a statement released here by the Vatican press office, Rwanda's bishops praised the armed forces for how they were able to restore security and called on the authorities to "continue to protect all, regardless of ethnic origin, party or region" and to "neutralize those who block peace." The bishops went on to strongly condemn those who initiated the civil strife between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes, sparked by the death of that nation's president, shot down in a plane together with the president of neighboring Burundi. In particular, the Rwanda bishops struck out against the "spirit of vengeance" and the looting, massacres of innocent civilians and religious workers "which has even taken place inside churches... which is unprecedented." The statement also underscored how the new government had pledged a "return to peace and security, a fight against hunger and negotiations with the Rwanda Patriotic Front." "The Catholic Bishops of Rwanda" the statement to the press read, "favor dialogue and sincere and efficient negotiations. It is for this reason that they call on the government and the Rwanda Patriotic Front to avoid the logic of war to resolve their conflicts." "They call on all Rwandans, and Christians in particular" the noted continued, "to show themselves to be the makers of peace, protecting, in particular, those seeking refuge and giving aid to the needy." The Rwandan church officials added how they had been shocked by the murders of the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi and for the successive bloodshed. "In these difficult and critical times" the statement concluded, "each and all must avoid reacting under the influence of rage."
