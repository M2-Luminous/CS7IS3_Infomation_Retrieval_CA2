Speaking at a press conference this evening, the foreign minister said that during his visit he has met with Chinese leaders including President Jiang Zemin and held talks with vice-premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. The two sides, he said, exchanged views on bilateral ties and international issues, and gained positive results. Amorim said that Brazil and China enjoy good cooperative relations, adding that both are developing countries playing more and more important roles in the world. Both Brazil and China work for world peace and focus on their own economic development, said Amorim. Therefore, Brazil-China cooperation is conducive to world peace and security. The foreign minister said trade between the two countries has been developing impressively, with an annual volume surpassing one billion U.S. dollars. Bilateral cooperation in various fields, including hi-tech, has broad prospects, he noted. Amorim said that Brazil has always advocated the restoration of China's status as a founding party of GATT, adding that China is a big nation in trade, and its re-entry into GATT is important for both China and the world. Brazil and China are cooperating in that regard, he added. The foreign minister, who visited China in 1986, extended his congratulations on China's achievement in economic construction, saying that the great changes taking place in the country in the past eight years are great, and he was "astonished" by the changes. Amorim and his party are scheduled to leave here for home tomorrow.
