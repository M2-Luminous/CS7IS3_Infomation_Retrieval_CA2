The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), major backers of multimedia projects, say they are inundated with various inquiries from businesses aiming to tap an area with huge growth potential toward the next century. "We are groping for ways to make multimedia services commercial," said Masashi Kojima, president of NTT, which recently outlined three types of experiments on the joint use of multimedia networks. Test operations of high-speed, wide-band "backbone" telecom networks will begin in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and seven other major cities across the nation from September, using a technology called the asynchronous transfer mode for the first time in the world. The idea is to build high-speed local area networks, a large- amount file transmission system and a high-speed data retrieval system, an NTT official said. A test of multimedia networking for general public use will be conducted in the 10 cities from the spring of 1995 to establish systems for high-grade electronic mail services and electronic newspaper. NTT also plans to conduct an experiment on cable television services in seven urban areas from the spring of 1995, envisaging video-on-demand services that enable viewers to access movies and other video programs at their discretion. Interested third parties will be invited to take part in each experiment, the NTT official said. "By speeding up these experiments, we should lay a foundation that will lead to actual business opportunities," NTT president Kojima said. The Electronic Industries Association of Japan forecast the market for multimedia-type hardware and software will grow to 17.66 trillion yen by 2015, a 4.6-fold jump from 1992. Including infrastructure-related business, the sum will be 123 trillion yen, the posts ministry predicted. A foundation set up by the posts ministry unveiled a 5 billion yen experimental project earlier this year to build a next- generation telecommunications network in Japan. The project will offer a variety of information and communications services, such as teleconferences, visual phones and video-on-demand services, for three years from this summer in an area in Kyoto, choosing 300 households as model users. "The experiment is intended to clarify economic feasibility and other problems involved in laying a nationwide optical-fiber network in the 21st century," said the foundation, called the Association for Promotion of New Generation Network Services. Remote-control services in medical areas that use integrated services digital network (ISDN) technology will be tested by a government-private joint entity from this summer in Osaka and other kansai areas. Nikon Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and several other companies are researching, for example, ways of transmitting X-ray images taken at home to remote medical facilities, jointly with Kyoto University and Osaka University, said the Association of Broadband-ISDN Business Chance and Culture Creation. Remote services under study by the association also include mail- order services using electronic catalogs, housing designs made by remote-operated computer graphics and remote editing and printing of books. The city of Okazaki in Aichi Prefecture has been designated by the posts ministry as Japan's first model city for experiments of a multimedia network offering education and other public services. Using the existing cable-TV network, students at selected schools will be able to access from this fall a vast amount of educational information collected by the city in the past 40 years, a spokesman in Okazaki said. "Major school events like a student board meeting may be conducted via a teleconference system in the future," said the spokesman. Analysts say the social infrastructure needs to be upgraded more in Japan for these multimedia experiments to be smoothly converted into commercial services in the near future. Chuck Goto, a senior analyst at S.G. Warburg Securities (Japan) Inc., said the penetration of cable television, for example, is very low in Japan compared with the United States. Software for multimedia also needs to be developed. The Ueda Municipal Government in Nagano Prefecture has been assigned by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to run a multimedia information center. The center will make citizens familiar with the convenience of multimedia by providing them with the opportunity to design audiovisual software using multimedia equipment. But the project is on hold since nobody in the local government has expertise in multimedia operations. "We are at a loss about what to put in the planned center," said an Ueda Municipal Government official.
