Dhlakama replied that if that is the case, the blame does not lie with Renamo but with the UN's lack of efficiency: [Begin Dhlakama recording] If he said that, that is his fault, because the Unomoz [United Nations Operation in Mozambique] office has a list of over 1,000 Renamo names to be demobilized. The process works on the basis of lists. We hand in the lists of the people who are to be demobilized. If Unomoz fails to set the date, if they fail to go ahead with the demobilization, then maybe it is a question of incompetence on Unomoz's part. It is not up to Renamo unilaterally to arrive at an assembly point and say: Right, you are going home. We have collected lists of our men and have handed them over to Unomoz. It is up to Unomoz to carry out the demobilization. [end recording]
