What are your motives? [Monod] As early as 1984, the ERT had drawn the attention of political and economic circles to the need to give a new start to infrastructure building in Europe. Today, the ERT is completing a report on major East-West infrastructures. The report looks at road, rail, and airport networks, large pipeline systems, major energy transmission systems, and lists -- without defining them rigidly on a map -- essential pathways likely to connect at once the economy, people, and ideas. There will, of course, be a chapter on telecommunications and electronic highways between East and West Europe. [Menguy] So you believe that the time has come to invest in infrastructure? [Monod] The times are quite ripe for such new projects. In the current context, recovery measures taken jointly at the European level would give a new lease on life to European economies, which have become too interdependent for a single country to reap much benefit from isolated measures. This is a unique opportunity to build infrastructure directed at Central and East European countries. The best way to accelerate trade with these countries is to anchor them to the European Union. [Menguy] How do manufacturers view the program? [Monod] Manufacturers throughout Europe are very keen on this program of physical and realized connections, because they believe it is an essential ingredient for growth. And, above all, it should create new jobs quickly. [Menguy] Immediately? [Monod] Yes. This is because the programs are ready. Out of the 26 projects listed by the Commission, some can be initiated without delay, which means that they can create jobs right away. [Menguy] Is implementation of this program so slow because of funding difficulties? [Monod] Funding is available. The problem is a lack of will to achieve things at the European level. This is a matter of national selfishness; everybody is only interested in what benefits them directly. To be sure, the most widespread notion is that the program will put pressure on national budgets. This is both true and untrue. None or very few of these projects can be achieved without a degree of intervention from national or European authorities. Funding can be arranged in many ways, be it through state-guaranteed loans, mixed funding with the European Investment Bank or the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development], where East Europe is concerned, or revenue guarantees for concession projects. There is also an idea put forward by Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's former president: issuing bonds modeled after the Eurobonds popular in the United States; such bonds could be guaranteed by the European Community, but would draw on international investment (from European countries as well as others). I will also mention the Eurotunnel experience, a gigantic undertaking which was funded through more than 100 banks as well as private investors.
