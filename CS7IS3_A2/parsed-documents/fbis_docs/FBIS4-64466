No one should think that the evil ghosts of the past are at home only in the Balkans, and that racial and religious hatred and ethnic expulsion can only happen there. Despite all our problems and worries, such as the attainment of internal unity, the combating of the recession and unemployment, and the creation of new jobs, the safeguarding of peace and liberty now and in the coming years remains the decisive goal of German politics. Internal peace is only possible when external peace is guaranteed. Our German experience this century includes a recognition of the fact that we need partners and friends. Our security and negotiating ability in foreign policy matters is geared to the fact that we are reliable partners and that our allies trust us. After all, our allies stood by us in the past, and continue to do so. When it comes to peace and freedom in Europe and the world, Germany must not stand on the sidelines. We must share the responsibility at the side of our friends and partners. The Bundeswehr's involvement in measures to safeguard world peace within the framework of the community of nations is not only a central issue of German foreign and security policy, but also a question of German honor and identity. You soldiers of the Bundeswehr are entitled to have a clear definition of conditions so that you may agree to and fulfill your duties without any ifs or buts. Just as our country is growing accustomed to its new international responsibility, so too is the image of the soldier's profession undergoing a transformation. The challenge concerns all of you, and with your involvement in UN operations you have furnished the first examples of this responsibility. In the future, the Bundeswehr's tasks will include not just the defense of the country and the alliance, but also the containment of crises and conflicts. The soldierly profession is one of the few professions that call for an existential commitment in every sense of the term, in other words a readiness to lay down one's life. This can also happen in peacetime if you experience a serious situation in a crisis area beyond our borders. This provides us, especially the politicians, with great responsibility. As chancellor, I am fully aware of this responsibility every time I reach a decision regarding the deployment of our soldiers. A readiness to assume duties and participate in service for the common good has shrunk alarmingly in our society. We are living at a time when ruthless egoism is often hailed as "self-fulfillment." To safeguard our future, and it is not old-fashioned to say this, we must resort to the values that guaranteed Germany a future in difficult times -- courage and reliability, self- responsibility and efficiency, a readiness to help, and consideration for others. With your service, soldiers of the Bundeswehr, you occupy a central position in our society. You are accorded our recognition, and have every reason to be proud of your services. I wish as many people as possible in all sectors of society -- in politics, in the parties, in industry, and in the trade unions -- would follow your example. Ladies and Gentlemen, Israel's Amos Oz, peace prize winner of the German publishing trade, said in St. Paul's Church in Frankfurt in 1992: "Twice in my life have I seen the horrible countenance of war. But still I am convinced that one can never abolish aggression by succumbing to it." Therefore we need your service in the Bundeswehr to permit future generations a life of peace, freedom, and prosperity. I ask each of you, also on a personal level, to take part in this great future task. I thank you all for your service, and ask you to convey my thanks to your comrades.
