In an interview with RAI-Uno, the public broadcasting corporation's flagship channel, to be broadcast tomorrow evening, he recalled that, when he came to power, he had promised to manage a situation "of great dangers" including a "giant public debt" using only ordinary means. According to Ciampi, people were dubious about trying to manage the crisis through market means, but the results were falling interest rates and the re-conquered confidence of the international markets. He also said the key was the incomes policy agreement achieved with the unions last July 23. Another major factor was the lira's devaluation, which had turned a balance-of-payments deficit of 30 trillion lire into a surplus of 15 trillion. According to Ciampi, all this may mean that Italy may be the first European nation to plunge into a "real economic recovery." He also cited his government's continuation of the battle against organised crime, its moves to uproot corruption and other forms of malfeasance from public and business life, and the measures laying the foundations for giving jobs to the young people. In other points, he looked back fifty years to the Liberation in 1944. "Anyone who saw Italy with their own eyes then can only say that the country has made enormous progress," he said. "Particularly in the early years, there was an ability for translating political ideals of liberty and justice into reality. There was an ability for conjugating the Catholic with the nonconfessional matrix."
