Chernomyrdin signed in Moscow Thursday a treaty on principles of bilateral relations. During an official friendship visit to Russia by the Vietnamese Government leader from 15 June, the two sides also signed other important agreements laying new grounds for further development of the friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and Russia. At this connection, the Voice of Vietnam has this to say: Russia is one of the big countries in the world with developed agriculture and industries and great potentials in oil, gas, machinery, and means of transport. In recent years, Russia has been confronted with a number of social economic difficulties such as the decrease of economic growth, inflation, unemployment. To overcome this situation, the Russian leadership has stepped up its relations with foreign countries while solving its domestic problems. To get this done, Russia has focussed on nations in Asia, especially in Southeast Asia. The Russian foreign minister, in his talks on 15 June with visiting Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam said: Russia and Vietnam share many common interests. Vietnam is Russia's friend in Asia. On this occasion, Senior Lieutenant General Commander (Lindegrav) said: No reason for Vietnam and Russia forget each other. [sentence as heard] At present, the two countries are determined to restore, consolidate, and develop their bilateral cooperation. This determination has been manifested through a series of agreements and treaties signed on 16 June. Besides the treaty on the principles of bilateral relations, Vietnam and Russia also signed agreements on investment; on economic scientific and technical cooperation; in agriculture, industry; and on cooperation in fishery. These documents are new foundations for Vietnam and Russia to develop long term cooperation for mutual benefits on the principles of equality, and at the same, basis for them to overcome obstacles on mechanism and forms of cooperation in recent past. The Russian prime minister, in the talks, assured the Vietnamese prime minister that the two countries of Vietnam and Russia have a fine traditional relationship. With the newly signed documents, the two countries should bring into full play this fine relationship.
