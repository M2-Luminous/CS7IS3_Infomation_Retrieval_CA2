FR940803-0-00131 FR940803-0-00040 (2) For model years 1993 through 1995, alcohol dual fuel automobiles designed to operate on mixtures of alcohol and gasoline must, in addition to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, to obtain the CAFE credit determined in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and (vi) of this section, provide equal or superior energy efficiency while operating on a mixture of 50% alcohol, 50% gasoline by volume, as while operating on gasoline fuel. The following equation must hold true: E 50 /E g >or=1 Where: E 50 =[FE 50 /(NHV 50 ×D 50 )]×10 6 =energy efficiency while operating on 50% alcohol, 50% gasoline rounded to the nearest 0.01 miles/million BTU. E g =[FE g /(NHV g ×D g )]x10 6 =energy efficiency while operating on gasoline fuel rounded to the nearest 0.01 miles/million BTU. FE 50 is the fuel economy [miles/gallon] while operated on 50% alcohol, 50% gasoline as determined in §600.113; FE g is the fuel economy [miles/gallon] while operated on gasoline as determined in §600.113; NHV 50 is the net (lower) heating value [BTU/lb] of the 50/50 blend; NHV g is the net (lower) heating value [BTU/lb] of gasoline; D 50 is the density [lb/gallon] of the 50/50 blend; D g is the density [lb/gallon] of the gasoline. (i) To demonstrate that the equation holds true for each engine family, the manufacturer will: (A) Test one test vehicle in each engine family on both the city and highway cycles; or (B) In lieu of testing, provide a written statement attesting that equal or superior energy efficiency is attained while using a 50% alcohol, 50% gasoline mixture compared to using 100% gasoline. (ii)(A) The net heating value for the 50% alcohol, 50% gasoline mixture shall be determined by ASTM D 240 (Incorporated by reference as specified in §600.011&hyph;93). (B) The density for the 50% alcohol, 50% gasoline mixture shall be determined per ASTM D 1298 (Incorporated by reference as specified in §600.011&hyph;93). (iii) The net heating value and density of gasoline are to be determined by the manufacturer in accordance with §600.113(c). (3) Alcohol dual fuel passenger automobiles and natural gas dual fuel passenger automobiles manufactured during model years 1993 through 2004 must meet the minimum driving range requirements established by the Secretary of Transportation (49 CFR part 538) to obtain the CAFE credit determined in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and (vi) of this section. (h) For each of the model years 1993 through 2004, and for each category of automobile identified in paragraph (a) of this section, the maximum increase in average fuel economy determined in paragraph (c) of this section attributable to alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel automobiles shall be 1.2 miles per gallon or as provided for in paragraph (i) of this section. (1) The Administrator shall calculate the increase in average fuel economy to determine if the maximum increase provided in paragraph (h) of this section has been reached. The Administrator shall calculate the average fuel economy for each category of automobiles specified in paragraph (a) of this section by subtracting the average fuel economy values calculated in accordance with this section by assuming all alcohol dual fuel and natural gas dual fuel automobiles are operated exclusively on gasoline (or diesel) fuel from the average fuel economy values determined in paragraphs (b)(2)(vi), (b)(2)(vii), and (c) of this section. The difference is limited to the maximum increase specified in paragraph (h) of this section. (i) In the event that the Secretary of Transportation lowers the corporate average fuel economy standard applicable to passenger automobiles below 27.5 miles per gallon for any model year during 1993 through 2004, the maximum increase of 1.2 mpg per year specified in paragraph (h) of this section shall be reduced by the amount the standard was lowered, but not reduced below 0.7 mpg per year. 24. Section 600.513&hyph;91 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) introductory text, (a)(2), and (b)(2)(xii) to read as follows: §600.513&hyph;91 Gas guzzler tax. (a) This section applies only to passenger automobiles sold after December 27, 1991, regardless of the model year of those vehicles. For alcohol dual fuel and natural gas dual fuel automobiles, the fuel economy while such automobiles are operated on gasoline will be used for Gas Guzzler Tax assessments. (1) *␣*␣* (2) For 1991 and later model year passenger automobiles, the combined general label model type fuel economy value used for Gas Guzzler Tax assessments shall be calculated in accordance with the following equation, rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg:
