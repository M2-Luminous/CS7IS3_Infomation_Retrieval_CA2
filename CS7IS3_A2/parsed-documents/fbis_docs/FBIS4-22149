Filippov] [Text] The Avenger surface-to-air missile [SAM] system was developed by the American firm Boeing within the framework of the FAADS program, which calls for creating advanced forward area battlefield air defense systems. The basic requirement imposed on such weapons is to ensure reliability of covering first- and second-echelon ground forces groupings against airstrikes. The Avenger SAM is designed to hit air targets at ranges up to 5.5 km and altitudes up to 3500 meters. It can be fired from the halt and on the move. The system is air-transportable: A C-130 can carry three SAM systems, and a C-141 can carry six. The SAM system includes: A launcher with eight Stinger SAM's ready for firing; a 12.7-mm machinegun; optical and infrared-imaging target detection and tracking devices; a laser rangefinder; an IFF; a computer; control and indication elements; and communications transceivers. All elements are situated on a gyrostabilized platform, which is mounted on the chassis of a multipurpose 1.25-ton M988 Hummer cross-country vehicle. The Stinger surface-to-air missile (launch weight of about 10 kg, length of 1.52 meters, and airframe diameter of 70 mm) has a two-stage solid-propellant engine. The first stage is a separating booster rocket that fires when the missile passes in the launch canister. The second stage of the Stinger SAM is made in the canard aerodynamic configuration. The control surfaces and fins are folded and unfold after the missile leaves the launch canister. To avoid injury to the operator, the second stage engine ignites when the SAM is approximately 9 meters from the launcher. The missile's maximum flight speed is 700 m/s. Guidance to the target is accomplished with the aid of an infrared homing head. Presently, Stingers are equipped with POST (Passive Optical Seeker Technique) homing heads that operate in the infrared and ultraviolet bands. As is asserted in the foreign press, this increases protection against natural interference and also in conditions of the enemy using countermeasures. The missile has a high-explosive warhead (1 kg). It is detonated by an impact fuze when the missile meets the target or by a self-destruct signal, in the event it is fired at a friendly aircraft or if it misses. The operator's cab contains an optical sight, an infrared-imaging device, and control, indication, and monitoring elements. The FLIR (Forward Looking Infra-Red) thermal imaging device ensures detection and tracking of targets at night and in poor visibility. The Hummer motor vehicle (4x4) has a top speed of 110 km/hr and a range of 500 km. It is able to negotiate 31-degree inclines and fords 0.76 meters deep. The most important assemblies are protected by armor. The U.S. Army began receiving the Avenger SAM systems in 1989. A total of about 1200 of these systems are to be purchased for a total sum of $2.2 billion. In addition, Boeing is conducting negotiations on delivering 40 units to the ground forces of the Netherlands. The results of field operation have shown that the Avenger SAM system has insufficient effectiveness when firing against low-flying and hovering helicopters, as well as against ground targets, as a result of interference from ground objects affecting the infrared guidance system of the Stinger missiles.
