"We have unconfirmed reports that any foreigners may be targetted by the Khmer Rouge," an embassy statement said. "You should take extreme care and should not travel on roads where the Khmer Rouge occasionally operate," the statement said. If travel was absolutely necessary, foreigners were advised to move in convoys. A senior embassy official would not speculate on whether the kidnapping of foreigners was a new Khmer Rouge tactic. But the official said the travel advisory was in reaction to the "best available evidence" and was designed to "alert but not alarm" the expatriate community. Co-Interior Minister Yu Hokkri told AFP that the Khmer Rouge leadership may have ordered their guerrillas to kidnap foreigners in order to use them as bargaining chips in the event of negotiations with the government. Although the Khmer Rouge strongholds are in the north and northwest of the country, pockets of guerrillas operate in most provinces. Australian former model Kelly Wilkinson, 24, her British boyfriend, Dominic Chappell, 25, and a British friend, Tina Dominy, whose age was not given, were reported to be alive and well, friends in the capital said Saturday. The trio was spotted by local people near the area where they were abducted Monday by Khmer Rouge guerrillas on National Route 4, about 130 kilometres ( [word indistinct] miles) southwest of the capital. The American Embassy backed the British advisory "100 per cent" while the Australians agreed with the need for "increased vigilance and extreme caution." An spokesman for Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans also told reporters in Canberra that the three people kidnapped were apparently in good shape. "Elements of the armed forces have made contact with other Khmer Rouge elements in the province and apparently there are reports that they are alive and, to all intents and purposes, well," the spokesman said. But another Australian official said there was still no ransom demand and no contact had been made with the abductors. Two Khmer-speaking Australian police officers, who served with the recent United Nations peacekeeping mission here, were expected to arrive soon to help the efforts to secure the release of Wilkinson and her two friends, an embassy official said. Wilkinson's father, Peter, and brother Sean, both from Queensland, Australia, arrived here Friday and were reported to have left for the southern coastal town of Sihanoukville Saturday. Wilkinson and Chappell run a popular restaurant in the port and resort town and were returning there from the capital when they were taken by Khmer Rouge guerrillas. The Australian's mother, Gabrielle Wilkinson, welcomed news of the sighting. "This is certainly the news we have been waiting for -- a confirmed sighting," she said. "That's wonderful." Meanwhile a representative of the aid agency Food for the Hungry International (FHI) said there was no response to a letter from King Norodom Sihanouk calling for the immediate release of one of their American aid workers, Melissa Himes. "There was supposed to be a response mid-morning, then it was delayed," the aid agency official said, adding that there might be news later Saturday. Himes and two Cambodian colleagues are entering their third week of captivity. Police identified their captors as Khmer Rouge, but FHI spokesman Robin Shell said they appeared to be a rogue unit. Their affiliation was not clear.
