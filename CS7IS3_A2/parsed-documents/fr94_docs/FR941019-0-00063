FR941019-0-00063 FR941019-0-00008 G. Annual Report Delivery Requirements Rule 14a&hyph;3(b) [17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;3(b)] under the 1934 Act requires that, when directors are to be elected at an annual or special shareholder meeting, registrants, including funds, furnish each person solicited with a proxy statement that is accompanied or preceded by an annual report to shareholders. Most non-investment company registrants hold annual meetings to elect directors, and, in many cases, the annual report delivery requirement under rule 14a&hyph;3(b) is the only requirement that shareholders receive an annual report. Funds, on the other hand, are subject to express annual (and semi-annual) shareholder reporting requirements under section 30(d) of the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;29(d)] and rule 30d&hyph;1, regardless of whether they hold annual meetings, and fund shareholder meetings may not coincide with the mailing of the annual shareholder report. 42 To clarify the annual report delivery requirements for funds, the Commission proposed to amend rule 14a&hyph;3(b) to set forth the conditions under which a fund's annual report previously transmitted to shareholders as required under rule 30d&hyph;1 would satisfy the rule. 43 The Commission requested comment on other alternatives for the annual report delivery requirement, including whether it might be appropriate to eliminate the proxy annual report requirement for funds in light of the reports required to be transmitted to shareholders semi-annually under rule 30d&hyph;1. 42 Funds generally are not required under state law or the 1940 Act to hold annual shareholder meetings. Funds schedule shareholder meetings as necessary to elect directors, to approve investment advisory contracts or Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans, or to vote on other matters requiring shareholder approval. 43 As proposed, an annual report transmitted to shareholders two months before the date of the proxy statement would satisfy the delivery requirements of rule 14a&hyph;3(b). Where more than two months has elapsed, the rule 14a&hyph;3(b) annual report delivery requirement would be satisfied if: (i) the fund mails the proxy statement at least 30 days prior to the meeting; (ii) the proxy statement includes a prominent statement that the most recent annual report and any subsequent semi-annual report will be delivered to shareholders, upon written or oral request, without charge; and (iii) if requested by a shareholder, the annual report and, if available, the semi-annual report is transmitted within two business days of the request. Several commenters supported the proposed clarification of the annual report delivery requirement. Other commenters, however, urged the Commission to eliminate the requirement and to substitute a requirement that the proxy statement include a legend advising shareholders that an annual report is available upon request. These commenters argued that the shareholder reporting requirements of the 1940 Act make the proxy annual report requirement superfluous. Commenters also noted that the primary effect of the annual report requirement is to impose restrictions on holding shareholder meetings because meetings can not be scheduled when the annual report for the preceding fiscal year is not yet available after the end of the fiscal year. In some cases, a fund complex may wish to make a combined proxy mailing for several funds to reduce the expense of the proxy solicitation; however, a joint proxy statement may be precluded if some of the funds have different fiscal years for which the annual report is not available. 44 These commenters argued that the cost of mailing an annual report with the proxy statement to new shareholders who have not received an annual report can be substantial, and these expenses are borne by the fund's shareholders. 44 In the past, funds have sought relief from the rule 14a&hyph;3 annual report delivery requirement when a shareholder vote is necessary before the annual report is available after the end of the fund's fiscal year. See Dreyfus California Tax Exempt Bond Fund, Inc., et al. (pub. avail. June 18, 1994); Dean Witter American Value Fund, et al. (pub. avail. Nov. 18, 1992). The Commission agrees that the costs imposed on funds and their shareholders outweigh the benefits of requiring that annual reports accompany a proxy statement. At the time of a proxy solicitation, shareholders who have recently invested in a fund will have received a current prospectus and other shareholders will have received either an annual or semi-annual report within six months of receiving the proxy statement. In addition, most funds transmit to shareholders quarterly account statements providing information about fund performance. In contrast with the timeliness of information provided under the 1940 Act's reporting regime, rule 14a&hyph;3(b) requires delivery of a fund annual report that may be, in some cases, almost twelve months old. Thus, this requirement has the unintended and anomalous effect of requiring delivery of an annual report the information in which may have been superseded by information in a more recent semi-annual report. Moreover, as applied, the current requirements impose significant restraints on the timing of shareholder meetings and may add substantial costs to holding meetings when, for example, accountants must perform an audit on an expedited basis. Therefore, the Commission is revising rule 14a&hyph;3(b) to eliminate the annual report delivery requirement for funds. 45 45 Paragraph (4) of rule 14a&hyph;3(b) requires the annual report to include information concerning changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure required by item 304 of Regulation S&hyph;K [17 CFR 229.304]. The Commission is preserving this requirement for funds by amending the shareholder report financial statement requirements set forth in rule 30d&hyph;1 by reference to the applicable item in the registration statement forms (new instruction 4(iv) of item 23 of Form N&hyph;1A; new instruction 4(c) of item 23 of Form N&hyph;2; and new instruction 4(iv) to paragraph (a) of item 27 of Form N&hyph;3). Item 22(a) requires, in lieu of the annual report, inclusion in the proxy statement of a statement that the fund's most recent annual and semi-annual reports are available upon request. 46 Those shareholders in need of information contained in the annual report will, therefore, continue to have access to it. 46 Paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of item 22. This provision also is applicable to information statements. Rule 14c&hyph;3 [17 CFR 240.14c&hyph;3], which requires an annual report to accompany an information statement concerning the election of directors, also is revised to eliminate the annual report requirement. H. Other Matters The Commission is adopting two other amendments to the general proxy provisions. First, the Commission is amending rule 14a&hyph;3(e)(2) [17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;3(e)(2)], which relieves funds of the obligation to deliver proxy and other soliciting materials to shareholders whose dividend payments are returned as undeliverable, to relieve funds (and other registrants) of the delivery obligation when dividend reinvestment confirmations are returned as undeliverable. Second, the Commission is amending Item 3 of Schedule 14A, which requires a description of appraisal or similar rights under state law applicable to any matter being acted upon ( i.e., mergers and other fundamental corporate transactions), to make it expressly inapplicable to open-end funds. 47 The 1940 Act, which requires open-end funds to redeem their securities at net asset value, 48 supersedes state law appraisal rights. 49 47 Instruction 2 to item 3 of Schedule 14A. Closed-end funds (including closed-end funds that make periodic repurchases of their shares under rule 22c&hyph;3 of the 1940 Act [17 CFR 270.22c&hyph;3]), which do not issue redeemable securities, would continue to be subject to item 3. 48 Rule 22c&hyph;1 [17 CFR 270.22c&hyph;1] (providing that redeemable securities must be redeemed at a price based on the current net asset value next computed after tender of the security for redemption). 49 Investment Company Act Rel. No. 8752 (Apr. 10, 1975) [40 FR 17986 (Apr. 24, 1975)]. I. Date of Effectiveness The new amendments to the proxy rules are effective on November 23, 1994. Funds may file, at their option, proxy statements prepared in accordance with the new rules on or after the effective date. Funds must comply with the new rules for all proxy statements filed on or after January 23, 1995. During the transition period between the effective date and the compliance date, funds should state in the cover letter submitting the proxy statement whether the proxy statement is prepared using the new rules. II. Cost/Benefit of the Proposals The amendments to the proxy rules, as adopted, are intended to improve the disclosure provided to fund shareholders in proxy statements. The amendments are not expected to impose additional burdens on funds. The amendments eliminate a substantial amount of ``boiler plate'' disclosure regarding matters that may not be relevant to shareholders. The additional information required by the amendments is readily available, and the elimination of the annual report requirement in connection with the proxy statement should provide funds with greater flexibility in scheduling shareholder meetings and reduce related expenses.
