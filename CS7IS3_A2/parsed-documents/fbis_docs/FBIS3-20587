There presently are 88 national distilleries and 90 breweries in the province and annual production of spirits and beer is nearly 1 million tons. Taxes and profits realized from spirits and beer in addition to wine and state commercial alcoholic beverage sales in recent years have exceeded 700 million yuan, making up an important part of provincial revenue. But these reporters understand from the people concerned that in recent years, Heilongjiang's alcoholic beverage production and sales both have been in a rather chaotic state, not only causing serious erosion of revenue, but more directly endangering consumers' physical health. Alcoholic beverage production is out of overall control. Based on calculations of current production capability, throughout the province state enterprise production of spirits is 100,000 tons greater than sales and production of beer in 200,000 tons greater than sales. In some state enterprises, production capacity is idle and with results still not fully brought into play, small individual distilleries have grown incrementally. According to incomplete statistics, in 1991 there were 879 small distilleries throughout the province, and this year it has already reached 2,500. According to a survey, the vast majority of small distilleries do not meet standard production conditions. They do not have specialized technicians and they do not have testing equipment. Some even sell diluted industrial alcohol. What causes extremely serious consequences is that fatal poisonings continue to occur. In March 1993, a farmer, Bu Sulong [0592 4790 7893], in Songjiang village, Songjiang township on the outskirts of Jiamusi without any license operated a small private distillery, used adulterated industrial alcohol diluted with unboiled water to make spirits in bulk, and peddled 1,500 kilograms to thirteen sales points in that locality, poisoning five people to death, paralyzing three people, and blinding three people in both eyes. An inordinate amount of poisonings also occurred in Bin county last year causing injury and death. Because of their limited technology, small distilleries' grain consumption is generally twice that of state distilleries. According to statistics, in this province alone, 150 million kilograms of grain is wasted. According to surveys, the existence of small distilleries depends mainly on tax loopholes. Experts reveal that if they paid 10 percent taxes, all small distilleries would lose money. The current state distillery tax is levied at 35 percent. Based on this calculation, every year throughout the province taxes evaded by small distilleries reach 50 million yuan or more. The alcoholic beverage sales market is out of control. Since the circulation system has been reformed and the state commercial monopoly has been broken, channels for circulating alcoholic beverages have increased and a brisk market has flourished. But at the same time it has brought some problems. The first is that falsely labeled alcoholic beverages have run rampant. In 1992 alone, throughout the province special alcoholic beverage sales control organizations confiscated more than 260,000 bottles of fake Maotai and fake Wuliang. The second is that low-grade spirits diluted with ethyl alcohol are flooding the market. In 1992 throughout the province, special alcoholic beverage sales control organizations confiscated more than 200,000 kilograms of low-grade alcoholic beverages made by individuals using ethyl alcohol diluted with unboiled water, and in 1993 they confiscated more than 300,000 kilograms. Experts believe that the key to turning around the chaotic situation in the production and sale of alcoholic beverages is in learning from other provinces and augmenting special alcoholic beverage sales controls and speeding up special sales legislation for alcoholic beverages.
