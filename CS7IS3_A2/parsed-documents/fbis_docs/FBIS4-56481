Throughout the 15 blocks covered by the parade and at the rally held at Francisco Morazan Civic Plaza next to the local stadium, workers and peasants directed their attacks against Carlos Roberto Reina's government, which they compared to that of Rafael Leonardo Callejas, for its actions that have impoverished the working class. Slogans such as this were chanted during the parade: "Red Rooster [logo of the Liberal Party] you have shit on the people," "Blues and Reds, you have shit on the people," "There is no peace; beans cost more," "What good is the moral revolution if we are still on a pile of shit," "We are civilists, not militarists," "The Armed Forces are the people's armed branch, and the people are in power, ha ha ha," "The damned revolution brought us devaluation," "We must sell the F-5's so we can eat." Before the 1 May rally began, demonstrators burned two coffins, one symbolizing mandatory military service, the other, the U.S. Government. They also burned effigies of the current president and the traditional party. Contrary to other opinions, the worker and peasant leaders who led the parade, including Mario Quintanilla, Mauro Gonzalez, Victor Artiles, Efrain Aguilar, and Israel Salinas, said the goal of gathering 60,000 people was achieved. Although the number was not confirmed, the truth is the march covered ten blocks, causing the coordinators to be satisfied. In their proposals, the workers described Carlos Roberto Reina's Liberal government as weak and devoid of a political definition as it approaches its first 100 days in power. The workers said the regime of the moral revolution must establish social justice for all Hondurans, which makes miserable the sad life of the majority of fellow citizens. [sentence as published] Therefore, the workers, peasants, and professional associations demand the current government implement an emergency food and agrarian reform plan that will guarantee access to land for peasants, timely credit at low rates, and technical and state assistance to allow them to commercialize production. They also demanded the immediate suspension of the existence of the "ill-called Law of Agricultural Modernization," while a new agrarian reform law, which is consistent with the peasants' real situation and needs, is drafted. They called for a general wage readjustment for all Honduran workers because current wages do not satisfy the basic needs of nourishment, health, education, housing, and recreation, in view of the monetary devaluation and inflation caused by the former government. Concerning the health field, they said social security is a right of the people. They demanded, therefore, the government establish legal and financial mechanisms to expand the coverage and quality of the Honduran social security service. They asked for hospitals supplied with surgical equipment and the establishment of public health clinics. On public housing, it was regarded as a natural right of human beings, not as merchandise for profit. They demanded an immediate revision of the social housing fund law. The workers demanded President Reina establish a labor policy that would guarantee the freedom and autonomy of social organizations, labor unions, peasant, professional, indian, environmental, and youth organizations. They also demanded urgent approval of labor code reform, restructuring the Labor Ministry, and the teachers statute. Concerning privatizations, they said the Honduran state must reserve for itself the direction and administration of strategic utilities such as water, electricity, and telephone service, provided it is for the betterment of its quality. They demanded Congress urgently issue a decree on voluntary military service, social, educational, humanist, and democratic, with the respective rules in accordance with the law. They demanded the electoral processes be totally trustworthy and called for institutions to divest themselves of sectarian political interests, which have made electoral functions corrupt. On the crisis through which Hondurans live, the workers called for a real and effective process of social concord to unite the interests of all Hondurans, in search of a better future that will not benefit the powerful minority. Regarding ecological and environmental aspects, the Honduran workers pronounced themselves against the installation of a refinery in Trujillo and the felling of trees. They demanded the government declare a one-year moratorium on lumber exportations. For the organized classes that marched, grouped in the Regional Northwestern Coordinating Board of Peoples Organizations [consisting of the United Federation of Honduran Workers, the Confederation of Honduran Workers, and the Coordinating Council of Honduran Peasant Organizations] yesterday was a memorable date because in 1954, 40 years ago, the first banana workers strike in El Progreso gave birth to the Honduran worker movement.
