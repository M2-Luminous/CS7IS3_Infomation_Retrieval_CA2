Mr. Hah Saret, governor of Boreicholasa District, said without the strong efforts of all of us Cambodians, especially the provincial leadership, these Vietnamese troops would never have withdrawn. He expressed concern that similar incidents would again happen in the future if our border is not clearly demarcated. The problem of Vietnamese intruding into our land and planting rice there or just plain illegal immigration takes place every year and has to be settled every year with no end in sight. The district governor went on to reveal that along Takeo Province's border with Vietnam there was an artificial canal dug up during the time of Mr. Pol Saroeun, who was then the province's governor (of the former State of Cambodia), to prevent Vietnamese infiltration into Cambodian territory. This canal was quite effective. However, whenever it got damaged or dried up, problems normally arose. It has been frequently observed that the Cambodian side rarely intrudes into Vietnam, whereas the Vietnamese usually cross over this side of the border. It was noted that the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops who intruded into our land to grow rice was prompted by the pledge made following talks between the leadership of Takeo Province and that of Vietnam's An Giang Province earlier this year. The Takeo provincial leadership made three attempts to solve this problem with the leadership of Chau Doc District and An Giang Province before it was successful. Mr. Su Phirin, governor of Takeo Province, once told REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA that the latest round of talks with the Vietnamese side was most difficult because the Vietnamese claimed that the contested area belonged to them. They said they had heard repeated pleas from Takeo Province for years and they were determined not to give up the land as in the past. The governor said that before we could reach any agreement, we had to make a lot of inquiries, confrontations, and persuasions and we spent so much time doing just that. Mr. Phirin wished to see the border clearly and quickly demarcated to avoid similar border disputes in the future. It should be recalled that the site where the Vietnamese troops came to grow rice is located in Cheychouk Commune, Boreicholasa Disitrict. The area is 50 to 70 meters deep and 1,500 meters wide inside Cambodian territory. These Vietnamese intruders are troops from Chau Doc District. They came to grow rice in groups of 40 to 50 persons, each armed with automatic guns and sometimes heavy weapons. This made the situation much more explosive than before when only unarmed civilians came in to grab land to plant rice or simply to set up domicile. The latter would pull out whenever our district armed forces intervened. But recently, it was the Vietnamese troops themselves who had intruded. Some of the views admitted that it was great the Vietnamese troops had agreed to withdraw. But one thing they were most concerned about was that these troops might return in the future as there is already a precedent. According to the provincial governor, every year when the rice planting dry-season comes, the problem of Vietnamese coming in to plant rice on Cambodian land always arises because the soil in Vietnam is not as productive as in Cambodia. Another problem that frequently occurs is the renting of land to the Vietnamese by some of our own Cambodian citizens. This is a dangerous practice. Moreover, the governor of Boreicholasa Disitrict has complained that he cannot control every part of the sparsely populated, and vast land area (240 square kilometers) with few roads, as most of it is inundated. Moreover, during the dry season access is easier from the Vietnamese than from the Cambodian side. Nevertheless, he showed his strong determination to fully preserve the territorial integrity of Boreicholasa District. It is to be noted that Boreicholasa is a new district of Takeo Province created in December 1987. It is currently has 18,362 inhabitants, mostly farmers and fishermen. The creation of this district was Takeo Province's strategy against the influx of illegal Vietnamese immigrants.
