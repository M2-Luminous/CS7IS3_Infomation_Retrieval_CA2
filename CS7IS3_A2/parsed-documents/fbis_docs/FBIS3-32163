The declaration reiterates the traditional friendship existing between Paraguay and Peru and outlines their decision to strengthen cooperation and their political, economic, and cultural ties. The two presidents signed the document at the Golden Hall of Government Palace in Lima in the evening of 31 January, on the first day of Wasmosy's two-day official visit to Peru. This is the first visit by a Paraguayan head of state to Peru. The declaration firmly condemns terrorism, which it characterizes as a systematic and deliberate form of violating human rights that poses a threat to the stability of the democratic system. The two presidents state that they are committed to implementing a policy that will improve the standard of living of their people, especially those in low-income groups. In their declaration, Fujimori and Wasmosy reaffirm that socioeconomic development must go hand in hand with the preservation and rational use of natural resources through a mechanism designed to protect and preserve the environment. They also express their support for efforts to consolidate integration processes in the region. They also state that it is their common objective to gradually build "a great zonal and continental market" in which the Paraguayan and Peruvian economies would interact "dynamically and in a balanced fashion." They also vow to promote negotiations with a view to building a highway that would link Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, with the Peruvian cities of Ilo and Matarani. The two presidents convey their "deep concern" over the steady rise in the drug trade and the unlawful consumption of narcotics. Prior to signing the joint declaration, Fujimori and Wasmosy signed agreements designed to fight the drug trade and the unlawful consumption of narcotics, to promote and give mutual protection to investments, and to promote cooperation between the diplomatic academies of the two countries. They also signed a memorandum of understanding on technical cooperation between the two foreign ministries. During day one of his visit, Wasmosy was received in the Peruvian Congress and declared an "illustrious guest" by the Lima city government. Today, 1 February, Wasmosy will visit an exposition of Paraguayan handicraft and, accompanied by his Peruvian counterpart, will dedicate a school bearing the name of "Colonel Jose Felix Bogado," a Paraguayan citizen who took part in the expedition to liberate Peru led by General Jose de San Martin. Wasmosy will first decorate Fujimori with the Francisco Solano Lopez National Order of Merit and then will host a reception in his honor.
