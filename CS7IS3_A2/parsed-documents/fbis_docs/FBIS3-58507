In a speech to a political meeting in Dundee, Scotland, he warned that extreme rightwing nationalism in Russia was being fuelled by unemployment caused by privatisation, and aggravated by the loss of social safety nets. "We need to find ways of assuring the local populations that the new system can work, and even provide better services than before, and that they will have access to them," Brittan said. He urged more help in training the unemployed in Russia and supporting social safety nets, particularly for orphans, the elderly and the sick, which were threatened by the break-up of large state corporations. Brittan said the EC also needed to open its markets wider to imports from East European countries in preparation for bringing them into the Community. He singled out steel as typical of sensitive sectors where strict barriers against imports of East European products needed to be reconsidered. "East Europe has enormous potential in the steel sector. We need to sit down together to work out how to reconcile our steel policy with the legitimate aspirations of the East," Brittan said. He acknowledged that the EC had the largest responsibility for helping East Europe, saying: "This is our continent, these are our neighbours. It is our common future." But Brittan called on other countries, particularly the United States and Japan, to shoulder a fair share of the aid burden for East Europe and the former Soviet Union (FSU). He noted that EC aid payments had dwarfed help from the United States, accounting for 60 percent of all aid to East Europe and the FSU and providing a market for the bulk of exports from East Europe. However, the EC commissioner paid tribute to the "vision and drive" of U.S. President Bill Clinton's policies towards East Europe and Russia, expressed during Clinton's European trip this week. "The scale of the challenge to the East is huge. We must match this with the scale of the resources that we devote to assistance. The member states of the European Union, the United States and the other donors must work closely together to ensure that we do not fall short of what is needed," Brittan said.
