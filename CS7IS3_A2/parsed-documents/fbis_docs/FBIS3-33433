The National Front for Change and Democracy, FNCD, made public in Washington on 22 February a proposal for a solution to the crisis. A plan issued after a plenary session by some parties and organizations close to the FNCD was thus presented to the UN secretary general. In this document the FNCD legislators repeated, but in a different order, the priorities and the steps necessary to put an end to the political crisis. The FNCD plan, which does not indicate a specific date for the return of President Aristide, provides in point seven the process for his return. Regarding the nomination and the installation of a new prime minister, the FNCD advocates in this plan, first a vote on some essential laws including the one on amnesty and the retirement of General Raoul Cedras. In presenting this plan on 22 February, Senator Turneb Delpe, the FNCD spokesman, guaranteed that a large sector of national political opinion supported him. Senator Turneb Delpe presented the various points of this plan advocated by the FNCD: [Begin recording] [Delpe] A vote on the laws: a) Amnesty; b) Separation of the police from the Army; c) international cooperation; 1.2 [number as heard]: anticipated retirement of Gen. Raoul Cedras; 1.3: Nomination and ratification of a new commander in chief of Haiti's Armed Forces; 1.4: Nomination and ratification of a new prime minister; 1.5: Formation of a government of national concord; 1.6: Suspension of the sanctions; 1.7: Return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide; 1.8: Lifting of the sanctions. Resolution 2: A delegation of political leaders and FNCD legislators will go to Washington to promote this realistic compromise to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the representatives of the international community. [Reporter Clarence Renois, in Creole] Senator Delpe, did you discuss this plan with President Aristide and what is his position on this proposed plan? [Delpe, in Creole] We did not make the plan public yet because we wanted to discuss it with him. Generally speaking, we can say that he does not have much objection to it, although he has his own opinion. When he examines it he thinks that there will be some sequences he disagrees with, since he feels that the anticipated retirement of Gen. Raoul Cedras must come before the nomination and ratification of a prime minister. [end recording]
