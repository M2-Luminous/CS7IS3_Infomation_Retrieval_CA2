China was fifth on the 1992 list of Japan's major trading partners. Japan-China trade in 1993 grew 30.9 percent from the previous year to 37,844 million dollars, renewing an annual record for the third consecutive year, Jetro said. Japan's trade with the U.S. last year totaled 160.5 billion dollars. Chinese statistics showed Japan was China's largest trading partner last year, with two-way trade amounting to 39 billion dollars, Jetro said. Japan's 1993 exports to China surged 44.6 percent from the previous year to 17,281 million dollars, Jetro said. Passenger car exports increased 2.5 times and communications equipment exports, including telephones, doubled. Japan's imports from China advanced 21.3 percent to 20,563 million dollars. Apparel imports rose 30.0 percent and vegetable imports surged 42.0 percent, due to poor crops in Japan. Jetro forecast Japan-China trade this year will surpass 40 billion dollars, with imports steadily increasing despite an expected slowdown in exports due to China's import restraints.
