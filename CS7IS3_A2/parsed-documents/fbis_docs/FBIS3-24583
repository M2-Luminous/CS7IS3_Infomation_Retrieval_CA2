Pankov; UDC 681.31:535] [Abstract] A new approach is examined for designing parallel specialized photo-matrix LSIC, employing metal-dielectric- semiconductor (MDS) technology, capable of not only reception, photoelectric conversion and storage of logic signals, but their parallel logic-arithmetic processing as well. The results are reported of a new photo-matrix LSIC PMAMD (Photo-Matrix Associative Memory Device) for realization of parallel data search methods from optical memory organized by pages. High speeds of photoelectric transformation of the data of optical pages and their parallel processing is successfully combined in this LSIC with a high reliability and interference rejection of photoelectric transformation during the data flow, divergence of optical parameters of the page images, nonuniformity of the light background, electrophysical parameters of the photoelectronic LSIC crystals, and also nonuniformities produced by technology of the LSIC manufacturing. The structural diagram of the proposed photoelectronic LSIC PMAMD is provided. Testing of experimental samples of the PMAMD demonstrated that with the optical signal power 5x10[.sup]-8[/]W/Bit, the photo-sensitivity of the PMAMD elementary cells (not less than 10[.sup]-13[/], can produce a 100 Mbit/s rate of the data flow at the optical input to the PMAMD .
