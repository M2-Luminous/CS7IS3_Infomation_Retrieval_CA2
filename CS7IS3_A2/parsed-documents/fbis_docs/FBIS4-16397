Yaroslavl Oblast Conducts Examination of Investment Projects"] [Text] The Institute for a Transitional Period Economy [ITPE], headed by Yegor Gaydar, and the Yaroslavl Oblast administration have extended their cooperation in 1994 whose result is a program of selective policy [selektivnaya politika] for the oblast's enterprises. The Yaroslavl authorities have decided to support the initiative of their Nizhniy Novgorod neighbors and to invite the prominent economist from Moscow to carry out a local reform. The absence of a broad-based promotion for the project in Russia is explained by the fact that it is almost completely geared to Western investors. Thus, unlike Nizhniy Novgorod, Yaroslavl is only interested in money rather than in an image of economic well-being: Yegor Gaydar is not going to "build capitalism in a separate oblast." The Gaydar institute has examined all investment applications and turned down some of them, in particular an international airport project. Generally, the "selective policy" a la Gaydar in Yaroslavl Oblast is fully free of territorial and sectoral constraints. The ITPE has elaborated criteria for the projects of enterprises that are in need of investments. The main criterion should naturally be returns on investments. This applies not only to projects in the social sphere. The oblast's budget, too, has undergone ITPE examination and, in Mr. Gaydar's words, has been considerable altered. One result of these alterations, the project's authors think, is a "relative socioeconomic stability" in the region. The only serious problem the oblast faces is the "inordinately high unemployment level" attributed to the fact that concentrated in the region is a labor-intensive light industry that is going through a crisis in the absence of consumer demand. That sharply reduces the number of jobs. Yegor Gaydar has named among the most promising projects the development of the tourism and services spheres. He has not shared the governor's enthusiasm for the production of agricultural equipment, however, because he thinks it is not going to find consumer demand. The administration is most unlikely to receive money from Western partners without Gaydar's positive findings. This is perhaps why his cooperation has been sought -- the trust in Gaydar's name in the West will make it possible for Yaroslavl resident to attract the necessary investments.
