On 25 May, at the Ukrainian president's instruction, Radetskyy handed Sergio Balanzino, deputy chairman of the North Atlantic Council, a presentation document outlining guidelines for Ukraine's cooperation with NATO states within the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program. The submission of this document means that Ukraine has become one of the first NATO partner states whose relations with the North Atlantic bloc are being transferred into a practical framework. The first step of Ukraine's cooperation with NATO will be the participation of Ukrainian servicemen, together with American, Hungarian, and Polish soldiers in a special military exercise scheduled to take place this summer in Poland.
