FBIS3-44198 "drafr018_c_94020" FBIS-AFR-94-018 Document Type:Daily Report 27 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 27 Jan MB2701124094 MB2701124094 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN Communist Threat Tactics Will Not Get Support for NP -- Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 25 January in its page 6 editorial comments on the 27 South African Communist Party (SACP) members placed among the top 50 positions of the African National Congress' (ANC) election candidates' list. The National Party (NP) "complains that 'the strategically strong position into which the SACP has manoeuvred itself spells danger to the whole process of establishing a true democracy with a strong and growing economy'. That may be so, but Red gevaar [threat] tactics will not swing Black votes to the NP -- and we doubt whether it will swing any other votes to it either. We will have to accept, like it or not, that the Reds who were under our beds in the days of the total onslaught are now on top of the beds." THE STAR ANC `Deserves' Chance To Govern; DP Has Watchdog Role -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 27 January in a page 18 editorial states: "We recognise that the African National Congress has earned its place as the majority party in a government of national unity." "Whether or not one agrees with the tactics the organisation employed over the years, The Star believes the ANC under Nelson Mandela deserves its chance to govern. Thereafter it should be judged according to its performance in government, and be retained or removed by the electorate." The paper believes the "presence in government of small but talented and principled parties such as the Democratic Party [DP], as well as individuals from the National Party, Inkatha Freedom Party, Pan-Africanist Congress and others, is very much in the long-term interests of the country, and the ANC itself." Although the DP is "much too white, too upper- class and too unrepresentative" its presence in the government of national unity "will be invaluable." It will "play a watchdog role, help entrench a workable multiparty system, and defend the core principles to which it and its predecessors have been committed. Bear in mind, too, that proportional representation means every vote counts: the DP is not going to win the election, but every vote it receives will contribute towards its presence in parliament." BUSINESS DAY ANC's `Totalitarian' Style -- "The ANC is not yet the government, but already it shows a totalitarian-style inability to distinguish between its own narrow party interests and the national interest," points out a page 6 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 27 January. That is the BUSINESS DAY's explanation for the ANC's "request that it be permitted to purchase a building, presumably with a foreign donation, through the financial rand. It has also asked that duties be waived for the importing of motor vehicles, office equipment and T-shirts, all designed to assist the ANC's election campaign." The request was "cynically" framed in terms of the "'leveling of the political playing field'," and has gone to the finance subcouncil of the Transitional Executive Council for adjudication "where, it so happens, the ANC and it allies are well-represented." If the ANC "were as committed to 'transparency' as it claims to be, it would ensure that the subcouncil discussion on its request was open to the public. We hope the episode is not a preview of the open, honest government we can expect after the election." CAPE TIMES Government Urged To Avoid Lesotho Crisis -- "The South African government is wise to act with circumspection in the Lesotho crisis, and should do everything possible to avoid becoming involved, even if the government of the tiny mountain kingdom has asked that SA troops be sent to quell the fighting between rival army factions in Maseru," advises a page 8 editorial in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 25 January. "Pretoria, which has done well in mending its fences with Africa since February, 1990, does not wish to be suspected of reverting to a spoiling role in a neighbour-state."
