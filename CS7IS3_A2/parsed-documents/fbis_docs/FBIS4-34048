One eliminates sovereignty and the other "allows the people to set their own course." [PRESENCIA] How do you see the future of the Bolivian labor movement? [Soliz] Organized labor is in crisis all over the world. The globalization of the economy, the implementation of neoliberal policies, the freedom to hire, robots, automation, and scientific and technological advances have resulted in the loss of tens of millions of productive jobs, even in highly industrialized countries. These factors have also led to hypertrophic growth in the services sector and the informal economy. The result of the current social equation is disturbing: "The more modernity, the less employment." All indications are that wage earners in our time belong to the last generation of workers who have benefited from job security, social security, compensation, and paid vacations. Neoliberalism has no heart. Either you accept the employer's conditions or you have no job. There are countless legions of unemployed workers, including professionals, who are waiting to fill what few job openings there are. This cataclysm has had perverse effects on the Bolivian labor movement, especially since Decree 21060 of 29 August 1985, which shifted the axis of the national economy from hydrocarbons, mining, and the still weak nontraditional exports to the various aspects of drug trafficking. [PRESENCIA] What does drug trafficking have to do with Decree 21060? [Soliz] Although that criminal activity has obvious roots in the Banzer and Garcia Meza dictatorships, 21060 promoted the acceptance of bank deposits "without tracing their origin." The brains behind the operation, Jeffery Sachs, has "narcotized" the Bolivian economy, with all the imaginable consequences, ranging from the movement of former miners to the Chapare, to the infiltration of cocaine proceeds into political structures. That was the origin of scandals such as those of Huanchaca (involving the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement), the narcovideos (involving Nationalist Democratic Action), and the narcophotos (involving the Movement of the Revolutionary Left). The ensuing commotion obviously shook the foundations of the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB). Only now have its leaders begun to realize that their survival depends on their ability to bring together emerging sectors, such as trade associations, informal workers, hometowns, drivers, and craftsmen, without neglecting the interests of workers who still depend on a regular paycheck. In short, the future of the COB depends on its ability to expand its sphere of influence, on the one hand, and to raise the banner of national defense, on the other hand, so that the "Tupacamarization" of Bolivia can be contained. [PRESENCIA] What are you referring to? [Soliz] To the sinister capitalization law governing former state enterprises that have now been turned into mixed corporations. It will allow such entities as Bolivian Government Oil Deposits (YPFB), the National Smelting Enterprise (Enaf), the National Telecommunications Enterprise (Entel), and the National Railway Enterprise (Enfe) to be captured and "vampirized" by foreign capital. In the name of modernity, Bolivia is returning to the days of Patino, Hoschild, and Aramayo, who sucked the wealth out of the country and put it in foreign banks. The neoliberal doctrine is supposed to solve the problems of the third millennium with postulates from the 18th and 19th centuries: those of Adam Smith and Robert Malthus. YPFB, the Mining Corporation of Bolivia (COMIBOL), Entel, Enfe, Enaf, and Ende will be administered by transnationals. Our weak symphony orchestra will be transformed into a musical group in which each member will beat the drum at his own rhythm. Entel's foreign board of directors will decide whether it is worthwhile to install electricity facilities in Provinces of La Paz, Pando, Tarija, or Santa Cruz. Its decision will depend on a calculation of immediate profits, not on national interest. If the parameters of the World Bank or the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) had been followed, Bolivia would not have built its Cochabamba-Santa Cruz highway. YPFB's foreign board of directors may decide to sell our gas to Brazil through Argentine pipelines, or to sell it to Chile over the objections of the Foreign Ministry. In short, the self-determination that we won with the revolution of April 1952 will have been forfeited for the benefit of the new foreign "barons" of the former state enterprises. [PRESENCIA] What implications does the Popular Participation Law have for the labor movement? [Soliz] It is a chink in the system's armor that the popular movement should take advantage of. From a conceptual point of view, this law has an unquestionably revolutionary content. By recognizing the legal status of ayllus [tribes], tentas, captaincies, cabildos [town councils], and farmworkers' unions, it has taken a tremendous step toward eliminating one of the greatest injustices perpetrated over the five centuries of external and internal colonialism. This legal instrument is, at the same time, the antithesis of the Capitalization Law. The former tends to allow the people, joined together in municipal jurisdictions and neighborhood boards, to set their own course and their own priorities; the latter eliminates sovereignty and allows the exploitation of natural resources to benefit foreign interests, as has been occurring for the last 500 years. The former seeks to encourage citizens to plan for their future; the latter allows huge hypodermic needles to suck the lifeblood out of the country, with no benefit for Bolivians, as has occurred with silver, quinine, rubber, tin, and petroleum. The interests created by the two laws will be at loggerheads with each other over the next few years. The Capitalization Law is part of the New World Order that seeks to destroy the countries of the Third World. The Popular Participation Law can be an instrument for defending the fatherland, limiting efforts to shrink even further our sparse population, repopulating the provinces, and eliminating corruption. Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas, to the extent that he does not become more of a tool of the neoliberals, and Deputy Remedios Loza are the symbols of Popular Participation. Fernando Illanes and other plutocrats are the paradigms of the Capitalization Law. In that context, the COB must stand firm for the Popular Participation Law, fight to eliminate its negative aspects, and extend its scope so that it can serve as a point of departure for the COB and other political organizations in the popular sphere, such as CONDEPA, to move forward in the construction of the Productive Revolution, the Moral Revolution, and Participative Democracy. [PRESENCIA] How do you explain these concepts? [Soliz] Bolivia cannot allow its future to depend on food donations or on the precarious profits of drug trafficking; it must achieve self-sufficiency in food. This was achieved in Tiwanacu, in the Inca Empire, and in the Jesuit missions. It was also part of the Bohan Plan, proposed by the United States to Bolivia in 1942, during World War II, for the purpose of assuring food supplies. If we Bolivians do not carry out our own moral revolution, this postulate will become a pretext for foreign intervention and domination. The superstate installed by the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] needs no further comment. I would like to note, however, that along the lines of our moral revolution, I have submitted two bills that the parliamentary oligarchy refuses to discuss: The Fortune Investigation Law and the Law Against Impunity. The latter advocates the elimination of the statute of limitations on crimes against the state. Under the SAFCO [Administrative and Financial System for Government Control] Law, the statute of limitations is now 10 years. Given the current legal framework, the deals made as a result of the Capitalization Law will soon be immune from any scrutiny. The Popular Participation Law was proposed by CONDEPA, as stated in "The Book of the Endogenous Model," which we published last year. In that publication we also planned the conversion of the current inefficient, verbose, 18th-century parliament into an assembly of producers made up of all the economic and cultural sectors in the country. [PRESENCIA] What does the current social protest stand for? [Soliz] The people organized and turned into a vanguard by the COB have responded to attempts to demobilize them by staging hunger strikes, for the purpose of reducing hunger. People have risked their lives; they have faced death and repression to reduce the "terrible dependency" recognized by the president of the Republic himself. The active involvement of Aymaras, Quechuas, Guaranis, Amazon ethnic groups, and Mestizos in national affairs is the only possibility we have to avoid swelling the ranks of the slaves of the 21st century. That is why we are passionately in love with interculturalness and its incipient possibilities. This diversity is not an obstacle, but a creative component in a Latin America that has been united defensively so that it will not be excluded from the unknown world that is approaching.
