Context of Joint Exercises"] [Text] Orenburg City -- Forty years ago nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere were carried out at the Totskoye test site in Orenburg Oblast. Many of those who happened to be in the area of the dangerous experiment are suffering from the tests' effects to this day. Totskoye test site was recently visited by Brigadier General Leonard Holder Jr., commander of the U.S. Army 3d Infantry Division. He was studying preparations for the tactical exercises scheduled for summer 1994 in the southern Urals in the same places where the atomic epoch left its tragic mark four decades ago. Who is Holder? What constitutes a U.S. division? The U.S. general fought in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait and has a master's degree in European history. He once taught at a military academy. He has written a number of books on tactics and the art of warfare. The 3d Division, which Holder commands, is armed with the latest military equipment. It consists of over 18,000 people, 290 tanks, 600 armored fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers, 220 artillery pieces including nine multiple rocket-launchers, and 127 helicopters, 44 of them attack helicopters. The division has a signals battalion as well as mass destruction weapons protection and military police companies. It must be stressed that during Operation Desert Storm alone, which was notorious for its ferocity, the U.S division destroyed 105 enemy tanks and armored personnel carriers and captured over 800 soldiers. Currently 1,100 of the division's soldiers are in Kuwait or on the Turkish-Iraqi border. Holder is now apparently ready to pass on his combat experience of massacring an enemy to Russian soldiers, in particular the personnel of the 27th Russian Division at the Totskoye test site. Our division consists of 8,000 soldiers and is equipped with tanks, armored personnel carriers, self-propelled guns, mortars, and multiple rocket-launcher systems. The public in the Orenburg and Volga regions, concerned by the unfolding events, are protesting strongly against the scheduled exercises. Exactly what kind of joint "peacekeeping" tasks can be being tackled here is a complete mystery. A number of sociopolitical organizations in Samara and Orenburg Oblasts have adopted a joint statement in which they strongly protest about the two divisions' "peacekeeping" combat operations. Especially as these exercises are extremely dangerous in a region saturated with the defense industry. This area is Russia's bread basket. Let us not forget that the Orenburg region is a border oblast neighboring Kazakhstan. The saber-rattling could alarm peoples with whom we have lived on good terms. The statement was supported by the oblast organizations of the Russian Federation Communist Party, the Russian Communist Workers' Party, the Agrarian Party of Russia, the Socialist Party of the Working People, the "For Social Justice" voters' association, the Union of Officers, and veterans' and other organizations. A large group of candidates for Orenburg Oblast's legislative assembly has protested. The text of the document was handed over to Vladimir Nikolayevich Volkov, State Duma deputy from Orsk Electoral District No. 133 and member of the committee for defense questions, at a meeting with voters.
