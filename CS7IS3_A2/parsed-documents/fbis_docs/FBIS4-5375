Trade, Industry and Resources Minister Kim Chol-su leads the 16-member delegation to be joined by nine others at Marrakech. He will be one of the representatives from 123 nations there marking the conclusion of the global trade pact that comes after seven years of gruelling negotiations since the first meeting in Punta del Este, Uruguay, back in 1986. While protesters rocked the entire nation Saturday to oppose South Korea's signing of the agreement, Seoul officials declared they will go ahead to commit to the pact. But Seoul will delay signing the mandate for the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its annex protocol until after the parliamentary ratification, officials said. The mandate for the WTO includes country schedules in agriculture, industry and services. Kim will meet with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor while in the Moroccan city where the two officials are expected to formally discuss wider opening of South Korean market to American automobiles. He also meets other trade ministers from Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members for an informal conference to decide on the time, site and agendas to the APEC trade ministers' talks scheduled or sometime in September or October.
