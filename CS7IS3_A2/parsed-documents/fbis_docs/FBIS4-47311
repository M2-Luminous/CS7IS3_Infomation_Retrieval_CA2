M. Khasanov, Ufim Oil Institute; UDC 519.718] [Abstract] Random vibrations in technical systems may provide information on an object or its internal characteristics. Estimates of the dimensions of attractors and fractal properties of chaotic time series of observations may be used to identify motion in dynamic systems, and may diagnose changes in their states. Separation of true chaos from system noise is discussed. Examples from the field of oil and gas extraction are presented which illustrate the possibility of using these charateristics to monitor and control technological proesses using data obtained in the course of normal operations. It is shown that this information may be used to increase operational efficiency and extend the lifetime of equipment. Figures 4; table 1; references 13 (Russian).
