Two contingents of UN troops, comprising Jordanians and Argentines, were placed on alert Tuesday because of mounting tension at the site. About 100 Serb police and soldiers have held the bridge over the River Sava since they overpowered a UN control post manned by Nepalese troops on Friday. The bridge links the Croatian town of Stara Gradiska and the Bosnian town of Bosanska Gradiska. The UN secretary general's special envoy in ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi viewed the Serbs' seizure of the bridge as "unacceptable" and was exploring "various ways" to end the stand-off, UNPROFOR said in a statement. [passage omitted] UNPROFOR meanwhile reported "repeated attempts" Tuesday to shell the strategic Maslenica Bridge in southern Croatia, without saying which side was responsible. It said this constituted "one of the most serious violations" of the ceasefire concluded in mid-December by the Croatian Army and secessionist Serbs. Croatian media Wednesday accused secessionists from Krajina of having bombed the Meslenica area Tuesday, wounding two people. The Maslenica bridge, which the Croatian Army recaptured from Serb secessionists during an offensive in January 1993, is vital to Croatia because it links the ex-Yugoslav republic's northern and southern parts.
