The talks were held between the victorious Democratic Front, or UDF, of President Bakili Muluzi and the Alliance for Democracy, or Aford, led by Mr. Chakufwa Chihana. Interviewed in Blantyre, Aford's second president, Mr. Peter (Kaleso), said the UDF had failed to meet his party's demands. Mr. (Kaleso) said Aford had demanded that Mr. Chihana be appointed second vice president and, in addition, be in charge of either the foreign or home affairs ministries. Furthermore, Aford wanted seven ministerial portfolios including Justice, Works and Supplies, and Agriculture. Aford, which won all 33 parliamentary seats in Malawi's northern region during last week's general elections, sought a coalition with UDF which won 84 of the 177 seats in Parliament. The Malawi Congress Party of defeated President Kamuzu Banda won 55 seats, but the UDF said it would not form a coalition with it.
