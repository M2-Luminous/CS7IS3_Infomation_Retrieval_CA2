The general public asks why France openly makes itself the frontline enemy of the Cambodian nation and people. Have the latter ever done anything affecting French interests that prompts it to implement a dark policy toward Cambodia? To answer this question, it is worth recalling: 1. A long time ago in Indochina, France adopted a policy of constant support for the late Ho Chi Minh's Indochinese strategy of swallowing and incorporating Cambodia into Vietnam's Indochina. In 1949, the French Government of (Kuch Floret), the then master of Indochina, decided, without consulting the Cambodian side in the least, to give Cambodia's Kampuchea Kraom to the Vietnamese King Bao Dai with the aim of protecting French interests in Indochina. The action was an encroachment upon the rights of the Cambodian nation and people, who are the owners of Kampuchea Kraom, and the right to self-determination of millions of Cambodian people living there. Why did France sell out the Cambodian nation and people in Kampuchea Kraom? The reason was that it needed to include Vietnam's Indochinese federation in its arena for the purpose of serving its strategy in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Although Cambodia lost its race, France did not care about the country's destiny and future. What was important for it was its status as a colonial power. It did whatever it could to achieve its strategy. 2. In November 1991, when the Paris 23 October 1991 accord was being implemented, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas came to Phnom Penh immediately to combine two parties -- one belonging to Ranariddh of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and the other to Hun Sen of the Vietnamese puppet Cambodian People's Party [CPP]. The French foreign minister's intention was to encroach upon the Paris accord, which demands that the four parties achieve national reconciliation. France was opposed to the Party of Democratic Kampuchea and the Supreme National Council headed by Prince Norodom. In connivance with its alliance, France assisted the Vietnamese aggressor troops to reinforce the communist Vietnamese regime in Cambodia, enabling it to smash the Democratic Kampuchea forces. French General Loridon, commander of the UN forces in Cambodia, said blatantly that the Khmer Rouge [KR] should be smashed to pieces and so on. 3. Along with this, France and Akashi [head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia], as well as their alliance, forged a law making millions of ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia eligible to vote. They also declared that Vietnamese nationals would be allowed to flow into Cambodia at will. 4. Shortly after the elections organized by UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia], even though the communist Vietnamese puppet CPP was defeated, France further strove to immediately combine the communist Vietnamese puppets with the FUNCINPEC of Ranariddh to form a two-headed government and an army to attack Democratic Kampuchea and the people at Phnum Chhat and Stoung, and then Anlung Veng and Pailin as now. In January 1993, the French defense minister made an urgent trip to Phnom Penh, and later, the French General Staff chief and foreign minister also came in order to join in mapping out a military plan to (?attack) the Cambodian nation and people in the Democratic Kampuchea-controlled regions during the 16th dry season. 5. Now, despite serious defeats suffered by its alliance, the communist Vietnamese and the two-headed government, on the Anlung Veng, Pailin, Route 5, Poipet, and Sisophon battlefields, France remains adamant on further inflaming the war of aggression. It has summoned Prince Sirivut -- who is now having a good time in Paris touring, drinking, and dancing -- to see it so that more military aid can be provided for destroying the Cambodian nation and people in accordance with the strategy applied by its alliance and the communist Vietnamese in Cambodia and the region. The Cambodian nation and people as well as all patriotic forces are determined to continue to hold aloft the banner of the struggle to preserve the survival of the nation and race. Peace-loving countries in the region, including the ASEAN states, are vehemently opposed to the communist Vietnamese' and their alliance's policy of furthering war in Cambodia and Southeast Asia. They want Cambodia to recover national reconciliation and peace in accordance with the king's five-point national reconciliation plan.
