FR941227-0-00083 FR941227-0-00015 Small Entities Only one comment was received on the impact of the interim rule on small entities. That comment concerned potential over-zealous enforcement and is discussed in the comment section of this preamble. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), the Coast Guard considered whether this rulemaking would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). This rule is administrative in nature, making final an alternate method of processing violation cases. The total number of civil penalties levied against the public does not substantially change as the result of this regulation. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rulemaking contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U. S. C. 3501 et seq .). Federalism No comments were received on the federalism implications of the interim rule. The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment No comments were received on the environmental impact of the interim rule. The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rulemaking and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.lB, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. Procedural rules do not require environmental impact studies.
