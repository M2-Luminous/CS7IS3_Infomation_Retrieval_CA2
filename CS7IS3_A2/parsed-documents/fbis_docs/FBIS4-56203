The discussions began with the one single issue on the agenda of this first special session: cleaning up the country's domestic finances. Union delegations from several countries that flew to Havana to participate in the 1 May International Labor Day celebrations are present. ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon recalled the wide and intensive discussion on the main problems of the country's domestic economy. These discussions took place at each of the approximately 80,000 so called parliaments in the workplace, with the participation of 3 million workers and almost 58,000 cooperative farmers at 60,000 general assemblies and thousands of university students. [Begin Alarcon recording] The extensive consensus that clearly rises from those meetings is the will of the overwhelming majority of Cubans to continue resisting, to continue struggling to save the fatherland and its revolution. Within this same framework and in this same spirit we, the members of this national assembly, must now continue that process of collective debates and take the needed measures accordingly. [end recording] Before studying the document that was distributed among the deputies, Pedro Ross Leal, general secretary of the Cuban Workers Federation, took the floor. He told the assembly about the main issues that surfaced during the workers' discussions. He said this session is the best way to celebrate 1 May in Cuba at this specific moment. The main objective of this parliamentary encounter is to present the government with specific proposals, to suggest measures it can gradually implement to try and develop a systematic economic policy that could clean up the domestic economy. The proposals and measures are based on company profitability, work incentives, and preservation of the Cuban revolution's social achievements.
