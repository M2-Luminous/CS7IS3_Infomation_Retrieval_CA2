Shortly before his departure, the head of the Romanian Government delegation made the following statement to our correspondents: [Begin Cosea recording] We are leaving for a visit to the People's Republic of China. Our delegation consists principally of members of Romania's Council for Reform, but some delegates of the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Industry have also joined us. The visit is being made upon the invitation our council received from China's Committee for Economic Restructuring. We will have the honor of being received by China's prime minister and vice president. Practically every day, we will be able to meet with ministers and important personalities involved in China's reform. For us, this visit represents a very interesting element, because as everyone knows, the Chinese experiment has been a success. We are not interested in duplicating the Chinese model; such a thing would be impossible, as the structure and grandeur of that country compels us to observe the proportions. However, the key elements of the way in which their new economic apparatus and market economy was conceived might be used by us as well. We could use certain elements that our Chinese friends resorted to in the southern part of their country, in building up a very large potential for exports there and in attracting foreign capital. Therefore, this visit may be regarded as a trip to accumulate experience and training in view of the Romanian reform. I would also like to mention another important element of our visit, and that is the revival of the economic and political relations between China and Romania. This is to be a government visit, and the Chinese Government considers it as an event that could give impetus to the relations between Romania and China. China has become an economic world power and forecasts show that over the next 10 years, it will become one of the most important economic powers in the world. In my opinion, Romania should be very interested in not just profiting from that country's experience, but also in keeping close relations to that Asian area where such development is taking place and where we are interested and able to engage in exchanges and cooperation.
