Nuclear Industries of Brazil [INB], which in 1988 replaced Nuclebras and lost some of its original functions, is dismantling three subsidiaries: the Brazilian Uranium Co., Nuclemon Mining and Chemicals Ltd., and Nuclei [Nuclebras Isotope Enrichment, Inc.]. INB President Roberto da Franca on 26 January said: "We are readjusting the industry to its real needs." He added that by transforming the three subsidiaries into departments, the company will save $1.27 million per year. The number of INB board members (directors and advisers) will decrease from 43 to 14, while the the number of management employees will decrease from 83 to 56. The Nuclebras system was created in 1975, one year after the Brazilian-German Agreement was signed to support the activities of eight nuclear plants. So far, Brazil has only one plant, Angra-1, which was not a result of the agreement signed with the Germans and normally operates at half its capacity. In addition to that, the completion of Angra-2's construction is not entirely ensured. Angra-2 will be the first plant to use German technology (Angra-1 was negotiated with U.S. Westinghouse). As a result, the overall system has no clients for its products: uranium, enriched uranium, and fuel elements. Activities linked to the nuclear program have been decreasing slowly although the idea to build eight nuclear plants was discarded a long time ago. In 1986, two years before being transformed into the INB, Nuclebras and its subsidiaries had almost 6,000 employees. Currently there are 1,200. This number probably will decrease as a result of the changes being implemented by the INB. So far, Franca has not mentioned dismissals. He prefers to talk about reappointment, particularly in the experts' area, through accords being signed with Furnas [Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc.] and the National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), to which the INB is linked. Originally, Nuclebras worked with the following subsidiaries: Nuclemon [Nuclebras Monazite and Associated Elements, Ltd.] (monazite sand exploitation), Nuclam [Nuclebras Mining Assistance, Inc.] (uranium prospecting), Nuclen [Nuclebras Engineering, Inc.] (nuclear plant engineering), Nucom [Nuclebras Nuclear Plant Construction, Inc.] (nuclear plants construction), Nuclep [Nuclebras Heavy Equipment, Inc.] (nuclear plants heavy equipment), and Nuclei (uranium enrichment). Nuclebras also was linked to the Fuel Elements Plant (FEC). Currently, Nuclen belongs to Eletrobras [Brazilian Electric Power Company, Inc.] and Nuclep has been included in the privatization program. Nuclam and Nucom already have been dismantled and will be followed by Nuclemon, Uranium of Brazil (which was established together with the INB), and Nuclei. According to Franca, the overall complex will now operate with a president and four directors. Nuclei, which was built in Resende to enrich uranium through the jet nozzle process, was not successful. Franca added that the Brazilian Government has chosen to adopt the ultracentrifugation process developed by the Navy Special Projects Coordinating Board (Copesp). This is why the company is being dismantled and the personnel being absorbed by the INB. Uranium of Brazil, which was established to produce uranium and its concentrate, was out of operation for four years due to lack of demand on the domestic and international markets. The product could not be exported in view of its very low price. Nearly $8 million would have to be invested in Nuclemon to make the installation of a chemical plant to extract chloride [not further identified] from rare types of sands feasible. Waiting for Angra-2 The INB has a $40 million yearly budget resulting from the sale to Furnas, which operates Angra-1, of fuel produced in its Resende plant. With these resources, the company covers 50 percent of its expenses. The rest is supplied by the central government. Franca believes that when Angra-2 goes into operation the company will have the required conditions to become self-sufficient because then it will have one more customer for its fuel element. "Angra-2 is vital to the INB complex because it will ensure that uranium exploitation will continue, the FEC remains in operation, and we will achieve more technological knowledge," Franca said. INB investments for 1994 are not very significant: Franca plans to have from $2 million to $3 million to invest in new machinery for the FEC and to adapt Nuclei (where the process of enriching uranium through a jet nozzle was developed) for the production of pills [pastilhas], which are a component of the fuel element. Currently, these pills are only produced abroad. There are more ambitious plans: to sell FEC components to Siemens (German) reactors, which must be qualified abroad; to rent Uranium of Brazil facilities to the private sector; and several other initiatives.
