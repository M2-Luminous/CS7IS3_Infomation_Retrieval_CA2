[passage omitted] "Unilateral measures not in accordance with the dispute settlement rules of the World Trade Organization which were established as a result of the conclusion of the Gatt Uruguay Round are explicitly prohibited," said Masayoshi Takemura, the chief spokesman of the Japanese government. Indeed Gatt rules prohibit a country from unilaterally declaring a trade war on another. Without doubt, the Japanese themselves are very concerned about the trade surplus with the United States because of its effect on their own export markets. The pricing of these exports in yen -- which currently is high -- is affecting the sales of big export products like cars and electronic goods -- which makes them less attractive on world markets. This in turn is causing hardship to Japanese companies which have to meet production costs or go bust. Certainly the $59.3 billion trade surplus is also causing problems within Japanese industry. When U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor talked about taking retaliatory action against Tokyo, he did not state in specific figures what he considered a fair trade balance between the United States and Japan would be. But if the American side insists on zero, the Japanese reply of course would be a prompt "impossible". By insisting on zero, the United States would be expecting each Japanese to spend twice as much on U.S. products as each American spends on Japanese goods, because the US population is twice as large as Japan's. Simply charging that certain U.S. products do not sell well in Japan while they do well in other countries or regions, and using that as evidence that the Japanese market is closed, is akin to publicizing one's insufficient knowledge of how business is conducted. Corporate marketing efforts determine the trade balance between two countries, and politics and diplomacy merely provide the stage props. This is elementary business logic. Lifestyles differ from country to country. So do customer preferences and customs. The Hosokawa government is pushing ahead with deregulation to make its market more free. Japan has shown seriousness in reducing its trade surplus with the US in its latest economic stimulus package worth some US$200 million to get the Japanese economy moving. Coupled with the high value of the yen, U.S. products will certainly be more attractive to Japanese consumers when Japan pulls out of its current recession. Are some U.S. firms trying to reverse this direction by imposing managed trade controlled by the bureaucracy just for the sake of corporate profit? Obviously, Clinton was pressured by domestic concerns to resort to the Super 301 action on Thursday. According to an ABC News/WASHINGTON POST poll released before the U.S. President made the decision, a record number of Americans now favor imposing sanctions on Japan. The U.S. President himself realizes that Super 301 provisions can be a thorn in diplomatic relations. When Super 301 was last in use in 1989, Japan, Brazil and India were all targeted but sanctions were never used. Since the Hosokawa government is making conscientious efforts to reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States, Clinton might be wise to look back to 1989 and drop the threat of sanctions. Excessive U.S. pressure can delay Japan's economic recovery, which will also have an impact on the Asia-Pacific region, and trade retaliation is not the way to gain access to Japanese markets.
