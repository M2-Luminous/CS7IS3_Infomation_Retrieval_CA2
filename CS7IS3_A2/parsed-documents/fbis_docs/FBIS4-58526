[passage omitted] The cabinet also discussed and approved the Public Works Ministry's road works program for the year 1994-1995. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? [Samahah] This issue was discussed. The conference will be held in June, and the level of participation will be decided in another session. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? [Samahah] This information was broadcast over television and radio stations today. As for its impact on Lebanon, no matter what has been signed, we are always concerned that any agreement signed abroad should not have a negative effect on Lebanon. If you mean the Palestinians' settlement in Lebanon, as far as we are concerned, the Palestinian representatives are free to sign whatever they want; but we do not believe that this agreement has restored the Palestinians' legitimate rights to their land. Lebanon rejects the settlement for two basic reasons: First, we believe in the Palestinian people's right to return to their land and determine their future on their own soil. Second, we have the same concern for Lebanon's identity as an Arab country affiliated with its Arab homeland. As concerned as we are about the Palestinian identity in Palestine, we are also concerned about the Lebanese identity in Lebanon and this is [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? [Samahah] Let us wait and see what happens with the agreement. We are only concerned with our track. As the president said, we are concerned about the negotiations because we entered the negotiation process in Madrid as Arabs. The Lebanese, Syrian, and Jordanian tracks are still on the same level of progress. If the Palestinians opt out, this means that they have departed from the Arab fold. They have left the Arab fold and Arab unity for unilateral negotiations and the signing of an agreement. With regard to the negotiations, we are still committed to peace, but to a just peace based on the recovery of rights, to a comprehensive, just, and durable peace in line with the principles according to which Lebanon, along with Syria, Jordan, and the Palestinians, entered the negotiations in Madrid. [Correspondent] Christopher [words indistinct]. [Samahah] To start with, his tour is not over yet. He is still in Cairo. [Words indistinct] that he will return in 15 days. Let us wait and see. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? [Samahah] Who is [word indistinct]? Secretary Christopher or Lebanon? [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? [Samahah] Not only is Lebanon taking a stand. Lebanon has adopted a position based on its conviction that it went to Madrid based on certain principles and wants to pursue the negotiations through these principles. I do not believe we should interpret Lebanon's absence from Christopher's itinerary in this context. [passage omitted]
