Interior Minister Carlos Delgado Chapellin told reporters the street riots are part of a premeditated plan to disrupt public order and to tarnish the ceremony to change the government, scheduled for 2 February, and the work of the recently-installed Parliament. The minister said the situation in the country is normal and attributed the outbursts of violence to minorities that incite the students to those actions. Violent protests have broken out recently in Caracas and other cities, which resulted in the death of one young student on Tuesday. These protests, led mainly by students and masked protesters, have turned into violent street battles with the police. Disturbances broke out again today at the Central University of Venezuela [UCV] and other Caracas educational centers as well as in the north-central state of Aragua. The riots and the recent Banco Latino intervention, the second most important bank in the country; public protests; and uncertainty with respect to the financial system's soundness were described by National Convergence Leader Julio Cesar Moreno as part of a orchestrated plan to have President-elect Rafael Caldera receive a country in disastrous conditions. According to the leader of the National Convergence party, which was founded by the new Venezuelan president, these incidents are not spontaneous, but are intended to prevent the successful start of the next administration. Moreno attributed those interests to "an undercurrent that has its source entrenched in priviliges that were handed out at one time, especially during the past two administrations." Asdrubal Baptista, one of the new president's main advisers, pointed out that the new administration expects to place special priority on raising the people's standard of living, and that requires the support of all sectors of the population. Without going into details, Baptista indicated that next Wednesday Caldera will announce a far-reaching economic program, prepared by the president himself, which is expected to "split the country's history in two." The presidential adviser pointed out that the country's future will not rest primarily on its crude oil revenues, which has fallen from $20 billion at the beginning of the 1980's when the population totalled 13 million, to somewhere between $8 and $10 billion in 1994 with the population at 22 million. Finance Minister Carlos Rafael Silva said current President Ramon J. Velasquez, as head of the transition government, held one of his last meetings today to examine the country's social, labor, political, and financial issues.
