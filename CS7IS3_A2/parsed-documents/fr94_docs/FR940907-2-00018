SUMMARY: The Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces will hold a closed meeting on Wednesday, September 7, 1994, from 11:00 p.m. until 12:30 p.m. in Pentagon Room 2E877, Washington, DC. The Commission meeting will consist of a briefing from the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff discussing operational missions assigned to each Service. Material presented will include both classified and unclassified information in a format that makes it impractical to separate the two. In accordance with section 552b(c)(1) of Title 5 U.S.C. disclosure of such classified information would be contrary to the interests of national defense, therefore this meeting will be closed to the public. Extraordinary circumstances created by scheduling conflicts compel notice of this meeting to be posted in less than the 15 day required.
