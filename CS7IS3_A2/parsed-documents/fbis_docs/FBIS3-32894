According to Lecsy Tejeda, president of the National Stage Arts Council, a long and varied list of creators, including poets Dulce Maria Loynaz (winner of the Cervantes literature prize) and Eliseo Diego and the musicians Leo Brouwer and Gonzalo Rubalcaba received international awards last year. Prima ballerina Alicia Alonso, theater playwright Abelardo Estorino, film directors Alfredo Guevara and Tomas Gutierrez Alea, and cartoonist Roberto Fabelo also received important distinctions. Other artists in less mentioned fields such as applied arts and the circus also received awards. Despite the difficult economic situation in the country, which has compelled the government to eliminate or drastically reduce budgets, Cuban culture has been particularly productive during the past 12 months. If the international awards are categorized by field, Tejada said, the plastic arts are at the head (42), followed by film making (33), theater arts (19), music (12), and literature (10). In Tejada's opinion, the National Art Education System deserves a special mention because 23 of the people awarded are still students at its specialized centers yet they stood out for their talent and solid education. To honor all those personalities -- both those who are established professionals as well as the newcomers -- there will be an art gala at the National Theater in Havana on 11 February. A complete rundown of the 1993 awards will be presented at that event.
