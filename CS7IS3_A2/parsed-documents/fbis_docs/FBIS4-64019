Lawyer Oleg Mironov from the Russian Communist Party's faction fared best of all with over 41 percent of the votes. As the Duma Legislative Committee's Chairman Vladimir Isakov has reported, factions are entitled to put forward their own candidates to the president. When a Constitutional Court bill was debated, the lower house insisted on its right to put forward its candidates to that judicial body and amended the law's wording appropriately. In keeping with Russia's Constitution, the president is to make the final selection of candidates to sit on the Constitutional Court and the Federation Council is to appoint them. The Constitutional Court is made up of 19 judges, 6 posts in it are currently vacant.
