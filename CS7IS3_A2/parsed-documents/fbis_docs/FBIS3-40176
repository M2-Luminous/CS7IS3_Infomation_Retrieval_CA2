Most Projects Are Small in Scale and Low in Standards The average agreed amount of foreign investment for foreign-funded enterprises in the machinery industry is only $1.03 million. The amount of funds actually invested is even more pitifully small. In the Jiangsu and Anhui region, most foreign investment consists of funds invested by Hong Kong and Taiwan businesses and processing projects for Japanese businesses. In terms of technology, there has been no qualitative improvement in enterprises' products. This shows that in terms of the average amount of investment for the projects, China's machinery industry's utilization of foreign capital is characterized by small scale and low standards, and that it is necessary to develop joint ventures and cooperation with internationally renowned large transnational conglomerates, thereby raising standards and achieving upgrades. Projects Are Not Properly Distributed Basic parts and basic machinery are the weak links of the machinery industry, and the improvement of the overall standards of the machinery industry depends on the rapid development of basic parts and basic machinery. However the basic parts sector has utilized only $200 million in foreign direct investment, accounting for 4 percent; the average amount of foreign capital involved for the projects is only $630,000. Basic machinery mainly refers to machine tools. The machine tool sector has utilized only less then $300 million in foreign direct investment, accounting for 6 percent; the average amount utilized for the projects is only $650,000. In the two basic sectors, the scale of utilization of foreign capital and the average amount of foreign capital utilized for the projects are both small, and the technological content of products is low; the two basic sectors are far from meeting the demands of the overall development of the machinery industry. Therefore it is necessary to accelerate the development of the two sectors. The Problem of Increasing Pressure at Every Level and Pursuing Quantity in a One-Sided Manner Is Serious The purpose of developing foreign-funded enterprises is to make up for the insufficiency of domestically gathered funds, accelerate the optimization of economic structure, accelerate resource development, and promote technological progress. Nevertheless, some localities seek to increase the number of foreign-funded enterprises in a one-sided manner, increasing pressure at every level; they have made the quantity of foreign capital utilized an item of performance evaluation. As a result, in whatever areas foreign businesses have shown interest, there will be negotiations on those areas, and projects in those areas will be carried out accordingly. Joint ventures are established in a blind manner. "Whatever is put into the basket is considered vegetable." There is no bargaining with cooperation partners, neither is there any strategy or blueprint. Also, there is a lack of macro-level guidance. Pre-project Decision Making Is Ineffective Currently, when making preproject decisions on foreign-funded enterprises, many localities have failed to form strong teams to conduct investigation, study, surveying, and supporting analysis, and have instead operated in a perfunctory manner, grabbing everything available indiscriminately. The main manifestations include: 1) A failure to select cooperation partners carefully; 2) a failure to conduct extensive market investigations and a tendency to join the action in a hurry, resulting in redundant projects; 3) a failure to acquire adequate information about foreign businesses' credit status, resulting in being defrauded in some cases; and 4) a failure to conduct self-evaluation and consider future development in an adequate manner. A factory in Wuxi signed the contract on a joint venture project with a U.S. company before the assets of the Chinese partner had been evaluated. According to later evaluations, the assets were worth more than estimated in the contract; asset disputes thus ensued, casting a shadow over the development of the joint venture. The joint-venture contract on a joint-venture project between a factory in Anhui and ABB Corporation was signed when agreements on technological transfers and on plant, equipment, and land leasing had not been entirely worked out; in addition the contract provided that the technological-transfer percentage-retention payment should amount to 3 percent of net sales. Without an agreement on technological transfers, how could there be any technological-transfer percentage-retention payment? Is all this not very strange? There Is No Guarantee of Supporting Funds In developing joint ventures, the Chinese partners depend almost entirely on loans for funds. Since the middle of last year, supporting funds have been in short supply. As a result agreements on some new projects on which negotiation has been completed cannot be signed according to schedule; projects on which agreements have been signed cannot start to be constructed or be put into production operation according to schedule; and the projects which have been put into operation cannot function normally. Consequently, foreign businesses' confidence in project success has been lowered, and the rate of delivery of agreed investment funds has declined. Internal, External Management of Foreign-Funded Enterprises Is Not Strict 1. The property rights of Chinese partners do not have actual effects, and the responsibility for state assets is not clearly located. As the present period is a changing and transition period, the rights of local machinery-industry management agencies as representatives of state assets are not clearly defined. After becoming joint ventures, most enterprises' boards of directors contain no officials from government agencies. The supervisory agencies' management of enterprises is carried out mainly through the boards of directors, but most directors representing the Chinese partners work as employees in the joint ventures, and are thus unable to represent the interest of the Chinese partners in a satisfactory manner. 2. Foreign partners often take advantage of Chinese partners' weaknesses, such as being unfamiliar with the international market situation and lacking purchasing and marketing channels, by manipulating prices and fee standards, appropriating enterprise profits, and evading taxes, thereby harming the interests of the country. 3. The system of external management of foreign-funded enterprises is not yet characterized by an organic structure, and management work is weak. Quantity, Quality of Trained Personnel Cannot Meet Demands of Development 1. There is a lack of personnel competent for externally oriented economic activities. There are often no suitable people who can negotiate with foreign parties. Consequently it has been necessary to cope with the matter by using some people who are doing other work. Those people do not understand negotiating procedures, negotiation techniques, or international practices. Whatever the foreign parties say is accepted. All this has created a very difficult situation. 2. The people who participate in the management of joint ventures on the Chinese side are relatively low in quality and strong in self interest, and do not act in the interests of the country, resulting in damages to the interest of the country. For instance, a joint-venture company in Suzhou has five directors, three of whom represent the Chinese partner; but one Chinese director is siding with the foreign partner. As a result, control over the joint-venture company has fallen into foreign hands when the Chinese partner has a majority of the shares. Secondly, the professional competence is also low. Chinese partners' representatives play no effective role in the management of joint ventures. Chinese managers of some joint ventures lack knowledge about foreign languages, computers, and the accounting system, do not grasp the actual business situation of the joint ventures, and are thus unable to participate in management. 3. As the standards of some Chinese technical personnel in joint ventures are low, the process of nationalizing production has been slow, and it has been difficult to achieve a foreign exchange balance. Information Channels Do Not Function Well China does not yet have a complete information system providing enterprises with information about foreign capital. This fact has produced large adverse effects on developing foreign-funded enterprises. First, Chinese enterprises do not have detailed information about large companies in their respective industries around the world. If they want to form joint ventures, they cannot take the initiative in seeking joint venture partners, but can only negotiate with those who have come, resulting in a large degree of blindness and a low success rate. Second, as they do not know the situation of prices and purchasing channels for the equipments needed by the joint ventures on the international market, they cannot but let foreign partners make profits and harm Chinese interests by raising prices at will. Third, Chinese partners do not control channels of purchasing raw materials and parts needed by the joint ventures or channels of marketing joint venture products on the international market. As a consequence, foreign partners can import things at high prices and export things at low prices, thereby making huge profits in the circulation stage. At the same time the joint ventures would be suffering losses in terms of what the books show; thus the Chinese partners will receive no dividends and the state can collect no taxes.
