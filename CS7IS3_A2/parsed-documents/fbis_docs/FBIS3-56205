He was put forward by the Russian Agrarian Party. He was the leader of the Communist faction in the former Russian Parliament, the Supreme Soviet. In an exclusive interview for an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Ivan Rybkin said that his position is to work in the lower chamber of Parliament "for consensus, cooperation, and for the interests of all groups and factions of deputies to be taken into account as much as possible." The State Duma speaker intends to focus particularly on defending minority rights. "Not infrequently in our bitter Russian history has it been the case that it is precisely the minority that turns out to be right," stressed Ivan Rybkin. He said he will strive to cooperate with the president and the Government "within the constitutional framework," as he put it, and naturally maintain firm ties to the upper chamber of the parliament -- the Federation Council -- "on a principled and partner-like basis." Asked whether his political sympathies would affect his conduct in the Duma, Ivan Rybkin said: "I think not."
