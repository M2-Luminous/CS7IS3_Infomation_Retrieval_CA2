FR940907-0-00048 FR940907-0-00018 11. In the Memorandum Opinion and Order, we limited existing paging licensees to acquisition of two response channels in a given geographic area. Our intent in imposing this limit was to allow an opportunity for at least four existing paging licensees to upgrade their operations. NABER agrees that the two channel limit is useful as it relates to the initial auctioning of frequencies and that it should serve as a protective measure against the hoarding of response channels by a few carriers. NABER is concerned, however, that this rule could interfere with the orderly operation of the marketplace if maintained on a long term basis. It states that when paging licensees merge or are acquired, the response channels used with their systems should be transferred as an integral part of the new system. Such transfers would not be permitted under the current rules if the acquiring operator would end up with more than two response channels in a particular service area. NABER recommends that we modify the two channel limit to provide that, under certain conditions, existing paging licensees would not be subject to a limit on the number of response channels they could acquire at any time after the initial grants of the licenses for those channels are final. 7 Under NABER's proposal, aggregation of response channels would be limited to parties that acquire the channels as part of an existing system or to supplement their own existing system. It suggests that approval for such acquisitions be conditioned on a review by the Commission to ensure that the purpose of the rule would not be violated and that this scrutiny be relaxed after one year. 7 This description of NABER's recommendation includes clarifications that were submitted in its ex parte presentation to the Commission's staff on June 29, 1994. NABER had initially suggested that this problem be resolved by providing for waivers of the rule or by establishing a sunset date after which the rule would be automatically eliminated. 12. Our purpose in adopting the two-channel limit was to ensure that at least four existing paging licensees will have the opportunity to upgrade their one-way services. We now believe that once the existing paging licensees have had an opportunity to obtain response channels and the competitive structure of narrowband PCS markets have taken form, it will not be necessary to limit the number of response channels a paging licensee may hold. 8 We agree with NABER that in cases where paging systems are merged or acquired, the seller should be permitted to transfer the response channels as well. At that point, the response channels would be integral to the individual systems that are merged, and we see no reason to require that they be divested. We also agree with NABER that eliminating the rule immediately after the initial licensing auction could encourage frivolous bidding in the auction process. We therefore find that NABER's initial suggestion for providing a sunset period is reasonable, and believe that a period of two years will be sufficient to discourage such speculation. Accordingly, we are amending the rules to provide that the two response channel per market limit will expire two years after the date of initial license grant. We believe that this sunset provision addresses NABER's concerns and that additional scrutiny by the Commission of response channel acquisitions would impose an unnecessary administrative burden. 8 We do not believe that it is necessary to maintain the two channel limit in order to ensure a competitive market for narrowband PCS services in the long run. In this regard we note that our rules provide for twenty-one 50 kHz based narrowband PCS licenses with associated response channels at any geographic point. Nine of these response channels are 50 kHz (five nationwide, two regional, and two MTA channels) and twelve are 12.5 kHz (three nationwide, four regional, three MTA, and two BTA channels). Thus, existing paging licensees that operate narrowband PCS services using response channels will compete with other narrowband PCS licensees in each area.
