The proposal takes aim at the existing rules that require a large portion of the funds to go to the Finance Ministry's Trust Fund Bureau which uses it to finance public works projects, a practice that results in a limited return. Under an agreement between the two ministries, the remaining portion of the funds is invested largely in public bonds at the postal ministry's discretion. The study group, in a report presented to the director general of the Postal Savings Bureau, said the government should shift its policy on postal funds from the current rigid one to one allowing the Postal Ministry basic discretion over how to invest the funds. It said the amount of postal savings funds to be entrusted to the Trust Fund Bureau should be determined on the basis of funding needs for public works projects instead of entrusting all of the funds to it first. Among other proposals, the report gives high marks to one put forward by some economists that public entities issue bonds for postal savings funds instead of borrowing funds from the Trust Fund Bureau as at present. The Trust Fund Bureau lends such funds using postal savings funds entrusted by the Postal Ministry. The report is in line with a persistent call from the Postal Ministry to the Finance Ministry to expand the scope of its discretionary investment of postal savings funds. But the report has drawn a quick, cool response from the finance ministry. "It embodies the desire of the postal savings system to become a huge institutional investor. Nobody will understand it," a Finance Ministry official said. In fiscal 1993, that ended March 31, postal savings funds subject to the Postal Ministry's discretionary investment totaled 4.75 trillion yen. The sum of such funds is to increase to 5 trillion yen from fiscal 1994 through 1996 under an agreement already reached between the two ministries.
