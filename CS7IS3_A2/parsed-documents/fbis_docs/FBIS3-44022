However, the management of the country's largest harbor is determined to get over those problems as rapidly as possible. The year of 1994 offers Lobito commercial harbor new prospects because the blockade [bloqueio] which was in force between April and August of last year has now been lifted. Only 800 ships docked at that harbor in 1993, but it is expected that those figures will double by the end of this year. The management of Lobito Harbor has already been given permission to open an account with Totta e Acores Bank so it can manage its foreign currency earnings with complete autonomy. This is what Lobito Harbor Director Carlos Gomes had to say: [Begin recording] [Gomes] There is some optimism now because the World Bank has made available a certain amount of money to see if we can deal with these problems as urgently as possible. [Unidentified reporter] How much has it made available? How much? [Gomes] It has made available $7 million, but we know how the World Bank operates: now, there is still bound to be some red tape and there will be other difficulties before the money gets here. [Reporter] You did say it was $7 million? [Gomes] Well, what I am pinning my hopes on is that there will be more ships docking here to see if we can consolidate our gains by our own means, thereby getting shipowners and shipping agencies to deposit currency in the bank we have indicated.
