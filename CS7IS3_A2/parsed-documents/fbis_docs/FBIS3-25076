The president of the Higher Council of the Republic [HCR]-transitional Parliament agreed to answer our questions at a time when he has decided to distance himself from the political mission he has fulfilled since his election as head of the Sovereign National Conference [CNS] more than two years ago. The archbishop of Kisangani also replies to those who have criticized his action in recent weeks. [Grogna] Are the new institutions capable of bringing about reconciliation? [Monsengwo] I obviously have confidence in the HCR-Transitional Parliament because the desire of people from all sides to form part of it shows a real desire for reconciliation, agreement, and harmony. Partisan interests have been set aside. In addition, this Parliament was installed following the institutional order of the CNS. There is no reason why it should not go well. [Grogna] How is the situation developing? [Monsengwo] The commissions have been formed, the committee for the drafting of the transitional institutional text has been set up. Its work should not take too long. The work will probably be completed in 10 days' time. We will then be able to proceed to elect the prime minister and form the government. [Grogna] What was the decisive factor in bringing together the opposition and presidential circles? [Monsengwo] Everybody realized that they were dragging their feet. The country could not remain in such a situation for any longer. The legitimate government had no real power. This state of affairs did not allow the country to function normally. In addition, the monetary reform precipitated economic decline. The politicians realized the urgent need for a compromise. Involvement [Grogna] The CNS had already met with President Mobutu in July 1992 and a text had been published. It was recognized by all. That did not prevent deadlock. What enables you to say now that the problems have been smoothed over? [Monsengwo] I think that the deadlock arose because a section of the Zairian authorities, rightly or wrongly, did not feel sufficiently involved in the institutional order of the CNS, although it had been adopted by all groups. The MPR [People's Movement of the Revolution] and the army did not sign. This situation made it impossible to run the country in harmony. There was fairly deep discord. We therefore advocated political negotiations with all groups to arrive at a "common agreement" -- a purely political reconciliation. [Grogna] Do you really believe in Mobutu's involvement? [Monsengwo] He has publicly pledged to be involved and knows that the whole nation is watching him. His honor depends on him keeping his word. [Grogna] Is it not possible to fear new obstacles with the election of the prime minister, especially in view of the fact that Tshisekedi's UDPS [Union for Democracy and Social Progress] does not seem to be prepared to join the HCR? [Monsengwo] As far as I know, the UDPS does sit on the HCR. I do not see why Etienne Tshisekedi should not admit it. On the other hand, I am surprised that when discussions are taking place in Kinshasa, some people claiming to support the UDPS are staging demonstrations in Europe. There is reason to wonder what the point of that is. [Grogna] Can Tshisekedi still be prime minister? [Monsengwo] In a democracy, exclusion must be avoided. As a priest, I do not want to enter into arguments over individuals. I leave it up to the politicians to deal with this problem. The opposition will choose its candidate. He will form a government which will seek the HCR's confidence. Referendum and Elections [Grogna] What timetable will the HCR establish? [Monsengwo] The transitional Parliament will have to carry out a vote of confidence in the government. When that has been done, the government and the HCR will draw up a minimum economic program which will enable the partners to help us. When that program has been drawn up, we will have to think of the constitutional referendum. Then move on to elections: Parliamentary and presidential elections first, then regional and local elections. [Grogna] How long will that take? [Monsengwo] That will have to be discussed. In the draft agreement, we made provision for 15 months to arrive at the Third Republic. But we have already wasted four of them.... [Grogna] Is it reasonable to think of holding credible elections in Zaire? [Monsengwo] It will obviously be very difficult. It will take at least a minimum of preparations relating to telecommunications, media access for all groups, the repair of short-wave radio, a minimum of opportunities to travel around the country, observers.... The government and the National Elections Commission will have to examine the possibilities with the help of friends. Keeping in the Background [Grogna] You told the diplomatic corps that you were leaving room for secular people. Does that mean that you will leave the political stage? [Monsengwo] Yes. Gradually. My mandate is due to run throughout the transitional period, but, in the absence of a major crisis, the presidency of the HCR will be ensured by the vice presidents in turn. I will keep in the background more and more. [Grogna] Will you be able to abandon the HCR when the reconciliation starts? [Monsengwo] If there is reconciliation, there is no longer a need for me. I intervened for almost a year to try to settle the crisis. If they reach agreement, the state will be able to function normally. [Grogna] What do you expect from Belgium? [Monsengwo] Belgium and the other partners have said that they are prepared to help Zaire when a credible government is installed. I think they will do so. However, they will probably wait until the administrators prove their honesty. Political Troubles [Grogna] Amnesty International thinks that Zaire is in terrible trouble and many ethnic disturbances are taking place. Is this the result of the country's decline or a real political will? [Monsengwo] The Amnesty International report does not surprise me. The country has never been in such a situation, even at the height of President Mobutu's tough regime. In addition, I have never known ethnic troubles which were not of partisan political origin. It does not come from the people. [Grogna] What do you say to those who accuse you of being the president of higher presidential circles or of having betrayed the CNS ideal? [Monsengwo] I do not know whether those people have much information about Zairian politics. When those people were making those statements, we were reaching agreement in Zaire. I think that those people have never read the document containing the constitutional provisions. They do not know the spirit or the letter of it and have not followed the strategy established to ensure that the CNS is not betrayed. [Grogna] In particular, some people have accused you of having sent faxes to Butrus Butrus-Ghali to advise him against allowing the Tshisekedi government delegation into the UN General Assembly.... [Monsengwo] I have not sent faxes to the UN secretary general. I have only written to him once, in reply to a question on the dispatch of humanitarian aid. If there are other faxes, they are forgeries and there is reason to wonder why some people want to deceive the world and disrupt public opinion.
