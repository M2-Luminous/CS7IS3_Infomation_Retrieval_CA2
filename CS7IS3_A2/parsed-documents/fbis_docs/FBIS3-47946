But that last test is perhaps the most difficult in his drawn out quest to implement sweeping reforms. For Hosokawa, who has ardently pursued the introduction of measures necessary to eradicate rampant political graft in Japan, the clearance of his package through a special panel of the House of Councillors was a welcome development. But he is also keenly aware that the race is not over. The full upper house will meet Friday to put the bills to vote. Although the governing coalition holds a slight majority in the 252-member upper chamber, it is uncertain whether Hosokawa can secure the votes he needs due to an anticipated revolt from some members of the largest force within the coalition, the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ]. Fearing wrath from the public and other coalition members if the bills fail, the SDP leadership has attempted to persuade its potential rebels to support the government package. But some of its lawmakers openly say they will cross the party line mainly to object to the introduction of a new electoral system for the House of Representatives, which will drastically change the nation's electoral map and would further reduce the SDP's presence in national politics. Among them, Masao Kunihiro, a staunch opponent of the package, reiterated his opposition, saying, "To ask me if I am for or against it is like asking the pope if he is a Catholic." But a senior coalition official, who refused to be identified, said the SDP leadership appears optimistic about the course of the final vote in the full upper house. "Mr. Kubo (the SDP secretary general) keeps saying, `The prospects are very grim,' but he has not looked so serious from yesterday," the official said. Another factor clouding the fate of the government package -- and of the Hosokawa cabinet -- is the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), knocked out of power last August after nearly 40 years of rule. An unexpected revolt by Tomoichi Hoshino, an upper house LDP legislator, in Thursday's vote at a session of the second chamber panel, surprised the LDP, which had voiced confidence in unity among its upper house members. Man Sasaki, chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs Committee in the upper house, told reporters the party will take all possible steps to prevent more of its legislators from voting with the government in the final vote. Hosokawa, apparently in hope of securing the enactment of the reform legislation by the January 29 close of the current Diet sitting, stated there is room for further negotiations between the coalition and the LDP for a final compromise on the reforms. While Hosokawa said he is ready to meet with LDP President Yohei Kono to bridge the gap between the two sides, Kono ruled out the idea. The two men are both now in difficult positions. Hosokawa would have to step down along with all other cabinet ministers or dissolve the lower house for a general election should he fail to achieve his pledge to push the reforms through by January 29. If the government reform package became law with no modifications, Kono would also face intense pressure from within his party to take responsibility for failure to change the legislation in its favor. "He would eventually have to quit on his own," one LDP legislator noted.
