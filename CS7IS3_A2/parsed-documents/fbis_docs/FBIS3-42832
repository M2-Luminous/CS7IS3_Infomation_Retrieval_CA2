In 1992 Volodymyr Pylypchuk was elected deputy chairman of the Economic Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of NBSYe [[expansion not given]. Since the first day of Ukraine's political independence, he has consistently called for securing Ukraine's economic independence through radical economic reforms. Today Volodymyr Pylypchuk is also involved in coordinating the training of free-market economists to take the place of officials currently in office following the 27 March election. [Levytskyy] A great deal has already been said about the state of the Ukrainian economy. Unfortunately, skeptical and negativistic views prevail. Some politicians have gone so far as to "predict" how much longer our independent state will survive. I have asked you to give me this interview because you belong to that circle of people who continue to believe in economic reforms and envisage great prospects for Ukraine as a prosperous state. [Pylypchuk] We all need a healthy dose of optimism. If we accept the opposite notion, that "everything is heading towards the end, towards collapse," we are still left with the question: and what then? What should we tell people to do--head for the cemetery?.. If we view our problems from a philosophical vantage point, we know that every decline is followed by a rise. It is assured by people who know what needs to be done and how to do it. The Commission on Economic Reform and Management of the National Economy has a conception for overcoming the crisis, a program for halting inflation, conducting accelerated privatization, developing a market infrastructure, stabilizing the economy, and introducing a monetary unit. The first thing we need to do is halt inflation. But to do so, we have to eliminate the budget deficit. Our program calls for revoking all tax benefits except those granted to organizations of invalids, who are unable to compete with able-bodied people. We must change the tax base and switch to taxing turnover or sales volumes. It is also important to lower taxes. This will cause the business activity index to rise and ultimately replenish the budget. Business enterprise will expand and firms that have registered where taxes are lower will return to Ukraine. Our program envisages conducting privatization and receiving a portion of the earnings from this. This will result in reducing the expenditure side of the budget because the state will stop financing private organizations. As a consequence of this policy, branch ministries, committees, concerns, and their local organs will be eliminated. The third important element in reducing budget expenditures is to decrease spending on the upkeep of the armed forces. Ukraine currently maintains a rather large army. This army must be transformed into a professional force and then made smaller and more efficient. Inasmuch as Ukraine has a negative foreign trade balance, we have worked out a mechanism for eliminating the deficit in foreign trade. This can be achieved by increasing exports, which is also linked with privatization. Privatization is the only thing that can serve as an incentive for work, an incentive to increase output and improve production quality. It is also necessary to revoke export licenses and lower import duties. To prevent exports from being sold at dumping prices, we must introduce economic regulation. To overcome the current crisis, it is important to convert and reconvert the military-industrial complex and sell weapons. The whole world trades in arms in compliance with the regulations established by the world community. [Levytskyy] An important element in Ukrainian reforms must be decreasing imports. What do we need to do to achieve this? [Pylypchuk] We need to recooperate the national economy to enable us to produce domestically the goods that are now being imported from abroad. It is also essential for us to allow the sale of facilities producing unfinished production by tender (on condition that products that are in short supply in Ukraine are manufactured here). To restrict nonvital imports, we need to pursue a wise isolationist policy and focus on buying raw materials and high technologies. The state must renounce conducting trade. Private businessmen will maintain the proper balance--that is, they will buy only as much as they can afford for the money they earn from sales. In addition, we must intensify our search for minerals, especially fuel resources, and pump deeper for oil and gas on existing fields. [Levytskyy] In a market economy, there must be a balance between the supply of goods and the supply of money. Is this difficult to achieve with the kind of disequilibrium in the economy that we are currently experiencing? [Pylypchuk] In order to balance the supplies of goods and money, we must treat land, factories, and plants as goods, prohibit the issue of credit if there are no goods and financing when the balance is in the red, as well as the sale of reserve funds by the National Bank in the form of credits. [Levytskyy] Representatives of government structures often stress that the crisis is the result of objective circumstances--of the fact that the structure of the Ukrainian economy is so tied to Moscow. How much of today's crisis is caused by postimperial objective conditions and how much by officialdom's subjective actions? [Pylypchuk] If someone needs to explain the reason for failure, he will always find an excuse. The easiest way is to blame external factors. No one denies that these exist, but one must always look to oneself for the cause. Today's situation is the result of a failure to implement reforms, of pursuing a zigzagging and inconsistent economic policy. [Levytskyy] One frequently hears that Ukraine has lost her chance. I disagree with the skeptics, but will it take our country a very long time to make its way out of this crisis? [Pylypchuk] We are quite capable of reforming our economy. There are methods and mechanisms that would allow us to do so rapidly. Ukraine's potential is sufficient to halt production decline in 1994 and begin building up the national economy. All we need is the will and a new way of thinking. [Levytskyy] Representatives of government structures have another excuse for their failures: the price of energy supplies has increased 10,000-fold since 1990. Their opponents say that in 1990, a metric ton of oil cost 10 cents, which is not true. Can you explain this discrepancy? [Pylypchuk] This is both true and false. I recall that before the crisis, a metric ton of Russian oil cost 12 dollars. Today's price is eight times as great. But the multiplying effect has also comes into play. When the costs of raw materials rise, these costs are multiplied in processing, in the production of Group A products, Group B products, and in the retail trade. The law of multiplication is in operation, as in calculating the gross social product. On top of this, there are internal factors of inflation. The external factor in inflation could have been neutralized. We sold Russia a certain amount of metal, grain, and meat. A wise government should have made an agreement: we will sell you a package of goods, but if your price rises, ours will rise accordingly. Then the price shock would not have been as strong. But some in our government did not know or understand this, while others were openly working to collapse Ukraine's economy. Let me just say that the situation in Ukraine is quite different from that in the former countries of the socialist bloc. For example, Poland has a monolithic society, which never wanted to be part of the empire. There is a segment of our society that is very fond of the empire and looks back on it with nostalgia. Fortunately, time is on our side. People are beginning to understand that a drowning man's hope of salvation lies solely in himself. [Levytskyy] You mentioned nostalgia. Journalists have learned that Yu. Zvyahilskyy has agreed to transfer a portion of our industrial projects to Russia in exchange for our debts. What can you tell us about this contract, and how are such problems resolved elsewhere in the world? [Pylypchuk] The general rule is that loans are secured by property. If they are not paid back, this security goes into effect and the property is put on the block. Unfortunately, I do not have all the documents that Zvyahilskyy signed, and so I cannot draw a firm conclusion regarding this action. I would like to assure you that Ukraine would be able to engage in trade without incurring debts with all countries if the state would hand over the conduct of trade to businessmen. The state should have no say in what anyone should buy, at what price, with whom to break ties and with whom to establish ties. Businessmen will do a much better job of it. Government structures have proved totally incapable of directing new processes. [Levytskyy] A conflict broke out in December between the National Bank and the commercial banks. National Bank officials assure journalists that had it not been for the National Bank's timely intervention, the commercial banks would have paralized the financial system. The heads of commercial banks charge V. Yushchenko with incompetence and are demanding his resignation. The arguments put forward by both sides appear persuasive to nonspecialists. Which side is right? [Pylypchuk] There is more truth in what the commercial banks say. Although they, too, are not without sin, because they hold up the funds of their clients for a time and use them as if this money were their own. This happens because the National Bank does not perform the functions with which it has been charged. There is a decree in force in Ukraine, under which accounts that are settled late are subject to taxes and a fine. The National Bank is unable to control this and therefore takes steps that do not serve the interests of the banking system as a whole, let alone the specific situation in which Ukraine currently finds itself. Prohibiting banks to advance credit can be compared to prohibiting stores to sell goods. This is absurd... [Levytskyy] Until recently, the so-called money changers used to buy up convertible currency at every intersection. For the last two weeks, we have been witnessing the reverse in Kiev. They are trying to sell currency. What has caused this abrupt change? [Pylypchuk] This phenomenon is linked with the banking system. As long as the National Bank advanced credits that were not backed by resources, many people tried to save their money in hard currency. When the Supreme Council prohibited the National Bank from issuing money unbacked by resources, the exchange rate came to a halt. Insofar as winter is a passive season in agriculture, the National Bank's position will be firm and consistent. When the production sphere is activated, the dollar exhange rate will drop. Some people understand this and hope to exchange their hard currency at the highest possible rate. Secondly, the process of privatization has begun. Enterprises are selling their stock. Those with dollars are investing their capital in property. [Levytskyy] Is it true that 29 Russian banks are operating in Ukraine at this time, and if so, what impact do they have on our economy? [Pylypchuk] There are branches of Russian banks in Ukraine. Opening branches of foreign banks is a universal practice, because their funds benefit the country in which they are located. Under inflationary conditions, however, there is a danger that the profits from conducting hard currency auctions do not benefit the Ukrainian economy, that they do not remain in Ukraine. [Levytskyy] You frequently meet with economists from abroad. How well do they understand Ukrainian problems? I am particularly interesting in how well these are understood in Poland. According to reports from Warsaw, Poland's foreign policy towards the east is changing to reflect a greater emphasis on Russia. [Pylypchuk] Since I am not only an economist but also a politician, I do not wish to make any comments about what is happening in Poland. But I want to stress that it is necessary to take a sober look at who has come to power in Russia and on what platforms. Poland was a part of the empire which Zhirinovsky is planning to restore. The conduct of some politicians reminds me of the rabbit that places its head into the mouth of a serpent. [Levytskyy] What benefits did Ukraine derive from its membership in the CIS? What is your attitude to the idea put forward by the national-democratic forces of Ukraine that a qualitatively new entity should replace the CIS--the Baltic-Black Sea Community? [Pylypchuk] I am among those who support the creation of a Baltic-Black Sea Assembly. Above all, because of the military doctrine of the Russian Federation, which wants to interfere in the internal affairs of independent states, in interstate relations, and to settle conflicts with the help of its armed forces. The aggressive policies of the USSR have not disappeared. They have been passed on, along with many other things, to Russia. Today, this policy is being proclaimed openly. The countries that lie between the Baltic and Black sea need to understand that if Russia succeeds in swallowing up Ukraine, one of them will be next. [Levytskyy] Especially in light of the fact that as Radio Liberty has reported, Russian diplomats are now resorting to a new tactic: "If you do not give us a peacemaking mandate and credits, Zhirinovskyy will simply take them." [Pylypchuk] There are forces whom Zhirinovsky wants to swallow up in Russia itself and in other countries who understand that such a policy will lead to a conflict that will shake the world. For that reason, the UN and the developed countries of the world should listen to the fears being voiced by the countries that lie between the Baltic and Black seas and realize that the threat is real. I am confident that they will adjust their attitude to the new states that have emerged on the territory of the former USSR and will make the granting of aid to the Russian Federation conditional on its rejection of territorial claims on its neighbors. [Levytskyy] The election campaign has already started in Ukraine. Judging by the results of two democratic elections in Poland, a large number of people will cast their votes based on a party's attractive name or a candidate's effective speech, rather than on the political platform being proposed. Inasmuch as these elections are deemed to be especially important, what should voters focus their attention on? [Pylypchuk] There is a rule that every people gets the kind of government and parliament that it deserves. If people do not want to stand up against it, they deserve this absurd situation. Sociological surveys indicate that the majority of people has now come to understand that the parliament and government should consist of professionals. I am onfident that the electorate will cast its votes for the reformist forces. As I said earlier, the democratic bloc has a program for solving the crisis and it has people who can accomplish this. [Levytskyy] But you surely agree that far from all voters will bother to study the program in any depth. They will vote for reform, but the choice will be between two concepts: "change everything immediately" or "make changes that have been well considered and are possible to effect." [Pylypchuk] There is a grain of reason in both concepts. Our success will also depend on the speed with which reforms are conducted. But we should not repeat the mistakes made by our neighbors. [Levytskyy] The presidential campaign in the Crimea has entered a heated phase. The campaign has a distinctly anti-Ukrainian bent. People are being drawn into the pro-empire camp with populist slogans about cheap gas and oil. Will Ukraine be able to maintain her territorial integrity? [Pylypchuk] Let me answer you first as an economist and then as a politician. From an economist's standpoint, Crimea's separation would be to Ukraine's advantage. Per capita income produced in the Crimea is lower than in Ukraine but higher than in Russia. Ukraine supplies the Crimea with water and electricity. This would leave Ukraine with 3.5 billion dollars of net profit annually. While the Crimea produces only some three percent of Ukraine's national income, it consumes 18 percent. Hence it requires large subsidies. But no state in the world gives up territory without a fight. I think that all politicians understand what a change of borders leads to when one of the sides does not agree to this change. There are already many examples of this on the territory of the former USSR. I do not believe that politicians will take this route. When a new boundary is drawn across the land of an owner without his consent, this land is always drenched with blood. Those in the Crimea who are pouring gasoline over the ground must be stopped, because later it will make no difference who throws the first match--chauvinists or nationalists! [Levytskyy] Thank you for this conversation, and I hope that there will be no new boundaries in Ukraine and no blood! [Pylypchuk] I hope so too. Allow me also to extend my Christmas greetings to your readers and wish them that troubles and evil pass them by and that their children bring them joy.
