Yablokov, chairman of the Interdepartmental Commission for Environmental Security at the Russian Federation Security Council, to a reader's question: "Will Russia Remain a Nuclear Dump?"] [Text] Every now and then, newspapers report that nuclear waste from abroad is being dumped in Russia. Is our country really going to remain a nuclear dump for the whole world? (Sergey Gudkov, Podolsk) [Yablokov] In accordance with agreements signed before 1992, nuclear waste is brought to Russia from certain European countries (Finland, Bulgaria), where nuclear electric power stations built with Soviet participation are in operation. And although the Russian Law on the Protection of the Natural Environment bans the bringing in, storage, and burial of nuclear waste (Article 50), the Ministry of Atomic Energy believes that this ban does not concern bringing in spent nuclear fuel for treatment, since the intergovernmental agreements were concluded before the law was adopted. There is no such intergovernmental agreement with Hungary. This one has been concluded at ministry level. Our commission believes that we are not obliged to take fuel for treatment from Hungary. We also believe that when it fulfills its commitments concerning the treatment of spent nuclear fuel, Russia should return the waste from the treatment to the countries it came from. That is also the State Duma's position. An interdepartmental commission is now striving for a review of the concept of a closed nuclear cycle, which emerged during the arms race. This was necessary in order to obtain plutonium, necessary for preparing nuclear weapons, from the treatment of nuclear fuel. Now there is no such need. And it is sensible to store waste from nuclear electric power stations over a specific period in special storage pits and then bury it like normal radioactive waste, which is what the United States does, rather than treating it.
