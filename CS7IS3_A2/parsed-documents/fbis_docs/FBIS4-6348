Executive Order 168 authorizes the issuance of multiple entry visas valid for six months to Chinese nationals coming to the Philippines for business or pleasure. Under the law, Chinese nationals are defined as persons who hold passports from the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. The president said granting this type of visa to Chinese nationals is in line with government's policy to attract and promote trade, investment and tourism as instruments of the country's economic growth and national development. The new law allows the issuance of multi-entry visas to Chinese nationals by Philippine Foreign Service establishments without prior authorization from the DFA [Department of Foreign Affairs], provided the applicant meets the following requirement: -- duly accomplished visa application form; -- passport valid for six months beyond the period of authorized stay in the Philippines; -- valid entry visa to the next port of destination or reentry to the country of origin; -- confirmed return or onward package ticket; and, -- proof of bona fide status as tourist or businessman. The visa fees are $1OO for a multiple entry visa valid for six months; $50 for multiple entry visas valid for three months and $25 for single entry visas valid for three months. [passage omitted]
