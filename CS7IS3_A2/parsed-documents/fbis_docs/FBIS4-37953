The troops broke through southern defences, heading toward the bay of Aden late Saturday. The Hiswah power station and Radio Aden are on the coast road. Renewed fighting broke a six-hour calm which fell as Sanaa declared a ceasefire from midnight. The truce call was immediately rejected by leaders in the breakaway south. Northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih were also trying to advance on the Little Aden oil refinery, 18 kilometres (12 miles) west of the southern stronghold. The south accused the north of taking advantage of a lull in fighting to move troops into position for an assault on the refinery. Radio Aden stopped all broadcasts late Saturday before the northern troops arrived. They were camping out among the transmitters on Sunday. They were also installed in the Hiswah power station which was put out of action three days ago when a fire broke out there after a raid by northern warplanes. Queues of cars formed at Aden petrol stations only to find that tanker trucks had been unable to get through roadblocks barring the route to the refinery. Civil war broke out in Yemen on May 5 after rival leaders failed to resolve differences over running the country. Former tribal, conservative North and Marxist South Yemen merged in May 1990. The south last month proclaimed itself independent.
