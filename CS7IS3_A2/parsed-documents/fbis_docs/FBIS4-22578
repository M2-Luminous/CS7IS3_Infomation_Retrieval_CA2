At a news conference in Kiev on 28 March 1994, he assessed the first round of elections as a victory for the national-democratic forces, inasmuch as, in his opinion, a majority of the candidates from the Ukraine association of democratic forces, of which Rukh was a member, were either elected in the first round or proceeded into the second. Vyacheslav Chornovil believes, as before, that the main deficiency of the election campaign was the ruinous absence of unity among democrats, and the main virtue of the elections was that the voters, despite all the cunning of "the party in power" and the imperfection of the majority law, were nonetheless able to find their bearings and cast their votes for the democrats. Regarding the polls conducted by local organs of authority in the Republic of Crimea and Donetsk and Lugansk Oblasts to clarify the attitude of the population toward bilingualism, dual citizenship, and tighter integration of Ukraine in the CIS, Vyacheslav Chornovil declared: "Let them take polls, these polls do not have any legal force, this is the competence not of individual oblasts but of the people as a whole." With respect to the outbreak of pro-Russian separatism in the Crimea, Chornovil said that it had occurred because the economic situation on the peninsula is much worse than in neighboring Kuban or Rostov Oblast of the Russian Federation, and he expressed the proposition that "if the situation were better in Ukraine, perhaps we would be dealing with Kuban separatism, and, without interfering in the internal affairs of Russia, we would also support it." In general, Vyacheslav Chornovil acknowledged that the elections that were held were democratic, although the "number of violations exceeded the average permissible level in such cases in other countries. Nevertheless, the news conference became not so much a summing up of the campaign as a definition of Rukh's plans for the future. Concerning the new Ukrainian Supreme Council, Chornovil said: "There should be a clear-cut structure in parliament, not an assemblage of independent deputies." But if a parliament is not elected, then, in the opinion of the leader of Rukh, the tactic of his organization will be that he will agree to the existence of the present Supreme Council, which "should not grant the president of Ukraine additional powers." Vyacheslav Chornovil declared that in this case the current parliament should adopt the so-called little constitution of Ukraine, that is, new laws on the presidency in Ukraine, and on local organs of authority and self-government; it should also change the majority election law to a proportional or mixed one. But the present law on elections, Chornovil thinks, is advantageous to Leonid Kravchuk, since it blocked the path to parliament for many political parties. Vyacheslav Chornovil let it be known that, as previously, Rukh remains in opposition to Leonid Kravchuk, but it is not insisting on presidential elections, inasmuch as "it is ridiculous to elect a president without knowing what he will be: the head of the executive authority, or the head of state who only receives ambassadors and meets with students graduating from school." Therefore, Chornovil declared that the reaction of Rukh in the presidential elections will be "calm" until such time as the president's powers are defined. As regards strengthening the positions of the extreme national-radicals, Vyacheslav Chornovil said that some of their patriotic statements impress him; however, in the main their actions do not please him, since it is "always important to know who is leading them, when they zealously fight against both the communists and against, in their opinion, the rotten democrats." The Rukh leader asserted also that the second phase of the Rukh congress will be held on 15-16 April of this year; it will sum up the election campaign, transform Rukh into a more structured political party, and finally determine the strategy and tactics in the elections for president and to local organs of authority. Afterwards, Vyacheslav Chornovil answered several questions from NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondents. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Do you not think that the polarization of Ukraine into eastern and western Ukraine will intensify after these elections? [Chornovil] I do not think so, when I look at the lists of candidates that we have. Perhaps even the center of Ukraine is in some ways obviously getting closer to western Ukraine. This is a very interesting aspect. I am very troubled only by southeast Ukraine. Not the northeast and not the south, but specifically the Donbass, where the communists have won. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Is Rukh prepared at least 95 percent to switch to opposition to the existing authority in Ukraine? [Chornovil] It is ready, but we still do not know what this authority will be. But if we form our own authority? Or if we are able to create a coalition? Why not go for a coalition for the sake of preserving the state, if there are normal forces for this? We only will not go for a coalition with the communists. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Can you name your probable allies? [Chornovil] On economic questions we will form an alliance with forces from the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, with its demands for partial centralization of the economy, and with the Labor Congress of Ukraine, with its social orientation of reforms. All of them have some form of reformism. The spectrum will be narrower on political questions: We will support an alliance only with other national-democratic forces. We are not as rigid as they, and we are for a unitary Ukraine, but also against all political autonomies, bilingualism, and other similar slogans with which some leaders of the "left" of center are toying. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But what do you think of the rumors that are appearing that in this complicated political situation Rukh once again could go for definite support of the president, and even for an alliance with him as a bearer of executive authority and a potential reformer? [Chornovil] Concerning cooperation with presidential structures, we approached the president only with a demand to replace some of his representatives in the localities who are violating the law. We never raised any questions about presidential representatives that Leonid Kravchuk pushed in everywhere who were even a little different from the purely Communist Party nomenklatura. I do not understand why such close cooperation with the president and his structures is being attributed to us. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Possibly this is occurring because of the error of the Rukh thesis about electoral opposition to Leonid Kravchuk? [Chornovil] I do not entirely agree with this. But then why not? Why can an opposition not be constructive? You will recall how at the beginning of 1992 Leonid Kravchuk suddenly spoke sharply against the CIS charter, and we supported him at that time, but within a month we once again began to criticize him for inconsistency. But also within a month we declared that Leonid Kravchuk, after discarding the CIS charter as a document, was putting elements of this charter into practice. This is the tactic of Rukh's political struggle.
