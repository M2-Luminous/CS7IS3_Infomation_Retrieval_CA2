Although the two documents called for an end to the two-year-old embargo, one urged president Bill Clinton to do so unilaterally while the other directed him to first seek support from the European allies and Russia. The amendments, both passed with votes of 50-49, have yet to be approved by the house and signed by Clinton before becoming law. The Clinton administration, which all along favors lifting the ban, has failed to register support from its European allies and Russia. While the white house "certainly understands the Senate's sentiment," Clinton's spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said it refuses to do it alone. "The president does not support unilaterally lifting the arms embargo," Myers told Cable News Networks' "inside politics" program. "He thinks that would have implications for other multilateral actions that we've taken in places like Serbia." As debates on the unilateral actions were raging in Washington, Secretary of State Warren Christopher was preparing for Friday's meeting on Bosnia in Geneva with foreign ministers from Britain, France, Germany, Greece and Russia. Although the Clinton administration has time and again said it would press other nations to lift the arms ban, it is very unlikely to succeed. Visiting French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe reiterated on Wednesday Paris' strong objection on the ground that, among other things, more weapons flowing in would worsen the war, endangering its troops in the Balkan republic. France is the largest contributor of UN peacekeepers in Bosnia. Its objection to lifting the ban was echoed by Russia and Britain, which also have troops in the former Yugoslav Republic.
