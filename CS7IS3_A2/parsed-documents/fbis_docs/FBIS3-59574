As early as last October it was agreed that ZMD was to be removed from the parent company Mikroelektronic and Technologiegesellschaft (MTG) and taken over by the holding companies of the Commerzbank AG, Frankfurt/M., and the Dresdner Bank AG, Frankfurt/M., each taking half. The privatization is under committee supervision. For Saxony's economic minister, Kajo Schommer (CDU), this sale marks an important technological policy goal for the Land: "Saxony will remain a standard in microelectronics in the production of user-specific circuits." In Saxony about 100,000 jobs depend directly or indirectly on microelectronics, Schommer said. East Germany's other two significant microelectronics firms in Erfurt and Frankfurt/O. have already been privatized by their trusteeship. The support for this project is considerable: According to statements of the trustees, Siemens AG will provide knowhow and personnel in areas of technology, production techniques, marketing and sales for three years. There is a fairly good chance that ZMD could develop as a supplier for Siemens, not least through licenses which Siemens will make available. The Free State will provide the liquidator for MTG with DM40 million for research and development for ZMD and an additional DM10 million until 1996 for the purchase of property and buildings. The trusteeship will support the undertaking for the next three years with opening financing in the amount of DM135 million. Schommer thought that it would be clear in 1995 that faith in ZMD had been justified. There is still quite a bit to be done: Last year ZMD achieved sales of DM7 million. According to the designated president of ZMD management, Kurt Garbrecht, this year sales should amount to DM15 million, but this is not yet guaranteed. For 1994 he said that the objective would be sales of DM50 million and in 1995 DM100 million. Costs should be covered by production by 1996. Garbrecht, who most recently was leader of the internal microelectronics division at Siemens, estimated financial needs up until 1995 (loss coverage and investments) at approximately DM130 million. MTG liquidator Wilhelm A. Schaaf confirmed that with the support of the trusteeship, the Land of Saxony and the EC there is complete financing for ZMD. He said that the ZMD plan was firm.
