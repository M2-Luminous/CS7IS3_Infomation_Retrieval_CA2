FR940217-1-00002 FR940217-1-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 772 RIN 3206&hyph;AF76 Interim Relief AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is publishing a proposed change to regulations reflecting administrative case law on taking personnel actions to provide interim relief under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. These changes also reflect OPM's initiative to sunset the Federal Personnel Manual. DATES: Comments must be received on or before April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments may be sent or delivered to Marjorie A. Marks, Chief, Family Programs and Employee Relations Division, Office of Labor Relations and Workforce Performance, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, room 7412, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary D. Wahlert (202) 606&hyph;2920. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA), Public Law 101&hyph;12 codified at 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A), provided that prevailing parties in an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) shall be granted the relief provided in the decision, and remaining in effect pending the outcome of any petition for review. OPM published final regulations on this subject in the Federal Register on January 31, 1992 (57 FR 3707&hyph;3715). The final regulations authorized agencies to take interim personnel actions to provide a prevailing applicant or employee the interim relief ordered in an MSPB initial decision. Interim personnel actions include, but are not limited to, interim appointments, interim repromotions after demotions, and interim within-grade increases. After these regulations were published, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) issued an administrative decision in Leonard Ginocchi v. Department of Treasury , DC315I8910527, February 19, 1992, which explained MSPB's interpretation of the WPA with regard to interim relief. In Ginocchi, the Board ruled that it would not look behind the agency's determination under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A) that returning an employee to the workplace would be unduly disruptive. It also held that an agency making a determination of undue disruption did not have to keep the employee on excused absence (administrative leave), but could place the employee in other duties. OPM believes this facet of Ginocchi is a reasonable and persuasive interpretation of the WPA. Since this interpretation is inconsistent with a portion of OPM's regulations (which was based on a more restrictive interpretation), OPM is proposing to delete that portion of the regulations_section 772.102(d). This change will help reduce any confusion by practitioners before the Board about their respective rights and responsibilities regarding interim relief. In addition, OPM notes that guidance on preparing official documentation to effect an interim personnel action is currently located in Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 296&hyph;33. The current regulations provide that interim relief actions need to be prepared in accordance with that guidance and other guidance contained in FPM Chapter 296. Consistent with OPM's initiative to sunset the FPM, OPM proposes to delete references in the regulation to the FPM. E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation OPM has determined that this is not a major rule as defined under Section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it applies only to Federal employees. List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 772 Administrative practice and procedure; Government employees. U.S. Office of Personnel Management. James B. King, Director. Accordingly, OPM proposes to amend part 772 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: PART 772_INTERIM RELIEF 1. The authority citation for part 772 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 1302, 3301, 3302, and 7301; Pub. L. 101&hyph;12. ยง772.102 [Amended] 2. Section 772.102 is amended by removing paragraphs (d) and (g); redesignating paragraphs (e) and (f) as paragraphs (d) and (e) respectively; and by removing the semicolon and the word ``and'' at the end of redesignated paragraph (e) and inserting a period in its place.
