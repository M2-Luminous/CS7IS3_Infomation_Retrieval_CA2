This refers to Palair-Macedonia [Macedonian flag-carrier], Vardar-Air, Macedonia-As, Avio-Impex, Meta, and Falcon. The reason for the ban, as the letter says, is the huge outstanding debt for the servicing of these airlines' overflights. We have learned from our ministry that contact with Yugoslav bodies was established; they were called on to postpone the implementation of the decision by at least one month in order to enable the companies to repay their debts. The letter also says that the same measure was applied to airlines from Bulgaria and Turkey that have incurred arrears in payments.
