The adoption was made at the end of the one-day NATO foreign ministers meeting which were attended by 16 NATO member states. The NAC said that major political changes on the European continent following the break-up of the former Soviet Union also have potential proliferation implications that required close attention. It added that a number of states on the periphery of the alliance continue in their attempts to develop or acquire the capability to produce WMD and their delivery means or to acquire illegally such systems. "Similarly, the growth of indigenously developed WMD-related technology has also made proliferation more difficult to control," the NAC said. "In addition, there is the risk that a proliferator might seek to profit or gain political benefit by selling WMD and their delivery means, relevant technology and expertise," stated the meeting. The NAC agreed that current international efforts focused on the prevention of WMD and missile proliferation through a range of international treaties and regimes. The most important normsetting treaties are the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC). It pointed out that the BTWC can be strengthened through efforts in the field of transparency and verification. It also added that the allies furthermore supported other relevant efforts in the field of non-proliferation and arms control. "The alliance policy on proliferation is aimed at supporting, reinforcing and complementing, not at duplicating or substituting the aforementioned treaties and regimes," the NAC said.
