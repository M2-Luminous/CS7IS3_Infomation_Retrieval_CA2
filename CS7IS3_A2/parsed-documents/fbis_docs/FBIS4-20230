Ibanez report: "Roca Warns Socialists That He Will Withdraw His Support From Them Unless Corruption Is Thoroughly Combated"] [Text] Madrid -- Miquel Roca yesterday gave Felipe Gonzalez the fuel for the government to carry on, but he warned him that that assistance could end unless the Socialists are able to use it correctly right now, namely to make every effort to combat corruption. He held the government responsible for success or failure in that task. CiU [Convergence and Union] thus made it clear that it stands by its parliamentary pact with the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party], but also that it could soon be broken off if the Socialists do not regain their credibility. The CiU spokesman based his [Congress of Deputies] state of the nation speech on confidence and hope -- confidence because of the perceptible signs of economic recovery, and hope that the Socialists will prevent corruption from handicapping recovery. Roca confronted Gonzalez with evidence that the confidence in the government, which is essential for investments and job creation, "has been seriously eroded." "In order to restore that confidence," he told him, "you, Mr. Prime Minister, must convince society that the struggle against any instance of corruption will be led and directed by the government itself; that you, Mr. Prime Minister, accept full responsibility for this action." Roca was very cautious in describing the current corruption scandals -- "a disturbing and irritating phenomenon" -- but was emphatic in his warning to the government about the Catalan nationalists' support for the PSOE. When calling on Gonzalez to regain day by day his now weakened credibility, he warned him: "For this you will not lack the necessary stability, but you could lack it if you do not achieve this." Roca, who did not miss the opportunity to proclaim that none of the improvements in the economic situation is unconnected with CiU's initiative or cooperation, asserted the urgent need for a new urban rents law and the urgent implementation of the labor reform, and the need to amend the social security system and to modernize and streamline the functioning of the administration of justice. Slowness and Impunity With respect to corruption, he said that slowness is a party to impunity. Accordingly, he proposed that Congress define a shortened legal procedure which, without detriment to legal and procedural safeguards, would ensure rapid handling of corruption cases. "Society should learn quickly whether or a not a report is well-founded; it should know whether the report is untrue or if corruption is a fact," Roca stated. The CiU spokesman also proposed making it a requirement that before taking office, those holding public posts of some importance be examined by a parliamentary committee on their professional and personal careers. Last, in view of the biased leaks concerning the debates of the committees of enquiry, he proposed that they cease to be secret. Roca's speech was applauded by several Socialist deputies and received in silence by his group colleagues, which caused laughter among the People's Party seats.
