In reality, however, such assertions are nothing more than political speculation. Questions of granting the Crimea the most extensive economic powers will be discussed. Regarding the question of state financial policy, including the introduction of a particular currency regime, it is exclusively the jurisdiction of Ukraine's state organs, not of individual administrative and territorial formations. This is, in particular, stressed in Ukraine's Supreme Council decree of 24 February 1994 "On the Status of the Crimean Autonomous Republic in Accordance With Ukraine's Current Constitution and Legislation."
