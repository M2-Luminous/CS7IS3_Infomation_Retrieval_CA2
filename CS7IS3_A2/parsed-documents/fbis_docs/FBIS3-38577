It Is Identified as Missing Cessna. To Be Brought Up on Friday"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] [Text] Rorschach, 2 Feb (ATS) -- The wreckage discovered in Lake Constance on Tuesday evening [1 February] is that of the Cessna 425 which disappeared nine days ago. The twin-jet plane was identified by underwater cameras, the St. Gallen canton police said on Wednesday in a press conference. The operation to recover the plane will be carried out on Friday. Preparations began on Wednesday. The recovery work will be carried out with caution, in case radioactive material is present within the wreckage, a representative of the Swiss Alert Center explained. Experts from the Paul Scherrer Institute of Wuerenlingen for the monitoring of radiation are at the scene. However, it is very unlikely that cesium will be found on board. Prague Rules Out Transport of Cesium Bruno Fehr, chief of the St. Gallen criminal investigation department, does not believe radioactive substances will be discovered. In Prague, whence the Cessna came, an assurance has been given that the customs checks found nothing suspicious. Moreover, the two businessmen on board were certainly known for their trade in rare metals but not radioactive metals. The pilot's partner said she knew nothing of such a cargo. According to Mr. Fehr, in addition to the police and the two German businessmen, two Czech women were on board the plane when it crashed. However, there is no certainty about that. The St. Gallen police are focusing their efforts on identifying the victims, the police chief explained. The investigation into the radioactive metal and the activities of the businessmen is in the hands of the German criminal investigation department in Wiesbaden. No Bodies Detected A camera from the Langenargen (Germany) Lacustrian Research Institute transmitted pictures of the Cessna's registration number -- D-IEFW -- at 1100 hours [1000 GMT]. However, it was impossible to see whether there were bodies inside the plane which is lying on its back. Preparations for lifting the plane have already begun, Peter Gruetter, commander of the St. Gallen canton police, explained. Weather permitting, the wreckage will be brought to the surface on Friday. A representative of the Federal Civil Aviation Office also said that the Cessna from Prague, which was preparing to land at Altenrhein, was due to take off again en route for Paris. Mysterious Order Several aspects of the investigation are still unresolved. In particular, it is not known why one of the businessmen told Altenrhein airport that he would bring a money order worth more than 4,000 francs. Moreover, investigations have been carried out in cooperation with the Zurich-Kloten airport police, following the emergence of rumors about the presence of radioactive material in the duty-free goods depot.
