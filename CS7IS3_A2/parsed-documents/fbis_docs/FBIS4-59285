Asked when the earliest evidences was found in this connection, Mahmoud Mohammadi said the earliest signs were discovered three weeks ago. "Naturally after the discovery of the first clue, the embassy staff tried to complete their investigations for the discovery of all the (eavesdropping) devices, and this needed time," Mohammadi said in answer to a question as to why the issue was not disclosed earlier. Of course, he said, the British officials saw themselves facing a big scandal as soon as they felt the first disruptions in their bugging system, thus accusing Iran of collaboration with I.R.A. The accusations covered by the British press were mocked even by other European press, some of them describing the British claims as "sheer propaganda."
