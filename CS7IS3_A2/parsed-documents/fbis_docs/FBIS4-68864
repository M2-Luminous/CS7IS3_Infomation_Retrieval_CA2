Usually countries with a market economy have a tax on profits. In ratifying the Law on Taxation of Income, the Supreme Council took into consideration the fact that over the period the Law on Taxation of Profits was effective in Ukraine, our businessmen understated profits, converting them to wages. Would it not be more advisable to introduce in Ukraine, instead of a tax on income, a tax on profits? Such a step would be more advantageous both for foreign investors and for many of our country's enterprises--primarily state enterprises, which specialize in the production of traditionally labor-intensive output. Today they are forced to pay higher taxes on income than enterprises whose production output does not relate to labor-intensive sectors. Enterprises of the coal and metallurgy industries therefore find themselves in an unfavorable situation, while those of light industry (where wages comprise a significantly lower proportion of the producer cost structure than in the above-mentioned sectors) are in a more favorable situation. If we shift to a system of taxation of profits, all enterprises will then be operating under the same conditions. Bearing in mind Ukraine's experience with the effects of this method of taxation in 1992, however, it is necessary to introduce a new method and mechanism for collecting this tax. Thanks to studies conducted over the course of 25 years (from 1965 through 1990) on the problem of the machine-building complex of Ukraine, the following rule was discovered: There exists a stable, approximately 1:1 ratio between wages and profits in this sector. The ratio is a bit different in other sectors, but it is also stable, the wages being less and the profits more. Under our present-day conditions, it would be advisable for all sectors to have the ratio between wages and profits on the level of 1:1. Such a ratio has existed over the course of decades in countries of the market economy of Europe and the United States. It is based on the fact that simultaneously characteristic of human labor are the output of a necessary product (wages) and a supplemental product (profits). Based on the constancy of this ratio, therefore, we may introduce the following method of establishing a tax on the profits of enterprises of all forms of ownership and the mechanism for withholding it. When an enterprise receives from the bank, let us say, 1 billion karbovantsy in cash for the payment of wages, the bank must immediately remove 350 million karbovantsy as tax on profits from the settlement account of this enterprise and deposit it into the budget, to the appropriate account of the Ministry of Finance--this under the condition that the norm for tax on profits is 35 percent. The proposed method of establishing the tax on profits and mechanism for withholding it has the following advantages: it will be impossible to artificially understate profits, for if an enterprise attempts to do this, it will also have to lower its wage fund, which would be economically disadvantageous; not a single production enterprise will be able to evade timely payment of the tax on profits, and the budget will receive tax revenues in timely fashion (this is the main advantage of the new method); the method is strongly anti-inflationary; an enterprise will not be able to overstate its wage fund, for if it does so it will also have to increase the withholdings from its profits in the form of tax going to the budget; enterprises will be interested in augmenting their noncash accounts and in taking cash out of the banks only for wages, for if they take out cash for other purposes, 35 percent of the amount will have to be paid as tax all the same; the tax inspectorate will be able to focus its attention on the withholding of taxes from those enterprises that are involved mainly in cash transactions, i.e., with trade enterprises, while taxes will be collected from production enterprises at the banks.
