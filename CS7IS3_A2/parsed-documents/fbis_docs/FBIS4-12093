In addition to the two presidents, the Egyptian prime minister, defense minister, and foreign minister also participated in the bilateral Egyptian-Syrian talks. The Syrian side included the vice president and the country's foreign minister. The focus of the al- Asad-Mubarak talks was on the efforts for a compromise in the Middle East, although some regional and international issues of mutual interest such as the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Somalia were also discussed. The unscheduled visit by Hafiz al-Asad to Egypt is significant since within a few days Warren Christopher will be visiting the Middle East region to reactivate the wheels of diplomacy to achieve this compromise. In the course of this visit, the U.S. secretary of state is to strive to resuscitate the almost lifeless Washington- brokered Arab-Israeli talks. These talks--which were resumed after a prolonged hiatus in the wake of Clinton and al-Asad's meeting in Geneva--were suspended by the Arab side after the al-Khalil [Hebron] massacre. Informed sources predict that after Christopher's visit and within the next 10 days these talks will resume in Washington. At present, the crisis in the Middle East will play a decisive role in the array of political forces in this region. Therefore, between Tel Aviv and Damascus is Cairo, which is the base of the compromise and peace brokering. While Damascus continues its role-playing in the peace talks, it is also a center for the Palestinians opposed to this compromise and is a leader of the diplomacy of intense conflict with the Zionist regime. On the other hand, Cairo is the base of the colluding Palestinians and the center of the compromising talks between 'Arafat and Tel Aviv. Despite all this, the situation in the region, especially in the wake of the Cold War and the departure of the Soviet Union from the Middle East arena on the one hand and Mubarak's efforts for attaining a special position in Washington's Middle-East policies on the other, has brought Egypt and Syria closer together. In fact, whenever Damascus wishes to gauge the viewpoints of the United States and of the Zionist regime or to convey its own views to them the Damascus-Cairo axis becomes active. Of course, the interim policies and strategies transpire amid these tussles, more or less. In any case, Damascus has a decisive role in the Middle East crisis both during wartime or in the course of peace talks. Neither Washington nor Tel Aviv and Cairo can nudge the process forward without taking into account al-Asad's viewpoint on regional developments, certainly not on a longstanding crisis such as that in the Middle East.
