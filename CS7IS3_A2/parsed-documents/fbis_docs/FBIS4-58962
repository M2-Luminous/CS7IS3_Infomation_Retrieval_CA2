He told MENA that in a telephone conversation with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, the Yemeni foreign minister welcomed the Arab League Council decision to continue its efforts and contacts to stop the fighting between the sons of the homeland. The Yemeni foreign minister's statement that the Yemeni crisis is an internal affair, as cited by news media, does not mean a rejection of the Arab League's help in ending the fighting, he said. The ambassador said the Arab League is continuing its contacts with the Yemeni and Arab leaders in an attempt to stop the bloodshed. He said Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah has agreed to receive a delegation from the Arab League Secretariat headed by Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, the assistant Arab League secretary general for military affairs. Asked about reports that Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid had requested Jordanian mediation to stop the fighting, al-Qadi said he has no information about this. He noted that Jordan has continued to call on the Yemeni leaders to begin negotiations and renounce force as a means to solve differences. He pointed to Jordan's role in signing the Pledge and Accord Document, which he described as the best option of the Yemeni people to solve differences and preserve a unified Yemen. The Jordanian ambassador hoped the brothers in Yemen will come to their senses and stop battles as soon as possible so that differences can be solved through dialogue and understanding.
