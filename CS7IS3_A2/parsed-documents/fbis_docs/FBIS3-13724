President Hafiz al-Asad held telephone contacts with King Husayn of Jordan and Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi. He received a telephone call from President Clinton in which the peace process and the Security Council resolution were discussed. A meeting of the Arab parties in the Washington talks is expected to be held soon in order to discuss the resumption of these talks. This is in light of international developments and the conviction of the peace process cosponsors and the entire international community about the importance of carrying out intensive efforts to implement the Security Council resolution and achieve peace in the region. This is not the first time that Syria has taken the initiative and contributed to the rescuing of the peace process. It has done so several times, because it sensed, as it senses now, a serious international trend to see a just and comprehensive solution in the Middle East, based on the resolutions of international legitimacy, and leading to a real and lasting peace. Security Council Resolution 904 was unanimously adopted. It stands as a clear and strong condemnation of Israel and its practices. For the first time in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the resolution calls for international protection for our kinsfolk under occupation. Prominent Security Council members demanded that the protection be real and broad, and include our kinsfolk in occupied Jerusalem. For his part, President Clinton announced that peace with Syria is of the utmost importance, and hailed Syria's sincere peaceful trends. It is natural that Syria works to employ this international trend in the interest of the just and comprehensive peace for which it is calling, and in a way that puts Israel to the test. Israel should either bow to the will of international peace or drop its last mask and face the world's strong criticism and whatever measures the international community might take. Undoubtedly, the peace process -- despite Israel's intransigence and procrastination -- took an important step forward in the adoption of Security Council Resolution 904. Tel Aviv's rulers have no excuse for evading the requirements of the peace process, especially exchanging land for peace. Israel's rulers will no longer be able to use the Arab desires for peace as a pretext, because they are the most sincere desires. The international community, especially the United States, has felt Arab eagerness for peace and Syria's serious contribution to repeatedly salvaging of the peace process from collapse as a result of Israel's practices and the designs of its rulers. As all admit, peace cannot be made in vacuum, but should be based on the resolutions and the objective bases represented in Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, and the principle of land for peace. In other words, Israel has no choice but to return the occupied Arab territories and recognize the Palestinian people's national rights. These stand as the essence of the Security Council resolutions. Any Israeli delay and procrastination designed to evade these resolutions will only increase tension in the region, and may lead to new brutal actions by Zionist settlers that will be firmly and decisively rejected by the international community. If Resolution 904 asks Israel to disarm its settlers, then any new criminal action by settlers will surely lead to broad international protection in the occupied territories. However, Israel is skillful in the arts of procrastination and maneuvering. It has been carrying out a large-scale policy of deception since 1948. It has always shown a disdain for the principles and resolutions of the international community. For more than two years, it has been aborting the peace talks in Washington. If these talks are expected to produce a just and comprehensive solution in the Middle East, the international community should place its full weight behind efforts to implement its resolutions, support its credibility, and end the Israeli occupation. It is important for the international community to double its efforts so it will not face new Israeli massacres that may destroy the whole peace process.
