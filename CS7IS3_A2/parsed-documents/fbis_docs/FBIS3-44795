Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi recognized the very complimentary nature of the Chinese and American economies and the fact that bilateral trade had surged in recent years. Trade between the two hit $23.2 billion in the first 11 months of last year, well ahead of 1992's total of $17.5 billion. However the U.S.'s annual review of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status remains a problem. "It is unwise to add political conditions to the MFN as a means of pressure," she said. "It will only damage our bilateral economic and trade relations." She described as "unacceptable" the recent remarks by the U.S. Government that "China's human rights and arms sales will be part of the MFN." The U.S. has until June to decide whether to extend China's status for another year. Analysts said the review mechanism has thrown a cloud of uncertainty over Sino-U.S. relations and the both business communities. "We hope to get rid of the shadow haunting the MFN issue so that bilateral economic relations can make greater progress," Wu said. She is scheduled to preside over an important meeting in Washington this April along with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown. The eighth session of the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade aims to shed light on a wide range of issues concerning bilateral trade and investment. "I believe this session will be positive for our bilateral relations," Wu said. During the meeting, China will stage two large-scale trade and investment fairs. High-profile business people from the two countries will be present and seek co-operation in a series of major projects, Wu said. But she did not mention the specific fields to which these projects belong. Wu said China attaches great importance to developing Sino-U.S. economic relations, but she maintained that trade conflicts "should be tackled through consultation rather than unilateral retaliation." She revealed that she would discuss with Brown the discrepancies in trade statistics between the two countries. Meanwhile, Wu expressed optimism about China's re-entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before the Gatt's Uruguay agreement takes effect. "China is now qualified to resume its contracting party status in Gatt," she said. And she added that issues raised by other Gatt contracting parties "are liable to be solved through earnest consultation." Gatt has decided to convene the 16th session of its working party on China in Geneva in March, which Wu said will be a strong stimulus to China's bid to rejoin the world trade body. She said a uniform foreign exchange rate, adopted since January 1, will further mesh China's trade regime with Gatt rules.
