A great victory was scored in the first trial. In 1993, two gas fields were discovered. One was the Ledong 15-1 Gas Field and the other was the Dongfang 1-1 Gas Field. Before this, great discoveries had been made in prospecting for natural gas in Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin. A decade ago, when drilling a well in the contracted Yacheng 13-1 zone in Yinggehai, the U.S. company Arco discovered the Yacheng 13-1 gas field, which is now under construction and will deliver gas to Hong Kong in 1996. As there are three gas fields within the same basin, what kind of prospects does it indicate? Hence, this reporter interviewed Wang Yan, president of China National Offshore Oil Corporation not long ago. President Wang, who took part in the prospecting and construction of the first offshore well in our country and once acted as the head of Nanhai Xibu Petroleum Corporation, was extremely familiar with the Nanhai Sea waters. For him, he carries in his mind a map depicting the situation of natural gas prospecting in Nanhai. As introduced by President Wang, Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin is a rapidly subsiding basin, and such a geological environment is the best place for producing and storing natural gas. This point is also illustrated by the current situation of the Yacheng 13-1 gas field in this basin which has already been proved. The gas-bearing sandy layer of the Yacheng 13-1 gas field is over 100-meters thick. With the assessment and calculation made by a third independent party--U.S. Geological Advisory Company, which is a worldwide authority, the reserves of this gas field are estimated at 100 billion cubic meters, which is equivalent to an oil field with 100 million metric tons of crude reserves. Compared with natural gas fields which have been discovered in our country, the reserves of Yacheng 13-1 gas field amount to approximately 50 percent of the remaining proved reserves in the whole area of Sichuan; and its size, abundance (referring to the gas-bearing area per square kilometer), and productive capacity is markedly better than that of gas areas in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. It is the largest single gas field discovered in our country so far. The reserves of the two gas fields newly discovered last year are also quite large. Now, efforts are being vigorously made to drill wells there for assessment. Last year, China National Offshore Oil Corporation drilled two exploratory wells, but the attempts failed because the pressure was too high. However, the "failure was gratifying" because it was only the project which failed but a layer of quite abundant gas was found in the two wells. According to seismic measures, the gas-bearing sandy layer was more than 200 meters thick, whereas in the Yacheng 13-1 gas field, which has 100 billion cubic meters of reserves, the gas-bearing sandy layer was over 100 meter thick. Hence, if the drilling of the third well in this structure, which has already been carried out, is successful and can be further verified, we will have a large gas field with reserves even greater than that of Yacheng 13-1 gas field by 100 to 200 percent. What is gratifying is that China National Offshore Oil Corporation has also found the structure of Yacheng 23-1 gas field around the area which is similar to Yacheng 21-1 gas field. An area of over 260,000 square kilometer in the Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin can be prospected and geologists have already discovered over 100 formations. There are four types of formations for producing and storing natural gas in this basin, and now gas fields have been found in three of them, which will, no doubt, greatly widen the scope of finding gas and indicate very gratifying prospects. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation has set the "joint development of oil and gas" as a long-term strategy of development. From last year onwards, it was unequivocally stated that in the future priority would be given to gas extraction. Consequently, in the first year of "giving priority to" gas extraction in the Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin, reports of new successes kept pouring in. The trend of gas extraction is gratifying but also pressing. President Wang Yan said: In 1994, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation will further give priority to the Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin. Now the corporation has set up a leading group headed by the chief geologist to handle the project in the vast gas area in Nanhai. Investment in the Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin will be increased from 400 million yuan to 600 million yuan, and we are going to drill six exploratory wells and three assessment wells. At present, three well-drilling vessels are intensively carrying out work in this area. When talking about the significance of discovering a vast gas area in Nanhai, President Wang pointed out: Natural gas is a fine-quality and pure fuel and also important for industrial chemicals. Natural gas accounts for approximately 30 percent of the world's total of energy production and consumption, among some developed countries account for 50 percent, whereas in our country it accounts for a mere three percent. Hence, our country has a very great potential in developing the natural gas industry. In particular, as the vast gas area in Nanhai is adjacent to coastal areas in the southeast, which are economically developed but extremely short of energy, the market prospects are very good. Finally, President Wang pointed at the locations of several key exploratory wells on the map, held up three fingers, and smiled and said, "Even if the chance is one out of three, there is a very high probability of finding a vast gas area." He said with full confidence, "This year, we must definitely make a major breakthrough in the vast gas area in Nanhai."
