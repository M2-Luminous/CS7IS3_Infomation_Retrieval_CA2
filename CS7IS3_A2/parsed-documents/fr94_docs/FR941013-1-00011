FR941013-1-00011 FR941013-1-00004 Office of the Secretary 14 CFR, Parts 380, 381, 399 [Docket No. 49385; Notice 94&hyph;16] RIN 2105&hyph;AC03 Special Event Tours AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Department seeks comment on a proposal to expand its rules on Super Bowl tours to cover air tours to other types of special events. These Super Bowl rules require that operators of Super Bowl tours that are promoted as including game tickets must have those game tickets in hand or under contract before they advertise or sell the tours, and that they must refund the entire tour price to any customer who does not receive a promised game ticket. This proposed rule would also extend the charter rule's prohibition on last-minute price increases to non-charter tours to special events. This initiative arises as a result of problems on certain tours to the 1994 Rose Bowl on which participants did not receive game tickets that were promoted as being included in the package, or were required to make additional payments in order to receive tickets. DATES: Comments should be received by November 14, 1994. Late-filed comments will be considered to the extent practicable. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Docket Clerk/C&hyph;55, Docket No. 49385, Room 4107, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. For the convenience of persons who will be reviewing the docket, it is requested that commenters provide an original and three copies of their comments. Comments will be available for inspection at this address Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. through 5 p.m. Commenters who wish the receipt of their comments to be acknowledged should include a stamped, self-addressed postcard with their comments. The docket clerk will date-stamp the postcard and mail it to the commenter. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tim Kelly, Consumer Affairs Division/I&hyph;25, Office of the Secretary, Room 10405, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Telephone (202) 366&hyph;5952. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In conjunction with the Rose Bowl football game that was played in Pasadena, California on January 1, 1994, a large number of fans of the University of Wisconsin (one of the two teams participating in the game) purchased package tours to California. Many of those tours were promoted as including a ticket to the Rose Bowl game. However, a significant number of these individuals either did not receive the game tickets that they had been promised and did not gain admission to the game, or were required to make an additional payment after they arrived in Pasadena in order to obtain their tickets. The Department is seeking comment on a proposal to extend its rules on Super Bowl tours to include air tours to other types of special events where admission to the event is advertised as being included in the package. The Department's rules on Super Bowl charters are contained in title 14, part 380 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR part 380): •Section 380.2 defines a Super Bowl charter as a charter flight that is represented by its charter operator as including tickets to the National Football League's Super Bowl game as part of its ground package. •Section 380.18a states that a Super Bowl charter may not be advertised unless the operator has submitted verification to the Department 1 that the operator (1) is in physical possession of enough Super Bowl game tickets to provide them for a substantial number of seats on the charter, or (2) has a contract with the NFL or with an NFL team for such a number of game tickets, or (3) has a contract with another person who has a contract with the NFL or an NFL team for such a number of game tickets. 1 References to ``the Board'' in Part 380 refers to the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Department's predecessor in aviation economic and consumer matters. The Department of Transportation now administers this rule as authorized by the Civil Aeronautics Board Sunset Act of 1984 (P.L. 98&hyph;443; 98 Stat. 1703). •Section 380.18a also states that a Super Bowl charter may not be sold unless the operator has submitted verification to the Department that the operator has possession of, or contracts for, enough game tickets to provide one to every person who is to receive one under the terms of the operator/participant contract for the charter. •Section 380.31(c) states that if an operator receives a booking for which he or she does not have possession of or a contract for a game ticket, the operator must return that participant's money within 3 days, unless the participant has authorized the operator in writing to retain the payment while the operator seeks additional tickets.
