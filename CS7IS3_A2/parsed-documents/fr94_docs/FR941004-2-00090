SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Register of December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67791), which announced that Mauri Laboratories, 9 Moorebank Ave., Moorebank, NSW 2170 Australia, had submitted an application to register the pesticide product Victus (EPA File Symbol 67186&hyph;R), ~containing the active ingredient Pseudomonas fluorescens strain NCIB 12089 at 1 percent, an active ingredient not included in any previously registered product. ~~~~~ The application was approved on August 5, ~1994, as Victus for the control of bacterial blotch on cultivated mushrooms (EPA Registration Number 67186&hyph;1). ~~The Agency has considered all required data on risks associated with the proposed use of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain NCIB 12089, and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from use. Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health safety determinations which show that use of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain NCIB 12089 when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects to the environment. More detailed information on this registration is contained in an EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on Pseudomonas fluorescens strain NCIB 12089.
