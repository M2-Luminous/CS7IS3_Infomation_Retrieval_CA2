What is the latest information about the number of casualties? ['Abd-Rabbuh] So far, more than 60 Palestinian martyrs have fallen in Hebron and more than 270 Palestinians have been injured. The Israeli Army is participating with the settlers in the killing operations and in collective terrorism against the Palestinian people in steadfast Hebron. Clearly, this crime was well-planned. [Salamah] In fact, some say the massacre is the work of one man, but other reports say it was an organized massacre. What information do you have about this? ['Abd-Rabbuh] Such a great number of martyrs and wounded cannot have fallen as a result of one man's work. A great number of settlers entered the Ibrahimi Mosque. They were armed and they entered under the eyes of the Israeli Army which, has strict security measures in place at all entrances to the Ibrahimi Mosque. These settlers opened fire on the worshipers while they were prostrated during dawn prayers. Therefore, all indications are that the operation was a large-scale one aimed at creating large-scale terror and fear. Palestinians in all areas are now confronting this crime and its perpetrators with all their resources. These murderers and criminals must be confronted with all our resources. [Salamah] Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, in your opinion, will this pogrom affect the ongoing negotiations between Israel and the PLO? ['Abd-Rabbuh] It is clear now that the presence of the settlers and settlements in the heart of Palestinian territory is a time bomb that explodes every now and then to kill more people. Therefore, it is clear that no actual peace, either in a provisional or in a final form, will be achieved while the settlements are in existence. [Salamah] Does this mean that during its current negotiations with Israel, the PLO will present the problem of the settlements that will remain in the Gaza Strip after the Israeli withdrawal? ['Abd-Rabbuh] Not just the issue of the settlements in the Gaza Strip. [Salamah] I mean at this particular stage, Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh. ['Abd-Rabbuh] Yes, I am talking about this stage. All the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are an obstacles on the path of any arrangements to make peace. Therefore, the existence of the settlements is the point at issue now. No actual peace will be accepted with the presence of the settlers and these murderous gangs, who will destroy not only the peace process but the way of life of the Palestinian people. These have always been their aims. It has proven to be the same today. [Salamah] Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh, what possible measures might the PLO take to face the possibility of similar massacres in the occupied territories? ['Abd-Rabbuh] As I have said, there is the issue of the existence of settlers. We must confront this existence by all means and resources. The issue of ending the existence of the settlements must be at the forefront of the issues that will be considered with the aim of realizing steps toward a just and real peace. Moreover, we have presented this urgent issue to the UN Security Council to take urgent measures so the UN Security Council will reiterate that the existence of the settlements is illegitimate and that they must be removed from occupied Palestinian territory, and also to provide international protection for the Palestinian people. Within this framework, we appeal to all the forces that wish to see peace, and to the Arab and Islamic worlds, to shoulder real responsibility along side of the Palestinian people in these difficult circumstances. I repeat here that the Palestinian people will know how to confront this massacre. Those who committed it will pay a real price in exchange for every drop of Palestinian blood. [Salamah] Thank, You, 'Abd-Rabbuh. ['Abd-Rabbuh] Thank You.
