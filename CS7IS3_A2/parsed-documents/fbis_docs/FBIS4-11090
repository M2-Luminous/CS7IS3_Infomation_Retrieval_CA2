This was announced at the meeting chaired by ANPP Vice President Jaime Crombet at the seat of the provincial government. During the meeting, also attended by the presidents of the People's Councils, and the provincial Administration Council, it was reported that over 40 percent of the suggestions made at the workers assemblies have been implemented. The importance of this new democratic practice to solve countless problems with production and services as well as to help rejuvenate the national economy was also stressed. Crombet pointed out that the idea is not for the ANPP to take specific measures during the forthcoming meeting, but to set the policies and guidelines to guide the government efforts to save the Revolution and accomplishments of socialism.
