The party led by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa reached the agreement in a meeting of executives, the officials said. The SDP decided to walk out of the coalition on April 26 after Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Democratic Socialist Party [of Japan, SDPJ] and the Liberal Party, as well as the JNP, abruptly formed the 130-legislator parliamentary group, called Kaishin (Innovation), excluding the SDP, saying the move was a breach of trust. The SDP's withdrawal forced new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to launch a minority government. As to whether Hosokawa should remain the party head, the party was divided on the issue and postponed a decision, the officials said. Hosokawa announced his resignation suddenly on April 8 over financial improprieties.
