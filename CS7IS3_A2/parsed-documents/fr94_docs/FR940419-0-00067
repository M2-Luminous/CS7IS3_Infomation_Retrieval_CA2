FR940419-0-00067 FR940419-0-00019 33. Modification of Existing Contracts Comments were received which took exception to a unilateral placement of conflict of interest clauses into existing contracts. EPA does not intend to unilaterally place the new EPAAR clauses into existing contracts. Clauses substantially similar to these clauses shall be negotiated by the Contracting Officer for existing contracts, on a case-by-case basis, as stated in the general prescription to the clauses. The general prescription to the clauses, cited in the proposed rule as paragraph (c), EPAAR 1509.508, Solicitation provision and contract clauses, is redesignated, under the final rule, as EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause, to conform with recent numbering changes to FAR Subpart 9.5. 34. General Comments Concerning Improper Restriction of Competition and Its Effects Commenters expressed concern about a restriction of competition on Superfund work resulting from this rule. Commenters also stated that EPA has improperly restricted competition by placing overly broad future contracting limitations affecting sites, types of contracts, and parties with whom the contractor may contract. Commenters questioned the authority to impose ``post contract'' restrictions and stated that such activity should be governed by internal guidelines and market forces. Others stated that these clauses prevent EPA from having access to the most qualified sources in its contracting program. Other comments reflected an interpretation that the restrictions apply to affiliates and to contractor clients. We disagree with these comments. The LOFC clause and its alternates are not overly broad nor do they improperly restrict competition. The LOFC clause and each alternate are focused narrowly upon areas which have a high potential for conflict. The authority for ``post contract'' restriction is recognized in FAR Section 9.507. Many EPA Superfund solicitations and contracts currently include clauses similar to those contained in this rule. EPA has attracted qualified contractors and competition has not diminished. The comment concerning the limitation of competition based upon the flow down of restrictions to affiliates or to clients reflects an assumption based upon a misreading of the proposed rule. There is no flow down of restrictions to affiliates or to clients. 35. Negotiation of Specific LOFC Clauses One comment suggested that the LOFC clause be negotiated separately for each contract. This will occur for existing contracts. However, the rule's EPAAR clauses are required for all solicitations and new contracts. The Contracting Officer may, however, consider a deviation to the inclusion or for the modification of the clause. 36. Assessment of the Cost and Economic Impacts of Limiting Work on Existing Contracts Commenters were concerned about the limitation on business as a result of the inclusion of the LOFC clauses in existing contracts. One commenter stated that an assessment of the economic impacts of the rule has not been performed for existing contracts. The commenter further stated that the limitations contained in the LOFC clause, which will be included by modification into existing contracts, will adversely affect its future activities. The commenter's concern is that these effects were not envisioned by the contractor at the time it submitted its offer to the EPA. The rule states that the EPAAR clauses are to be placed in all solicitations and new contracts unless a deviation is obtained. For contracts existing as of the effective date of the rule, clauses substantially similar to those in the rule are to be negotiated and incorporated into those contracts, on a case-by-case basis. EPA will not unilaterally incorporate these new clauses into existing contracts. Concerning the cost and economic impacts of the rule, EPA has performed a cost burden analysis of the rule and recognizes that there will be some economic impact as a result of implementing these clauses. During the formulation of the LOFC clause for each existing contract, the negotiation process will assure that any specific economic attributes associated with the contract are taken into consideration. 37. Unduly Burdensome and Redundant Certifications Several commenters stated that the certifications required by the rule are unduly burdensome and redundant, and should be deleted from the rule. Specifically, the commenters took exception to requirements for an annual certification and to the work assignment and work plan certifications.
