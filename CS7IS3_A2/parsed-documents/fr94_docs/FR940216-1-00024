FR940216-1-00024 FR940216-1-00008 Regulatory Reform: Less Burdensome or More Efficient Alternatives The Department of Agriculture is committed to carrying out its statutory and regulatory mandates in a manner that best serves the public interest. Therefore, where legal discretion permits, the Department actively seeks to promulgate regulations that promote economic growth, create jobs, are minimally burdensome, and are easy for the public to understand, use or comply with. In short, the Department is committed to issuing regulations that maximize net benefits to society and minimize costs imposed by those regulations. This principle is articulated in President Bush's January 28, 1992, memorandum to agency heads, and in Executive Orders 12291 and 12498. The Department applies this principle to the fullest extent possible, consistent with law. The Department has developed and reviewed this regulatory proposal in accordance with these principles. Nonetheless, the Department believes that public input from all interested persons can be invaluable in ensuring that the final regulatory product is minimally burdensome and maximally efficient. Therefore, the Department specifically seeks comments and suggestions from the public regarding any less burdensome or more efficient alternative that would accomplish the purposes described in the proposal. Comments suggesting less burdensome or more efficient alternatives should be addressed to the agency as provided in this notice. Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public This proposed rule will not result in additional paperwork not already required by law or approved for use. Therefore, the review provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507) and implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320 do not apply. Environmental Impact This proposed rule would set forth the acts that are prohibited on the National Forest System. This rule, in and of itself, will not have environmental effects that need to be addressed in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act procedures. Section 31.1b of Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (57 FR 43180; September 18, 1992) excludes from documentation in an environmental assessment or impact statement ``rules, regulations, or policies to establish Service-wide administration procedures, programs, processes, or instructions.'' The agency's preliminary assessment is that this rule falls within this category of actions and that no extraordinary circumstances exist which would require preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. A final determination will be made upon adoption of the final rule. List of Subjects in 36 CFR Parts 261 and 262 Crime, Law enforcement, and National forests.
