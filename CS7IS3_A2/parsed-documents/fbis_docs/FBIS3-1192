However, people in some suburbs have behaved and people have been able to sleep, while others continue to shoot and throw explosive devices. Our colleague Emmanuel Nzeyimana asked Major Bambara in charge of security in Bujumbura town for more details on the security situation last night. Here he is: [Begin recording] [Bambara] Things are not as bad as they were last night. In Nyakabiga the situation has improved but in Cibitoke, Kamenge, and Kinama people continued shooting as usual. In fact, yesterday they started the shooting earlier. A military vehicle that was transporting food for the soldiers was shot at in front of the zonal headquarters at 1700. Three soldiers were injured. The shooting continued until this morning. They were targeting military positions in particular. That is how the security situation looks. There are not enough of them to cause a disturbance. [Unidentified correspondent] Many measures were taken yesterday which are related to restoring security [words indistinct]. How far have you gotten? [Bambara] We started yesterday, since we were yesterday ordered to put soldiers into position. We brought them in yesterday evening. We have already arrested a good number of people, especially in the Cibitoke area. We have also seized a few weapons. They are still continuing even now, they have been shooting at security agents. [passage omitted] There are not many of them. They shoot in groups of two to three, then change position, moving behind houses so that we also shoot at houses. But we are aware of this and that is why we do not respond, we just wait. [passage omitted] [end recording]
