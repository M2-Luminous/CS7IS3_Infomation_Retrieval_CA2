Despite Israel's commitment to this date, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres stated that things had been postponed until the end of this month. Before news agencies could confirm the date, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin made a statement in which he declared that the agreement on the implementation of the Declaration of Principles might be signed in the middle of next month. A sense of despair is increasing among the Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied territory, especially following a new decision by the Israeli Government to import foreign workers to replace the Palestinian workers employed by some Israeli companies in the occupied Palestinian territory. This decision has dangerous implications for the Palestinian people as it affects their livelihood and their right to maintain a decent life in the land on which they were born and raised. It might push the Palestinian people in the occupied territory into extreme despair, the result of which no one can calculate. When life and death become equal, the resulting reaction could be difficult to predict or calculate. Perhaps what happened in 'Afula and that led to regression in the peace process proves the truth of what we say. Credibility in abiding by the articles agreed upon and the dates set to implement what is concluded between the two negotiating parties is essential-- if there are indeed sincere intentions to resolve the Palestinian- Israeli differences. The Palestinians in the Cairo negotiations have agreed to postpone the implementation until the end of this month, according to the Israeli foreign minister's statement. This is because the PLO doesn't want to miss any chance for the Palestinian people to secure their rights and emphasize the Palestinian desire to establish permanent and viable peace with Israel and solve the Middle East conflict according to the principle of land for peace, which was endorsed by the international community in Madrid. Israel's continuing attempts to postpone the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement places Israel in a position that we think is not in its favor. The PLO has offered everything that could advance the peace negotiations and achieve permanent peace in the Middle East and all the Arab capitals have expressed their support and backing for every step to achieve an agreement that will restore security and peace to the Middle East, providing this is done on a just basis.
