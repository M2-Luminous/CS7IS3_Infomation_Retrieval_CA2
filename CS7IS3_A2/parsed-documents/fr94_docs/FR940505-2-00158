FR940505-2-00158 FR940505-2-00113 ``1. Eligibility for consideration under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by an amendment listed in subsection (c) that lowers the applicable guideline range. 2. In determining the amended guideline range under subsection (b), the court shall substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced. All other guideline application decisions remain unaffected.''. The Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned ``Background'' is amended in the last paragraph by deleting ``subsection (d)'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``subsection (c)''. Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises §1B1.10 to substantially simplify its operation. Under this amendment, the court will recalculate the guideline range using only those amendments expressly designated as retroactive. In addition, this amendment deletes current §1B1.10(c), a rather complex subsection, as an unnecessary restriction on the court's consideration of a revised sentence in response to an amended guideline range. Finally, this amendment makes a number of minor clarifying revisions. 3. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(c) is amended by deleting subdivisions 1&hyph;3, by renumbering subdivisions 4&hyph;19 as 2&hyph;17, and by inserting the following as subdivision 1: ``(1) 30 KG or more of Heroin (or the equivalent Level 38 amount of other Schedule I or II Opiates); 150 KG or more of Cocaine (or the equivalent amount of other Schedule I or II Stimulants); 1.5 KG or more of Cocaine Base; 30 KG or more of PCP, or 3 KG or more of PCP (actual); 30 KG or more of Methamphetamine, or 3 KG or more of Methamphetamine (actual), or 3 KG or more of `Ice'; 300 G or more of LSD (or the equivalent amount of other Schedule I or II Hallucinogens); 12 KG or more of Fentanyl; 3 KG or more of a Fentanyl Analogue; 30,000 KG or more of Marihuana; 6,000 KG or more of Hashish; 600 KG or more of Hashish Oil.''. The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amended in Note 16 by deleting ``40'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``38'', by deleting ``35'' wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof in each instance ``33'', and by deleting ``4 levels'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``2 levels''. The Commentary to §2D1.6 captioned ``Application Note'' is amended in Note 1 by deleting ``(§2D1.1(c)(16))'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``(§2D1.1(c)(14))'', and by deleting ``(§2D1.1(c)(19))'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``(§2D1.1(c)(17))''. Reason for Amendment: This amendment sets the upper limit of the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1 at level 38. The Commission has determined that the extension of the Drug Quantity Table above level 38 for quantity itself is not required to ensure adequate punishment given that organizers, leaders, managers, and supervisors of such offenses will receive a 4-, 3-, or 2-level enhancement for their role in the offense, and any participant will receive an additional 2-level enhancement if a dangerous weapon is possessed in the offense. 4. Amendment: The Commentary to §4B1.1 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amended in Note 2 by deleting the first sentence and inserting in lieu thereof:
