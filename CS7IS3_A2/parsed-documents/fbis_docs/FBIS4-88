In a letter to the chairman of the Council of State, Professor David Kpomakpor, dated 23 March, Chairman Soglo of ECOWAS says that he has learned that a letter bearing his signature has been circulated to the leaders of the former Liberian factions party to the Cotonou Peace Accord recommending that two of the four disputed ministries be given to the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia]. The ECOWAS chairman expressed surprise at what he described as an irresponsible act because the contents of the purported letter differ totally from his recommendations concerning the allocation of the four cabinet posts. The ECOWAS chairman reiterated his position that the decision for the allocation of the four ministries rests with the Liberian people. Chairman Soglo has, therefore, urged a prompt settlement of the issue in a spirit of dialogue, concerted efforts, good judgment, and secrecy.
