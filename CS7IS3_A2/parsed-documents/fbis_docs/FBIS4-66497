"There are good prospects for strengthening and increasing the volume of trade between Algeria and Japan," sources said, adding that the Japanese side "reacted favorably and sympathetically to Algeria's commitment" to move toward a market economy. The purpose of Mr. Benachenhou's visit was to "inform top-level Japanese officials of the substance of the new economic policy decided by the Algerian Government as part of the transition to a market economy," said ministry sources, without divulging more specifics. The minister held talks "in an atmosphere of frankness and professionalism" with the Japanese minister for industry and international commerce, the deputy foreign affairs minister for international economic relations, the directors general of Eximbank [Export-Import Bank] and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, the vice president of Keidanren (employers' association), and other Japanese economic leaders. Additional meetings were planned by the two sides and should take place "in the near future," sources added. Japan, which after France is Algeria's biggest creditor, has made commitments to participate in diverse investment projects in Algeria, including the vast program to renovate Algeria's natural gas facilities, to the tune of credits totaling close to $1.5 billion, it was noted. Algeria is preparing to conclude a temporary "standby" agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to be followed by a three-year "expanded adjustment accord" to support an easing of the debt service burden, which at its current level of $9 billion will consume more than 97 percent of hydrocarbon exchange earnings this year. Admitting for the first time that Algeria could no longer meet its essential needs without a reduction in payments on its external debt, which now totals close to $26 billion, authorities last December asked for a "multilateral debt restructuring" without the strict conditionality that generally accompanies conventional reschedulings. The standby accord must be accompanied by balance-of-payments support financing on the order of several hundred millions of dollars, said IMF director-general Michel Camdessus on 25 February, at the conclusion of a 24-hour visit to Algeria. The accord should also facilitate unblocking remaining tranches of certain multilateral lines of credit, including 1992 European Community credit lines totaling 400 million ECU [European currency units] (about $500 million). During the negotiations that began last September between the IMF and Algerian authorities, the latter announced they had appealed to the Group of Seven (G-7)--the seven major industrial nations, including Japan--to support their request for special treatment in view of Algeria's severe economic, political, and social problems. Following the example of France, which Mr. Benachenhou visited before Tokyo, the principal partners responded favorably to that request with statements of good intentions--but they conditioned any concrete support to conclusion of an accord between Algeria and the IMF.
