FR941116-0-00049 FR941116-0-00011 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 18 CFR Parts 342, 346, and 347 [Docket No. RM94&hyph;2&hyph;000] Cost-of-Service Reporting and Filing Requirements for Oil Pipelines Issued October 28, 1994. AGENCY: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is amending its regulations to establish filing requirements for cost-of-service rate filings for oil pipelines; filing requirements for oil pipelines seeking to establish new or changed depreciation rates; and new and revised pages of FERC Form No. 6, Annual Report for Oil Pipelines. These requirements are adopted as companions to Order No. 561, Revisions to Oil Pipeline Regulations Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 1992, published in the Federal Register on November 4, 1993. That order established an indexing methodology which would establish ceilings on oil pipeline rates. The Commission provided the opportunity for oil pipelines to seek an exception to indexing through a cost-of-service filing if the pipeline could show that, under indexing, it would substantially underrecover prudent costs. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective January 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Harris S. Wood, Office of the General Counsel, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;0224.
