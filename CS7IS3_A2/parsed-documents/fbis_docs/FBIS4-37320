This regime, which is known for its agentry, plotting, and hiring of mercenaries and for its background as the outcome of a well-known imperialist deal, cannot but shun any Arab unionist trend and exploit every geographical and political factor in order to foster factionalism and fighting so as to protect its political entity first and also because such a course enables it to indulge in its treasonous policy. What the Saudi regime has done to Yemen is known and proven by events and facts. It has continued to openly plot against Yemen from the moment the Yemenis opted for the republican political system. The Saudis dispatched large numbers of mercenaries and agents with the aim of returning Yemen to the era of misguidance, backwardness, and decadence. They used border wars, assassinations, disturbances, and economic siege. They expelled more than one million Yemeni workers from Saudi Arabia and deprived them of their properties and financial rights during the U.S.-Zionist aggression against Iraq. They also plotted against the Document of Pledge and Accord, which the Yemenis signed in February this year, when they received the renegade 'Ali Salim al-Bid in order to spite Yemeni constitutional legitimacy and to throw a wrench into the accord and thus bring it to standstill. This development encouraged al-Bid to disavow the document and to harp once more on the tune of separatism. The insistence of agent Fahd's regime on pushing matters in Yemen toward internationalization is contrary to the Arab League and UN charters. What has happened so far in the Security Council concerning Yemen also constitutes blatant interference in Yemen's internal affairs. Real concern for Yemen calls for preserving its constitutional legitimacy, which has come as a result of the Yemeni people's democratic choice. The logic of protecting Yemen and preserving its security and the safety of its people and stemming the present copious flow of blood calls for safeguarding the unity of this noble Arab country, not encouraging separatism.
