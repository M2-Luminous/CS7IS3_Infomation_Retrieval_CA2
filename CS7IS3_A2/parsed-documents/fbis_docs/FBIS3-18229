[Leotard] We can be satisfied. We had a specific objective limited to Sarajevo, with requirements we set and which are currently being met. However, this result is not enough. Other objectives remain to be achieved. First of all, the siege must be lifted. It must be possible to enter and exit Sarajevo freely, and humanitarian convoys must be able to enter the city as a matter of course. France has just submitted a new resolution to the Security Council. Then, unfortunately, there is more to the crisis than just Sarajevo. We must enforce the resolutions already passed -- there are 49 of them! [LE POINT] Are you not worried about the risk of seeing the Serbs transferring to other fronts the equipment they have withdrawn from Sarajevo? [Leotard] This is not a risk, it is a fact. Information in our possession shows that the equipment placed under UN control is rather old, while equipment withdrawn beyond the 20 kilometer interdiction zone, as well as that concentrated in the Pale area, is much more recent and powerful. This is precisely why we must now turn to other enclaves, which are besieged by Serbs, Bosnians, or Croats. [LE POINT] The reopening of Tuzla airport is your next objective, with a deadline set for 18 March. But do you have enough men to achieve this? [Leotard] Personnel is a problem throughout the former Yugoslavia. The UN secretary general has been asking for additional forces for months. Enforcing a peace plan will require several ten thousand men. For example, we now control around Sarajevo a zone which went from roughly 1,200 square km to 13,000 square km. Mere arithmetical thinking would tell us that we therefore need 10 times as many men. This is far from being the case. Thus we deployed four French helicopters from the Split detachment; they are able to go from one hill to the next, and therefore to greatly increase Blue Helmet intervention and prevention capabilities. While it has decided not to send in more troops, France proposes a different arrangement in the field, such as transferring an additional French battalion from Bihac to Sarajevo, for example. [LE POINT] Can we hope to see the Americans taking part in this effort? [Leotard] We certainly hope so. But at the same time, we must also point out that there are American soldiers in the air, American soldiers in the Adriatic, American pilots in Italy, American foot soldiers in Macedonia, American doctors in Zagreb. What is missing is the most important element: foot soldiers in Bosnia. We also need to bear in mind that Washington promised to send an infantry contingent as a contribution to enforcing a potential peace settlement. On this issue, I would also like to add that if every European country made the same effort as France has, we would have all the human capacity we need. France said so at the latest European Council in Copenhagen, but we could not make ourselves heard. This is a worrisome tendency on the part of Europe, which does not view this crisis as one that can be dealt with primarily and essentially by the Europeans. [LE POINT] You have just released a White Paper on French defense for the next 20 years which opens a debate on what the missions of the French Armed Forces should be. Traditionally, such missions are presented as consisting of three circles. First circle: Europe and Central Europe, where all our forces would be engaged. Second circle: external actions, for instance in the Mediterranean. Third circle: more specific missions overseas, for instance in Africa and in overseas territories. Can we retain all three mandates? [Leotard] To these three purely geographic approaches, we have substituted a definition of our defense policy objectives which combines permanent and innovative objectives. First objective: To defend France's interests. Its vital interests such as the national territory, its sovereignty. Its strategic interests, such as our supply routes or the balance of forces in Europe or in the Mediterranean. And its interests as a world power, its interests as they relate to its rank, its international responsibilities, its status as permanent member of the Security Council. Second objective: To build a European defense system and to contribute to world security, as our borders are no longer our first line of defense. Third objective: To implement a global defense concept, not only in military terms, but also in terms of how we view the nation, with our values, with those of the Republic and democracy. Do we have the means to continue meeting all these responsibilities? I believe we must do what it takes to have them. Obviously, there are limitations, but we have the capability to intervene anywhere in the world should it become necessary. The issue of the necessary means is raised in the White Paper. We answer it both by developing intervention scenarios for French forces and by emphasizing -- this is a way to be rational -- the probable multinational nature of most future interventions. As part of Europe, of course, with our allies, as is currently being done in Bosnia, as was done in Cambodia and Somalia. For our interests as a world power, I used the word multilateralization. We have no problem with the fact that such interests must nowadays be expressed on a European scale. [LE POINT] How do you reconcile what you call multilateralization and the protection of the national territory through [nuclear] deterrence? [Leotard] We do not believe in sharing atomic weapons at this point. This is an issue that must remain under national jurisdiction as it affects our vital interests. On the other hand, with the exception of nuclear matters, it is very important that we look into multilateral or multinational actions, especially with our German friends, in view of potential future crises. [LE POINT] Speaking of nuclear deterrence: Can we remain credible without resuming testing? [Leotard] I would give a two-part answer to your question. First, France's current deterrent is totally relevant, totally reliable, and, I might add, completely at the level of those of other world powers, and this will remain true for quite a while. Second, there is the issue of the renewal of today's weapons, which must take place from the years 2005, 2007, 2010 onward, depending on weapon types. To ensure such renewal, the next president of the Republic will certainly need to be in a position to authorize new tests if we are to maintain our credibility into the third millennium and if we want to acquire the simulation capability we need -- a capability which in itself requires testing. The question is not whether we should, but when we need to resume testing. [LE POINT] Do we not need to cross the Rubicon and trade conscription for a professional army? [Leotard] I believe that we both need to work toward a number of professional units and to maintain the national service. This is why the 1994 budget provides for the creation of 1,000 additional jobs in the army. We also put a stop to personnel cuts, which is in sharp contrast with the 40,000 military jobs suppressed over the last two years. We do not question the need for a national service. First of all because a country such as ours, with real integration problems, cannot underestimate an integration tool such as the national service. I should add that given the missions we must carry out today, our Armed Forces need the current numbers of conscripts. In other words, contrary to a widespread idea, switching from conscription to a professional army would be highly problematic. First of all because it would substantially deplete the Armed Forces' human resources. Conscripts are far from being the army valets we hear about; they fulfil many highly important and technologically useful functions with high added value. And second, external operations such as the ones being conducted in the former Yugoslavia involve 40 percent of conscripts. This is therefore a choice to be made at the national level. Besides, during the Gulf War, when it was decided not to send any conscripts -- a decision I personally regret -- the Armed Forces did not take kindly to this situation. I would really like the country to accept this idea that it is the people itself which defends not only its territory, but also a number of values. And not just people who are paid to do it. This is a real debate, and I totally accept the political risks, knowing that in the majority there are a number of people whose opinions differ from mine.
