He said: Some foreign news media are now spreading reports that the DPRK signed an "arms deal a "new contract" with the Southern Yemen forces, according to which it will supply Aden with jet planes, tanks, tactical missiles and other combat equipment. This is an utterly groundless fabrication. It is by no means accidental that such reports are afloat when the manoeuvres to stifle the DPRK over the fictitious "nuclear issue" have reached a grave stage. We cannot but think that they are underlain by the political intention to impair the authority of the DPRK and isolate it in the international arena. Our country which has steadfastly maintained the principle of non-interference in relations with other countries consistently calls for a negotiated solution of disputes between the parties concerned. The dispute between the Northern and Southern Yemen is merely an internal dispute, and it is inconceivable for us to "help" any one side. From the very moment the dispute broke out between the North and the South of Yemen we have hoped to see it solved peacefully at an early date in the interests of the entire Yemeni people without outside interference, and there is no change in this principled stand of ours now. Truth will be made clear. No insidious attempt can tarnish the image of our dignified Republic or damage the excellent relations between our country and Yemen.
