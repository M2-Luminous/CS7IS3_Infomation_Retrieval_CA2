Moravcik has been invited to attend the conference both by the foundation and leading representatives of two Hungarian liberal parties -- the Union of Free Democrats and the Union of Young Democrats. Prolle said that Moravcik had excused himself, citing the lack of time, already last Friday. On the other hand in an interview with representatives of Hungarian liberal parties in Bratislava Moravcik has allegedly made it clear that he would attend the Visegrad meeting of Central European liberal politicians if possible. Liberal politicians and representatives of liberal parties from all Central European countries and some Western politicians are to take part in the conference. It is expected that Chairman of the Liberal International Otto Lambsdorff will also take part. Representatives of some liberal parties from the Czech Republic have also been invited, organizers said.
