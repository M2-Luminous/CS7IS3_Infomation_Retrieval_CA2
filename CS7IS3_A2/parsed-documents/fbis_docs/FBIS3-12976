The message also deals with the current developments in our country and the efforts being exerted by brother Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi and other brothers in Libya to bring views closer and to heal the rift in the Yemeni ranks in order to maintain the march of unity, democracy, and stability in Yemen. The message stresses the Libyan brothers' eagerness to support all efforts and do whatever is possible to contain the current political crisis in our country, to halt its regrettable repercussions, and to stand by our people to surmount the current challenges and maintain Yemeni unity, which is a major pan-Arab gain and a model for realizing the Arab masses' dreams of Arab unity. During the meeting, the two sides reviewed their brotherly bilateral relations, the developments of the situation in our country in light of the efforts being exerted by the military committee to halt the regrettable military developments, and the efforts being exerted to begin implementation of the accord document. Those efforts are designed to end the crisis and enable the state's constitutional institutions to resume their responsibilities so that they can move collectively to implement the contents of the document in a manner that ensures its success, achieves the national aspirations for a modern Yemeni state, and entrenches unity and democracy in our country. During the meeting, the Presidential Council chairman expressed thanks and appreciation for the efforts, the sincere fraternal sentiments, and the outstanding pan-Arab eagerness of his brother Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi and other brothers in Libya to help their brothers in Yemen to maintain Yemeni unity.

He indicated that Yemeni unity is a pan-Arab accomplishment and an Arab enterprise of interest to all advocates of unity and good in the Arab homeland.
