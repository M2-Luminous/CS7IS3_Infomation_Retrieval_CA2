[Watanabe] There may be various viewpoints. We are professionals living in the political world, so it is possible that he may have used me as a card to obtain policy concessions from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. However, if the SDPJ made a concession because of that, it is good for the country, is it not? [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is said that the Hata administration has a dual power structure or that the Hata administration is "Ozawa's cabinet." [Watanabe] If a man can be a scenario writer and leading actor at the same time like former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, it is all right. However, a division of work is necessary to some extent. It may be that, since the two men are not different in their ideas, tickets will sell well if Hata, not Ozawa, dances on the stage. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Are you still thinking of leaving the LDP if that helps to eliminate a policy gap? [Watanabe] The problem is that Shinseito and the LDP are at odds with each other despite the fact that their policies are almost identical. It will be difficult for the Hata administration to implement its policies unless it officially asks for the LDP's cooperation. I have been thinking of mediating between the two parties. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Is there any possibility of your leaving the LDP if there is a chance of political realignment? [Watanabe] It is too dangerous to make comments on that. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] There is a movement afoot in the LDP to come back to power in league with some members of the SDPJ and Sakigake [Harbinger]. [Watanabe] Cooperation between the LDP and the SDPJ should be limited to the management of Diet affairs. If, however, the SDPJ breaks with convention and comes closer to our party in policy cooperation than when it formed an alliance with Shinseito and other parties, that would be another story. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What will be the nature of political realignment? [Watanabe] I think there will be two lines of thought: one based on the main current of the LDP and the other different from that. The voluntary establishment of the Constitution is the LDP's platform, but we are not saying that we should amend Article 9 of the Constitution. It would be ridiculous not to discuss the problem of the Constitution since the world is changing in many spheres, like the problem of the environment and the problem of limiting property rights. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] There is a considerable difference between your way of thinking and the contents of LDP President Yohei Kono's interpellation at the Diet concerning the problem of security. [Watanabe] I am not saying we should approve the exercise of the right of collective self-defense. What I am saying is: "Concerning UN peacekeeping activities, postwar management and attendance for the confiscation of weapons can be interpreted as collective security from the standpoint of the Constitution. Concerning national emergency laws, laws providing for the minimum requirement for security can be made within the framework of the Constitution. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] LDP President Yohei Kono has declared that he will submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet in the current Diet session. [Watanabe] If a no-confidence motion is to be submitted, there must be just cause for it. I am sure of one thing: It is not good for a minority government, which does not represent the will of the people, to deal with the next budget or to maintain a cabinet for a long time. However, if the Hata administration asks for our cooperation in pursuing the same policy as the LDP's, we cannot submit a no-confidence motion. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think will happen after a no-confidence motion is submitted? [Watanabe] That is impossible to say because there is the other party, not just us. Speaking of dissolution by mutual consent, for example, it is also impossible to tell whether there is mutual consent. It will take time for the current Diet to pass bills on redrawing electoral districts, because the opinions of local governments must be listened to. And it is still unknown whether Prime Minister Hata will choose dissolution. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] If the Diet is dissolved before a bill on redrawing electoral districts is passed, that constitutes "torpedoing political reform," does it not? [Watanabe] At any rate, since the single-seat constituency system was enacted by both the ruling and opposition parties, it is impossible to abolish it without using it even once.
