Aguinaldo] [Text] Government will temporarily suspend talks with the National Democratic Front (NDF) if hostilities within the communist party are not put to an end, a government negotiator said yesterday. The decision was reportedly made after the New People's Army (NPA) claimed responsibility for the death of former leader Leopoldo Mabilangan and after Luis Jalandoni NDF representative to the talks and vice-chairman for international affairs, failed to condemn the killing which was claimed by the NPA [New People's Army] Melito Glor Command. The negotiator, who requested anonymity, said the government panel considered the killing of Mr. Mabilangan as a "step backward" for the peace process. In a statement, [former] Ambassador Howard Dee, chairman of the government panel traced Mr. Mabilangan's death to the rift within the communist movement and appealed to all factions "to allow the spirit of The Hague Declaration to prevail within their own movement and to commit themselves to a just and peaceful resolution of the armed conflict." The government negotiator said the panel believes violence within the movement will affect the peace process in a negative manner. Another source disclosed the strong possibility the NDF will further delay the resumption of the second round of exploratory talks with government. The NDF's attempt to consolidate its forces in the past had become even more impossible with the death of the NPA Banahaw Command's former leader, he said, adding the killing had also dampened the image of the movement, while the government benefited from it. He added, however, that the incident might affect the success of the government's amnesty program. "The NPA might have finished Comrade Hector off in order to show others who are planning to avail of the amnesty what the NPA can do to them," he said. Meanwhile, President Ramos said Mr. Mabilangan's killers are not qualified to apply for the government's amnesty program as the act was plain "murder" and not done in furtherance of a political goal. Satur Ocampo, former chief NDF spokesman, defended the military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, saying the Melito Glor Command, which operates in Southern Tagalog and is headed by Gregorio "Comrade Roger" Rosal, had found Comrade Hector guilty of crimes punishable by death. The command has the right to dispense justice to the crimes he committed against many people and the Ramos administration has failed in this respect," he said. Mr. Ocampo added the "people's court" has evidence of his involvement in activities against the CPP, showing he was killed in order to preserve the movement. Mr. Ocampo said he was not surprised by the president's pronouncement because "it has been a policy of government to file common criminal charges to our brothers in the movement, rather than charge them for political offenses. Government has made members of the CPP suffer multiple layers of injustice because of this practice." He also revealed the decision of the "people's court" who found Mabilangan guilty of crimes such as involvement in kidnapping and other "anti-revolutionary activities" will be reviewed by a higher court. Mr. Ocampo said a CPP national court will be tasked to study the decision of the NPA Southern Tagalog Regional Command. "We will see to it that all the requirements for death penalty were fulfilled. The leadership will check if the order came with authority and if there was a failure in implementation," Mr. Ocampo said. Mabilangan's punishment will also have to be within the standards of the International Humanitarian Law, he said. "The NDF is a responsible political organization. We will not tolerate injustice in our movement," he said.
