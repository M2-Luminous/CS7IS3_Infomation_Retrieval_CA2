FR940620-0-00068 FR940620-0-00023 III. Final Rulemaking Action The USEPA has conducted Level I, II, and III quality assurance reviews of the emission inventory submittals and has concluded that the State of Indiana has met the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Act by submitting ozone precursor emission inventories that include comprehensive, accurate, and current actual emissions from all identified sources in the subject ozone nonattainment areas. In particular, the Indiana submittals meet the 10 crucial criteria contained in the Level III quality assurance review. The emission inventories are, therefore, approved for incorporation in the SIP as satisfying the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Act. Because USEPA considers this action to be noncontroversial and routine, the USEPA is approving it without prior approval. This action will become effective on August 19, 1994. However, if the USEPA receives adverse comments by July 20, 1994, then the USEPA will publish a notice that withdraws the action, and will address the comments received in response to this final rule in the final rule on the requested SIP revision which has been proposed for approval in the proposed rules section of this Federal Register . The comment period will not be extended or reopened. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of the Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Tables 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. Nothing in this section should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq ., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids the USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976).
