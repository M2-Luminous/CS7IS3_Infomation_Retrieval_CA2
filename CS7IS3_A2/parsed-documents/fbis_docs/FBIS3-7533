The group, which broke from the Maoist-oriented CPP, has been holding a series of preparatory meetings for the formal launching of "Siglaya [Siglo ng Paglaya -- Century of Independence]" in the middle of May, according to a leader of the group who spoke to the CHRONICLE. As agreed upon by the preparatory committee, the group shall be an "open and legal organization." The committee for the founding congress in May includes civic leaders Liddy Nacpil-Alejandro, Ben Moraleda, Etta Rosales, Noel Medina, peasant leader Jaime Tadeo, labor leader Robert Galvez who represents the Ilaw at Buklod ng Manggagawa [Ilaw -- expansion unknown; and Workers Union], and scholar Joel Rocamora. Ricardo Reyes, whom the military has identified as the former secretary general of the CPP, is one of the leaders group principally assigned to draft the program. The Siglaya leader also said a top-ranking Catholic religious leader has joined them but he requested the CHRONICLE not to publish his name. In a 15-page manifesto, the group lined up a 10-point program that one of its leaders said sets it apart from the mainstream CPP and a breakaway group of some Metro Manila-based cadres and members. Among its goals are: -- Aspire for national independence from imperialist control and uphold the sovereign control over the country's national life, politics, and culture. -- Work to end the political control of "imperialists and big landlords and bureaucrat capitalists." -- Establish a people's democratic state, uphold democratic rights, civil liberties, human rights and other social rights like the right to strike. It shall uphold the rights of the minorities. -- Work to make capital for agriculture available to peasants, push for rural cooperatives, work to modernize agriculture, and to ensure food security. -- Work for a comprehensive and progressive policy for social welfare. -- Uphold a culture that stresses patriotism, national unity, scientific and critical attitude, democratic ethics; respect for the gender, religion and beliefs, race and color, and other free thinking; a patriotic, scientific, critical, and liberating education for the Filipino youth. -- Uphold the rights of the Bangsa Moro people, people of Cordillera at the national minorities for self-determination. -- Oppose the destruction of the environment, defense of the source of life, democratization in the exploitation of natural resources. -- Work for the equality of the sexes and the freedom of women from a patriarchal system. -- Adopt an independent foreign policy. Establish diplomatic relations with all countries regardless of ideology and social system. Rejecting the vanguard role of the CPP in the insurgency, Siglaya said it shall uphold empowerment in its political work. Empowerment, Siglaya said, "is not only an aspiration as a platform for change. According to the group, this principle will start today, in spirit, in our ethics, in every process and conduct, in the whole political and organization life of the newly born movement." According to the Siglaya leader, the new movement will rely on several organizations for its mass base and shall not dictate upon these organizations. He said the new movement shall not take a confrontational attitude towards the party led by Jose Ma. Sison. "Instead, we shall let the masses decide which is the more viable political program," the leader said. Asked about the group of Metro Manila-based communists who broke from Sison, the Siglaya leader said the Metro group led by one Carlos Forte has yet to come up with a program. "We hope the group finishes its draft so that the people can decide on what program is the best," he said. Although Forte's group has openly criticized Sison, it has yet to come up with its program. Asked to elaborate on its differences with the Sison group, the Siglaya leader said he could identify at least three areas where the new group differs with Sison. One of these, he said, was on the ideological framework. He said that while Sison has adopted the Maoist framework, the new group draws its inspiration from the writings on early Marx. He explained that the early Marx was a humane Marx who stressed the need to uphold the rights and prerogatives of the individual. On the other hand, he said, the Program of the People's Democratic Revolution adopted by Sison's CPP puts premium on the rights of the state and the party over the individual. On the method of grabbing power, the new group will utilize all forms of struggle including elections, lobbying, and mass mobilizations. "We are also open to armed struggle, but it shall be on a case-to-case basis," said the Siglaya leader. Sison's group, on the other hand, has a very clear stand on the seizure of state power, and that is to destroy by armed means the machinery of the state and installing a national democratic state. The Siglaya leader, however, said the new movement agrees with Sison on the need to install a "national democratic state" as a transition to a socialist goal.
