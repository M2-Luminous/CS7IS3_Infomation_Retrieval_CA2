Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a news conference that it is time for all the coalition members to take a united front in helping Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 state budget go smoothly. Murayama said any move that threatens the unity of the coalition should be avoided. Murayama said he relayed his thoughts to Hosokawa when he visited the premier at his official residence last week to inquire about news reports that the planned coalition study group is a preliminary step before establishing a new party. Mass media reports said that a prerequisite for joining the group is support for choosing joint candidates under the new electoral system for the House of Representatives. Hosokawa said earlier this month the coalition would be at a disadvantage in the next general election unless it overcomes internal rivalry and agrees to file a joint candidate in each of 300 single-seat constituencies. If joining the study group is a condition to be selected as a joint candidate or if the group is designed to create a new party, "I would not be able to agree" to let SDP legislators participate, Murayama said. But he added the SDP has no plan at the moment to decide on whether to allow party ranks to join the study group and instead will keep watch over political developments.
