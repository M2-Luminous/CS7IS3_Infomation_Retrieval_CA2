U.S. foreign stock investments (buying on balance) in 1993 was 2.5 times that of the previous year, totalling more than $120 billion. This surpassed Japan's investments at its peak (in 1989; $120 billion). Backed by low interest rates in the United States, capital from pension funds and personal investment trust funds flowed into the stock markets in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. On the other hand, Japanese investment in foreign stocks (buying on balance) was around $36 billion from January to November 1993, equivalent to less than one-third of the U.S. investments. This switch of leading player in international stock investments reflects the change in the balance of power in the international financial market brought about by the economic recovery in the United States and the prolonged recession in Japan. According to statistics compiled by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board (FBR), stock investments of U.S. residents in foreign countries for the whole of 1993, estimated from figures for January to September, exceeded $120 billion. Until 1988, U.S. foreign stock investments had been less than $10 billion yearly. This started to increase in the second half of 1989, and has grown rapidly in the 1990's. Behind this increase is the expansion of investment funds from the pension funds and investment trust funds. With the increase in available capital, U.S. pension funds began to turn to stock markets in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, where the United States used to take a more cautious approach. Moreover, personal funds withdrawn from bank accounts due to low interest rates have also gone into overseas markets through investment trust funds. According to the U.S. investment trust association ICI [Investment Company Institute], net capital flow into overseas investment trust funds from January to October 1993 was $26.6 billion, about four times that of the comparable period in the previous year. In 1993, the upheaval in the foreign exchange mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS) subsided, and stock markets in the European countries enjoyed stable growth. This added fuel to investments from the United States. Furthermore, "the flow of capital into the Mexican market in anticipation of the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the Southeast Asian countries, which continued to enjoy high economic growth," was subtantial (according to the Nomura Research Institute). On the other hand, while Japanese investments in overseas stock markets maintained a high level at $80-100 billion annually from 1986 to 1988, and "Japan money" had great influence in the international financial market, this has declined rapidly since investments peaked at $120 billion in 1989. According to Finance Ministry statistics, investments in overseas stocks from January to November 1993 amounted to only $35.9 billion, or less than one-third of the volume during the peak period. Not only has financial speculation through overseas stock investments decreased since the bursting of the bubble economy, life insurance companies and other institutional investors have also taken a more cautious attitude toward foreign stock market investments involving exchange rate risks with the progressive appreciation of the yen, and the decline in latent profits from domestic stockholdings. The Japanese private sector, which used to be the leading player in international stock investments, now avoids the risks involved in such investments due to the prolonged economic recession. The private sector in the United States, which has overtaken Japan in economic recovery, now replaces Japan as the source of capital in the Asian and European markets. Analysts say that "the second half of the 1980's was the era of Japan money, while the first half of the 1990's will see the dominance of American money" (according to the Mitsubishi Bank's International Capital and Foreign Exchange Division).
