My aim is to inform you on the prevailing situation and to express some of my views on this situation. As you know, the Azerbaijani state and its leadership aim at putting an end to the ongoing war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and for this purpose is trying to achieve a certain agreement by holding peace talks. We have taken many steps in this direction. We are always trying to make use of the possibilities of the international organizations. We accept the big powers' initiatives and try to benefit from them. We have established contacts with the Armenian Republic and are holding talks with them. Recently we accepted the mediation initiative of the Russian state, and through the Russian Foreign and Defense Ministries we have given our consent to a certain agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. I do not intend now to analyze all the processes in recent months for you. However, I want to single out some facts. As you know, during the CIS meeting in Ashgabat on 24 December last year, I met with Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and held detailed talks with him and made proposals to end the ongoing war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We held a broad exchange of views. At that very same CIS meeting, I made an extensive statement on Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan over the last few years, invited the CIS leaders to intervene in this problem, and declared that war between the CIS states is abnormal and that therefore the head of each state should express his own stance on this matter. Later on, the Russian Foreign Ministry became active. We received the representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry on various occasions, examined different draft agreements, submitted our proposals, and tried to achieve an agreement by making certain compromises. However, even these did not produce any results. Finally, the defense ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Russia met in Moscow on 18 February and a protocol was signed between Armenia and Azerbaijan on a cease-fire and holding peace talks. We also accepted this for the simple reason that we have always worked, and are still working, for the peaceful resolution of the conflict. According to that protocol, the cease-fire in the Karabakh zone and on all the fronts was to go into effect between Azerbaijan and Armenia as of 1 March. This was to be followed by talks, the withdrawal of Armenia's Armed Forces from the occupied Azerbaijani lands, and a major agreement. However, the Armenian side undermined even this agreement. It started to launch constant attacks against our positions as of 2 March. Thus, this agreement also produced no result. The chairmen of the Azerbaijani and Armenian parliaments met in Kazakh on 12 March. They held talks. We were hoping that these agreements would produce a result. However, later on the Armenian side did not abide by these agreements and continued with its attacks against the Azerbaijani lands and Army positions. These attacks by Armenia's Armed Forces continued until the end of March. However, I can state with great satisfaction and pride that the Azerbaijani Army, Army units, our military units and fighters have checked all these attacks and Armenia's Armed Forces suffered enormous losses and were forced to withdraw without achieving anything in Fizulinskiy Rayon, against which they had mostly directed their attacks. Despite all this, we continued favoring peace talks, and almost a week ago Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian Foreign Ministry's representative, plenipotentiary ambassador, and the representative of the Russian president, visited Baku and held talks with us and presented us with a new draft agreement.
