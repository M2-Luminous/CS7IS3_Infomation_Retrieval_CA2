FBIS4-5175 "dreas068_c_94024" FBIS-EAS-94-068 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 North Korea Article Dedicated to Kim Chong-il Work Article Dedicated to Kim Chong-il Work SK0404233194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1507 GMT 4 Apr 94 SK0404233194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, in his historical work "On Some Questions in Understanding the Chuche Philosophy" published on April 2, 1974, gave a comprehensive exposition of the basic characteristics of the chuche philosophy, the chuche-based viewpoint of man, the chuche-based outlook on the world, a scientific understanding of independence and other theoretical and practical questions arising in the development of the chuche philosophy. In a by-lined article dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the publication of the work, NODONG SINMUN today says it is a monumental work that newly formulates all the fundamentals of the chuche philosophy and systematizes them in an integral whole and an immortal famous work greatly conducive to the development of the philosophical idea of the working class. It says: The dear leader expounds that the chuche philosophy is an anthropocentric philosophy which is elaborated and systematized, focussing on man. This is a scientific formulation of the basic characteristics and originality of the chuche philosophy. The chuche philosophy is fundamentally different from the human philosophy. It does not explain the human question only but raises such fundamental questions as the relationship between the world and man and the position and role of man in the world and elucidates the man-centred outlook on the world. The work is a precious ideological and theoretical treasure which newly raises and explains the human question and a great textbook of the chuche idea which gives a new correct outlook of the chuche philosophy on the world. The dear leader defined man as a social being with independence, creativity and consciousness, thus making it clear that the chuche philosophy and the bourgeois human philosophy are diametrically opposed to each other in their view of man. By elucidating the view of the world that nature and society are dominated and transformed by man, the chuche philosophy brilliantly fulfilled the philosophical task of our time in which the popular masses are masters of their own destiny and history. It is a noteworthy event in the history of human philosophy that the dear leader gave a scientific exposition of the formation and development of man's independence and its characteristics. The chuche philosophy explains that independence is not a product of evolution but a social product. As a result, it has been made clear that man is not a simple biological being that represents on the highest level such natural attribute as desire for existence which other living matter in general has, but the most developed social being that represents such social attribute as independence which other living matter cannot have.
