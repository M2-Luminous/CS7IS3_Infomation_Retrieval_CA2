Kucan met Federal President Klestil, Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Foreign Minister Alois Mock, and Nationalrat President Heinz Fischer for talks. In connection with the Krsko nuclear power plant, Kucan, who expects Vienna to support Slovenia's European Union [EU] ambitions, said that Slovenia was as worried about the safety of its citizens as Austria. Kucan emphasized his country's interest in Austrian EU accession and voiced his hopes that Vienna's experience in the entry talks with Brussels would also benefit Ljubljana in its objective to join the EU. Vranitzky underlined that he agreed with Kucan that the process of European integration would have a positive influence on bilateral relations. On the issue of Krsko, Kucan and Vranitzky said that on Thursday they did not discuss a date for the resolution on shutting down the nuclear power plant near the border area. According to Kucan, the plant can be completely shut down only 10 years after Ljubljana makes a decision to this effect. He pointed out that first one must clarify the question of an energy supply for Slovenia, citing as an example more hydroelectric power stations on the Save River. Moreover, the decision in Krsko does not lie with Slovenia alone but also with Croatia, which also has an interest in the nuclear power plant. Klestil announced that he hinted to Kucan that Austria would be interested in further developing an early warning system and that, at the next meeting of Central European presidents, he would advocate a nuclear-free zone in the region.
