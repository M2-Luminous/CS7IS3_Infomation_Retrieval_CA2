He added that the government does not take orders from the World Bank or other financial institutions. The government's decisions in the area of economic reform, he pointed out, are based on the conviction that they will serve the interests of the homeland and the citizens. He also said that no one could force us to do something in which we do not believe. In an interview with AL-AHRAM published today, the prime minister added: We have economic ties with all countries. We export, import, and hold open dialogue with all the world's countries and economic blocs, including the IMF, the World Bank, and the Paris Club. He added that we all benefit through common interests, and our cooperation with the World Bank and other international institutions must be viewed in the context of "common interests" only. Dr. Sidqi touched on the issue of price hikes. He added that the state is striving for economic liberalization and for keeping the economy free from administrative decisions. This does not mean, however, that there will be no state control on prices and on the quality of commodities. The proof of this is that many contaminated commodities are discovered and rejected, and their importers are brought to trial. The prime minister emphasized that for more than two years prices have been relatively stable. He said that inflation rates are declining noticeably. The rate now has gone down to approximately 7 percent, compared with over 25 percent a few years ago. This proves that the economic reform policy in Egypt is successful. On reports that the government intends to lay off employees in the public sector after privatization, Dr. Sidqi reiterated that there will be no victims from the public business law and that no employees will be laid off unless they want to and, in that case, they will get all their rights. On the government's confrontation with corruption, Dr. Sidqi said that no society is free from corruption, but this issue has been highly exaggerated here. Most cases of corruption are the result of rumors or malicious writing. Many of these cases have been taken to court and the rulings were decisive. The prime minister was then asked about the delay in enacting the tenant-landlord law. He noted that the government prefers to conduct more studies on this matter and that the results will soon be submitted to the People's Assembly, because such a law could have negative or positive ramifications for society and it should be studied further.
