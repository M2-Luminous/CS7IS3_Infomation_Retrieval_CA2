He critized the U.S. position toward the faltering Middle East peace process. Mufidah al-Hashani interviewed 'Abd-Rabbuh in Tunis: ['Abd-Rabbuh] The situation has actually resulted from the Israeli position, which offers proposals that try to regulate the occupation more than end the occupation of the Palestinian territories. The Israelis propose some ideas that aim to slice off parts of Gaza, especially in the coastal area and along the green line between the Gaza Strip and Israel. They also propose other ideas, greatly restricting and narrowing the powers of the Palestinian authorities and police. [Al-Hashani] What is the new Palestinian proposal? ['Abd-Rabbuh] What is now required is that the peace process be salvaged on a new basis and through a new approach; that is by the immediate transition to negotiations on the final stage. [Al-Hashani] What is the current U.S. stand on the negotiations? ['Abd-Rabbuh] So far we have not sensed a serious U.S. stand to affect the course of negotiations. The U.S. side merely presents proposals of a procedural and administrative nature.
