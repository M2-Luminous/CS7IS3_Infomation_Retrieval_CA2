In this round of reform of the tax system, under the flag of equitable tax burdens and the gradual achievement of tax equality between domestically funded and foreign-funded enterprises, not only have taxes on foreign-funded enterprises been increased, but those enterprises have also come to be required to pay several additional taxes. Just the new taxes on foreign-funded enterprises include: the land appreciation tax, urban maintenance and construction tax, vehicle and vessel use tax, securities trading tax, and consumption tax. Taxes of which rates have been raised or raised in disguise include value added tax, business tax, real estate tax, and urban land use tax. Real Estate Businesses Are Faced With an Increasingly Difficult Situation Since the middle of 1993, the real estate industry cooled down across the mainland because of the impacts of the tightening of the money supply and macroeconomic regulation and control measures on the mainland. According to statistics of the Construction Ministry, in January-October 1993, for the country as a whole the rate of growth in the completion of investment in commercial buildings declined by 10 percentage points from last year; the rate of growth in the floor space of newly started buildings declined by 15 percent; sales of commercial buildings declined by 9.6 percentage points; and forward prices for buildings on the real estate market declined by approximately 20 percent. The per mu price of land fell from 1.8 million yuan to 200,000 yuan in some cities in southern China. Foreign businessmen who had invested in the real estate industry on the mainland were already having a very difficult time. Nevertheless, the Provisional Regulations on the Land Appreciation Tax of the People's Republic of China which came into effect on 1 January 1994 levy the land appreciation tax on all enterprises and individuals conducting transfers of use rights to state land and buildings and other things affixed to the land and receiving incomes from the transactions, including domestic and foreign investors. Thus, the new tax law is similarly applicable to domestic and foreign real estate developers, investors, speculators, and ultimate customers. This means that developers must pay the appreciation tax before transferring buildings, and that when individuals buy or sell buildings, it is necessary to pay the appreciation tax each time real estate is transferred. The minimum rate of the land appreciation tax is 30 percent, and the maximum rate is 60 percent. According to calculations, under the situation where the new land appreciation tax is levied by the mainland, a foreign businessman who has made less than 500,000 yuan from investing in real estate development would have to pay 265,500 yuan in land appreciation and foreign-funded enterprise income taxes, resulting in an effective tax rate of 53.1 percent. If the income is between 510,000 and 1 million yuan, the effective tax rate would be 56.45 percent; if the income is between 1.01 million and 4 million yuan, the effective tax rate would be a high as 67.34 percent. According to Shen Yu-wen, a partner of the On Wing Accounting Firm of Hong Kong, real estate projects accounted for a large proportion of the over $100 billion to be invested by foreign businessmen under contracts signed last year. Procedures for real estate transfers on the mainland are laborious, and economic bearing capacity is limited; thus the secondary real estate market is immature in the first place. In addition, the tax system will adversely affect foreign investment on the mainland. Also, recently many foreign businesses have invested in public construction such as light railway, subway, highway, and bridge construction, and have thereby acquired some land as a compensation for the inadequate returns on their investments. After the implementation of the new tax system, returns on their land properties will decline by at least over 30 percent. After the imposition of the new appreciation tax, as investors must pay the appreciation tax before transferring buildings and have to the pay appreciation tax each time real property is transferred, and as in addition to paying the appreciation tax individuals also have to pay the individual income tax when buying or selling buildings, there will doubtless be adverse effects on foreign investment on the mainland. Tax Increase Results in Increased Tax Burdens on Foreign Businessmen According to an informed source on the mainland, the basic idea directing the adoption of the new tax system in 1994 was to gradually increase the proportion of tax revenues to GNP and to raise the share of central fiscal revenues in all fiscal revenues through the reform of the tax system. Through the implementation of the new tax system, the mainland is estimated to increase its tax revenues by approximately 30 billion yuan annually. In recent years the mainland has been having a fiscal deficit every year; the number of officials of all levels has swollen to over 30 million. Each year such items as dinners at public expense, expenditures on meetings and investigation missions abroad, and vehicle purchases at public expense would each cost over or nearly 100 billion yuan. The huge deficits can only made up through tax increases. Thus the new tax system and the reform of the tax system are carried out just for the purpose of increasing taxes; they are just the center's efforts to get more from tax revenues. In the previous few years, in order to attract foreign capital, the mainland applied a preferential tax policy characterized by three-year reductions and four-year exemptions to foreign-funded enterprises. But under the new tax system, unifying income taxes on domestically funded and foreign-funded enterprises will be considered. Under the new tax system the turnover tax has been divided into the value added tax, consumption tax, and business tax, which will be applicable uniformly to domestically funded enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises; the uniform industry and commerce tax levied on foreign-funded enterprises will be abolished; the basic rate of the post-reform value added tax is proposed to be 16 percent. As pointed out, when the value added tax is levied on foreign-funded enterprises, there will be some changes in tax burdens. With regard to the existing uniform industry and commerce tax, the tax burden resulting from approximately 40 percent of the tax items is equal to that resulting from the turnover tax levied on domestically funded enterprises; the burden resulting from approximately 30 percent of the items is slightly higher than that levied on domestically funded enterprises; and the burden resulting from nearly 30 percent of the tax items is slightly lower than that resulting from the turnover tax levied on domestically funded enterprises. Furthermore, quite a few of the newly instituted taxes will affect foreign businessmen. For example, it is stipulated that foreign-funded enterprises which previously did not have to pay the urban maintenance and construction tax should become that tax's new payers, with a tax rate of 0.5-1 percent being applied to them. A securities trading tax will be levied on trading in Type B stocks, and the basic tax rate has been proposed to be 3 percent, which will be applied to both sides of trading and allowed to float upward by 10 percent at the maximum. The urban real estate tax and vehicle- and vessel-use license tax levied on foreign-funded enterprises and foreign nationals will be abolished, and the real estate tax and vehicle and vessel use tax will be levied in a uniform manner. The relevant tax rates and tax amounts which are too low at present will be appropriately raised. The principles on implementing the new tax system also stipulate that except for the uniform tax breaks provided for by tax laws, no tax breaks should be given to enterprises, sectors, or regions of any kind, including special economic zones as specifically pointed out. This amounts to declaring that the preferential tax policies which regions of the mainland have promised foreign businessmen when trying to attract investment will become legally invalid. The Minimum Income Level for Payers of the Individual Income Tax Is Too Low While the Individual Income Tax Rates Are Too High A foreign employee of a foreign-funded enterprise on the mainland complained to me that the minimum income level for payers of the individual income tax was too low while the tax rates were too high, that furthermore the tax must be paid with foreign exchange, and that the situation was really not right. According to a source, with regard to the effective deduction standards relating to the individual income tax under the new tax system, the amount of monthly deduction is proposed to be 800 yuan on the basis of the general living expense standard on the mainland. With regard to individual income tax rates, incomes are divided into two categories, "wage and salary incomes," and "production and business incomes"; an excess-amount progressive rate of 5-45 percent will be applied to the former, and an excess-amount progressive rate of 5-35 percent will be applied to the latter. The tax burden level is largely similar to that of the enterprise income tax. Because of vigorous calls made by many foreign employees, the mainland will make foreign nationals eligible for additional deductions after the imposition of the uniform individual income tax on Chinese and foreign nationals, and is planning to increase a foreign national's monthly deduction to 4,000 yuan. In addition the mainland is also planning to institute an inheritance tax and gift tax, and will impose inheritance and gift taxes on overseas Chinese and people from Hong Kong and Macao; the relevant draft documents have been submitted to the State Council. The consumption tax instituted under the new tax system will also affect foreign businessmen. As pointed out, the consumption tax will be applied to: some luxury, high-grade consumer goods, some consumer goods in the nonrenewable resource category, some oversupplied products which need to be restricted for a period of time in order to support the adjustment of the product mix, and products which will cause substantially less tax burdens after the institution of the value added tax. It is preliminarily planned that the consumption tax will be levied on 20 commodities, including mainly cigarettes, alcohol, cosmetics, jewelry, air conditioners, refrigerators, color television sets, videocassette recorders, motorcycles, cars, gasoline, diesel fuel, and fireworks; in the future adjustment and control will be carried out in accordance with the demands of the state's macroeconomic policy and in view of changes in consumption structure. Strengthening Mechanisms So As To Impose Severe Punishments on Tax Evasion The mainland was previously called a paradise of tax evasion and avoidance for foreign businesses, and the low tax rates and the lax tax collection system were one of the reasons why many foreign businesses vied with each other in making investments on the mainland. However, after the implementation of the new tax system, the situation will be greatly changed. --A tax report system will be established across the mainland. After the establishment of the tax report system, economic penalties will be imposed on those who fail to report on schedule, and a failure to report truthfully will be considered an act of tax evasion and will be sternly punished in accordance with the law. --The establishment of a system of strict tax examination. The main force of taxation agencies on the mainland will turn into being engaged in routine and priority tax examinations; a tax-collection and -management situation characterized by the combining of reporting, agent service, and examination is to be created, and as a supporting measure, the method of imposing heavy penalties on tax evasion will be used. --To meet the demands of the implementation of the separate taxation system, two systems of tax collection agencies responsible for collecting central and local taxes respectively will be established. --Except for the tax breaks provided for by tax laws, governments at various levels may no longer grant tax breaks, neither may taxation agencies, fiscal agencies, or other agencies. --The building of the legal system governing taxation will be enhanced; efforts to complete the process of making tax laws and regulations will be accelerated; and a mechanism of having tax-related legislation, adjudication, and law enforcement be independent of one another and constrain one another will be gradually established.
