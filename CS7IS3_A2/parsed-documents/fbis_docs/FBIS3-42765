The foreign trade turnover of states of the Commonwealth (not including trade transactions among themselves) in January-November 1993 amounted to $80.3 billion in current prices. This is 7 percent less than the level for the same period of 1992. The volume of exports increased by 7 percent, while imports decreased by 22 percent. The balance with respect to export and import operations of states of the Commonwealth in January-November was positive in the amount of $15.5 billion. The number of unemployed persons who applied to the employment service seeking work exceeded 1.6 million on the whole throughout the Commonwealth as of the end of November. This is 2.4 times greater than the need for workers as stated to employment services. For every vacant job position in Azerbaijan, there were four persons unemployed, as opposed to 3.4 in January. In Armenia these figures were 53 and 75, respectively. In Belarus, they were four and 1.5; in Kyrgyzstan, 2.4 and 1.3; in Moldova, 22 and 18; in Russia, 2.7 and 3.4; and in Tajikistan, six and 33. The number of persons out of work and registered with the employment services amounted to 1.1 million as of the end of November, or over 70 percent of the unemployed population (this figure for the end of January was 0.9 million, or 61 percent). The dynamics of persons out of work in countries of the Commonwealth in 1993 is shown below (as of the end of the reporting period, numbers of individuals): First Second Third October November quarter quarter quarter Azerbaijan 7,700 6,700 19,100 18,800 18,900 Armenia 76,700 87,600 95,900 98,600 100,700 Belarus 52,800 54,900 63,400 65,800 67,300 Kazakhstan 39,300 37,600 37,200 39,100 39,800 Kyrgyzstan 2,400 2,700 2,800 3,200 3,100 Moldova 12,800 9,800 10,400 10,800 11,000 Russia 730,000 717,100 706,000 728,400 779,200 Tajikistan 9,700 11,700 16,500 18,000 20,500 Uzbekistan 14,900 15,100 14,400 14,100 13,500 Ukraine 79,500 73,300 78,700 79,500 80,500 The most significant proportion of people out of work is attributable to workers laid off from enterprises and organizations: Their share as of the beginning of October constituted 56 percent in Kyrgyzstan, 49 percent in Moldova, and 28 percent in Russia. One out of every five persons out of work is a rural resident. Young people account for 55 percent of the total in Kazakhstan, 30 percent in Kyrgyzstan, and 37 percent in Russia. The share of individuals receiving unemployment compensation fluctuates from 24 percent in Azerbaijan to 64 percent in Russia. Industry In January-November 1993, the total volume of industrial production throughout countries of the Commonwealth decreased by 14.7 percent from the level of the same period of 1992. The change in production of consumer goods in January-November 1993 as compared with the level for the same period of 1992 for states of the Commonwealth is characterized by the following data (in percentages): Consumer Including: products Food All Nonfood Nonfood products nonfood products products products of light for industry cultural, domestic, and household use Azerbaijan 90 94 96 93 98 Armenia 73 52 78 85 75 Belarus 96 90 99 98 99 Kazakhstan 85 83 90 90 89 Kyrgyzstan 80 76 86 93 75 Moldova 88 82 96 103 90 Russia 89 89 90 79 93 Tajikistan 89 94 87 86 89 Turkmenistan 99.2 97 106 113 78 Uzbekistan 112 108 116 115 119 Ukraine 83 84 79 75 81 (January-October) Average across the 90 89 90 86 94 Commonwealth The output of foodstuffs diminished. Industrial output of meat in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan was 10 percent less than in January-November 1992; in Russia and Belarus, 16-18 percent less; Moldova, 38 percent less. Whole milk output in Russia decreased by 16 percent; in Kazakhstan, by 34 percent; and in Kyrgyzstan, by 41 percent. In most of the Commonwealth countries, production of vegetable oil was reduced, as was that of fish as an edible commodity, flour, macaroni products, and cereals. A reduction was seen in the production output of the main light industry varieties. A 25 percent reduction, on the average, was seen in the production of fabric of all varieties and footwear in the Commonwealth, as compared with January-November of last year. Production of fabric in Russia decreased by 29 percent; production of footwear in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan decreased by 29-32 percent. In a number of states, the output of major varieties of major home appliances has exceeded the level for the same period of last year. Production of television sets, refrigerators, and freezers in Russia grew by 10-11 percent over this period. The output of washing machines in Uzbekistan increased by 25 percent; in Moldova, by 21 percent; and in Belarus, by 15 percent. In Kazakhstan, production of tape recorders increased by 13 percent. In Moldova, the output of refrigerators and freezers grew by 9 percent. At the same time, the production of certain varieties of these items decreased as compared with the level of January-November 1992. In Belarus, the output of tape recorders decreased by 34 percent, of television sets--by 25 percent; in Kazakhstan, production of washing machines decreased by 26 percent; in Russia, output of tape recorders decreased by 18 percent, and of radios and radio equipment--by 28 percent. Generation of electric power in January-November decreased by 6 percent on the average across the Commonwealth as compared with the same period of 1992. Production of electric power by individual states of the Commonwealth in January-November 1993 is characterized by the following data: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Billions of kilowatt-hou-|Percentage of January-No-| | |rs |vember 1992 level | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Azerbaijan |17.1 |96 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armenia |5.7 |70 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belarus |30.1 |89 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakhstan |69.0 |93 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kyrgyzstan |9.8 |92 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moldova |... |... | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |820 |95 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tajikistan |16.4 |105 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Turkmenistan |11.2 |94 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Uzbekistan |44.3 |96 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukraine (January-October)|188 |92 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Coal production over the January-November period decreased by 10 percent in Russia and by 12 percent in Kazakhstan, including reduced production of coking coal of 13 and 11 percent, respectively. Production of gas was 4 percent lower than the level for the same period of last year in Russia, while this was 5 percent higher in Uzbekistan. Production of gas in Turkmenistan increased significantly--by 13 percent. This was the main factor determining the increase in total volume of industrial production in the republic. Production of oil in the Commonwealth diminished as compared with January-November 1992 levels, including by 13 percent in Russia, by 10 percent in Kazakhstan, and by 15 percent in Turkmenistan. Production of motor vehicle gasoline decreased by 14 percent, diesel fuel--by 16 percent, and furnace fuel oil--by 13 percent. The output of motor vehicle gasoline in Turkmenistan decreased by 22 percent, of diesel fuel and furnace fuel oil--by 29 percent. These figures for Belarus were 31, 32, and 35 percent, respectively. In Uzbekistan the level of production of main oil products increased over last year's level. The output of finished rolled ferrous metals decreased by 8 percent from the levels of the same period of last year. The decline in total production volume in machine building was not overcome. Output of metal-cutting machine tools in Kazakhstan decreased by 26 percent, in Russia--by 18 percent, and in Belarus--by 15 percent. Production of forging and pressing machines here decreased by 10, 55, and 67 percent, respectively. Production of tractors in Russia was reduced by 30 percent, in Uzbekistan--by 36 percent, and in Kazakhstan--by 57 percent. In the chemical industry, the output of mineral fertilizers in Russia decreased over January-November by 21 percent, in Belarus--by 36 percent, and in Kazakhstan--by 66 percent. Some 26 percent less of chemical fibers and filaments were produced in Russia than in January-November of last year; 25 and 23 percent less--of soda ash and caustic soda, respectively. In Belarus the output of chemical fibers and filaments decreased by 22 percent, of synthetic resins and plastics--by 23 percent. The production of paper decreased across the Commonwealth by 21 percent, as compared with the same period of 1992. The production of building materials diminished. Thus, output of cement was reduced by 19 percent on the average for the Commonwealth, as well as for Russia; in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, cement output was reduced by 37-40 percent, and in Tajikistan--by 46 percent. Intergovernmental agreements for the delivery of many technical and industrial production varieties for 1993 are not being implemented, although the volumes pertaining to the above-mentioned agreements are significantly reduced from 1992 volumes. Nonfulfillment of the agreements is due to the fact that Commonwealth countries have introduced restrictions on product exports under conditions of declining production, and the fact that consumer enterprises are not able to make payments. Agriculture Purchases of the main varieties of plant product output in states of the Commonwealth changed in 1993, as compared with the same period of 1992, in the following manner (in percentage of 1992 level): Grain Sunflower Sugar Raw Potatoes Vegetables seeds beets cotton (factory) Azerbaijan 102 - - 105 73 75 Armenia 37 - - - 375 8 Belarus 105 - 164 - 80 91 Kazakhstan 49 34 - - 110 73 Kyrgyzstan 113 - - 79 34 25 Moldova 147 42 48 - 200 82 Russia 109 47 70 - 53 74 Tajikistan 167 - - 166 89 80 Turkmenistan 172 - - 104 55 72 Uzbekistan 111 - - 103 ... ...

Thus, of the total volume of meat output throughout the Commonwealth overall, the proportion produced by the populace increased from 37 percent in 1992 to 41 percent in 1993; of milk--from 37 to 40 percent; and of eggs--from 33 to 34 percent. At the same time that the volume of livestock production purchases by procurement organizations decreased, livestock output sales through other channels increased (sales on the market, direct ties with trading organizations, barter transactions, and so on). Construction The commissioning of facilities in the social sphere by state enterprises and organizations in states of the Commonwealth in January-November 1993 is characterized by the following: Housing, General-education Preschool Hospitals, Walk-in square schools, student institutions, beds clinics, meters of spaces spaces visits total per shift area Azerbaijan 451,100 9,809 1,660 475 1,940 Armenia 187,200 7,105 690 - - Belarus 1.4355 18,518 4,700 647 3,025 million Kazakhstan 1.8196 15,783 4,170 387 1,230 million Kyrgyzstan 54,200 6,667 280 110 - Moldova 120,200 1,198 720 - 200 (January-September) Russia 11.8487 159,045 24,128 6,303 17,574 million Tajikistan 114,500 10,698 700 724 325 Turkmenistan 370,500 27,909 4,035 902 580 Uzbekistan 767,700 79,041 9,224 2,488 4,862 Ukraine 4.800 64,000 13,500 1,550 4,500 million Total for the 21.9692 399,773 63,807 13,586 34,236 Commonwealth million Over the first 11 months of 1993, a greater volume of housing was commissioned than during the same period of the previous year in Armenia (by 27 percent) and Turkmenistan (by 4 percent); of general-education schools in Azerbaijan (by 3 percent), Armenia (by a factor of 2.6), Kyrgyzstan (by 68 percent), Russia (by 2 percent), and Uzbekistan (by 8 percent); of preschool institutions in Azerbaijan (by 35 percent) and Armenia (by 7 percent); of hospitals in Belarus (by 18 percent), Russia (by 66 percent), Turkmenistan (by a factor of 2.2), and Uzbekistan (by 31 percent); of walk-in clinics in Azerbaijan (by a factor of 4.2), Belarus (by 4 percent), and Turkmenistan (by a factor of 4.3). Transportation Less freight was shipped (loaded) by general-use rail transportation in January-November 1993 in all the Commonwealth countries than was the case during the same period of the previous year: Freight shipped (loaded) in 1993 as percentage of 1992 1993, tonnes level January-November November January-November November alone alone Azerbaijan 17.0 million 1.3 80 78 million Armenia 1.0 million 0.04 38 40 million Belarus 66.1 million 5.2 74 77 million Kazakhstan 202.7 million 15.0 79 70 million Kyrgyzstan 1.9 million 0.2 56 60 million Moldova 5.6 million 0.5 65 73 million Russia 1.2440 billion 100.1 82 84 million Tajikistan 1.1 million 0.1 69 51 million Turkmenistan 16.9 million 1.4 80 89 million Uzbekistan 55.4 million 4.8 94 116 million Ukraine 496.3 million 38.6 72 71 million Total for the 2.108 billion 167.2 79 79 Commonwealth million Coal shipments by railroad over the first 11 months were reduced in Kazakhstan by 14 percent and in Russia--by 12 percent; shipments of oil and oil products were reduced in Belarus by 32 percent, Kazakhstan--by 29 percent, and in Russia--by 10 percent; of ferrous metals in Belarus--by 22 percent, Kazakhstan--by 15 percent, and Russia--by 10 percent; of ferrous metal scrap in Belarus--by 20 percent, Kazakhstan--25 percent, and Russia--21 percent; of chemical and mineral fertilizers in Belarus--by 32 percent, Kazakhstan--by 48 percent, and Russia--by 25 percent; of lumber freight in Kazakhstan--by 49 percent, and in Russia--by 25 percent.

In all states of the Commonwealth, as compared with the same period of last year, the rate of growth of monetary income of the populace outpaced the rate of growth of expenditures for goods and services. Thus, monetary income over the period in question increased from 8.8-fold in Azerbaijan to 13-fold in Belarus, while expenditures for the purchase of goods and services varied from 5.5-fold to 12.1-fold, respectively. In Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Moldova, this was caused by accelerated rates of increased amounts of cash accumulated by the populace and correspondingly lower rates of population expenditures on goods and services. In Russia, the rate of growth of monetary income was greater than the rate of consumer expenditures primarily because of greater increases in the purchase of securities and freely convertible currency. The growth of monetary accumulations in January-November in Moldova amounted to 18.2 percent of income, in Russia--21.8 percent, and in Turkmenistan--67.3 percent. The change in wages in nominal terms (including material assistance and social benefits) in January-October throughout the Commonwealth countries is characterized by the following data (average per month): Rubles As percentage of same October For period of 1992 1993 as reference, percentage minimum of wage in September effect in 1993 October January-October October January-October October 1993 1993 1993 1993 Azerbaijan 17,053 26,249 955 656 103.6 5,000 Armenia 9,318 21,338 764 1,032 151.2 7,350 Belarus 45,999 111,144 1,129 1,482 148.3 15,000 Kazakhstan 44,182 106,247 1,304 1,599 132.6 14,600 Kyrgyzstan, 67.9 127.5 859 856 113.0 32.0 soms Moldova 23,376 46,239 969 1,122 110.6 7,500 Russia 51,303 100,931 1,042 1,068 111.7 7,740 Tajikistan 11,194 23,128 694 818 131.2 8,000 Turkmenistan ... ... ... ... ... 9,600 Uzbekistan 21,317 45,979 1,199 1,169 110.2 13,500 Ukraine, 85,603 272,396 ... ... 122.0 20,000 karbovantsy In October 1993, the gap between average and minimum wage in Azerbaijan was 5.3-fold, in Armenia--2.9-fold, Belarus--7.4-fold, Kazakhstan--7.3-fold, Kyrgyzstan--4-fold, Moldova--6.2-fold, Russia--13-fold, Tajikistan--2.9-fold, Uzbekistan--3.4-fold, and Ukraine--13.6-fold.

Prices Prices for consumer goods continued to rise in November in all states of the Commonwealth. Their level in the organized trade network on average for the month throughout the Commonwealth increased by 28 percent. The increase since the beginning of the year (November as compared to December of last year) amounted to a 12.4-fold rise. On the whole for the 11-month period, prices increased 17.2-fold as compared with the same period of last year.

Gaps in price levels throughout states of the Commonwealth for certain consumer products (especially food products) continue to remain extremely significant. Thus, as of 30 November, the maximum price of beef, registered in the organized trade network of the capitals of Commonwealth states and a few oblast centers of Russia, exceeded the minimum by a factor of 5.4 (in Dushanbe--R7,330 [rubles] per kilogram, Volgograd--R1,368), of cooked sausage--by a factor of 6.1 (in Dushanbe--R9,300, Bishkek--R1,531), butter--by a factor of 3.3 (in Minsk--R5,120, Baku--R1,560), and vegetable oil--by a factor of 7.6 (in Minsk--R4,580, Voronezh--R600). The difference in prices of milk, more recently than the above-mentioned date, was 9.3-fold (in Yekaterinburg--R336, Dushanbe--R36), eggs--7.2-fold (in Tashkent--R2,300 per ten, Kazan--R320), granulated sugar--5.7-fold (in Yerevan--R3,000, Baku--R530), and wheat bread--7.6-fold (in Moscow--R454, Minsk--R60).

While the trade mass volume, that is, commodity turnover in comparable prices, was 5 percent lower than in January-November of the previous year, and 37 percent lower than the 1991 level. Stocks of consumer goods on hand as of 1 December 1993 in the organized trade network of countries of the Commonwealth could support trade over the course of 45 days, just as was the case as of the same date the previous year. In this regard, the supply of stocks in the trade network of Armenia decreased almost by a factor of 3 (from 53 days as of 1 December last year to 18 days), as well as in Tajikistan (from 83 days to 30 days). In Moldova, trade was supported by a 23-day supply; as of the same date in 1992--by a 39-day supply. A drop of 8-13 percent was observed in product supplies available to support the trade network in Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. Stores on hand throughout Russia comprised a 46-day supply on the average, as opposed to a 43-day supply as of 1 December 1992.

In actual prices and rates it was 10.6 times greater, more than 90 percent of the volume of services being attributable to increased prices and rates for individual services. As a result of the sharp increases in cost of paid services, a significant reduction was seen in their demand by the population. Visits by citizens to enterprises engaged in providing everyday services decreased, and the reduction in numbers of such enterprises was quite noticeable. Some 39 percent fewer services (in comparable prices) on average throughout the Commonwealth were performed for the populace in November than in November 1992. On the whole over the 11 months, the reduction amounted to 29 percent as compared with the same period of 1992.
