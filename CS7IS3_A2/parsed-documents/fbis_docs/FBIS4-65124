That is, not to go before the Senate until we have obtained a vote of confidence from the lower house." This was said by Giulio Maceratini, leader of the National Alliance's [AN] 48-strong caucus in the Senate. Who said right-wingers are conservative? In order to create the new government they are even willing to abandon the tradition whereby prime ministers-designate present their executives in alternation to both houses of parliament. This time it is supposed to be the Senate's turn. On paper, the majority lacks sufficient seats in the Senate to govern. And so? "So traditions are made to be broken," Maceratini said. Together with Forza Italia's group leader, attorney Cesare Previti, Maceratini was one of the architects of Carlo Scognamiglio's election to the speakership of the Senate. "In any case," Maceratini concluded, "I do not consider this custom of alternation so important." So "allies permitting, and with the agreement of the parliamentary speakers, Mr. Berlusconi will approach the lower house first and will address us Senators only after he has obtained the expected approval of the deputies." Will the impetus of the lower house vote be enough to secure the approval of the Senate, too? Operation Senators started after Berlusconi's announcement ("I will address parliament Thursday [12 May]"): The majority is three votes short of a majority. The Freedom Alliance has 156 elected senators out of 315. "But there are also 11 life senators," Massimo Palombi, elected in Rome for the Christian Democratic Center, said. "Last time, in the vote on Scognamiglio, they all voted in favor, apart from Giovanni Leone, who voted for Spadolini, but that was only out of personal friendship. Now, however, the establishment of the government is at stake, and it will be different." Which life senators might grant Berlusconi their support? Gianni Agnelli, for one: He has already made it known that, if absolutely necessary, he will not withhold his vote. And the same goes for former President Francesco Cossiga, whose sympathies for Berlusconi and [AN leader] Fini are well known. But Forza Italia is hoping that Giulio Andreotti and Amintore Fanfani, physical ailments notwithstanding, will also attend the Senate in its hour of need. Then there is Emilio Taviani, and many people remember that Silvio Berlusconi's first official move as prime minister-designate was in fact a courtesy visit to the octogenarian senator. Did he persuade him to grant him his vote of confidence? It goes without saying that a majority established on this basis is anything but a solid one. This is why Forza Italia's strategists are gazing longingly at the senators. They certainly will not receive the votes of the independents, who will make Berlusconi pay for the presence of AN ministers in key posts. Nor that of the Pact's Pietro Berlingeri, whom his party colleagues describe as "a person of integrity, who certainly will not sell out." That leaves the 30 senators of the Italian Popular Party [PPI]. "It is there that the possibilities exist," Maceratini smiled smugly, hinting at the effectiveness of the behind-the-scenes work that has been going on over the past few days. In fact, the results are already apparent, and the Ligurian, Luigi Grillo, already heads what appears to be an outright PPI splinter group: six senators who are willing to vote for Berlusconi. "I am no turncoat," Grillo said in self-defense in an interview with PANORAMA. "My decision is the result of strict reasoning. The old DC [Christian Democratic Party] committed every possible mistake. Now the PPI must avoid the last and most serious mistake -- that of putting itself in a corner by refusing to understand what has happened in the country." So Berlusconi will also receive votes from Grillo himself, from Aldo De Gaudenz from Trent, Tommaso Zanoletti from Piedmont, and another three as yet unnamed senators. What if that is still not enough? Then there is a solution put forward by PPI floor leader Mancino. "Nicola [Mancino]," Grillo said, "raised the idea at our meetings that if two or three votes are lacking, that same number of PPI senators could leave the chamber, thus permitting the majority to be achieved."
