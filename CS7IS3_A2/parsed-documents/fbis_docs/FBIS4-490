Isaacson] [Text] Qumbu April 11 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] will deliver more than 500,000 voter cards to Umtata on Wednesday [13 April], Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa told supporters at Qumbu on Monday. The African National Congress candidate said the IEC had agreed to increase the number of cards from 200,000 after a meeting with the ANC. Gen Holomisa again warned Transkeians not to accept food from the National Party because maize meal and sausages had been laced with a chemical which would prevent imbibers from voting. He promised residents his government would investigate claims that homeland police and soldiers, ANC and South African Communist Party members were linked to crime in Qumbu.
