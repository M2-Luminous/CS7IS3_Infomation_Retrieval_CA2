This request for statutory endorsement takes place at a time when the government's oil revenue, affected by the price crash, not only has declined and its future because of the slack world demand, is dim, but, as a consequence of the credit boycott, which has been imposed on the Iranian state for some time now, a major portion of oil receipts has to go into paying up the Central Bank's almost $13 billion[b] matured debts better known as "overdues." It was due to those very short-term and costly foreign debts that the government resorted recently to a policy of eliminating the non-government demand for hard currency. As a result, imports of raw and complementary materials and machinery parts for industries have come to an almost standstill. But on the other hand, no change has been made in the government undertaking as regards to paying "consumer" subsidies, among which the fuel subsidy alone comes up to somewhere around $10b a year. Moreover, the measure to transfer to the public the state companies and units for which, despite the fall in activities, a monstrous budget of Rls 56,000b[rials] has been proposed, has come to a halt because of lack of a strong, tactful, resolved caretaker. In this way the government intends to secure before anything else the personnel budget of its organizations and units, whether active or semi-active, and also to provide the necessary financial resources for carrying out the "manpower adjustment" policy in factories facing a cut in production caused by the lack of raw materials. Furthermore, the government prefers for the time being to continue paying consumer subsidies, which are mostly on foodstuffs, fuel, medicine, domestic flights and pilgrimage tours. But then, this method of tackling the problem of employment and earnings is, due to its human factor, a particularly sensitive social issue, will prove fictitious in the medium run with negative economic sequels. While the government sticks to paying consumer subsidies and the economy's tax paying power is waning, the major outlet for financing the government's continuous budget deficit will be the Central Bank and taking advantage of the country's banking system. And both these sources are, incidentally, extremely inflationary. In other words, the inflation arising from the increase in the government budget and unproductive subsidized expenses is outwardly delusive in the short run, for it will produce a false impression that the problems of production and employment have somehow been desirably solved. Whereas the very existence of abundant money and liquidity will, in the medium run, leave devastating, inhibitive marks on the level of employment and the income of labor power. People will become more and more inclined to converting their money into land, property, gold and hard currency. The inflationary visions spiral will gulp down all the sinking-funds of industries and social security and retirement savings and do away with all incentives for productive investment. In order to neutralize the inflationary sequels of the government proposed budget for next year, the following measures need to be taken: 1. The Islamic Majles should adjust the proposed funds at a reasonable single-digit inflation level; 2. Instead of spending thousands of billions of rials on keeping the state companies up, the government should as soon as possible transfer these units at a suitable price and by long-term installments to the public, experts and the personnel of the same units. Besides, the banking facilities asked for by the government should be made available to the private sector; 3. Except for the low-income and downtrodden strata, the government subsidies on pilgrimage tours, domestic flights, basic goods, fuels, etc should be phased out; 4. The Central Bank should be accorded greater independence to issue rial bonds in domestic markets and foreign exchange bonds in the world market and to show sensitivity to any decline in the rial's purchasing power and to be answerable to the public through the legislative branch. Foreign Debts: Until now the role of the oil export earnings has been to shore up the government's general budget and meet part of the general spending. However, as of 21 March 1993, the oil revenues have come to assume a dual (domestic-foreign) role. The continuation of the government budget movement, on the one hand, and of the process of repaying the foreign debts, on the other, is now mainly dependent on crude oil exports. Thus, with the scarcity of the revenue resulting from oil exports and the maturing of foreign debts the authorities have three courses in front of them: First--Giving priority to domestic exchange expenditure and deferring the debts further. Second--Giving priority to foreign debt payment and assuming a period of austerity at home. Third--Choosing a middle course and earmark the hard currency partly for home and partly for foreign purposes. Apparently, the best course is the third one. But then this is when the share portions for domestic exchange requirements and foreign exchange requirements grow equally and at a limited fashion. What has been proposed in the 1994-5 budget bill is for repaying just one billion dollars, and this means we have chosen the first course, i.e. giving priority to domestic exchange expenses and postponing the debts further. Whereas, foresight rules that we opt for the second course in the 94-5 budget for the following reasons: 1. The more we delay our debt, the bigger its principal and interest will become. 2. On-time repayment of debts does not push up the interest progressively. So, preparation in the 94-5 budget for paying a bigger portion of the debts could mean reduction in the debt burden in the future. 3. The experience of the highly debtor countries indicates that deferral, reborrowing and going round again have been one of the causes of their accumulated foreign debts... 4. Contrary to what some believe that today's world is the world of debts and so one should not be worried, our indebtedness is very much different from the indebtedness of, say, Brazil or Argentina. Because the West helps those countries to solve their problem...But with us...it stops at nothing to strike a blow at the Islamic system. 5. Neither the world oil price nor our exports are reliable for repaying the debts on time. And so, the sooner the debts are paid the more we can avoid the oil market fluctuations and debt crisis... Liquidity & Inflation: According to the 1994-5 budget bill, state-owned companies add Rls 4,365b to the government's debt to the banking system, for they don't pay back a major part of the loans thay have received. Unfortunately, there is a big gap between the credits granted to the people and to the government sectors. In the 1994-5 budget bill the government instructs the banks to provide Rls 7,598b in credits to government-affiliated units and Rls 1,565b for the private sector. Among the government establishments too a huge portion goes to oil, gas, petrochemical, underground transportation system, steel, aviation and sugar-cane projects. If the credits prescribed for the banks are set next year at the same levels indicated above and the private sector receives as much credits as it received this year, the liquidity expansion will exceed 25%. And this would bear no relation to the average 11.7% set by the Second Five-Year Development Plan. Since the rate of inflation has hitherto grown in pace with liquidity, it will be increasing by the same ratio next year. And that is if there is no budget deficit, or else liquidity would assume a faster rate of expansion. Inflation, however, can be contained through controlling the credit ceiling. One should at least avoid to extend credits to those investments which have no economic justification and whose repayment by state companies is not possible. Otherwise, this would be considered a kind of budget deficit and could generate inflation. As for the banking system, its organizational structure has to be reformed and revised. The administrative, organizational and promotional expenses of banks are already very high. Besides, the banking network charges credit receivers high profit (interest) and surcharges. These have to be reconsidered... The cost-price of money at our banks is high compared with what it should be, and the penalty is paid by the public. One of the problems relating to how banks are managed is the composition of the Money and Credit Council. A noticeable number of its members are from the credit-using ministries. In order to reform the monetary system, the composition of the Money and Credit Council has to change with mostly organizational-economic officials and economic pundits, not credit-users, being on it. Also, to reform the economic decison-making system the composition of the Council of Economy has to be altered. Because the consumer establishments are in the majority in this council and they push the latter's decisions towards being uneconomic. A problem with the banks is that they have come to own companies. These should be transferred to the people as soon as possible. Direct investment accounting for 50% of the share should also be delegated to the people. As monopoly is harmful in many economic activities, the banks too must come out of monopoly within the rules of Islam and the Constitution. Non-bank credit institutions should be allowed to operate so that the grounds for healthy competition would be provided. In this way the state banks which now call themselves non-government and public would no longer be able to impose all sorts of costs on credit users. 1 - The amount of loan to be received by some companies from the banking system in the year beginning 21 March '94 is like this: National Oil Company Rls 1.643b, Continental Shelf Oil Company Rls 130b, National Oil Products Distribution Company Rls 166b, National Gas Company Rls 226b, Power Generational and Transmission Company of Iran (Tavanir) Rls 427b, National Iranian Steel Corp Rls 280b, (Esfahan) Steel Mill Rls 100b, Mobarakeh Steel Rls 120b, National Petrochemical Company Rls 1,062b, IRI Airline Rls 150b, Iranian National Steel Industrial Group Rls 100b, Metro Company Rls 100b and Sugar-Cane and Ancillary Industries Development Company Rls 500b. 2. As a consequence of the budget notes alone 16% will be added to the liquidity next year.
