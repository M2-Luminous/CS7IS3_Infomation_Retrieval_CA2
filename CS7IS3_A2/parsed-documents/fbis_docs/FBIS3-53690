The early-warning units will be placed in three locations -- Elat, 'al-'Aqabah, and al-Nuwaybi' -- and will be built with EC financing. The decision to set up the joint system was made at a meeting held in al-Nuwaybi' in the Sinai by the multinational committee on environment affairs within the framework of the peace talks. The systems will be built within one to one and a half years (Christian Falkovsky), the EC representative who presided over the meetings, told our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling that he hopes Saudi Arabia will join the efforts to save the environment at a later stage. Our correspondent points out that it is estimated that the European financing of the system will total $10 to $15 million.
