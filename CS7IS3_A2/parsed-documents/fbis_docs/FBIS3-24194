At the beginning of 1994 there were 154 joint-stock companies (45 percent of the total number), 26 commercial partnerships (8 percent), and 14 leased enterprises (4 percent) engaged in industrial production. The number of joint-stock companies was six times as high as at the beginning of 1993, and the number of partnerships was three times as high. The number of leased enterprises was reduced by more than half. Oblast industry produced goods worth 7.2127 trillion rubles in existing prices, with state enterprises accounting for 94 percent, mixed enterprises accounting for 5 percent, and municipal and private enterprises accounting for 0.4 and 0.6 percent respectively. Enterprises of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug produced 71.2 percent of the total output, enterprises in the Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug produced 19.6 percent, and enterprises in the south of the oblast produced 9.2 percent. The growth of production volume (or the maintenance of the previous volume) at enterprises of the Rosneftegaz corporation and Gazprom concern began to stabilize the output of manufactured goods in the oblast as a whole and in the autonomous okrugs in October 1993. Production volume is still decreasing, however, at enterprises in the southern zone. Output decreased at the turbo-machine and Ishim Agricultural Machinery plants, the Zavod ATE joint-stock company, the Ishim Machine-Building Plant, the Tobolsk Petrochemical Combine, and other enterprises. Production Output in Physical Terms: The output of petroleum and gas condensate at oblast enterprises in 1993 was 35.6 million tonnes (or 13.7 percent) below the figure for 1992 and amounted to 224.7 million tonnes, including 218.6 million tonnes of oil. Most of the oil (98.8 percent) was produced by enterprises of the Rosneftegaz corporation, and the rest was produced by enterprises of the State Geology Committee (0.7 percent), the Urengoygazprom Production Association (0.4 percent), and the Krasnoleninskneftegazgeologiya state enterprise (0.1 percent). The Kalchinsk subdivision of the Tyumenneftegaz Scientific Production Association and the Tyumennedra state enterprise produced 50,300 tonnes of petroleum in Uvatskiy Rayon. The average daily output of petroleum and gas condensate at the end of 1993 was equivalent to the 1977-78 level and amounted to 615,600 tonnes. This was 13.5 percent below the 1992 figure and 0.5 percent below the figure for January-November 1993. The output decreased at all enterprises of the Rosneftegaz corporation, with the exception of the Varyeganneftegaz joint-stock company. The output of natural gas was 3.1 percent below the 1992 figure. The average daily output was 2.8 percent below the previous year's figure. Urengoygazprom, the largest gas production association, produced 24.8 billion cubic meters, or 8.6 percent, less than it had produced the previous year. There was a decrease in the output of electricity, liquefied hydrocarbon gases, synthetic resins and plastics, metal-cutting and woodworking machine tools, oil production equipment, technological equipment for light industry, tractor and vehicle trailers and semi-trailers, agricultural machines, building brick, prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and elements, and other items. The output of all of the main products of the timber and woodworking industry also decreased. The output of diesel fuel, batteries, and disposable needles and syringes increased.
