FBIS4-56181 "drlat084__a94028" FBIS-LAT-94-084-A Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 ANNEX Cuba Guatemalan Defense Minister on War With URNG Guatemalan Defense Minister on War With URNG PA2804234494 Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 1525 GMT 26 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PA2804234494 Havana PRENSA LATINA Spanish BFN [By Ruben Cortes] [Text] Guatemala City, 26 Apr (PL) -- Guatemala's defense minister, General Mario Enriquez, admitted here today that after 30 years of war it is impossible to defeat the guerrillas militarily. In an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA, Enriquez said that, although the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] forces barely number 900 men, it is difficult for the Armed Forces to thwart the guerrillas' mobility. In view of a virtual impasse in the nation's armed conflict, Enriquez thinks the peace talks with the rebels are the ideal method to put an end to the ordeal that the confrontation has imposed on Guatemalan society. Enriquez, a former member of the government team during the peace talks (1991-92), points to a certain ambiguousness in the rebels' political willingness in the negotiations, although he admitted there had been some changes. He also noted that a general agreement on human rights was signed in March and a schedule of 11 topics was included in the agenda for the talks. The minister did not conceal what he described as excesses against individual rights perpetrated by the Army over the past three decades. He reported that the cases are in the courts and that the guilty parties will be punished. According to the Guatemalan Catholic Church, in 1993, the Armed Forces were responsible for 248 summary executions and 245 cases of forced disappearances for political reasons, all of which were blamed on paramilitary Civil Self-Defense patrols. Enriquez accused the URNG of serious human rights violations, both of individuals and groups, as noted in resolutions issued by the Guatemalan Human Rights Ombudsman's Office. Enriquez criticized the URNG's acts of sabotage against the nation's urban power grid and the intentional spilling of 400,000 gallons of oil into the Maya preserve, one of the world's largest ecological preserves. According to the minister, the Armed Forces have not received U.S. military aid since 1977. "Not one single cent. Washington even suspended several higher learning scholarships that had been provided at one time. While El Salvador has as many as 100 helicopters, Guatemala does not have as many as two. We have had to develop our own infrastructure to conduct the war against the URNG." Meanwhile, he noted that the URNG still receives some assistance from abroad, although this aid has diminished somewhat, judging from higher war taxes the guerrillas are exacting from residents within the conflict zones. Finally, Enriquez denied that an eventual cease-fire will necessarily entail a reduction in the number of men in the Armed Forces because, he said, the Armed Forces contribute to the development of society and protect the nation's borders. Enriquez also spoke about the likely reorganization of the Army and the need to replace quantity with quality.
