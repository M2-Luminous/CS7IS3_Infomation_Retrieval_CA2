FBIS4-14118 "drnes082bb_94007" FBIS-NES-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 Inter-Arab Affairs Unemployment, Illiteracy in Arab States Reported Unemployment, Illiteracy in Arab States Reported NC2704112094 Paris AFP in English 1044 GMT 27 Apr 94 NC2704112094 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Abu Dhabi, April 27 (AFP) -- Arab states are still suffering from high unemployment and illiteracy rates despite economic reforms and educational campaigns, and the problem is threatening stability in the region, an official Arab report said on Wednesday [27 April]. While illiteracy is expected to decline in the near future, unemployment is likely to get worse in some Arab countries due to economic slowdown and a rapid population growth, said the report by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund. "The high unemployment rate in several Arab countries is one of the most serious problems which affect not only economic development but social and political stability," the 1993 annual report said. "What increases the dangers of this phenomenon is that unemployment rates are steadily rising and the problem could become more complicated in future." The report said unemployment in some Arab countries far exceeded that in industrial countries where such rates do not exceed 10 percent. In Jordan, it rose from six percent in 1985 to 19 percent in 1991 while it increased from 13 percent to 16 percent in Tunisia, it said. In Morocco it stood at 16 percent and Algeria at 19 percent. It said unemployment was widespread among educated people in Algeria, Egypt and Morocco. "This makes the problem more worrying," it added. The report put the workforce in the Arab League's 22 members at 66 million, which it said would increase to 81 million by the year 2000. It said the expected growth in labour was because more women were taking up jobs and a large number of people are within working age groups. But the report cited what it called negative aspects in the labour structure in the Arab world, including the low productivity of workers, small contribution by women to economic activity and employment of children. "Productivity of a worker in Europe is more than six times the productivity in the Arab world," it said. "The problem is underscored in the farming sector, which accounts for 36 percent of the Arab labour force but its share in the Gross Domestic Product did not exceed 13 percent in 1992." Surveys conducted recently in some Arab nations showed around 1.3 million children aged between 6-14 were working in Egypt while children accounted for 13.3 percent of the total workforce in Morocco's countryside, it said. "The surveys showed that this phenomenon is prevalent in the countryside of other Arab countries," it said. "What adds to those problems is the large number of non-Arab expatriate workers in the Gulf oil producing states." The report showed the services sector attracted the largest number of workers, acounting for 46 percent. It was followed by the farming sector, which has 36 percent, and the industrial sector, with 18 percent. Women accounted for only 6.7 percent of the total Arab workforce but the level was expected to jump to 20 percent in the year 2000. "Illiteracy is another serious problem facing Arab states. Despite educational campaigns, illiteracy stood at 49 percent in 1991 compared with 66 percent in 1970. The level is expected to decline further to reach 38 percent in the year 2000," the report said. Women are suffering most, with their illiteracy accounting for nearly 62 percent of the total. The level is expected to reach 50 percent by the year 2000, it added. A breakdown for 1992 showed Somalia had the highest rate, standing at 75.9 percent, followed by Sudan at 72.9 percent, Yemen at 61.5 percent, Egypt at 51.6 percent and Morocco at 50.5 percent. The report showed Lebanon and Jordan had the lowest rates, at 19.9 percent each but it did not provide figures for the United Arab Emirates, Djibouti, Oman, Mauritania and Palestinians.
