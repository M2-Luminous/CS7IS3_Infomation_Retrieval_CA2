In the first one Kovac informed him of his dismissal and in the second one asked him as chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the strongest political party, to name a HZDS representative to form a new cabinet. Meciar said that the HZDS would not participate in any government and went into opposition. The Slovak Government ended its activity at its meeting today, Meciar said. A vote of no-confidence in his government was passed by parliament on Friday. He said the government unanimously voted to end its activity, as according to the constitution the prime minister's resignation forces the government to resign. According to the resolution adopted at the last government meeting, none of Meciar's cabinet will accept the president's offer to stay in office until a new cabinet is appointed. The government decided to recall all its state secretaries and heads of administration in all fields.
