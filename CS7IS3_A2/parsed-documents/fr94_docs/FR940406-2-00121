Relating to Additions to the ``List of Exchange Rule Violations and Fines Applicable Thereto Pursuant to Rule 476A'' March 30, 1994. Pursuant to sections 19 (b)(1) and (d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s (b)(1) and (d)(1), notice is hereby given that on March 2, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On March 21, 1994, the NYSE submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify certain aspects of the original filing. 1 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 See letter from Donald Siemer, Director, Market Surveillance Division, NYSE, to Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated March 16, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1'') I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change This proposal would revise the Rule 476A Violations List for imposition of fines for minor violations of rules and/or policies by adding to the list Exchange policy regarding a two-week probationary period for execution of orders by new members on the Exchange trading floor. 2 As part of the proposed rule change, the NYSE is also seeking approval of the policy itself. 3 2 The Exchange also has requested approval, under Rule 19d&hyph;1(c)(2), to amend its Rule 19d&hyph;1 Minor Rule Violation Enforcement and Reporting Plan (``Plan'') to include its policy in regard to execution of orders by new members. See letter from James E. Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary, NYSE, to Sandra Sciole, Special Counsel, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated March 1, 1994. 3 See Amendment No. 1, supra, note 1. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose Rule 476A 4 provides that the Exchange may impose a fine, not to exceed $5,000, on any member, member organization, allied member, approved person, or registered or non-registered employee of a member or member organization for a minor violation of certain specified Exchange rules. 4 Rule 476A was approved by the Commission on January 25, 1985. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21688 (January 25, 1985), 50 FR 5025 (February 5, 1985). Subsequent additions of rules to the Rule 476A Violations List were made in Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 22037 (May 14, 1985), 50 FR 21008 (May 21, 1985); 23104 (April 11, 1986), 51 FR 13307 (April 18, 1986); 24985 (October 5, 1987), 52 FR 41643 (October 29, 1987); 25763 (May 27, 1988), 54 FR 20925 (June 7, 1988); 27878 (April 4, 1990), 55 FR 13345 (April 10, 1990); 28003 (May 8, 1990), 55 FR 20004 (May 14, 1990); 28505 (October 2, 1990), 55 FR 41288 (October 10, 1990); 28995 (March 21, 1991), 56 FR 12967 (March 28, 1991); 30280 (January 22, 1992), 57 FR 3452 (January 29, 1992); 30536 (March 31, 1992), 57 FR 12357 (April 9, 1992); 32421 (June 7, 1993), 58 FR 32973 (June 14, 1993). The purpose of the Rule 476A procedure is to provide for a response to a rule violation when a meaningful sanction is appropriate, but when initiation of a disciplinary proceeding under Rule 476 is not suitable because such a proceeding would be more costly and time-consuming than would be warranted given the minor nature of the violation. Rule 476A provides for an appropriate response to minor violations of certain Exchange rules or policies, while preserving the due process rights of the party accused through specified, required procedures. Violations of these rules and policies that are deemed by the Exchange not to be minor in nature are also subject to formal disciplinary proceedings under Exchange Rule 476. The list of rules and policies which are eligible for the Rule 476A procedures specifies those rule violations which may be the subject of fines under the rule and also includes a schedule of fines.
