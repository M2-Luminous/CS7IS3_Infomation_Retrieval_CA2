But the Russian Federation presidential edict that is under preparation on the admission of foreign financiers and the regulation of this process will bring this protectionism to an end. There have long been arguments over this. V. Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, has particularly campaigned for foreigners to be admitted. His arguments are that without strong competitors our commercial banks have monopolized the financial services market and are making no effort to lower their lending rates or commissions, while not improving their quality or the skills of their staff. Earning inflated monopoly profits, they are paying themselves fantastic salaries, living it up, and spending crazy amounts of money on politics and the mass media rather than on the economy. This is why the Central Bank recently proposed admitting a limited number of foreign banks with weighty reputations. But their capital will be limited to one-tenth of the capital of our banks. Figuratively speaking, we will be letting a cat into the house to educate the mice, but we will be tying it up by the tail as a precaution. Naturally, this move has been opposed by Russian bankers themselves, who are scared of losing their best clients. They have been supported by former Finance Minister B. Fedorov. He admitted that, of the 2,000 commercial banks in this country (as of December 1993), only one-tenth have financially trained staff. And he noted that foreigners can afford to work at cost in order to gain market share and grab the market for deposits -- since people will trust the foreign banks' reliability more than our own financiers' persistent advertising. It is no accident, they claim, that countries like Finland and Japan had until recently not allowed foreign rival bankers access to their market. The question of "whether to let them in or not" has recently become a political one. In late 1992/early 1993 the Supreme Soviet came to the defense of the Russian banks' monopoly by attempting to bring in a three-year moratorium on the admission of foreigners. At the time Gerashchenko had protection from Yeltsin, who blocked the law. But when the country had been shaken by the October events and elections to a new parliament were at issue, the executive required support from a reliable lobby. The words of one banker were passed from person to person -- if you don't protect us we will not support the "Russia's Choice" campaign. The Central Bank then had to act in the way that the national banks of Finland and Japan once acted -- replacing foreign competitors with its own tough demands and forcing our commercial banks to increase their incorporation capital (in order to improve their reliability), to observe the norms for deductions to reserve funds, to submit accounts on time, and so forth. Particularly as of the start of this year. But Russia is not Finland. Our business is far too criminalized. Commercial bankers have either been forced to undertake risky operations, getting rid of anyone who disagreed, or staffers of Central Bank of the Russian Federation control services have begun to be threatened with reprisals. One department chief was attacked and had his dacha torched. Weapons then had to be requested for banking inspectorate officials. Then instances of their meeting with opposition and having their investigations sabotaged came to light. And, finally, one last example -- a bomb was thrown at the apartment of Ye. Zhabotinskaya, chief of the Central Bank's Novosibirsk Administration. Under these circumstances the authorities have decided to abandon banking protectionism. I believe this is the only sensible step under current conditions.
