The coalition variations based on these statements are very diverse. However, if we also consider the election prospects, the possible coalition setups that can actually become a reality after the elections can be drawn up fairly accurately, as can the parties that are most likely to become government-forming factors. It seems that this is the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] because, according to the public, the MSZP is clear favorite for the elections. This can be seen from the public opinion survey that was carried out by the Szonda Ipsos [public opinion research company], commissioned by MAGYAR HIRLAP, in recent weeks. Some of the findings appear in this article, the rest -- on what kind of coalition people would welcome -- will be published later. The national representative survey was done in the first half of March and was based on a sample of 937 people. [passage omitted] As for the outcome of the elections, people give the biggest chance to the MSZP. To the question "Which party do you think will receive the greatest number of votes at the May elections?" 40 percent placed the Socialists in first place. A relatively large number think that the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] also have a chance of final victory (18 and 17 percent), a little over a sixth assuming that they can win the elections. Far fewer people think the same of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] and the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] (10 and 7 percent), and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is even more insignificant in this respect. [passage omitted] According to our data, in the current situation, those questioned -- at least those prepared to give their views on this issue -- see the greatest chance to be for a coalition involving the MSZP and the SZDSZ, or a government coalition of the three major opposition parties. Some 20 percent of those who replied thought it most likely that the MSZP and the SZDSZ would form a government, and 14 percent saw a serious chance for this although they were less certain. A similar number of people predicted that the MSZP would accept a role in government together with the SZDSZ and the Fidesz (19 percent), and the same number thought that a joint action of the three parties had less chance (18 percent) than other permutations but was still significant. The chances of the opposition parties winning the elections and forming a government is also increased by the fact that the third most frequently mentioned variation is a coalition of the two liberal parties, namely the SZDSZ and the Fidesz: 12 percent of people mentioned this coalition possibility in first place and 11 percent in second. The public gives much less chance to a coalition involving only the current government parties: For example, few think the survival of the current coalition likely (first place: 11 percent, second place: 7 percent). Those questioned also give less chance to a mixed coalition of some of the current government and opposition parties. Some mentioned a setup with the SZDSZ and the Fidesz together with a government party, either the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] (10 and 7 percent) or the KDNP (9 and 7 percent respectively). The basis of a coalition in which the MDF could also participate (8 and 8 percent) along with the three opposition parties would also be the opposition parties. The MDF also appears as a government-forming factor with the Fidesz and the KDNP (7 and 7 percent). Of the coalition possibilities, respondents thought an SZDSZ-MSZP-KDNP coalition least likely (5 and 8 percent). It is also worth mentioning briefly which coalition setup out of those examined is favored by the possible outcome of the elections -- namely which party the public thinks likely to win in May. As has already been mentioned, most people expect the MSZP to win the elections. If this happens then, according to the respondents, the MSZP may be expected to invite the SZDSZ to be a coalition partner, but far fewer think that the MSZP will also be forced to involve the Fidesz. Those questioned can think of many coalitions involving the MSZP, but in a significant number of cases they mentioned a government coalition without the MSZP, even though they predicted a MSZP victory. This fact in itself could indicate that, according to some respondents, the MSZP will not be able to form a government in spite of a successful result. It is true, though, that this possibility -- that the winning position is not always linked to a possible role in government -- can be observed in the case of all "winning" parties albeit to a varying extent.
