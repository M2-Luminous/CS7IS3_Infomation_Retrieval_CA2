Mr. Nimetz arrived in Athens from Skopje again this afternoon and held a meeting with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, thus continuing the new round of contacts with the Greek side. Our correspondent Mirela Kalostipi has the following dispatch from the Foreign Ministry. Good evening Mirela. [Kalostipi] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. The new round of talks between Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Bill Clinton's special envoy on the Skopje issue actually concluded a few minutes ago. Mr. Nimetz arrived in Athens this afternoon, and at 1900 he came to the Foreign Ministry and talked with the Greek foreign minister for approximately 1 hour. After this meeting, Mr. Nimetz will be returning to New York. Some statements were made, but the most important point is that Mr. Papoulias has accepted the invitation of Cyrus Vance, the international UN mediator, to a meeting in New York from 9 to 11 April. Here we should say that, according to reliable press reports, a similar invitation has also been accepted by Skopje Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski. [Announcer] For the same dates? [Kalostipi] For the same date, for 11 April. There is a statement by Mr. Crvenkovski that he will also visit New York to meet with Mr. Vance. In any case, Mr. Papoulias said that Mr. Kiro Gligorov and the Skopjeans persist in their well-known intransigence. We will see how this story develops. In any event, in a statement after his meeting with Mr. Papoulias, Mr. Nimetz said that continuous in-depth and intensive discussions are going on both in Athens and in Skopje. They are discussing all aspects of the problem and, according to Mr. Nimetz, it is obvious that both sides have both the desire and the will to reach a solution. We are concerned that a solution to the problem be found. However, he added, there are still difficulties, and the negotiations and talks should continue in order to find some way out. [Anouncer] Mirela, do you assess the fact that both sides have accepted the invitation to meet with Cyrus Vance in New York on the same dates as a positive development showing that the negotiations are on the right track? [Kalostipi] Clearly, this shows that something positive is happening. At least there is a persistent movement to find a solution soon; and when we say soon, we mean prior to the prime minister's visit to the United States. But there is nothing clear concerning the question of ending Skopjean intransigence. However, I suppose--and this is a guess--that for both Mr. Crvenkovski and Mr. Papoulias to decide to visit New York in order to meet, most probably separately, with the international mediator means that they have something to say of which we do not yet know. Probably--and I am still guessing--the Skopjeans are ready to make some practical concession, but all this is conjecture. What we know as a fact is that Mr. Vance will meet with both Mr. Crvenkovski and Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias in the next few days.
