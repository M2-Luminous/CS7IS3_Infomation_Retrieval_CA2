FR940930-0-00075 FR940930-0-00013 Discussion of Comments The Coast Guard received two written comments in response to our public notice concerning the temporary deviation to the regulations for the Gallant's Channel drawbridge. Both comments were from Beaufort City Officials (the Mayor and the Town Administrator). Both comments were favorable and expressed the belief that the temporary deviation had improved the flow of highway traffic across the bridge and reduced highway traffic delays previously attributable to frequent, unscheduled openings of the bridge. Verbal comments received by the Coast Guard from State Highway Officials, bridgetenders, a local county chamber of commerce and a representative of the commercial marine industry all indicated the 60-day temporary deviation had improved the flow of highway traffic across the bridge and had a generally favorable effect on the Town of Beaufort. They also expressed the strong opinion that reverting to the existing published regulation upon expiration of the temporary deviation would have a detrimental effect on the flow of highway traffic across the bridge and would be extremely confusing to both motorists and boaters. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is a not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.
