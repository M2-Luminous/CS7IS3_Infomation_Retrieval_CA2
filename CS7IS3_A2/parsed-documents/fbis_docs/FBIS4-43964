During the Cold War years, the United States and the Soviet Union struggled for hegemony over that region. Now, the Middle East has started to gain a new status. In line with the concept of the new world order launched by the United States after the Gulf war, new balances are taking shape in the region. Israel, too, is doing all it can for the success of the autonomous Palestinian administration which has been established, in the first stage, in Gaza and Jericho. When the White House pushed for a solution in line with the new world order, Israel and the Palestinians, who had been enemies for many years, sat at the negotiating table, and the smell of gunfire which had seeped into the region began to disperse. The thing is, however, that these countries that are interested in the Middle East with its rich oil reserves and important geographical position, have not stopped playing to their own hands as well. One wing of the U.S. Administration posits the green belt project against Tehran, which wants to export the Islamic revolution and which seems to have had relative success as we can see in Lebanon, Egypt, and the occupied territories in Israel. This wing calls for a "moderate Islam" in certain Middle East countries, including Turkey, against the fundamentalism of Iran. Germany, which emerged as the strongest power in Europe after it united with its "communist half," is trying to join with Iran and Iraq against its rival, the United States. Japan comes up with attractive offers to expand its existing markets. Starting to act in line with the nationalists headed by Zhirinovskiy, who was victorious in the elections, and also in line with the "imperial" demands of the former Red Army, Russia aims at returning to the Middle East which it had left for the United States. As for Israel, which has military and economic advantages, it wants to assume a role as an independent force in the regional balance and to find new allies to suit the conditions. The developments taking place in the Middle East are so interesting that the strategists thinking about the area get lost among the large number of possible combinations every new rapprochement brings. With the establishment of the Israeli-Palestinian peace, a Palestine waiting to be built and several giant projects emerged. The fight to take a bigger share of the Middle Eastern market now makes it necessary to set up new power unions and this turns into a multipolar struggle for balances. The formulas posited to change the economic and political balances in the Middle East are based in particular on the premise that Iran and Iraq each take a smaller share of the cake. You can expect a struggle among the Western allies who will share the cake, and you can also expect the struggle to eliminate some of the allies and replace them with others. Consequently, it should not be surprising if the first internal confrontation among the Western allies of the new world order era takes place in the Middle East. Actually, the forces inside and outside the region realize that reconstruction is essential. Israel remains alone among its neighboring Arab states with its advanced technology in the industrial and agricultural fields, with its qualified cadres, great foreign trade volume, sound economy, and superior military power. Aware of its position, Israel prefers to be an active factor in the Middle East market, and not an important pawn of the many allies -- headed by the United States and Germany -- in the continuing struggle to share the cake. Israel plans to set on its path with "powerful allies" so that it can succeed in its strategy that is bound to disturb the United States in the long run. New Horizons Israel has carefully selected the countries wooed for partnership. Now that it has brought the Palestinian issue up to a certain point, Israel wants to explore new horizons. These new horizons include Turkey and Egypt. Israel has practically secured Turkey's cooperation. Agreement was reached between the two countries to cooperate in several fields months before the colorful Israeli-PLO autonomy agreement was reached in Cairo on 4 May, during Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin's visit to Israel as well as during the successive visits to Turkey of Israeli President 'Ezer Weizman and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. The Israeli media is also speculating on the possible targets and nature of future cooperation. The LINK magazine, which is known for its close contacts with intelligence sources, allocated 10 pages to Turkey in its May 1994 issue. In its articles entitled "New Administrations in the Eastern Mediterranean," "Risk Versus Reward," "Turkey: Its Potential and Problems," and "Natural Partner," the magazine studies the current and possible future state of bilateral economic, commercial, and political relations. The introduction to the study notes: "Geopolitical considerations establish a direct link between Turkey and Israel, the key allies of the West located on the edge of the Mediterranean. Turkey has the heavy industry to build the body of F-16's, and Israel can supply high technology in aeronautics. The two economies complement one another. Turkey, with its Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, holds the key to the water resources in the Middle East. Israel, which utilizes water most effectively, on the other hand, also has high agricultural technology. There are obstacles to the south and north (Syria) of the two countries. However, the two countries must enter the global market and act in accordance with the new conditions created in the eastern Mediterranean in the wake of the Cold War." The Common Enemy The studies appear to have been carefully written by Michael Eilan and Jonathan Fedler. In his article, Eilan frequently refers to Weizman's views on Turkey and proposes an alliance against a common enemy: "We have entered a process of realignment in the Middle East. This process forces certain sides to strengthen their relations and undertake joint action. The contacts conducted with Turkey so far have demonstrated that both sides favor closer cooperation in the economic as well as political fields. The fact that Turkey and Israel failed to establish closer ties until now on the basis of political reservations undermines the interests of the two countries. Given the possibility that the confusion in the Middle East could lead to new threats of war at any moment, it is becoming clear that forces whose interests converge should leave old prejudices aside." Against what and whom will this alliance be formed, an alliance which Israeli officials dwell upon at every opportunity? Later on in his article, Eilan discusses this issue. He charges that radical Islamic forces are gradually beginning to take control of the balances in the Middle East and that Iran-backed movements such as Hezbollah, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], Islamic Jihad, and Hezb-e Eslami are continuously gaining strength. Eilan claims that Turkey and Israel should form an alliance against radical Islam and assume a decisive role in the region. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, in a statement to the 28 May issue of HURRIYET, also remarked that a stability triangle to be established by Turkey, Israel, and Egypt is necessary. Referring to this trio, Rabin noted that "it can act against all kinds of nationalist, religious, Islamic, or other terrorist organizations attempting to overthrow legitimate governments or to change borders." On the basic principles of the proposed tripartite alliance, Eilan expounds as follows: "The officials of the two countries concede that their countries are not established in a peaceful oasis. Syria, Iran, and Iraq are daily increasing the dose of political pressure and commercial obstacles. Our adversaries have a military mentality and it is necessary to establish a deterrent unity of force against them. In this context, Turkey and Israel seem to have discovered the importance of deterrence. The Turkish and Israeli Armed Forces must undertake a union against forces that support radical Islam." Common Goal: Fundamentalism After positing the above proposal, LINK cannot but proceed to underline an extremely sensitive point. Pointing out that Israeli and Turkish officials fear the reaction of their own radical groups if they put their thoughts into practice, the magazine notes that the two countries can receive a satisfactory share of the Middle East cake only if they act together. The practical cooperation between the two countries is not sufficient to achieve the necessary plan, the magazine remarks, adding that Egypt must constitute the third flank of the alliance. The theory proposed by Eilan with regard to the outcome of the Turkish-Israeli alliance is quite interesting: "Turkey is currently in the process of settling accounts with the separatist Kurds. The state is engaged in a ruthless struggle against the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Israel, in turn, is waging the same struggle against the Hizballah. Providing logistics support to both organizations is Syria. It is certainly not a coincidence that Turkish leaders briefed Weizman on the Southeast Anatolia Project [GAP] and took him to visit the region. Syria is concerned about GAP's success. Turkey, if willing to undertake the risk, can block a significant part of the water flowing to Iraq via Syria. This would ruin Syria. Military cooperation between Turkey and Israel would dispel Turkey's fear of taking a risk." Claiming that Syria should definitely be disciplined, Eilan believes that a Turkish-Israeli-Egyptian alliance would certainly eliminate the "Syrian threat." Is the rise of Islamic fundamentalism the only factor that forces Israel to form an alliance with Turkey? Or, does Israel -- a U.S. ally -- want to take some steps outside the Green Belt project imposed by the Pentagon? While it is known that Israel differs from the United States on certain issues, it is also clear that Israeli leaders will not suddenly attempt to take radical steps. Israeli bureaucrats believe that Ankara, which is cooperating with Tel Aviv, will secure a rapprochement between Israel and some Arab countries. Israeli officials, who stress that countries other than Turkey, Israel, and Egypt should also receive their fair share of the Middle East cake, believe that Turkey will build the bridge which will extend to the Central Asian Turkic republics. The Plan To Restrain Iran No doubt, Israel attaches great importance to the newly independent Turkic republics. Israel, which is unable to reach out to these republics because of Iran's influence over the region, is hoping to overcome the Tehran obstacle through the alliance it wants to establish. Israeli businessmen, who until now managed to carry supplies to the Caucasus using Turkish firms as brokers, faced difficulties when Iran, becoming aware of the situation, imposed new quotas on Turkey. In addition to the new quotas, Tehran increased the transit fee from Turkey through Iran from $400 to $810 and also imposed an additional $250 service charge. Israel, which realizes that it cannot get through to Iran by itself, wants to create pressure on the Tehran administration through the new alliance. Israel's alliance proposal will also act as "a young and lively regional pact" in the Middle East. This new possible alliance, which some strategists describe as "the common market of the Middle East," will also turn into a principled economic power in due course. LINK outlines the basic guidelines of the Turkish-Israeli economic cooperation project using the words of Turkish businessman Uzeyir Garih: "Skilled and unskilled work force. This is the most important factor bringing Turkey and Israel together. There are many skilled workers in Israel. Turkey, in turn, is the paradise of unskilled manpower. Joining these two work forces will serve the interests of both countries." In actual fact, Israel did not merely prepare the manifesto of the alliance it plans to establish. In a statement he issued recently, Weizman also revealed the economic base of the Turkish-Israeli-Egyptian alliance. Emphasizing that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat realized that he must sit at the negotiating table with Israel if Palestine's interests are to be protected, Weizman declared that the newly autonomous Palestinian territories will act as the economic center of he alliance and that Palestinian leaders have acknowledged this idea on principle. Given the fact that Turkey and Egypt will maintain close relations with Islamic countries and that the alliance of these three countries will force Iran, Iraq, and Syria, which constantly create problems in the Middle East, to reassess their current policies, it is understood that U.S. leaders will not oppose this alliance -- at least not at the beginning. Furthermore, it is suggested that the United States, which knows that Israel has its own independent plan, will want to "supervise" the Israeli Administration by means of Turkey and Egypt. The Attitude of the United States The picture presented so far is very rosy, but Israel harbors serious concerns with regard to Turkey. Like the West, Israel also wants Turkey, at the very least, to resolve its Kurdish problem and implement the democratization measures promised by the government. In his statement to HURRIYET, Rabin said: "We are granting autonomy to the Palestinians. We support other countries' (including northern Iraq) autonomy plans as well." Rabin was indirectly conveying the message that the Kurdish problem must be solved. Apart from political problems, Israeli businessmen who trade with Turkey repeatedly stress that Turkey is a great economic risk. According to Israeli businessmen, who note that Turkey, Israel, and Egypt have not yet reached a level where they can finance one another, the Turkish Government should find a solution to the problem of inflation. If Turkey restores order in its economy and utilizes its water resources in a rational manner, and if the Egyptian Administration does not ignore Israel's appeal, then a very strong and promising union can emerge in the Middle East. One does not have to be a prophet to guess that this union will be faced with a fierce diplomatic offensive particularly during its initial stages. This new alliance, which will disturb especially Russia and Armenia, will be forced to struggle against the schemes of these two countries on the one hand, and against the United States and the Germany-Iran-Iraq bloc, on the other.
