This was the first formal meeting between the leaders of the two countries since Hosokawa became Japanese prime minister. The meeting was aimed at resolving trade issues between the two countries, but ended in failure without any agreement. The United States indicated its readiness to take retaliatory steps. Thus, U.S.-Japanese trade frictions will be further aggravated. At a press conference after the meeting, Clinton directly criticized Japan by saying that Japan is still unwilling to open its market to U.S. products, it was the G-7 country with the most tightly closed market, and proposals raised by Japan at the meeting could not even meet the criteria provided by the "framework agreement" concluded by the two countries in Tokyo last year. Hosokawa stressed that although no trade agreement had been reached at the summit meeting, both sides agreed that "this result should not be allowed to undermine the solid and friendly relations between the two countries," adding that both sides maintained that cooperation in the political and security fields had developed and strengthened. Since the Clinton administration assumed office, U.S. foreign policy toward Japan has changed noticeably. The United States no longer puts U.S.-Japanese security relations in primary position in U.S. policy on Japan, but stresses the importance of U.S.-Japanese trade relations. For a long time, the United States has registered a huge adverse balance of trade with Japan. Although both sides have signed almost 30 different trade agreements since 1980, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan keeps increasing. Last year, the deficit with Japan rose by 20 percent, standing at almost $60 billion. The Clinton administration has always exerted pressure on Japan on the trade question. It has asked Japan to open its market to U.S. products and reduce the huge trade deficit to provide more job opportunities in the United States and stimulate U.S. economic development. In the "framework agreement" concluded last year, the United States asked Japan to work out detailed quotas to import U.S. products. The United States calls this "target criteria." Prior to the summit meeting, Hosokawa sent a special envoy to meet Clinton and ask the United States to give Japan more time on the trade talks, to put aside their differences during the summit meeting, and to prevent the first summit meeting between Clinton and Hosokawa from breaking down. However, Clinton replied that the seven-month period from July last year had been adequate and that differences were better than an agreement where nothing had been achieved. Subsequently, Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomo Hata arrived in Washington to hold talks with U.S. Trade Representative Kantor and Treasury Secretary Bentsen. The talks went on from 10 February until the early hours of 11 February without result. Japan indicated that the "target criteria" were actually "numerical quotas" to "manage trade," which did not correspond with Japan's basic principle of free competition. Japan could not accept this U.S. demand. On 12 February, at a press conference prior to his departure from the United States for Japan, Hosokawa stressed that Japan would not ease its stand in this respect and "we will not accept numerical quotas." He said that after a "cooling down period," both sides would be able to resolve all kinds of differences. In the meantime, Hosokawa hoped that the United States would not take retaliatory measures unilaterally against Japan, as this would violate GATT principles. While the United States could possibly take this step, U.S. congressmen and some influential leaders in U.S. business circles keep asking the Clinton administration to take a hard-line attitude on Japan. In their opinion, over the last 20-odd years, the United States has tolerated Japan's trade surplus with the United States, out of consideration for U.S.-Japan security relations. But the United States should not make this mistake any longer. Some U.S. officials say that after the summit talks failed, they were no longer interested in resuming trade talks with Japan, unless Japan changed its stance. The Clinton administration has prepared a series of specific programs to force Japan to open its markets, which include meting out trade sanctions against Japan. According to some reports, if the United States takes retaliatory measures, the first thing it will do is to raise import tariffs on Japanese telecommunications products and vans, apart from restricting imports of Japanese products. In addition, it could possibly list Japan as a country engaging in unfair trade and apply corresponding measures. In some analysts' opinion, if the United States takes retaliatory measures, this will cause Japan to retaliate also. In such a case, a trade war would break out between these two big economic countries. This is something the United States is unwilling to see, because not only would a trade war damage the interests of the enterprises and consumers in the two countries, but also endanger U.S.-Japanese political relations. Apart from this, it will also undermine the achievements the United States has made in promoting global free trade through the GATT and NAFTA [North Atlantic Free Trade Association]. This would be unfavorable to the United States. However, if the United States does not take strong measures, Clinton will be criticized and his policy toward Japan will be regarded as the same as that toward Bosnia-Herzegovina: "Loud thunder but small raindrops." Furthermore, U.S. credibility in trade negotiations would be much decreased. Clinton has indicated that the United States has no alternative but to take action. This may be announced next week. On 13 February, THE WASHINGTON POST disclosed that the Clinton administration had decided to impose retaliatory measures on some Japanese products. Evidently, the aggravation of U.S.-Japanese trade frictions is inevitable.
