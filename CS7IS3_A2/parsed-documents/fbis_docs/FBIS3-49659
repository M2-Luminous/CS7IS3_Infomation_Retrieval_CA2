Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, spoke at this session on the current political situation and the work and tasks of the party. Senada Cumurovic reports: [Cumurovic] At the beginning of the festive part of the founding session of the City Committee of the Party of Democratic Action, Memhmet Alija Hadzic spoke about the previous work and activities of the party, such as, for instance, the work on the territorial organization of the town aimed at improving a better functioning of the organs of authority, the setting up of the Patriotic League, the provision of food, acquisition of arms, work on the creation and strengthening of the Army, and so forth. Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, spoke at the founding session of the City Committee of the Party of Democratic Action on the party and the general political situation. He first spoke about staff issues in terms of the opening of the party for all those who want to fight for Bosnia-Herzegovina. The criterion for this, as Izetbegovic said, is support of the people. [Izetbegovic] There are 20 months of difficult trials behind us. During these trials, some people have passed the test, some have not. Please remove those who have not passed the test from the (?party); do them a big favor. Therefore, the (?gradual) opening of the party [words indistinct]. There is another term -- that is, cleansing of the party of those who do not belong to it. Regarding cleansing, all parties, and not only our party but all parties, (?are faced) with the constant problem of [having to choose] between the honest but unable and very able but extremely dishonest people. They are often in a dilemma as to what to do. In this dilemma concerning the honest but less able, and very able but almost certainly dishonest, deceitful, people, I would recommend you opt for the honest. [Cumurovic] This meeting presented an opportunity for President Izetbegovic to comment on the remarks often addressed to him that he is striving for an Islamic republic in this region. [Izetbegovic] I (?will) tell you clearly that I do not want an Islamic republic. However, I want Islam to be preserved in this region, [words indistinct]. I do not know why we should do that. We are illustrating here a European, a modern [words indistinct]. After all, we can go in that direction [words indistinct] we will not do that; this is not our policy, although I could say that [words indistinct] we should not do that. We will win, because we will not, because we will respect other people's religion, other nations, different political convictions, because we will try to be democrats in this grave situation. [sentence as heard] [Cumurovic] Izetbegovic also spoke about his recent talks with Tudjman, saying the Croatian proposal could have been acceptable last year, before the crimes took place. Also, in the meantime, our army was founded and developed. President Izetbegovic told its leadership a few days ago the same things that he spoke about today. [Izetbegovic] I ended that meeting with a recommendation to the soldiers and the officers. The recommendation was very short and amounted to the following: Be like the people you are (?protecting). [Cumurovic] Izetbegovic ended his speech at the founding session of the City Committee of the Party of Democratic Action by commenting on the future organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is no integral Bosnia-Herzegovina without the Croats and the Serbs. The integral Bosnia-Herzegovina is desired by all Muslims, most Croats, and some Serbs. Here is what Izetbegovic said about the ways of arriving at the integral Bosnia. [Izetbegovic] There are, in my view, two stages of the struggle. One stage is military, and the other is the stage of a political struggle for integration of Bosnia-Herzegovina. What then? We should then create a democratic country in that part of Bosnia. [Cumurovic] After the speech of Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency, names of 85 members of the City Committee and the Executive Committee of the Party of Democratic Action were read out. Safet Halilovic was elected president of the City Committee. [passage omitted]
