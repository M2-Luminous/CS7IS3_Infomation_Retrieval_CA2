Speaking at the 21st round of talks on economic development in eastern Germany on Monday [9 May], Kohl said in front of top industrialist and trade union representatives that "the upswing that is becoming apparent in western Germany will also have a favorable effect on the further reconstruction of the east." Industrial research in the new laender continues to be a problem, with the number of people working in this field declining drastically from 80,000 (1990) to 16,000. Kohl pointed out that companies in the new laender have the important task of developing new ideas, turning them into marketable products, and opening up new markets for these. He said that the Federal Government has supported research and development in east German industry with some 2.4 billion marks since 1991. Research Minister Paul Krueger and Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt reported that industrial research in eastern Germany is showing positive signs in spite of the difficult overall situation. The shrinking process has clearly slowed down. The president of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), Tyll Necker, said that the BDI has called upon west German industry to assign a large amount of research commissions to companies in eastern Germany. This is included in a "Purchasing Offensive East," which has helped a good deal in promoting product sales. The president of the Chamber of Handicrafts, Heribert Spaeth, announced new training initiatives by companies in order to secure a sufficient number of apprenticeship positions.
