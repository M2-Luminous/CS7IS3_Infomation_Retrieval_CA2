The item, published under the headline "Zedillo Has A Good Image," is comprised of four pie charts that show the results of a survey conducted shortly after the PRI announced Zedillo as its new candidate. The survey questioned 407 people in Monterrey and the surrounding metropolitan area and 450 people in Mexico City. The item mentions three questions. The first question was: "In general, what is your opinion of Ernesto Zedillo?" In Monterrey, 44 percent said they had a good opinion; 23 percent said they did not know anything about him; 18 percent said their opinion was neutral; 13 percent said they had a very good opinion; and 2 percent they had a bad opinion. In Mexico City, 39 percent responded positively; 29 percent did not know anything about him; 22 percent were neutral; 5 percent had a bad opinion; 4 percent a very good opinion; and 1 percent a very bad opinion. The second question was: "What do you think are the PRI's chances of winning the presidency of the republic with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon as its candidate? Good, little, or none." The report gives the general response to this question; it does not give separate percentages for each of the places polled. The results were: 64 percent said good; 27 percent said little; 6 percent said they did not know; and 3 percent said none. The third question was: "Would you vote for Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon?" The item also gives a general response to this question. Results: 65 percent said yes; 19 percent said no; and 15 percent said they did not know.
