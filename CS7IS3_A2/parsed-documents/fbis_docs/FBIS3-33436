Casas was arrested yesterday in the United States and charged with spying for the former USSR. Casas, who was born in Colombia, and her husband, Aldrich Ames, a high-level employee of the CIA for more than 30 years, were arrested in the state of Virginia. They were accused of having sold secrets to the KGB, the former Soviet secret service, since 1985 for a total of $1.5 million. The 41-year-old Colombian became a U.S. citizen after marrying Ames, 52. She was a cultural attache for the Colombian Embassy in Mexico in 1983 when she met the American. The Colombian foreign minister said Maria del Rosario Casas "worked at the Foreign Ministry more than ten years ago. She was an intelligent official; she studied at Andes University, taught at the institution, and did her job well." Sanin added: "After that, there was no news about her." Sanin said the U.S. Government has not yet asked Colombia for any information about the former diplomat. Maria del Rosario Casas' involvement in this espionage case has caused commotion throughout Colombia, whose laws recognize dual citizenship. She was an outstanding teacher of philosophy and language and was taking graduate classes at Georgetown University. In voicing his regret over the incident, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said that if the charges are proven, Maria del Rosario Casas will have committed "treason against the fatherland, which is sacred."
