He said that we cannot ignore the Kashmiri people's right to decide their own future. We cannot sacrifice the sacrifices that Kashmiri people have made for this goal. After the final meeting of a seminar held the other day, the president answered news reporters' questions and said that he clearly dismissed any effort to make the Line of Control a permanent border in Kashmir. The Kashmir issue has its own legal and human aspects. It is not possible for Kashmiris to give up their right to decide on their own future. It is very important to give the Kashmiri people their right according to the UN resolutions. He said in response to a question that our stand on the nuclear program was very clear. While commenting on the position taken by U.S. Congressman Hamilton, he said that he will discuss this and other issues with U.S. officials during his visit to the United States. Dismissing the possibility of making the Line of Control a permanent border in Kashmir, he expressed the opinion with which the whole nation agrees. Basically, this was proposed by a U.S. Congressman on his own and it is not necessary to accept any proposal made by the Americans. What the Congressman said could be because of his limited knowledge of the situation. The United Nations agrees that India should follow up on the UN resolutions. India has been deceiving the United Nations for the last 45 years and the Kashmiri people's bravery and sincere efforts have unmasked this deception. The world is fully aware of India's role in Kashmir and Kashmiri people's struggle for freedom. It is a fact that India cannot make its point on Kashmir at any local or international forum. As a selfless supporter of Kashmir people, Pakistan has unmasked India's evil role, war crimes, and evil designs to the world. The Indian leadership despite being embarrassed is still insisting on the correctness of its stand. The only reason for this is that it wants to keep its control on this heavenly, Islamic and valuable valley. Pakistan has always maintained this stand that India should accept the UN resolutions for solving the Kashmir issue. The proposal to accept the Line of Control as an international border did not surface for the first time. India, England, and some other countries have been advising about it in the past also. However, no one thought it necessary to consider this suggestion. The Kashmir issue basically is not a border issue between two countries. It is the question of freedom and the right to democracy of about 20 million people. [sentence as published] The unprecedented sacrifices the Kashmir people have made during he last few years were not made to accept any third suggestions and Pakistan cannot force its decision on the future of Kashmiri people. It is not a secret what the Kashmiris want. If they wanted to accept the Line of Control as a border, why would they have sacrificed the lives of 40,000 of their people? We cannot stop anyone from giving advice or making suggestions, however, neither are the Kashmiris ready to back off from their principled stand nor will Pakistan accept any illogical suggestion. If the U.S. government is desirous of establishing peace in South Asia, it should advise India to stop their genocide of Kashmiris and accept the historic facts and decisions of the Kashmiris.
