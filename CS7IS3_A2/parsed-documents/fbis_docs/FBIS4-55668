Beric: "The Guards Have Gone, the Company Has Remained"] [Text] Erdut, 25 April -- While the Serbian Volunteer Guards [SDG] of Zeljko Arkan Raznatovic were on the territory of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] and its main body was stationed at the training center in Erdut, a gasoline station was built at the approach to Erdut, a new commercial building was built, and Dafina Milanovic promised additional investments. A firm named Dafiment Centar was established in a joint venture with Dafina Milanovic, and Dafina Milanovic herself visited Erdut twice, where she met representatives of the RSK government. In the presence of then RSK president Goran Hadzic and Zeljko Arkan Raznatovic, she promised to invest large amounts to update industrial and agricultural production, primarily on the territory of eastern Slavonia and western Srem. Following the well-known events that befell Dafiment Bank, there was no longer any talk about any investment, but the business facility at the entrance to Erdut was entirely completed. However, when the training center in Erdut was abandoned, and when the SDG left the territory of the RSK, especially after the feature article published in DUGA and certain statements by Dafina Milanovic, stories emerged in public about the fate of the facility that had been built, about its origin, about its present owner, and so on. Various stories began to circulate in the local population even before the SDG left Erdut. According to some, the investors and owners of the facility no longer wanted even a financial presence in the RSK, and they were looking for a buyer for that facility to recoup at least some of their money. According to others, the owners of the facility had up to that point already been making maximum use of their presence in the RSK and had derived financial gain, so that the fate of the facility was not even very important to them. However, Stojan Novakovic, who owns 90 percent of the shares and is president of the SDG Company in Erdut, categorically denies all such stories. "The SDG is the Guards, and SDG Company is a company, and there is no connection between them," says Stojan Novakovic. "The company is registered with the economic court of the RSK in Beli Manastir as SDG Company Erdut, Joint-Stock Company. With its presence in this area, the company plans to work for improvement of the RSK economy by changing the old style of economic management, above all in agriculture. The company has a plan for doing that, but real economic relations have not yet evolved in Krajina, above all because of the danger of war and battles between political parties." According to Stojan Novakovic, the SDG Company began in 1992 to build a business facility and invested more than $3 million in it. This is a business facility consisting of a gasoline station with a capacity of 400,000 liters, a railroad junction immediately alongside the facility, and a commercial building built to all European standards with 2,300 square meters of floor space. The commercial building itself, according to Stojan Novakovic, consists of a production shop with an area of 760 square meters intended for wood manufacturing, and then a large warehouse and office with an area of 760 square meters. There are also a duty-free shop, a restaurant, and a bank in the building, and the entire project is appraised at $10 million. "In a joint investment Dafina Milanovic and I established the firm Dafiment Centar, but Mrs. Milanovic did not fulfill all her obligations," says Stojan Novakovic. "Under the contract Mrs. Milanovic was supposed to invest $3 million. We will continue to invest, but as for the funds and debts of Mrs. Milanovic, we will have to talk about that with her and straighten out relations." Stojan Novakovic, the company's president and investor, says that he plans to build a greenhouse with an area of 40 hectares in the vicinity of geothermal springs, where he will be concerned with plant genetics and the development of new varieties of highly profitable farm products. The president of this company also says that he personally did the design of the free trade zone and port in Vukovar and that he is ready to offer business associates the best terms for construction of the zone. In a very short time the duty-free shop, bank, restaurant, production shop, and warehouse will also begin to operate in the new commercial building in Erdut. "I am saying all this because certain political parties and individuals, pursuing their own petty political points, misuse construction of this business facility, referring to us all as war profiteers," Stojan Novakovic says. "But I wonder whether any war profiteer invested $3 million in an unsafe area. If I had built this facility on the Belgrade-Novi Sad highway, I would have had 1,000 times more traffic, and the facility would have been worth 50 times more. Once again I put the question -- is that war profiteering or patriotism?"
