Esteemed representatives of the Armed Forces! Respected guests! First of all, let me congratulate you on the occasion of the Day of Fatherland's Defenders and the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus! There is hardly a family, even hardly a person in our republic, whose fates have not been connected in one way or another with the past war, with the Army, with the making of the Armed Forces. Many times, our soil had been the scene of terrible battles for freedom and independence of the Fatherland. Such is the history. Many times, foreign invaders trod over our land and crop, set our towns and villages on fire. And every time, the path of the invading enemies was blocked by Fatherland's Defenders, by our valiant soldiers, guerrillas, and conspirators. The destiny of the Belarusian nation as well as those of other nations have often been determined on the banks of the Berezina river, alongside the gray Dnepr river, and by the walls of the Brest fortress. Addressing our words of gratitude to older generations, and bowing our heads by the graves of the fallen and those dead of wounds and woes during the evil years of the war, we also draw conclusions for the present day. We should always remember how great was the price paid for our victory and freedom. Therefore, it is our holy duty to preserve and augment the glorious traditions of our ancestors. Today our activity proceeds from our realities. The Republic of Belarus is an independent, sovereign state. A young state, too. Our state threatens nobody's security and builds its relations with all states on the basis of equal partnership and mutual respect, having clearly determined its neutral status that is being affirmed through practical actions. While building up our tomorrow, we have to begin many things anew. At the current time, in an exceptionally important and, due to objective reasons, complicated period, we lay the foundations for a new economic union with Russia and other CIS countries, as well as strengthen our ties with the countries of far abroad. Belarus favors collective security, supports those good traditions which were established with Russia and other countries of the former USSR during the past decades. Undoubtedly, we are all expecting improvements in all the spheres of our life. However, to achieve them, we must determine the ways out of the crisis and resolve many complex problems. Alas, many things -- due to various objective and subjective reasons -- are being resolved in an undesirable way. There is a very complex situation in the national economy. The national income, as compared to January-December last year [as published], decreased by 10 percent. The decrease in industrial production during 1993-94 in comparable prices amounts to 18.5 percent. The situation in agriculture -- it should be openly admitted -- has become threatening. Immediate measures should be adopted there, and we will adopt them. The issues of the upcoming sowing campaign have recently been discussed at the Supreme Soviet Presidium session. New possibilities of financial aid to the countryside have been found; some other problems will also be resolved. With regard to our economy as a whole, we are principally committed to the orientation toward an economic union with Russia, toward a single ruble zone. I think that, given the current circumstances, this approach is reasonable. It is important to stabilize industry, give enterprises greater employment opportunities, and restore people's confidence in the future. In today's activity of the Supreme Soviet, we give priority to the questions of the state political system: Introduction of the presidency and the nationwide elections of the president as a head of the state and executive power. The necessary draft laws have been prepared, and will be discussed during the current Supreme Soviet session. The parliamentary opposition as well as certain political parties and movements urge early elections for the Supreme Soviet; they propose holding presidential elections next, and, then ultimately, adopting a new constitution. I believe that in this case we should expect an interim period of complete state uncontrollability. I think that I do not need to mention the consequences of such a period. Esteemed representatives of the Armed Forces! The issues related to the building of the Army and the defense of the Republic of Belarus have always been given priority by the Supreme Soviet. The current process of reforms in the Armed Forces tends not to disorganize the defense capability of the republic, but to bring this capability in line with the current political and economic situation of our young sovereign state. There are many difficulties. What are their roots and origins? The Belarusian people have been living in peace for the last 50 years. It is a rare historical fact. However, due to well-known political processes, a change in the world outlook has occurred over the last two years. Along with it, a sense of honor for the destiny of the Fatherland has been lost to a certain extent. A very negative role has recently been played by political games, to which the Army was a hostage. Many of those who honestly attended to their military duties, have been brought down by a rush of accusations and insults. By unjust accusations and insults, I would like to emphasize. As a result, a fall in the prestige of the military service and work among the ranks followed. Celebrating the professional holiday of servicemen, which is historically associated with the notions of manly valor, honor, and dignity, we also see those first results that were attained in the complex work of building the Belarusian Armed Forces. Having declared its nonnuclear status and commitment to neutrality, Belarus has to eliminate these disproportions in a short time and benefit as much as possible from all that was inherited. Unfortunately, mistakes have been made here, too. Having announced our move toward neutrality, we clearly realize that the desirable effect cannot be achieved quickly. Therefore, many politicians understand that one has to optimally make use of those circumstances, of those economic, political, social, and demographic situations that were attained during the existence of the USSR. A well-considered approach by the Supreme Soviet and the government as well as a good attitude of our citizens to transformations in the military sphere have allowed us to prepare a legislative basis for resolving the tasks of the state defense and the creation of our own Armed Forces. Over 30 laws have been worked out and adopted; the government has implemented over 60 normative documents. On this basis, it was possible to reduce the number of troops almost by half in two years, as well as to implement the principal structural transformations which were applicable to the situation and the capability of our state. To picture the scale of this work, I will cite some figures. By November 1995, the republic should dismantle over 2,000 tanks, about 1,500 combat vehicles, and over 500 aircraft. We are for the strict fulfillment of international agreements. However, we also need an understanding on the part of other states which are interested in providing security to the European continent. Under the circumstances that have been globally changed -- I put it straightforwardly -- our republic alone is incapable of fulfilling those agreements. We, undoubtedly, count on the predominance of the spirit of reality among the governments of Europe and the United States, as well as their financial and material participation in the resolution of these issues. However, it is only a single, though very important, aspect. As the building of our statehood advances, new layers of very complex problems are uncovered. Therefore, while celebrating the day of Fatherland's Defenders and the Armed Forces, we also consult the righteousness of the adopted orientation with that part of our society, which is most competent in the military sphere. I evaluate the situation in the Army, which was created by our joint efforts with the Ministry of Defense in the process of reforming and deeply reducing the troops, as a success. The Supreme Soviet is deeply concerned today with the situation of servicemen and their families, as well as those pensioned or transferred to the reserve due to reforms in the Army. The economic situation in the republic does not allow us to safeguard the proper level of social guarantees to the right degree. I will say even more -- for the time being, we are not able to provide our troops with satisfactory material and technical support. The Supreme Soviet and the government are very concerned with the level of military discipline and the fall in the level of patriotic education of youth. There are many problems. However, there are also good aspects. I think that we all, including the information media, should also see the good things. I am sure, dear friends, that all those who served in the Army, and those who are serving today, as well as all the Belarusian citizens understand very well that our future is in our hands. Let me congratulate you on the Day of Fatherland's Defenders and the Armed Forces. I wish you good health and every success in mastering combat ability for the benefit of our Belarus! Dear veterans! I thank you for your contribution to the strengthening of our state independence and the education of the young generation. I wish you happiness and joy for long years to come! Congratulations, dear friends!
