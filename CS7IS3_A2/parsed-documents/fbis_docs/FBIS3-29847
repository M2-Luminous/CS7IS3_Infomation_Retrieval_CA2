Zhu is the first top Chinese Government official to travel to Japan since the coalition administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa came to power last August, officials said. He will have talks with Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as well as meeting three former premiers -- Noboru Takeshita, Toshiki Kaifu and Kiichi Miyazawa -- and business leaders during his stay until March 3, the officials said. "Last year Sino-Japanese trade volume hit an historical record of 39 billion dollars, an increase of 54 percent over the previous year," Zhu told reporters before leaving Beijing. "With this Japan has surpassed Hong Kong as China's largest trading partner and China has became the second largest trading partner of Japan," he said. "This year is a crucial year for China in building a socialist market economy," said Zhu, who is concurrently governor of China's central bank. "This also is an important time for Japan to take major administrative measures to rejuvenate its national economy. Therefore, I believe both sides have the interest and the need to hold mutually beneficial exchanges and discussions," he added. During the visit, the vice premier will also travel to Osaka, Kagawa and Fukuoka prefectures in western and southwestern Japan to take a firsthand look at corporate activities there. Zhu said upon arrival at Tokyo's Haneda Airport that his Japan trip is aimed at deepening mutual understanding and promoting cooperation and friendship between the two countries. "Bilateral friendly and cooperative relations have already entered a new stage of development through common efforts by the two governments and the peoples," Zhu said. To further strengthen such ties will be beneficial for the Japanese and Chinese peoples in the long term and will also contribute to the peace, stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and the world, he said.
