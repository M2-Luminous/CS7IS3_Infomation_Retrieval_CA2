Therefore, I spoke with engineer Oridio Caballero, Minaz [Ministry of the Sugar Industry] vice minister for sugarcane. The important thing, the vice minister assured me, is to continue sowing in July what cannot be sown now. Various factors determined the failure to meet the spring sowing plans in the country -- rain, fuel, and availability of seed with a certain category, meaning seed quality. According to Caballero, a supply of seed is now available after the required work was done. All steps were taken to prepare a quality seed supply. [Caballero] This involves the handling of quality seeds in each of the centers; the quality of the hydrothermal treatment of these seeds; protection of the seed supplies; adequate handling of seed varieties, which is very important; strict compliance with phytosanitary measures; qualified and trained personnel; attention to workers' social needs; and the aesthetic qualities, from the technical agronomical viewpoint, that each of the seed supplies must have. [Maso] Vice minister, you know Cubans have a tendency to do things sporadically. It would be interesting to know what will be done to guarantee that what has been accomplished will not be lost. [Caballero] I would say this is a challenge, but we are fully convinced that we can manage it. First of all, I can tell you that within the guidelines we established for the new Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's], it was clearly stated that the state was responsible for everything dealing with the seed varieties and phytosanitary issues. Judging from what we have seen around here, what we have seen in all the UBPC's, and what we have seen at each of the seed supply centers throughout the country, we are convinced that we will accomplish this task at the required level, at the prescribed level, from the technical viewpoint. I also want to tell you that we are in a better position than we were in 1986 and 1988 because we now have the thermal treatment plants we did not have back then. Now we can guarantee a quality seed system as never before. [Maso] If we have seed, it is necessary to continue sowing, not only in June and July, but also in August and September because in the end, that is the sugarcane we will have for the 1995-96 harvest.
