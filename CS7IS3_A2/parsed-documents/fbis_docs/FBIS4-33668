Mexico also said it is pleased with the statements made in favor of putting an end to Cuba's isolation. "As the Inter-American community is called upon to help democracy, it should promote the conditions that stimulate it," said Mexican Ambassador Jorge Pinto Mazal before the 24th OAS General Assembly. The Mexican under secretary for Latin America, cultural affairs, and cooperation, added that his country's delegation is very pleased to hear the pronouncements in favor of Cuba's participation in the inter-American system. He pointed out that Mexico's foreign policy is noted for favoring dialogue and agreement rather than exclusion and isolation. The ambassador added that the principles of Mexican foreign policy were reinforced with a negotiated political solution to the crisis in Haiti and the proposals for an end to the isolation of Cuba which were presented by Canada and Brazil. "We are obviously pleased to see that other countries share this stand and do not want to see Cuba isolated," he said. Pinto Mazal heads the Mexican delegation that is attending the 24th OAS General Assembly which will conclude on Friday in Belem, Para State, some 2,000 km north of Brasilia. Yesterday, Brazil and Canada proposed ending the isolation of Cuba as a mechanism for promoting the "democratic transition" that "is already observed" on the Caribbean island. "We are all hoping for a democratic evolution in Cuba, with which Brazil maintains friendly relations," said Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim to the participants in the regional meeting. The foreign minister said they have observed positive advances in the implementation of reforms in Cuba, which "should be increased," but rejected that economic and political isolation is the best way to contribute to the transition "that is starting to emerge." During her remarks, Christine Stewart, the Canadian secretary of state for Latin American affairs, maintained that her country believes that "isolation, due to its nature, is not healthy; especially during this important transition phase in Cuba." Stewart added: "It is in our and the Cuban people's interest that we support the process of change on the island, which is positive and orderly." On Wednesday, Pinto Meza underscored this, that experience has shown the ineffectiveness of the use of force as an instrument to resolve international conflicts. The lessons of the Cold War should be a reference to avoid the mistakes made in the past," he said. He praised the work carried out for eight years by Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena Soares as the OAS secretary general. "He led the inter-American organization during particularly tense bipolar moments and during the unique Cold War situation," Pinto Meza added. The Mexican diplomat also emphasized the importance that Mexico places on the advances made by the countries in social and economic development, the eradication of poverty, and combating drug trafficking activities. He presented Mexico's efforts toward commercial liberalization and economic integration and cautioned about the problems faced by people who look for jobs outside their place of origin. Pinto Meza promised that his country would support all OAS organization activities to defend human rights and briefed the General Assembly on the establishment of impartial litigation in his country.
