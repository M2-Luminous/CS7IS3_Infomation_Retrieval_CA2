FR940428-1-00024 FR940428-1-00008 Proposed paragraph (d) would require the authorized officer to prescribe the terms and conditions of each grazing permit in accordance with applicable law and administrative direction. Paragraph (d)(1) of ยง222.4 of the proposed rule parallels the intent of the current rule at ยง222.2(c). However, in contrast to the current rule, proposed paragraph (d)(1) makes clear that terms and conditions of the permit include applicable standards and guidelines from the forest plan and/or from applicable rangeland project decisions. This provision of the proposed rule replaces the allotment management plan as the basis of the terms and conditions of the permit and ties the permit terms and conditions to the two-tiered planning and decisionmaking process, as discussed earlier. The current regulations recognize an allotment management plan (AMP) as the mechanism for carrying out forest plan direction on a grazing allotment. The proposed rule would phase out the AMP as a source of direction for rangeland management and grazing use and, instead, make applicable standards and guidelines from forest plans and/or from applicable rangeland project decisions a part of the terms and conditions of the grazing permit. This provision is significant in that it would provide the means for ensuring that those current grazing operations authorized without benefit of rangeland project decisions would comply with the direction of forest plans. As previously noted, many of those who submitted comments on the ANPR recommended adoption of local standards and guidelines because they would be relevant to the land being affected by the action. On National Forest System lands, the forest plan and project decisions fulfill this role. Under paragraph (d)(2) of ยง222.4 of the proposed rule, the permittee may be required to collect and submit monitoring, inventory, or other resource information related to the permitted livestock grazing activity. Information of this nature is essential for identifying progress toward forest plan goals and objectives and changes in operational practices which may be necessary. This information is vital to proper rangeland management and in some instances the permittee is in a better position to gather the information than the agency. Paragraph (e) of ยง222.4 of the proposed rule allows the authorized officer to issue written annual operating instructions that document temporary stocking adjustments and/or provide additional direction necessary for proper management of the range resource. While not explicitly covered in the current rule, this is a long-standing agency practice provided for in the agency's internal directive system and in part 2 of the term grazing permit (Form FS&hyph;2222&hyph;10). Until now, most written instructions have been contained in annual operating plans provided to the permittees. These annual operating plans have been the subject of increasing controversy over whether decisions made therein are subject to NEPA procedures. Proposed paragraph (e) would make clear that where operating instructions fall within the scope of the decision authorizing the grazing use and NEPA documentation associated with that decision, a new decision and additional analysis is not required. If, however, they fall outside the scope of the decision authorizing grazing use, additional environmental analysis would be required before those annual operating instructions can be issued.
