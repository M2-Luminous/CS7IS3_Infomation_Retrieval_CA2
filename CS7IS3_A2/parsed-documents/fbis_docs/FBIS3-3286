The elderly Chinese, 60 to 70 years of age, were taken away in police vehicles from in front of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing's eastern diplomatic area, witnesses said. It was not immediately known where the activists, some of them walking with the aid of canes, were taken. Although the contents of the letter are not known, the war compensation activists were believed to be seeking an apology from the Japanese prime minister who begins a visit to Beijing on Saturday and to ask for war compensation for Japanese aggression. News of the demonstration began circulating Thursday evening, leading to speculation that the event was well planned. One middle-aged man, holding a letter with "Hosokawa" written on it in large letters, arrived at the embassy at 10 A.M. and was immediately taken away, witnesses said. Ten minutes later a group of elderly men and one woman arrived by minibus and were also questioned and taken away by police. The detentions came a week after police rounded up several political and labor activists before and during the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher last weekend. A Japanese Embassy spokesman said he was unaware of the demonstration and knew nothing of the detentions. The Chinese Government has been sensitive to demanding war compensation for civilian casualties from Japan as it is afraid it could damage the existing good governmental relations. A group of delegates to the ongoing National People's Congress, China's parliament, is presently preparing a motion demanding war compensation from Japan, but it is not known whether the central authorities will approve such a document.
