Guan Guangfu said: Having analyzed and assessed the anticorruption work over the past few months, the Central Committee has set out the need to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and maintain stability [zhua zhu ji yu shen hua gai ge kuo da kai fang chu jin fa zhan bao chi wen ding], which is the overall situation in the work of the entire party. Discipline inspection work must subject to and serve this overall situation. The provincial party committee has already made arrangements for work in 1994 and set out that 1994 is a year of reform, forging ahead, implementation, and building clean government. This requirement embodies the principle of grasping two types of work simultaneously and paying equal attention to both and complies with the overall work situation of the entire party. Party committees, governments, commissions for discipline inspection, and procuratorate organizations at all levels should correctly differentiate and handle two categories of contradictions. It is imperative to resolutely crack down on all law-breaking and criminal activities and mete out the appropriate penalties in cases of corruption. [passage omitted] Guan Guangfu said that, consolidating and augmenting flesh-and- blood and party-and-people ties is the fundamental goal of waging the anticorruption struggle and has a bearing on the rise or fall and success or failure of the party's cause, not to mention the basic issue of the party's life or death. He indicated that the overwhelming majority of the people have improved their living standards through reform, opening up, and economic development; however, some of our state-owned enterprises are really suffering from their economic difficulties, and it has been a hard life for the workers, staff members, and people there. We should always bear the masses in mind, show concern for them, and adopt effective measures to help them resolve difficulties. [passage omitted] In conclusion, Guan Guangfu said, the key to waging the anticorruption struggle in depth and with consistent efforts and reliable effects lies in augmenting leadership. Party committees and governments at all levels must continue to place the anticorruption struggle on the agenda and augment leadership in a down- to-earth way. It is necessary to establish the responsibility system and augment supervision and examination. Party committees at all levels must support discipline inspection work and supervision departments and help them resolve their difficulties.
