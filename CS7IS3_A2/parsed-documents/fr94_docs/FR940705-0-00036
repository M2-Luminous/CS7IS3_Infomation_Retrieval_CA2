FR940705-0-00036 FR940705-0-00002 (9) The following information must be either stenciled on the reel or on a tag firmly attached to the reel: Optical Cable Number of Fibers Armored or Nonarmored Year of Manufacture Name of Cable Manufacturer Length of Cable Reel Number REA 7 CFR 1755.900 Example: Optical Cable 4 fiber Armored 1988 XYZ Company 1050 meters Reel Number 3 REA 7 CFR 1755.900 (10) When preconnectorized cable is shipped, the splicing modules must be protected to prevent damage during shipment and handling. The protection method must be accepted by REA prior to its use. Appendix A to 7 CFR 1755.900 _Qualification Tests Methods (I) The test procedures described in this appendix are for qualification of initial cable designs and major modifications of accepted designs. Included in (V) of this appendix are suggested formats that may be used in submitting test results to REA. (II) Sample selection and preparation. (1) All testing must be performed on lengths removed sequentially from any of the same cables listed below. The cables must not have been exposed to temperatures in excess of 38 笳気 since their initial cool downs after sheathing. The lengths specified are minimum lengths and if desirable from a laboratory testing standpoint longer lengths may be used: (a) 12 single mode fiber jacketed cable consisting of 6 single mode dispersion-unshifted fibers and 6 single mode dispersion-shifted fibers. (b) 12 multimode fiber jacketed cable consisting of 6 50/125 micrometer multimode fibers and 6 62.5/125 micrometer multimode fibers. (c) 24 fiber jacketed combination cable consisting of 6 single mode dispersion-unshifted fibers; 6 single mode dispersion-shifted fibers; 6 50/125 micrometer multimode fibers; and 6 62.5/125 micrometer multimode fibers. (2) Length A shall be a minimum of 500 meters long. Coil the sample with a diameter of 50 to 75 times its sheath diameter. Three lengths are required if only requesting acceptance for either single mode fiber cable (a), multimode fiber cable (b), or using the combination fiber cable (c). Six lengths, 3 lengths of single mode fiber cable (a), and 3 lengths of multimode fiber cable (b), are required if requesting acceptance for both single mode and multimode fiber cables. (3) Length B shall be one meter long. Four lengths of either single mode fiber cable (a), multimode fiber cable (b) or the combination fiber cable (c) are required. (4) Length C shall be 600 millimeters long. Four lengths of either single mode fiber cable (a), multimode fiber cable (b) or the combination fiber cable (c) are required. (5) Data reference temperature. Unless otherwise specified, all measurement shall be made at 23 # 5 笳気. (III) Environmental tests _(1) Heat aging test. (a) Test samples. Place one or two samples of length A and one sample each of lengths B and C in an oven or environmental chamber. The ends of sample A must exit from the chamber or oven for optical tests. Securely seal the oven exit holes. (b) Sequence of tests. The samples are to be subjected to the following tests after conditioning: (i) Water Penetration Test outlined in paragraph (III ) (2) of this appendix; and (ii) Jacket Slip Strength Test outlined in paragraph (III) (3) of this appendix. (For Flooded Designs Only) (c) Initial measurements. (i) For sample(s) A measure the attenuation for the single mode dispersion-unshifted fibers at 1310 and 1550 nanometers, for single mode dispersion-shifted fibers at 1550 nanometers and/or for multimode fibers at 1300 nanometers at a temperature of 23 # 5 笳気. Also measure the bandwidth of the multimode fibers. Calculate the attenuation data on a per kilometer basis. Calculate the bandwidth data on a megahertz-kilometer (MHz-km) basis. (ii) Record on suggested formats in (V) of this appendix or on other easily readable formats. (d) Heat conditioning. (i) Immediately after completing the initial measurements, condition the sample(s) for 14 days at a temperature of 65 # 2 笳気.
