FR940822-0-00035 FR940822-0-00010 Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economical, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. As noted elsewhere in this action, the EPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 1 to Table 3 under the processing procedures published in the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214), and revisions to these procedures issued on October 4, 1993, in an EPA memorandum entitled ``Changes to State Implementation Plan (SIP) Tables.'' Regulatory Process This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from E.O. 12866 review. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds ( Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).

Note _Incorporation by reference of the SIP for the State of Texas was approved by the Director of the FR on July 1, 1982. Dated: July 19, 1994. Joe D. Winkle, Acting Regional Administrator.
