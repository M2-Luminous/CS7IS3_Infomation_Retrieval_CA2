FBIS3-43563 "drafr006_c_94018" FBIS-AFR-94-006 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 8 Jan MB0801154394 MB0801154394 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] SATURDAY STAR Time for TEC To Act -- "The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] must act now to ensure that Transkei co-operates fully with the police in investigating last week's massacre at the Heidelberg Tavern in Cape Town -- or risk severe damage to its credibility," an editorial in the Johannesburg SATURDAY STAR in English on 8 January on page 8 notes. The TEC, which is "supposed to embody the progress reached at the talks, remains silent, leaving this critical issue suspended in the hot air generated by the SAP's [South African Police] increasingly heated allegations against Transkei and [Transkei military leader] Holomisa's absurd demands for an independent inquiry conducted solely by foreigners." The TEC is "not being asked to condone another raid on Transkei," but "to deliver the accountable, flexible and responsive government that the negotiators kept promising" as South Africans "worry about killers being caught, not what political points are scored by whom." BEELD Secret Vote a Cornerstone of Democracy -- The Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 4 January points out in a page 8 editorial: "One issue which continues to feature in the country's political debate is that of a secret ballot. It is a cornerstone of democracy, because only if voters know that they can make a free choice at the polling booth can there be any talk of a truly fair election. Unfortunately our tradition of violence and intimidation serves as a weapon in the political arsenal." "Add to this a huge new voter corps which is still politically unsophisticated, and it becomes clear that the ideal of a free election is threatened by threats, superstition, and distorted information." "Just how important this matter is has again been underlined by claims that members of the African National Congress' military wing are joining the National Party [NP] and the Democratic Party." BEELD continues: "The very fact that the NP is not prepared to say who, and how many, of them have joined its ranks is another indication that our political climate is not healthy. The more open the process, the easier it would be to separate fact from propaganda. No matter how strong the urge for power, political parties owe it to South Africa to create a culture of moral competition. It is as strong a guarantee as a new constitution." Police Deaths `Unaffordable' -- "Last year alone 260 South African policemen died violently --people who, in the combating of crime, have become the victims of that crime," notes a second editorial on page 8 of the same issue of BEELD. For a force working under extremely difficult conditions, this "slaughter is unaffordably high. It is a fact that the police have an unenviable and dangerous task, because it does not always involve only the combating of crime. More and more they find themselves in the crossfire of power-hungry political groups to whom human lives, including those of policemen, have become very cheap." "It is difficult to understand why the communities refuse to help the police. Their refusal leads to a chain reaction which eventually boomerangs, because it feeds anarchy and promotes the climate of violence. In the end it is not only the police, but the community and the country as a whole who suffer under the chaos created by these criminals." Siting of Parliament Already a Serious Debate -- The Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 5 January says in a page 10 editorial: "One of the most sensitive political debates in South Africa is that of the siting of Parliament in a new dispensation. At the moment it is still a whispered debate, but it is already being seriously talked about. Chances are that none of the major parties would like to bring this issue out into the open. An election campaign is on the go, and with the important emphasis which regional parlaiments will be given, parties would certainly not wish to disturb or harm regional interests." It is a fact, adds BEELD, "that the advantages and disadvantages of two capitals -- Cape Town the legislative and Pretoria the administrative -- are already being studied in political, economic, and diplomatic circles. The ANC [African National Congress] has confirmed that some of its officials are in favor of moving Parliament, and within the ruling party the matter has sometimes also been discussed unofficially. We do not wish to set in motion an emotional debate because we believe that the election campaign must deal with fundamental issues," but "we do await the eventual debate on this vital issue." Right Channels Not Followed with Transkei -- A second editorial in the 5 Janaury edition argues that: "In the light of what has taken place in the past, one would expect the police to be vary careful when they accuse Transkei's Major General Bantu Holomisa." "For quite some time now efforts have been made to prove that the general allows his country to be used as a springboard for terrorist attacks on South Africa." Until now all these efforts have boomeranged. The worst instance was the defense force raid on a so- called base of the Pan-Africanist Congress' military wing in Umtata. Now it is being alleged that the police know exactly where the suspects of the Cape Town tavern attack are, but that they can do nothing because these people are hiding in Transkei. On the surface it would seem that this sensitive matter is being mishandled. It looks as though the correct channels were not followed to remove the stumbling blocks. Gen. Holomisa has offered his full cooperation in the investigation. Accept the offer, let justice take its course, and bring the guilty to book." Parties Have Duty to Make TEC Succeed -- A third editorial on 5 January on page 10 of BEELD warns: "The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has not even had its first full session of 1994 and already there is talk of a test of strength between the TEC and the government over political and security issues in kwaZulu." "No one wants to avoid robust politics. Nevertheless the role players in the TEC, and in particular their political masters, must realize that they have a duty to make the TEC succeed. The political confidence index among the South African public is not particularly high at present. If the TEC, in whom considerable hope has been placed, becomes involved in a tug-of-war at this early stage, the already difficult transition will be made that much more difficult." Leaders should ensure, says BEELD, "that the TEC is not discredited in the eyes of the public as just another political wrestling ring. They must show...an understanding for the realities of this country."
