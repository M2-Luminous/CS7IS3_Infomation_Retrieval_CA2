Both sides reached a consensus on the following issues: 1. Both sides believe that ARATS and SEF should avoid political issues in a practical attitude when holding talks on routine affairs. Both sides have discussed three topics on routine affairs, including the "Repatriation of Personnel Who Have Entered Into the Area of the Other Side in Violation of Relevant Regulations, and Related Issues," and have reached a high degree of consensus, but they still should make efforts to iron out certain differences so as to reach an agreement in writing as soon as possible. Both sides have decided through consultation to hold the fourth round of talks on routine affairs in Beijing in late March and have decided that, after an agreement is reached in the talks, it will be signed by ARATS and SEF responsible persons in Taibei [Taipei]. During the fourth round of talks on routine affairs, both sides will exchange views or hold discussions on "Joint Operations Against Smuggling, Robbery, and Other Criminal Activities at Sea," "Cross-Strait Protection for Intellectual Property Rights (Intelligence Property Rights)," "Cross-Strait Contacts and Assistance Between Related Law Courts (Mutual Assistance Between Judicial Organs on Both Sides of the Taiwan Strait)," and certain economic, scientific, and technological topics included in the "Joint Agreement Reached by Wang-Gu [Ku] Talks." 2. Both sides have decided through consultation on the "Measures Facilitating the Entry and Exit by ARATS and SEF Affairs Working Personnel," and have decided to implement them by treating the exchange of correspondences through mail as taking effect. 3. Both sides have agreed in principle to increase the categories of copies of notarization documents according to the second article of the "Cross-Strait Agreement on the Verification of Notarization Documents." Specific items will be decided upon through another consultation. 4. Both sides are willing to assist each other on issues relating to the Cross-Strait inheritance of property. 5. Both sides have agreed they will continue to promote the activities of mutual visits by responsible persons of the media, reporters, and scientific and technological personnel as well as the exchange of teenager. Both sides will continue to implement all the agreements reached by the "Wang-Gu talks," maintain a smooth channel for ARATS-SEF contacts and talks, and create favorable conditions for the second "Wang-Gu talks."
