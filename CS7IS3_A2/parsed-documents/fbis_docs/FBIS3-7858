The daily's special reporter quotes a British U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officer, who asked not to be identified as saying that the Moslems have connected a tunnel under the Sarajevo airport in the southern section of the city with another in northern Sarajevo, whose locality as yet remains unknown. Following a meeting with the UNPROFOR command, the same source said, the Moslem side agreed to place both tunnels under UNPROFOR's "discreet control," the daily says. Bosnian Serbs several months ago warned that the Moslems had dug a tunnel under the UNPROFOR-controlled Sarajevo airport to be used as a conduit for arms and ammunition deliveries and transportation of troops. However, Bosnian Serbs and Croats have for the past few days been stressing that the Moslem side has taken advantage of the Serb-Moslem ceasefire in the Sarajevo area to evacuate its troops and have them transferred to central Bosnia to help step up an offensive against Bosnian Croats.
