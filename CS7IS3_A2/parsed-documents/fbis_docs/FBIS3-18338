Austria's way into a united Europe is as old as the entire Second Republic. This way led from the European Reconstruction Program, the Marshall Plan, to the establishment of EFTA [European Free Trade Association], from the association negotiations in the 1960's and the signing of the Free Trade Agreement by the first Kreisky government up to the European Economic Area that came into effect last year. All these efforts show that for Austria it has always been a fact that peace, stability, and prosperity can only be developed and maintained together with the other democracies in Europe. Let me stress the words together and democracies. The history of this century has shown it was democracies that did not wage wars against each other. Developments in the east and southeast of our continent since the collapse of communism have confirmed this attitude. The great challenges of our time can only be tackled by joint solutions. This is true for securing Austria as a business location, for safeguarding our social network, as well as for protecting our environment, for future-oriented transport and energy policies, and for participating in the next steps in research and development. If our country does not want to remain isolated in this situation, there is only one possible decision, namely a clear declaration in favor of integration and a declaration to participate actively in the dynamic development of the EU after joining. If we take part in this European dynamic and contribute our creativity, hard work, and experience to the European entity, then we will have a share in creating the great projects at the turn of the millennium and continue playing our historic role in the very heart of the continent. I think that on this important and decisive day we must also state that these great projects in the world go beyond the horizons of the EU. Nothing should be further from our minds than Euro-centredness or the idea of an isolated fortress called European Union. These projects and the efforts they involve require the inclusion of the reform states in a joint area of stability, prosperity, and democracy, as well as the opening up to the dynamic new economic areas in East and Southeast Asia and in Latin America and the restructuring of our relations with the nations of the South. Ladies and Gentlemen, 50 years ago the survivors of two world wars set their hopes on a united Europe. Their aim was to have no more wars. And their way led to European integration. In this community, nations that had been at war for centuries were reconciled; and it secured for those nations that shed the burden of dictatorship their place in Europe. This made the EU the guarantor of peace and security for its members. Austria -- while keeping its neutrality -- has the opportunity to become a member of this peace community and to participate in its extension to form a framework of security including all of Europe. [applause] It has become unthinkable today that citizens of the EU fight wars against each other, shoot at each other. This makes the Community -- beside all economic, social, and ecological tasks -- a great peace project. Especially in view of all the uncertainties prevailing not far from our country, we will have a conscious share in this peace project and help form it. [applause] It is fashionable to complain about the lack of grand concepts and visions in the sphere of politics. I would like to ask the following question: What, if not the peaceful unification of the continent where we are living, what, if not the growing together of the most different peoples and cultures, should be such a prospect, a task that is worth devotion. However, there are naturally also numerous practical reasons why the Austrian Government suggests to the Austrians that they should join the European Union, why the Austrian Government works to achieve this goal, and makes such a great effort. I would like to make the following very clear today: In the past few days, weeks, and months, Austria explained, safeguarded, and ensured its interests with toughness, consistence, and determination. The negotiations have shown that we Austrians can join forces and cooperate if need be. [applause] We can state with some satisfaction today that we will integrate in the European Union what is important for us Austrians, that we will enjoy the advantages, but that we will also assume the obligations that are linked with membership. I strongly hope and believe the tough negotiations that were occasionally observed critically by foreign and domestic newspapers will turn into respect for Austria in the long run. [applause] It is also important at this point for us to say that, in view of our commitment and our intention to participate in an open Europe, in a market without frontiers, this opens up numerous opportunities for our producers and consumers, but it naturally also represents new challenges, and it will be necessary to adapt as a result of the opening of the market. Measures are required to make it possible for those who would otherwise be facing difficulties to adapt to the new situation. I would like to stress that these changes are necessary whether we become members of the European Union or not. However, the market will be opened up in such a way that we can safeguard and expand our cultural and ecological interests. Austria will adhere to its own regulations, but it will also integrate them into a larger Europe, in cultural diversity. We will and want to preserve and expand our pioneering role as an exemplary welfare state and our pioneering role in the environmental sphere. Above all, Austria, this small country at the heart of Europe comprising barely 8 million people and whose name [Oesterreich] is too long for the ordinary globes used in schools, this country will participate in a large market of 320 million which would be much more difficult to access without membership in the European Union. The foreign minister has just mentioned the major points of the outcome of the talks in Brussels. Let me add one thing: Austria's social, environmental, and health standards will continue to be valid. Moreover, the European Union has for the first time in its history stipulated an ecological goal in an agreement. The foreign minister pointed this out. I would like to underline his statement about Austria's intention to stick to the ban of the use of nuclear energy and to continue its commitment to a nuclear-free Central Europe. For the future economic and social development of our country the conclusion of the negotiations sets a substantially new course. The full participation in the large single European market as a partner with equal rights will permit Austria to use for our benefit all the advantages that this common Europe offers. At the same time, it eliminates the existing disadvantages of isolation and rules out the danger of future discrimination. In particular it guarantees that Austria will be able to continue to take advantage of being even more attractive as an economic center at the point where East meets West, which will have a positive impact on developments on the labor market. We will conduct a most intensive and enlightening discussion with those citizens who sometimes anxiously ask themselves why we are seeking membership in an economic area whose average unemployment rate is higher than that of Austria. These questions need to be answered -- we will provide the answers. Existing export barriers will fall, cooperation agreements between companies will be essentially facilitated through the harmonization of taxes and a common trade policy. Thus, the significant competitive disadvantages for Austrian enterprises, which are the result of the complicated European regulations of origin, will disappear. The elimination of customs and border checks will not only cut billions in expenses on the part of the enterprises but will result in sizable price advantages for the consumers, particularly in the area of foods, beverages, and tobacco, and articles in daily use, which is why low-income earners, in particular, will benefit from these lower prices. Ladies and Gentlemen, the citizens often ask us politicians: You always tell us about the advantages of our participation in European integration. There must also be disadvantages, which you must not conceal. We will not conceal them, and I would like to take this opportunity to mention one point, namely that there will be disadvantages, but that we will be able to eliminate them and cope with them. Regarding peoples' worries about a danger to the security of our country as a result of the elimination of border checks, that it is up to the Austrian Federal Government and, together with other governments through cooperation between interior ministries and security authorities, to provide other, new kinds of checks, so that the citizens' fears of the elimination of border checks can be dispelled. Ladies and Gentlemen, I would finally like to point to the considerable increase in prosperity that will follow from Austria's accession to the European Union, and which, according to provisional calculations by the Austrian Economic Research Institute, will amount to some 50 billions net for the next five years. This would constitute an additional economic growth of 2 percent and create some 30,000 new jobs. The gradual implementation of economic and monetary union will lead to further income gains. Ladies and Gentlemen, this brings me back to my remark that the conclusion of the negotiations in Brussels has opened the door toward European Union. Whether, we will finally walk through this door will have to be determined by the Austrian people in a democratic decision. Until then a lot remains to be done. Many citizens of our country already have an opinion on the issue. Yet we also want to get the support of those citizens who still hesitate or who do not or not yet want to accompany us on the road to Europe. Therefore, we will have to lead a very open discussion. After all, the point is not to try to talk people into something but to convince people of a path that we regard as the better path for the future, and, by meeting our responsibility as the Austrian Government, we are convinced that we have to pursue this objective. Together with the other countries of the European Union, and probably also with the north European countries, this path should lead us into a common and peaceful European future. [applause]
