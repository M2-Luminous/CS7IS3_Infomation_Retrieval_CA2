This incident coincides with the tension that has been mounting in Libreville since yesterday. Jean-Claude Franck Medome has the details [Medome] There is a sudden increase in tension following the unlimited general strike launched by the Gabonese Free Trade Unions Confederation [CGSL]. This strike turned into violent demonstrations characterized by roadblocks and the burning of tires, public vehicles, and buildings, including a police station in the second police district in the capital. People and motorists who tried to go to work were assaulted by demonstrators. Such sporadic incidents were still noted this morning, and, in the opinion of the government, this explosion of wrath is the handiwork of the opposition. The government says opposition leaders, at a rally over the weekend, called on their supporters to adhere to the CGSL's call for a general strike and civil disobedience. This strike call was echoed by Radio Liberte, the RNB radio that was destroyed early this morning by security forces. It is difficult, for the moment, to estimate the extent of the damage. In the face of the deterioration of the political and social climate, the government has decided to restore the state of warning, which is marked notably by a curfew from 2200 to 0530 throughout the country. [Paris AFP in French in a Libreville-datelined item at 1236 GMT on 22 February adds the following: "Presidential Guard armored vehicles took up positions in downtown Libreville by midday, where the state of warning has been in force since yesterday. Armored vehicles and truckloads of troops of the Presidential Guard were notably deployed along the boulevard facing the sea where the Presidential Palace is situated."]
