The decision notes that using his unconstitutional edicts, Yeltsin abolished the lawfully elected organs of representative power. The elections to the municipal soviets were fixed for March, then June, and now it is planned to put them off until the fall. But local self-government has been put entirely in the hands of an army of bureaucrats. You get the impression that this has been done on purpose. The decision says that having become defenseless, Krasnaya Presnya residents are appealing for help from their deputies whose powers remain effective until 1995. In connection with this, the rayon soviet's activities resumed as of 28 March. It will hold consultations for Muscovites on legal questions and questions of housing, defend people's rights in the courts, and publicly monitor the executive branch's doings which are at present unchecked. A public office for the rayon soviet has been set up. Sessions of the rayon soviet and its inner soviet should resume work in the space of a month. It has been decided to halt their activities only after the election in Moscow of the municipal soviets. It has been reported to the editorial office that Rayon Soviet Chairman Aleksandr Krasnov has already been summoned to the city prosecutor's office, where there is concern about the rayon soviet's having resumed its activities.
