Its content in AES regions in Russia and Ukraine has been increasing. Studies of tritium in the Ignalina AES region have been conducted since 1983. Concentration of tritium was measured in atmospheric moisture and precipitation and in surface, ground and artesian water. Emission of tritium in 1985-1992 as a result of Ignalina AES activity was calculated. Complex variances of distribution of tritium in the water objects in the Ignalina AES region demonstrate its important ecological role. Accumulation of tritium in vegetation can be up to 200 times higher than background amount. These effects can occur in the AES region, and they can affect dose loads.
