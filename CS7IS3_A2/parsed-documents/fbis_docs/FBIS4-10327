FBIS4-10327 "drlat070_f_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-070 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 El Salvador Onusal Director on Human Rights, Peace Accords Onusal Director on Human Rights, Peace Accords PA1204004094 San Salvador DIARIO LATINO in Spanish 7 Apr 94 p 3 PA1204004094 San Salvador DIARIO LATINO Spanish BFN [Text] Enrique Ters Hors, the new director of the UN Observers for El Salvador [Onusal], said yesterday that if he had to give a diplomatic opinion about the state of Salvadoran human rights, he would have to say it could use improvement. There is still a long way to go before we can say there is a full respect for human rights in the country. Ters Hors, who met with Human Rights Ombudsman Carlos Mauricio Molina Fonseca, said there is concern at the United Nations about the visible delays in the deployment of the National Civilian Police [PNC], land issues, and constitutional reform. These reforms should be approved by 30 April at the latest by all of the political parties represented at the Legislative Assembly. He said that each of the items included in a letter by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali expresses concern about the current state and progress of the peace agreements due to the Salvadoran Government's delay. The letter addresses issues from land transfers to the PNC's training and deployment. The international official said "it is important for all of the peace agreements to be fulfilled, but it is also important that they be properly fulfilled. Sometimes haste affects the quality of fulfillment." He added that the more important issues listed in the secretary general's letter demonstrate that there is in fact concern about the delays in the agreement, which is why Butrus-Ghali found it appropriate to bring them before the Security Council. President Cristiani recognized yesterday there are certain delays regarding the PNC, land transfers, and constitutional reform. He said this was not due to a lack of political resolve on the part of his government but, rather, due to delays in receiving international aid and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which did not want to meet with the government to try and find a solution to the problems. Ters Hors said he feels optimistic, because the president has publicly expressed his will to accelerate completion of the pending issues. He said that he personally knows President Cristiani has given his minister instructions, thus demonstrating the government's will to begin working. The Onusal director said he believes several programs designed to strengthen human rights in El Salvador will go into effect in July with coordination by Human Rights Ombudsman Molina.
