The department's Military Research Institute had intended to run trials with the vaccine gpl60. Approval was given by the National Committee on AIDS on February 14. Produced by the Micro Genesis company of the United States, gp160 is designed to combat the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which leads to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS. "The candidate vaccine (gpl60) has not performed satisfactorily in tests on Americans," said the officer, who declined to be named. The institute was considering another multivalent vaccine produced by United Biochemicals Inc (UBI) of the U.S. "It is a synthetic vaccine which is designed to treat many kinds of HIV infection, including the Thai strain," the officer said. However military testing of the vaccine could not start for another six to eight months and would need the approval of the National Committee on AIDS. The committee has already approved testing of a UBI vaccine by the Thai Red Cross under the auspices of the World Health Organization. Project director Prof. Praphan Phanuphak announced on Wednesday that tests would start on May I using civilian volunteers who test HIV-negative. "WHO will be responsible for scrutinizing the trials and making sure there is no breach of ethics or human rights," he said.
