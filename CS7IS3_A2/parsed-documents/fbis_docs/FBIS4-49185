In a telephone interview with XINHUA tonight, a high-ranking official of the United Somali Congress said in Mogadishu that the situation in Somalia, especially in the capital of Mogadishu, is very grave because the Habarghidir clan, where General Mohamed Farah Aideed is from, last month occupied Brava, Merka and the area around the Mogadishu airport which belong to the clans of Hawadle, Dir and Biimaal. The airport is now under the control of the United Nations Operation in Somalia (Unosom). The official said "if the Habarg-Hidir clan does not withdraw from Brava, Merka and the airport area soon, let it get ready to fight with us." On March 24 this year, all Somali faction leaders signed a declaration on Somali national reconciliation here after eight-day negotiations. The leaders agreed that a national reconciliation conference would be held in Mogadishu on May 15 this year to elect a president, a parliament and form a government composed of all faction leaders. Under the declaration, the faction leaders would hold a preparatory meeting in Mogadishu on April 15 for the proposed national reconciliation conference. However, the venue for the preparatory meeting has been changed to Nairobi, Kenya, for security reasons.
