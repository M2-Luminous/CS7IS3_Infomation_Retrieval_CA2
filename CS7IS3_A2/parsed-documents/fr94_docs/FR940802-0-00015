FR940802-0-00015 FR940802-0-00007 POSTAL SERVICE 39 CFR Part 111 Revisions to Standards Related to Deposit and Delivery of Mail AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Final rule; amendment. SUMMARY: This notice amends the final rule published on June 23, 1994 (59 FR 32336&hyph;32338), which amended several Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards concerning the deposit and delivery of mail. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 3, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Leo F. Raymond, (202) 268&hyph;5199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The final rule added new DMM D042.1.7 to provide uniform standards for the delivery of Express Mail and accountable mail, effective October 2, 1994. The new DMM D042.1.7f stated the period after which mail is returned to the sender if delivery is not made and the addressee does not respond to a delivery notice. The 15-day standard generally established included an exception for COD (30 days) but inadvertently omitted the existing 5-day standard for Express Mail, which is retained. The final rule also announced that, effective October 2, 1994, DMM D930.2.0 would be deleted and firm holdout service no longer offered. The final rule is hereby amended to include three supporting revisions to DMM D920, Caller Service. First, DMM D920.1.1 is revised to delete a reference to firm holdout service. Second, DMM D920.1.4, 1.5, and 1.9 are revised to ensure accommodation of previous firm holdout customers. Revised DMM D920.1.4 combines the text of existing 1.4 and 1.5, including a reference to new 1.5 that allows postmasters to except customers who had firm holdout service as of July 3, 1994, from the otherwise applicable requirement (in 1.4) that their mail would have to be addressed to their post office box (caller service) number. Third, the revision to DMM 920.1.9 makes it clear that caller service may be provided to former firm holdout customers. List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 111 Postal Service.
