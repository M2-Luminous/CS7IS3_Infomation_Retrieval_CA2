The discussions will mainly concern the Russian troops withdrawal and the situation of the ethnic minorities, he added. The Italian Foreign Minister's meeting with Riigikogu [parliament] Speaker Ulo Nugis had to be canceled because of the delayed arrival of the minister. Beniamino Andreatta met President Lennart Meri, Prime Minister Mart Laar, Dmitriy Mikhaylov of the Russian Cultural Society and member of the Russian Assembly Aleksey Semyonov. He is to meet Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik today before leaving for Vilnius.
