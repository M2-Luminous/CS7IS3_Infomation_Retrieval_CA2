[Nuhanovic] Mr. Granic, after the Croat-Bosniak agreement has been signed, there is an impression that the United States has provided no specific guarantees for the agreed 58 percent of the territory for the federation, other than the "paper" ones. [Granic] This percentage is a matter of principle. We should be aware of the fact that these are the areas in which the Croats and Bosniaks form a majority. Great success has been achieved with the Vienna agreement: The negotiating position of the Bosniak-Croat federation has been consolidated. There are, of course, no specific guarantees, but the aim has been achieved in Vienna -- the Federation has been consolidated. The stronger the Federation is, the stronger the U.S. support will be. [Nuhanovic] However, the positions of the international forces are divided. Namely, the same day the Vienna agreement was signed, Alain Juppe stated he hoped the ministers in Geneva would support the proposal of 51 percent for the Federation and 49 percent for the Serbs. What is your comment on that? [Granic] This is a well-known position represented by France, Russia, and Great Britain. The United States is close to that position, but it will not accept the position if the Federation does not accept it. [Nuhanovic] What would the lifting of the arms embargo in Bosnia-Herzegovina mean for Croatia? [Granic] The present situation should be distinguished from that of about six months ago, during the conflicts between the Muslims and Croats. In that situation it would have been negative both for the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and for Croatia. The Croat position that the Bosniaks are victims of Serb aggression just as the Croats are is well known. The international community believes that an agreement can be reached by putting pressure on the Serb side. However, if that does not happen, then the defense of the Croats and Bosniaks in Bosnia-Herzegovina is the only way out. Croatia supported this elementary right in the Security Council. Ultimately, though, we consider participating in the Partnership for Peace as much more important, and the same goes for the disarming in the area. We will specifically support that. We would like the international community to become more involved, but we will not give up our legitimate rights in Croatia, just as it is a legitimate right of the Croat and Bosniak people in Bosnia-Herzegovina to defend themselves. However, after everything that has happened, it would be better if peace were imposed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. When I say this, I am thinking of the Serbian side. [Nuhanovic] Could you comment on Ganic and Durakovic's appearance at the Vienna negotiations? Their political positions were significantly different from what was agreed at the end. [Granic] It is never good to talk about what happened during negotiations. Both sides were a little afraid, but the influence of the U.S. mediator was beneficial, as was that of the Croatian side. However, the solutions are better than was anticipated, as they are solutions that lead toward the end of the war. Naturally, another important thing is that the international position of Croatia has become even stronger.
