Water and oil mix, for example, and a candle flame takes on a spherical shape. The obvious place to investigate such things is in the microgravity environment of space. Unfortunately, that is still an extremely expensive ``laboratory'' where few have the privilege to work. One alternative is to conduct microgravity experiments on earth, taking advantage of the fact that the force of gravity approaches zero as an object accelerates downward. In Japan, an abandoned coal mine shaft in Kamisunagawa, Hokkaido, has been transformed into a state-of-the art facility for microgravity experiments providing an unprecedented 10 seconds of free-fall time. That is twice the duration of similar facilities run by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the University of Bremen in Germany. The successful completion of the Kamisunagawa microgravity experiment facility just slightly behind schedule in 1991 is the story of clever engineers meeting challenges as they appear. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry launched the microgravity project in 1987, handing over management to the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology. Construction began in 1988, carried out by a consortium of four companies: Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co., Mitsui Construction Co., and Toshiba Corp. Overcoming Resistance The vertical shaft at Kamisunagawa is 710 meters deep, or twice the height of the Tokyo Tower. The bottom 220m of the shaft is equipped with an air control system, an hydraulic brake and an emergency stopping system. The rest of the shaft is available for free-fall experiments. At 490m, this is long enough to provide 10 seconds of time where objects experience one-ten-thousandth the gravity they would on the surface of the earth. The experiments themselves are carried out inside a large bullet-shaped capsule which weighs 7.5 metric tons, and measures 1.8m in diameter and 7.8m in length. The capsule is not just dropped down the shaft, but shot down like a rocket. Moreover, it is not simply a matter of propelling a capsule down a hole in the ground. Numerous technologies had to be developed to speed the capsule down in a controlled manner that wouldn't disturb the experiments within. In the free-fall facilities at NASA and Bremen University, the test capsule is dropped down an evacuated shaft, so air resistance is not a problem. But at four-times the length, it is far more difficult to create a vacuum at the Kamisunagawa test facility. Instead, the capsule must be propelled downward with enough force to overcome air resistance. The original design called for the use of a superconducting maglev system, but that idea was scrapped in June of 1988 because of cost and technical considerations. ``They told us to come up with an alternative by September, and we were frantic,'' recalls Shigeaki Oobayashi, deputy general manager of Ishikawajima-Harima's new business planning and promotion department. The alternative they came up with was a type of cold-gas thruster system, similar to that used to control satellites in space. Since air resistance changes with time as the capsule drops, the engineers ended up placing 18 thrusters on the capsule, each capable of turning on and off as the occasion arises to ensure smooth control of the speed of the capsule. Being an abandoned mine shaft, a variety of hooks, horizontal shafts and other objects remain in place. All these objects disrupt the air flow and make it extremely difficult to analyze the aerodynamics of the shaft. ``We didn't have the luxury of being able to make armchair calculations. It was a constant process of trial and error,'' Oobayashi explains. To shield the experimental equipment from the vibrations of this ``rocket,'' the capsule is actually a pair of nested capsules, separated by an evacuated chamber. An extremely delicate balance must be maintained at all times between these two capsules: they must drop at exactly the same speed because any contact would disturb the microgravity environment of the inner chamber.
