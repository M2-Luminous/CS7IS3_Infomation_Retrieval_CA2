He said that the Serb side would not condition the talks on the end of hostilities on the lifting of the sanctions against the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. We would like to see peace, even for four months, in order to save the lives of many young Serb and Muslim men, said Karadzic at a news conference. We will not set any conditions for the talks on the end of hostilities, but the conference cannot start until the Serb side is guaranteed an equal status, which implies that something should be done about the sanctions and that the pressure and threats of the international community should cease, stressed Karadzic. These are the minimum conditions that should show whether the international community wants peace or not. Karadzic said that some circles in the United States would prefer the sanctions to peace and that some circles in the United States maintain "pro-Iranian positions" waging this war via a mediator. We believe that the talks about percentages of Bosnian territory should be abandoned because they do not reflect the structure and quality of these territories. We could accept 49 percent of former Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory, but in that case they [Bosnian Croats and Muslims] should give us Tuzla and Sarajevo, said Karadzic. Given that two states are being created in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, one must take into account the fact that they should be capable of functioning with enough resources, a good infrastructure and communications, believes Karadzic. We are prepared in this respect to honor the rights of Croats and Muslims and those of their federation, but we demand the same in return -- that our borders can be defended in case we become enemies again, and that our territories are compact, stressed Karadzic. [passage omitted] It is quite clear, said Karadzic, that the international community accepted the fact that the Srpska republic already existed in former Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory and that it will be recognized, while the remaining territory will be one state -- a federation of Muslims and Croats -- or possibly two states if the federation fails. In Karadzic's opinion, this is the greatest achievement of the four-month political struggle of the Serb people and he believes that it would have been better both for Bosnia-Herzegovina and for The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to have remained in Yugoslavia. If the international community fails to stop the Muslim offensive, the Serb army will, at a given moment, launch a counteroffensive, warned Karadzic. If our enemies decide that the conflict should be resolved by military means they must realize that they will get as many territories as they succeed in taking -- which means almost nothing. If however, they opt for a political solution then we Serbs will have to cede some of the territory, but in this case the war must stop at once, said Karadzic categorically. [passage omitted]
