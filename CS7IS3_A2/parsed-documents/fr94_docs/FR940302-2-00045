FR940302-2-00045 FR940302-2-00028 4. Final Closure Cover_40 CFR 258.60 requires that a MSWLF final closure cover include a composite cap which consists of a minimum 6 inch earthen erosion/vegetative layer and an infiltration layer of at least 18 inches of soil compacted to a permeability of 1Ã—10 ^5 cm/sec or the permeability of the bottom liner system, whichever is less. EPA Headquarters has interpreted this description to imply that MSW landfills with a synthetic in their liner system must be closed with a cap that includes a synthetic in the infiltration layer. Directors of EPA-approved states have the flexibility to allow infiltration layers of alternative materials and/or thicknesses. Florida's original regulations did not require a synthetic in the final closure cover of a synthetically lined MSW landfill. Florida has revised their regulatory language to require that final closure covers on MSW landfills include ``a barrier layer which is substantially equivalent to, or less than, the permeability of the bottom liner system.'' Florida also specifically requires that, ``If the landfill uses a geomembrane in the bottom liner system, the barrier layer shall also incorporate a geomembrane.'' 5. Financial Assurance for Corrective Action_40 CFR 258.73 requires that landfill owner/operators required to undertake corrective action procedures, have financial assurance based on a written estimate, in current dollars, of the cost of hiring a third party to perform the corrective action. Florida's original program did not address this issue. Florida has revised their regulatory language to require an acceptable mechanism by which owner/operators must provide financial assurance in the event that corrective action activities are necessary at their facility. EPA Region IV will consider all public comments on its tentative determination which are received by close of the scheduled public hearing. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for Florida's program. EPA Region IV will make a final decision on whether or not to approve Florida's program after all comments are received and reviewed, and will give notice of that decision in the Federal Register . The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments received by the end of the scheduled public hearing. Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
