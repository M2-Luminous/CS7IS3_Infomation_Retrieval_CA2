The debate is in progress, for the most part, between three groups: The "Arabism" group is seeking the preservation of the Arab order and action to bring it out of its current conditions and develop it, enabling it to withstand international, regional, and local threats. This group shows a special interest in the Arab League, seeing it as the eventual embodiment of the concept of an Arab regional system. It is the parent organization of all the Arab joint action bodies. This group is thus opposed to the "Middle East market," in which it sees an attempt to create a regional framework for Israeli domination of the area. The "Middle Eastern" group calls for the replacement of the Arab regional system with another, Middle Eastern one, including both Arabs and Israelis, at first, and perhaps Turks and Iranians later on. This group emphasizes the economic benefits this project would produce and the need for it as a guarantee of the Arab-Israeli peace. The last group proposes a third way, between these two courses. It seeks global and regional arrangements permitting the Arab system to coexist with the Middle Eastern system and for the Arab League to exist side by side with Middle Eastern joint action organizations that may be founded later. This third group includes some official and unofficial Arab quarters, chiefly the Secretariat General of the Arab League. In an effort to propagate this point of view, the Secretariat General has prepared a study on the future of joint Arab action and the Middle East market plan, and distributed it to Arab ministers of finance, economy, and foreign affairs. The study showed the great global challenges the Arabs will face in coming years, especially after the signing of the GATT accord, the strengthening of regional or continental cooperation between the countries of the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the efforts being made by the seven large powers to solve the unemployment problem in the industrialized countries. The study concluded by reaffirming the importance of regional cooperation in its Arab and Middle Eastern portions. In addition, in the course of testifying to the integrity of the third group's point of view, the secretary general, Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, has made statements dealing with the question of the Middle East market, in which he set forth the major ideas advanced by proponents of the idea of an Arab-"Middle Eastern" intermarriage, confirming the practicality of their plan and its rightness. 'Abd-al-Majid's point of view here can be summarized in the three following Arab "no's": - No privileges given to Israel after the settlement, nor any Israeli control in the context of the Middle East plan, because "it is no more than a tiny dot in the world, with limited resources and surrounded by an Arab world that has great possibilities," and "the Arabs are not naive; they will not accept terms imposed upon them or for Israel to have special status in this market." - No fear of a Middle East market on the part of the Arab order. "The future belongs to the Arab League because it is the expression of the sole Arab identity and the image of the community united by a single culture of values and traditions, by a single geographic expanse and shared history." - "No force or coercion in dealing with Israel." The Arab countries are sovereign entities and alone will define the way in which they will deal with the Israelis, according to their national interests. The picture drawn by Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid's "no's" should be welcomed by those keen to preserve the continuation of the Arab regional order. It strengthens their confidence in the future, and their hope of developing the maintenance of their resources and their use in achieving a comprehensive renaissance in the region. This is the appearance. In substance, however, the position of the League's secretary general seems to back the point of view of the "Middle Eastern" group. How and why? Protecting the regional Arab order from extinction requires us to define accurately the challenges it will face, and alerting official and unofficial Arab circles to their existence and their true extent, and the citizen of their effect on the Arabs. We must also define the methods by which we may confront and respond to these challenges, starting with action to unite the Arabs' forces to achieve this goal and firmly establish the collective Arab personality and revive the institutions through which it speaks. The Middle Easterners, by contrast, are seeking to keep Arab public opinion from fully comprehending these threats, so that they can ram their plan through without opposition to speak of, and with as little effort as possible. In this context, the Middle East market plan is offered as if it were a plan for coexistence rather than domination. It is, as one Arab active in politics has described it, a policy of "impoverish and rule." The positions of the Secretariat General of the Arab League give encouragement to the Middle Easterners when they ignore the threats surrounding the Arab world, and ignore the difference between what they hope for, and what actually is; between what is the Arabs' natural right, and actual reality. Reality says that Israel may lack some raw materials and may rely on outside aid, as stated in the study the Secretariat General distributed to Arab officials, but it makes up for this shortcoming in many ways. It is an industrial country, while most Arab countries are still agricultural societies. Its national income is greater than that of most of its neighbors. Israel is more advanced than the Arabs in the industries of the future as well as in agriculture. Its needs for water, energy, raw materials, and investments do not reduce its superiority over the Arabs; Japan is no less in need of energy resources than is Israel, and Holland is no less lacking in raw materials; yet these defects have not hurt these two countries' economies. It may not be said of Holland that it is an insignificant country just because it has a small population, nor because its area is limited, or because it is compelled to import raw materials from abroad. What is now proposed is that all doors be thrown open to bilateral relations between Israel and the countries of the Arab and Islamic region, to weaken the types of Arab joint action and collective bilateral Arab action. More bluntly, it is proposed that Israel and the Western countries deal with Arab countries on the basis of purely bilateral relations. The "Middle East market project" is the outward aspect of this reality. It is an outer facade that conceals an image that puts Israel into the center of the region and its economic, political, and military "core area." The Arab countries, on the other hand, become subject to the center, carrying out its policies and plans. We sensed this concept of the future at the Madrid conference, when Israel, and the conference sponsors, rejected the idea of a unified Arab delegation. Israel took steps, even in the smallest details, to weaken coordination among the Arab delegations, staying in scattered places to make cooperation and consultation among them difficult. These possibilities strengthen Israel's position economically, politically, and militarily, at the expense of the Arab countries, and allow it to gain economic prerogatives, and distinctive political roles, contrary to the hopes and plans of the League's secretary general. These projects are not our predestined fate. It is the Arabs' right, and it is within their ability, to resist them and to rebuild their lost unity, to strengthen their national unity, and to proceed along the path of prosperity; acting, at the same time, to contain the danger of Israeli expansionism and hegemonistic ambitions, which Israeli leaders do not even hide. This course of Arab and international action requires hard and persistent work with which energetic Arab forces are familiar, and continual movement to change the regional and international status quo, which tends to tilt the balance in favor of Israel. The Secretariat does not ignore this aspect; on the contrary, it gives it high priority among its concerns, and calls for Arab reconciliation, the revival of Arab solidarity, and the reactivation of its institutions. The Secretariat is not calling for the realization of this goal in a merely formal way; it has combined the call with practical action, ongoing contacts, and palpable effort in order to overcome the obstacles in its way. Therefore the Secretariat has certain knowledge of the extent of the fragmentation ailing the Arab world, and the policies that are aimed at turning the fracture that has plagued the Arab body politic in the 1990's into a permanent state and stable condition to help in redrawing the identity of the region and redrawing the map. When the Arabs were in that condition, comparison among them was as if they were a single power "with great possibilities" confronting Israel "with limited resources"--this comparison does not stand on firm ground, and leads to erroneous conclusions. It spreads feelings of torpor and apathy in the Arab spirit, when what we need to do is to give the Arabs incentives to emerge from this condition. The hope is that the Arabs will be free, as Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said, to draw their regional and international policies, and to choose, without compulsion or coercion, their own way of dealing with their neighbors, to define their position toward their enemy purely in accordance with their own interests. The reality, is however, entirely different. Israel was imposed on the Arabs by force, and the Arabs lost the Arab lands occupied in 1967 through war. They were compelled to attend the Madrid conference under force of threat. The coercion was the outcome of the pro-Israel Western powers' insistence on guaranteeing Israel's supremacy over the Arabs, individually and as a group. Will this policy change if the Arabs accept the Middle Eastern market? The great powers, keen to guarantee Israel's superiority in war and military confrontations, and in support of its role as policeman of the Middle East, will work on securing its superiority over the Arabs on the economic scene as well. They will enable it to obtain broad privileges at the expense of the Arabs so it can play the role of regional agent for Western interests. Apart from that, Israel itself will not hesitate to use its overwhelming military superiority over the Arabs to obtain economic and political privileges in the region. The coercion and complusion used against the Arabs today to get them to end the Arab boycott of Israel, for free, with no reasonable justification, convinces us of this. The Arab League's Council, which met in Cairo in September 1993, did not agree to end any of the levels of the Arab boycott of Israel. This was confirmed by Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid in his statement in January of this year, when he said that the boycott would continue "because the reasons for its original imposition still exist." This position was quickly changed, and the boycott reviewed by the Arab League itself, even though the reasons for which it was imposed still existed. Why? Because the U.S. secretary of commerce asked that the issue be put on the Council's agenda, and because "the American administration is determined to end the Arab economic boycott of Israel," as U.S. Vice President Al Gore told the annual convention of AIPAC [American-Israel Public Affairs Committee] in Washington. If this is not compulsion and coercion, then what is? If the change is not proof and evidence of the distinctive role being prepared for Israel in the framework of the "Middle East market" plan, then what proof does the Arab League Secretariat need, to be convinced that what is needed is to inform Arab public opinion of the risks of this plan, rather than to minimize it?
