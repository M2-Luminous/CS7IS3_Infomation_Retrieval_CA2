Sulaiman Ali, leader of one of the lost commands said the new wave of kidnapping will start at the close of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The month-long fasting of Muslims ended on Sunday. Ali, however, denied responsibility in the kidnapping of five school teachers in Tuburan, Basilan last 7 March. He demanded a pull out of the marines from Tuburan, saying that more people will be abducted by his group starting this month if the marine troops will not be pulled out.
