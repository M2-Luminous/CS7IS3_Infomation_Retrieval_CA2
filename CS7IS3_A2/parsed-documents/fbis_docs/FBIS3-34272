Zardari will bear a message from Bhutto to President Saddam Husayn. Informed sources say the message is connected to the release of two Pakistani soldiers and one civilian who were sentenced to seven years imprisonment in Iraq after entering Iraqi territory by mistake, as was claimed at the time, while on the job in a mine field on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. Under the leadership of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan dispatched troops within the Desert Shield operation in the second Gulf war and expelled an Iraqi diplomat. The two countries relations were not satisfactory during the rule of General Ziaul Haq. Informed sources told our radio that the Pakistani delegation will discuss with officials in Baghdad the causes for their tense relations. The sources voiced optimism that Iraq will release the imprisoned Pakistanis and that relations will be restored to what they were during the leadership of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir's first government -- a state of utmost cordiality.
