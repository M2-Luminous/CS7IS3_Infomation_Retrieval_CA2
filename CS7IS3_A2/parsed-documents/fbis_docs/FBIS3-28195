For the locals, admission is free and drinks will be on the Americans. American businessman and party organizer James Rothwell said it is a small way of thanking the Vietnamese for persisting in their efforts to improve relations with the U.S. despite the legacy of war. The announcement coincides with preparations for the lunar new year and is likely to be one of the memorable celebrations in decades.
