It has not been decided whether Lebanon will respond to the invitation. Minister Buwayz today discussed developments in the bilateral talks in light of the talks that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has had in Damascus and other concerned regional states. Buwayz expects Christopher's current tour to result in an invitation to attend the 13th round of bilateral peace talks. He believes that the proposals submitted to Syria in the past 24 hours are vague, because the Israeli proposal offers phased withdrawal from parts of the Golan Heights, starting with Majdal Shams. The proposals do not mention what will happen after that. Syria, he said, demands full withdrawal. Buwayz added: I believe that Syria is not very enthusiastic about these proposals, because it wants to know how withdrawals will begin and end even if they are phased. From the information I got from Damascus in the past 24 hours, I got the impression that these proposals are not tempting. I do not want to sound pessimistic and say that they are the last proposals. They will certainly be followed by others. But the first round of talks in Damascus did not sound constructive according to the latest reports. Minister Buwayz said that negotiations continuing for three years since Madrid have produced few results. The Palestinian-Israeli track produced the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, which remains a very modest achievement, he said, adding: This agreement mentions a 350-km square Gaza and Jericho and gives the Palestinians rights in municipalities. It involves no political rights. It also notes that Israeli military troops will continue to deploy at the entrance to Gaza and Jericho. The foreign minister was talking to a delegation from the Netherlands including professors and students from the faculty of law. The delegation is currently on a tour that will take it to Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Jerusalem, and Gaza to get acquainted with the peace process and the progress it has made. [passage omitted] As for the Lebanese-Israeli track, the problem looks much easier than it is. The Israelis say they have no ambitions on Lebanese land and water. This has remained mere talk in the media; it has not been interpreted in practical offers or proposals to withdraw during the ongoing negotiations. Buwayz added: We propose that Israel announce and bind itself to the principle of withdrawal from the land it occupies in the south. This principle paves the way for setting up two security and military committees to study the necessary security measures in the south to guarantee peace and stability in the region simultaneously with the programed Israeli withdrawal. I believe the Israelis do not want to implement UN Security Council Resolution 425 because it does not involve a peace agreement with Lebanon. This resolution demands Israel's unconditional withdrawal from the Lebanese territory it occupies. The foreign minister continued: The second reason that leads Israel to refrain from responding to Lebanon's demands is that it does not want to recognize the principle of military withdrawal until Lebanon restricts or suspends resistance activity. But the Lebanese stance on the Israeli viewpoint is the opposite; occupation can only be met with one of two things: Diplomacy, that is, implementing Resolution 425, or liberation by the army. Israel refuses the first approach and the United Nations has not put pressure on it to accept it. As for the second approach, the Lebanese Army is not militarily prepared to confront the Israeli army. Hence the resistance was organized by the Lebanese people, who are entitled to restore their land as long as the state cannot do it. Buwayz reiterated that resistance in the south is a result of the Israeli occupation. It will lose its justification once the occupier leaves, he said.
