The Demonstration ATR Construction Promotion Committee comprised of representatives from the electric power industry, MITI, STA, etc., will make its decision in the near future. The construction plan that will be presented to the Electric Power Development Coordination Council in December 1994 will call for construction to begin in April 1997 and operation to begin in 2003. The plan has been delayed by lengthy negotiations over compensation with the local fishermen's union, but the Oma Fishermen's Association decided to accept the prefecture's mediation concerning additional fishing industry compensation, so it is possible that negotiations will finally move forward once again. This is the seventh postponement since the Promotion Committee first hammered out the demonstration ATR construction process in 1985.
