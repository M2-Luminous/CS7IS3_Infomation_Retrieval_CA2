The list of the 126 officers includes 70 colonels, 17 from the General Police [PG], 19 from the Technical Police [PT], three from the Security Police [PS], and 31 from the Police Forces Health Unit. Also, 36 commanders, of which seven belong to the PG, 22 to the PT, four to the PS, and three to the Police Health Unit. The list also includes 20 majors: Five from the PG, 12 the PT, and three the PS. It was learned that in the next few days this measure also will affect captains, lieutenants, and second lieutenants. Police sources who asked to remain anonymous, said the "invitation" was delivered on 3 February to the homes of the affected policemen who will have to accept it. It also was disclosed that six generals retired last December. The sources noted that disciplinary measures played a strong role in the aforementioned "invitation" because a commission assessed the respective service records of all the commanders between 1989 and 1993. In the case of retirement for years of service, the sources said that those who graduated between 1961 and 1963 were included. It was also disclosed that those "invited" to retire will not lose any of their benefits. In the case that they were found liable for promotion to the next rank, they will get the salary and fringe benefits of the next rank. This measure, as well as changes announced by the Counterterrorism Division (Dincote) and the Crime Investigative National Directorate [Direccion Nacional de Investigacion Criminal -- Dinincri], has generated uncertainty within the PNP, according to the same sources. As is known, a few days ago PNP Director General Victor Alva Plasencia asserted that police stations that [words indistinct] to the public and carry out street services will be reinforced to do a better job. He did not specify, however, if the reinforcement will come from Dinincri. Moreover, on that occasion he said that in view of the reduction of terrorist actions, the crime prevention service will be reinforced so the citizenry can carry out its activities normally. In this regard, Alva Plasencia only said that the units will continue doing their job and that there is no estimate of the percentage of personnel that will be rationalized. In referring to Dincote, he said it will continue doing its job throughout the country.
