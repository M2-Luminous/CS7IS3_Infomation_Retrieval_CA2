It is the beginning of the road to the aim pursued, namely to a European security system. We are counting on mutual contacts between the Polish Army and the armies of the NATO countries and we favor joint maneuvers; for the time being, at the lowest tactical levels. We are trying in various ways to become acquainted with and get used to each other. In this sense, we are creating numerous opportunities, the West is doing the same, and this inspires us with moderate optimism." In connection with the stage of Polish-Romanian military relations and their development, the Polish defense minister said: "Were we to check the history of the two peoples, we would find numerous elements of friendship, fruitful cultural contacts, economic, and, of course, military cooperation. Now, we are jointly solving problems linked to higher military training and improving cooperation between our topographical services and in the area of health care. We are relying on technical cooperation. The access by our two countries to the PFP initiative is opening up new opportunities for cooperation."
