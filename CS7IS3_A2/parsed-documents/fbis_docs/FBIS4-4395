The emergency step is aimed at making a sufficient supply of rice available to consumers in the preharvest period, agency officials said. Japan suffered the worst rice harvest in postwar days last year, necessitating the emergency imports. The officials said blended rice will be sold at a ratio of 70 percent domestic rice to 30 percent imported rice from September, with domestic rice taking a dominant share compared with the 30-70 percent ratio expected in April through July. From October, consumers are expected to buy domestic brands almost entirely, they said.
