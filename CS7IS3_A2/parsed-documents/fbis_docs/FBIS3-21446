Describing the hike as "anti-people and anti-democratic," CPM [Communist Party of India-Marxist] state secretary A. Nallasivan, MP, said on Friday that by increasing the prices of essential commodities before the budget presentation, the Centre was trying to create the illusion that there were no new taxes in the budget. At the same time, the hike in the average ex-factory levy sugar price from Rs. 670.99 to Rs. 734.08 a quintal, had helped the sugar mill owners to attain huge profits. The proposed price hike would severely affect the people, he said, and asked the Centre to drop the move. CPI [Communist Party of India] state secretary R. Nallakannu said the price increase was "unnecessary and not proper." State Janata Dal general secretary K. Jagaveerapandian said the government had once again adopted the strategy of hiking the prices of essential commodities before the budget. Moreover, in the last one year, the Centre had thrice decreased the quantity of sugar allocated for distribution through the PDS and thereby caused an artificial demand for sugar in the open market. Besides this, the Centre's decision had helped businessmen to sell sugar at exorbitant prices. "This is a cheap way of duping the public," he added. UCPI [United Communist Party of India] state president N. Nanjappan and secretary K. Manickkam, in a joint statement, said the decision to increase the sugar price from Feb. 1 would greatly affect the common man. Moreover, it would pave the way for increase of sugar prices in the open market. "There is a wide gap between the Centre's assurances and the reality." Referring to the increase in the prices of domestic LPG [liquidied petroleum gas] cylinders and rice, the leaders urged the Centre to take immediate steps to reduce the prices of essential commodities. T. Kumaresan, president, All India Farmers Democratic Party, said the hike was "unjustified," and would hit the weaker sections hard.
