The Slovak Foreign Ministry originally intended that the agreements be signed during Kovac's current visit to Poland. That they will not be signed represents no change of policy, Kovac said. Most of the series of agreements will be signed in the first quarter of 1994, Kovac said. He added that a meeting of the two countries' cabinets was being prepared. Kovac said that a proposal to completely open the common border was spontaneously brought up during his Warsaw talks, which he considered an expression of great interest in extending Slovak-Polish relations. However, this question is linked to readmission agreements, and control of foreign citizens and goods must be preserved. The opening of the border should only concern citizens of the two countries. Kovac said that it was necessary to analyze the interests of the individual countries of the Visegrad Four (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia) and prepare further steps to develop mutual cooperation. There are specific questions, such as the Partnership For Peace plan, which cannot be solved bilaterally and need a joint line, he said. "When four say the same thing separately at various places, it is different from their speaking with one voice," Kovac said. However, cooperation within the Visegrad Group cannot replace bilateral relations, he noted. Kovac also met with President of the Polish National Bank Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, who said that the creation of a Slovak-Polish bank was not being considered. However, some Polish bank could take up the assignment. The bank will be chosen by the Polish minister for foreign cooperation, she said.
