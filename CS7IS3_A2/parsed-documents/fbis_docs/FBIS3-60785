In their communique, the subversives, who describe themselves as "prisoners of war," note: "We support, voluntarily submit to, and endorse (...) the letters that President Gonzalo and Comrade Miriam sent to the president of the Republic, engineer Alberto Fujimori Fujimori." The terrorists specifically indicate that they support "the talks to reach a peace agreement, whose implementation involves ending a 13-year-old war in our country." Emphasizing their identification with Abimael Guzman's leadership, the imprisoned Maoists stress that the Peruvian Communist Party-Shining Path's [PCP-SL] new slogan now is: "Struggle for a Peace Agreement!" Apparently, it involves a group of subversives who disagree with the leaders who have replaced Guzman and his followers because in their communique the imprisoned Shining Path subversives note: "The PCP wants peace and no more provocations," hinting at the attacks that shocked our capital during recent weeks, including a long blackout and the explosion of car bombs. According to police reports, Shining Path hard-liners, led by Oscar Ramirez Durand, Ostap Morote Barrionuevo, Teresa Duran Araujo, and others, are opposed to surrender and, with the assistance of those Shining Path armed units that have not been hit and are prepared to carry out terrorist actions, pursue their plans because "the people's war does not end with the decision of one man; the people's war is a historic necessity dictated by the laws of society." Outside our country, Luis Arce Borja and Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas, who are making propaganda for the Shining Path in Brussels and London, respectively, have said the laying down of arms is "a hoax, a government maneuver." They stressed that the PCP-SL will not surrender. Arce Borja and Olaechea Cahuas based their viewpoint on some remarks made by Abimael Guzman Reinoso in July 1988. In his remarks, Guzman Reinoso said the talks "are just aimed at undermining and destroying the people's war." Shortly after Guzman's capture, the Shining Path terrorists who replaced the arrested and killed leaders released a poster in which they stressed that the fight would continue: "The party's leadership may have disappeared, but the remaining leaders must and can pursue the plans, the struggle, the people's war. We are firmly convinced that the revolution will not stop, will not be paralyzed." Nevertheless, the communique issued by the Shining Path terrorists imprisoned in Canto Grande, which apparently is a majority group since the opinion of the rebellious group [within the Shining Path] remains unknown, leaves the leadership that insists on pursuing armed actions without important support. The self-styled "Canto Grande Shining Combat Trench's prisoners of war," including the perpetrators of the most shocking attacks and selective crimes, stress: "We reaffirm our highest and unconditional submission to the single leadership of President Gonzalo and the party's central directorate." In his letters to the president last October, Abimael Guzman said: "Peace has been achieved to meet a people's need. Yesterday we struggled to wage a people's war. Today, with equal firmness and resolve, we must struggle to achieve a peace agreement." For several weeks, the Miguel Castro Castro Maoists had their doubts about the authenticity of the letters and a video in which Guzman reads the letters while Elena Iparraguirre, "Comrade Miriam," watches him closely. After long discussions, however, the Miguel Castro Castro Maoists finally reached a majority agreement and signed an undated communique in which they decide "to close ranks in this new period of our party's life and the contemporary Peruvian society's life." Miguel Castro Castro is one of our country's most sophisticated penitentiaries. The largest group of our country's terrorists are confined there, with the exception of the Yanamayo penitentiary in Puno Department where top PCP-SL leaders such as Martha Huatay Ruiz, Edmundo Cox Beuzeville, Osman Morote Barrionuevo, Maria Pantoja, and others are confined.
