Solidarity has called a nationwide general strike for 28 April. The national protest action staff have stated that this action is being taken after today's talks with the industry minister and the fruitless wait for the government to implement the trade union's demands. The action will be continuous strike action and is aimed at putting pressure on the government in order to force it to quickly present a timetable for implementing the demands of the national trade unions. Minister Pol was urged (?to do this) during this morning's talks, Marian Krzaklewski stated. We have no other way, Krzaklewski added, at the end of a hastily organized news conference. [Announcer] Thank you. I remind you that the government is meeting just now to discuss the strike situation.
