[Khasbulatov] Of course, it is not a pleasant experience to be in prison. However, they would have released me soon in any case, partly because of my health, but above all because the judges could not find a shred of evidence against me. [Gambacorta] President Yeltsin maintains ... [Khasbulatov, interrupting] But which president? He was elected president under the old Constitution, which he himself regards as being undemocratic and to be annulled. However, this Constitution is still better than the one which he had passed in December without allowing the people to discuss it. I do not believe that the 20th century has yet seen a worse constitution. [Gambacorta] Boris Yeltsin maintains that he is in total control of the situation. What do you think about this? [Khasbulatov] I only say that in his message to the chambers Boris Nikolayevich accepted 99 percent of the proposals which we made three years ago. He accepted our diplomacy and gave in to the extent that he reduced us to a satellite state. Suddenly we find ourselves once again a great power. In Russia, if Yeltsin's supporters want to, they can start a new civil war, like the one in October which had a death toll of 1,500 and not the 150 which the government maintains. Must we perhaps forget everything? This is fascism, and the people have realized this.
