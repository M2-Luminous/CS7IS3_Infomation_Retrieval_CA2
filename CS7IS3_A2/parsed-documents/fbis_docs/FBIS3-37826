We are in the office of the president of the Republic of Moldova, Mircea Snegur, who was kind enough to receive us for an interview intended for the Actualitati [Current Events] program of Radio Romania. Mr. President, this is the third time you honor me by personally granting me an interview. I recall that on 28 July 1991 you gave me the first. Please, allow me to quote a passage from the end of that interview: To the listeners of Radio Romania, whom I esteem very much, today, on the 28th of July 1991, I would like to again wish you much health, happiness, and success. Let us remember that we are relatives, we have common roots. Let us hope that, by the joint actions we are undertaking with the Romanian party, our history will reach a peak in our development. Success, good luck, happiness, and let us cultivate our kinship. I conclude the quote. A long period of time has elapsed since then. Would you be so kind and continue the idea you expressed then and anchor it to the current moment? [Snegur] Of course, a great deal of time has elapsed since that moment, but in principle, in that context, my way of thinking has not changed, and if you remember, during our recent [5 February] congress titled "Our Home, the Republic of Moldova" the same things were reiterated related to our history and descent, as well as the need to maintain our ties and to cultivate our kinship, as I said at that time. Thus, in principle, the main idea calling for us to cultivate our ties as relatives remains valid. However, I can also see the reason behind your question referring especially to that issue, and that is, I believe, the anti-Snegur campaign launched in the Romanian press following the aforementioned congress, Our Home, the Republic of Moldova. In connection with this I would like to point out that our policy is a sensible one in all domains, and it is being permanently adapted to the reality in the Republic of Moldova and to the people's wish to strengthen the state character of our country, to develop as an independent state, and to preserve our territorial integrity. At the same time, within the very same policy, the principal directions regarding the spiritual and economic integration of the Republic of Moldova with Romania have remained unaltered. [Preda] I would like to ask you a question regarding the Ilascu case. What is your current assessment of that case? [Snegur] Related to the Ilascu case I would like to say that I prefer to act, rather than talk about it, so that my intentions and hopes are still the same, namely that we will manage to transfer those political prisoners to the constitutional juridical bodies of the Republic of Moldova. We have taken measures to that end, and we have also asked for the support of those who can influence the mentality of the Tiraspol secessionist leaders. To that purpose I do not find it embarrassing and I do not try to avoid to meet and engage in dialogues, regardless of whether they are direct ones or not, with the Tiraspol authorities. As a matter of fact, yesterday a number of [Moldovan] officials held talks there on the holding of the [27 February] general elections in that region as well, and on the need to maintain our economic and other ties. During those talks, they again approached that issue [the Ilascu case]. As a result of our efforts, the Dniester leaders, Grigore Maracuta, for instance, made a number of declarations stating that they would revise the [death] sentence and adopt different decisions. I optimistically assess that the problem will be solved in the end. [Preda] Recently the inter-ministerial commission met in Bucharest. I understand that both Bucharest and Chisinau assess its activity positively. What are your views regarding our bilateral cooperation? [Snegur] I consider that our prospects are very good, because if one draws a balance of our ties and our actions undertaken last year, in 1993, one can see that a number of new measures and concrete directions were decided upon to enhance our bilateral, mutually advantageous economic cooperation. I am pleased to mention that, during the meeting, you mentioned they did not talk about politics, but rather about the concrete problems that ought to be solved by the inter-ministerial commission. This is a thing that encourages us in a certain way. We maintain our former position, namely that the establishment of concrete ties between our companies ought to be boosted and speeded up, and the commission is able to set up a certain framework promoting such ties. I was briefed on the meeting thanks to you -- as you carried ample reports both on radio and television -- but, of course I was also briefed here, at home, by the head of our delegation, and I found that their meeting was a positive and encouraging one. [Preda] Mr. President, the inter-ministerial meeting established a kind of a schedule with respect to various contacts. According to that schedule, this year the prime ministers are to meet twice, plus the two meetings of the inter-ministerial commission. This means that a meeting will take place in each quarter. Do you expect other meetings as well, perhaps at an even higher level? [Snegur] In my opinion, the good understanding between us and our ties make it possible for us to meet at any time. It is true that the meetings we held over the past years had been planned and the agendas had been worked out well in advance, but whenever problems arise, Mr. President Ion Iliescu and I contact each other over the telephone and if we decide to see each other we meet and discuss those problems. Lately the issue of holding a meeting did not occur to us, but I think that a meeting at the highest level cannot be excluded. [Preda] I would like to thank you very much and, in conclusion, perhaps you would like to address a few words to our listeners in Romania. [Snegur] All right, I will do that. All I can say is that next time we will [words indistinct] such good wishes. This is welcome because a certain continuity is needed, but please believe me that I am making efforts to promote a consequent policy. My best wishes to the radio listeners. May this year bring rain and peace. I wish that in Romania work will continue to further the economic reform. Thus Romania would advance a little bit in the promotion of the reforms. Thus we will also have the possibility to examine and turn to good account the good things they do, but also learn from certain mistakes that are made. We admire and watch with satisfaction the democratization processes in Romania and, as a result of this, you will be witnessing multiparty elections [on 27 February]. [passage indistinct] I hope that this will be a fruitful year in results and that the harvest will be good, which will raise the standard of living of the population. I wish you much health and happiness. [Preda] Thank you.
