FR940202-0-00025 FR940202-0-00005 Unspecified Method Applied Paragraph (d)(3) provides that an adjustment will be excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment if the taxpayer satisfies the unspecified method requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) and the documentation requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(iii). The unspecified method requirement is met if a method other than a specified method was applied and the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) (B) or (C) are met, as appropriate. Paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) provides that if the transaction is of a type for which there are specified methods, then a taxpayer will be considered to have met the unspecified method requirement if the taxpayer reasonably concludes that, given the available data, none of the specified methods was likely to provide an accurate measure of an arm's length result, and that it selected and applied an unspecified method in a way that would likely provide an accurate measure of an arm's length result, given the available data. Paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(C) provides that if the transaction is of a type for which there are no specified methods, then a taxpayer will be considered to have met the unspecified method requirement if it selected and applied an unspecified method in a reasonable manner. A taxpayer's selection and application is reasonable if the taxpayer reasonably concludes that the method (and its application of that method) provided the most accurate measure of an arm's length result under the principles of the best method rule in ยง1.482&hyph;T(b)(2)(iii). Documentation Requirement An examiner cannot effectively examine a taxpayer's transfer pricing without adequate documentation setting forth the basic transfer pricing analysis conducted by the taxpayer. Accordingly, the documentation requirement does not provide a long, rigid list of documents that must be maintained; rather it focuses on the type of information necessary to evaluate how the taxpayer determined its transfer prices. The documentation requirements are essentially the same regardless of whether the taxpayer uses a specified method or an unspecified method. They diverge only in what the documentation must establish rather than the type of information that must be maintained. A taxpayer that uses a specified method must maintain sufficient documentation (that is in existence when the return is filed) to establish that it met the specified method requirement. A taxpayer that uses an unspecified method must maintain sufficient documentation (that is in existence when the return is filed) to establish that it met the unspecified method requirement. Regardless of the method used by the taxpayer, it must provide that documentation to the IRS within 30 days of a request. The temporary regulations set forth two classifications of documentation_principal and background documents. Principal documents consist of the basic transfer pricing analysis conducted by the taxpayer. Background documents are documents that typically support the principal documents. Only principal documents must be provided upon the IRS's request for principal documents. However, both types of documentation must be produced within thirty days of a request. A district director has discretion to extend the period for producing principal documents only if the taxpayer has made a minor or inadvertent failure to provide the required documents, has otherwise made a good faith effort to comply, and remedies the failure when it becomes known. For background documents, a district director has discretion to extend the production period for a short period. Foreign-to-Foreign Transactions Finally, paragraph (d)(4) provides that adjustments that are attributable to a transaction between foreign corporations are also excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment, unless the treatment of that transaction affects the determination of U.S. source income or taxable income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Carryovers and Carrybacks The regulations contain a special rule concerning tax benefits, such as losses, deductions, or credits, that may be carried to another taxable year. If a taxpayer's substantial or gross valuation misstatement gives rise to such a tax benefit that is carried to another taxable year, then the penalty will be imposed on any resulting underpayment of tax attributable to such a tax benefit in that other taxable year. In determining whether there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement for a taxable year, no amount carried from another taxable year shall be included. Coordination Rules The coordination rules remain substantively unchanged from the proposed regulations issued on January 21, 1993. These regulations provide rules for coordinating imposition of the transactional penalty and the net adjustment penalty. Advance Pricing Agreements If a transfer pricing methodology is developed and applied pursuant to an Advance Pricing Agreement in any tax year, that methodology may reasonably be relied upon in the current year if the relevant facts and circumstances have not changed or if the methodology has been appropriately modified to reflect any changes in facts and circumstances. Effective Date These regulations apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993. For taxable years ending after November 5, 1990, but beginning prior to January 1, 1994, the Treasury Department considers the proposed regulations issued on January 21, 1993, to be a reasonable interpretation of sections 6662 (e) and (h), except that no requirement of contemporaneous documentation may be imposed for transactions prior to April 21, 1993. In any case, contemporaneous documentation may be helpful in establishing that the taxpayer had reasonable cause and acted in good faith. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, an initial Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these temporary regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Thomas L. Ralph of the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (International), Internal Revenue Service. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1 Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
