In his opinion the visit discredits Clinton because "Russians are going to see he has come to support a team of bankers -- the Gaydar government." In Tuesday interview with INTERFAX Zhirinovskiy called the refusal of the American president to meet him a mistake. At the same time Zhirinovskiy is grateful for the refusal because this "gave credit to the leader of Liberal Democrats and added votes." "Russians know that all this disarray was organized from the West, it was mostly Americans who helped our Democratic Russia to undermine the country," Zhirinovskiy declared. This refusal "indicates that I am the only honest and clean politician because the person who helps to undermine the country does not want to meet me". A leading figure in the Communist group in the State Duma Victor Ilyukhin does not attach any hopes to the Clinton visit. "America has never wanted and will never want Russia to be a strong power, the main purpose of the United States is to split Russia and get free access to its energy resources", he told INTERFAX on Tuesday. Ilyukhin feels that lately Russia "has involuntarily stopped planning its home and foreign policies and has been living on hints from the United States." He attributed the coming visit to the need "to support the Russian president and government" after the December elections that demonstrated, in his opinion, that "the situation has notably changed to the disadvantage of the ruling regime." A leading figure in another parliamentary group Grigoriy Yavlinskiy does not expect anything special and thinks the visit will be simply a pleasant exchange of opinions between the two presidents. Neither does the leader of the Democratic Party Nikolay Travkin believe that the United States can help Russia in any way. If Russia were recognized as an equal partner in politics and economy, this would help Russia best. "We do not need any tips," Travkin thinks. A member of the presidential council Andranik Migranian has told journalists that President Clinton is going to make a mistake if he selects the participants for his meeting with the leaders of political parties and groups. If Clinton simply refuses to meet Zhirinovskiy, the advisor does not see a great problem in that. However, if he refuses to meet other opposition groups too, this will give the opposition another pretext to criticize democratic parties for their excessively close ties with the United States.
