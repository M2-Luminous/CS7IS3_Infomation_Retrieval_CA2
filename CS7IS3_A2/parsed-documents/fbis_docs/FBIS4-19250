"It is a shame that the Labor Party (PvdA) wants too few savings, because by acting in such a way, it is setting back employment in advance," he said. The prime minister also believes that the PvdA is hindering the necessary reform of social security. "All political parties see the need to tackle the Pensions Act and Health Law. Moreover, it is mentioned in the conclusions of the parliamentary committee of inquiry that looked into the question of social security. Only the PvdA is refusing to go along with this." Yesterday evening, Lubbers said he was extremely concerned about the developments in the PvdA: "We must avoid abandoning the steady course steered in recent years and taking a turn to the left. Doing so would mean wiping out the good results of all our achievements over the past few years." Yesterday, the PvdA did not respond to Lubbers' criticism. The prime minister was noticeably friendly toward D66 [Democrats 66]. He believes that the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] has "most in common" with that party in the area of socioeconomic policy. The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] could also count on glowing words from Lubbers. The VVD election platform contains "many good elements," he said, even if making a 10 percent reduction in social benefits is taking things too far in his opinion. It is also notable that one of Lubbers's party colleagues, Foreign Minister Peter Hendrik Kooijmans, is much more positive about the PvdA and its leading candidate Wim Kok. This week in VRIJ NEDERLAND, Kooijmans says that the CDA must recognize that after the elections the PvdA will be the largest party, with Kok becoming prime minister. The minister believes that his party should not hesitate to join a cabinet that is under the leadership of a PvdA prime minister.
