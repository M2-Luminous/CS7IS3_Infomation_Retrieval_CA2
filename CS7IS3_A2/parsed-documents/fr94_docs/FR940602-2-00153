FR940602-2-00153 FR940602-2-00094 The policy adopted August 16, 1988, was issued as direction to Forest Service personnel through amendments and interim directives to Forest Service Manual (FSM) chapters 2340 and 2720 and Forest Service Handbook (FSH) 2709.11_Special Uses Handbook. On June 1, 1989, at 54 FR 23499, the Forest Service gave notice that the direction in FSM 2340 and 2720 was to be revised, that the remaining portions of the policy were designated as interim policy in compliance with the Assistant Secretary's decision, and removed those provisions stayed by the Assistant Secretary. On September 20, 1989, in response to the Assistant Secretary's decision, the Forest Service gave notice that it was seeking comments on an Advance Notice of Proposed Policy (54 FR 38700). A 60-day comment period was provided which was extended an additional 60 days, expiring on January 19, 1990. In this notice, the agency offered alternative approaches to those portions of the policy stayed by the Assistant Secretary's decision and asked for public advice and comment on those provisions and on the options that the agency identified to replace the current policy provisions. The public comment received on the September 20, 1989, notice was considered in the development of a proposed reformulated policy published on October 10, 1991 (56 FR 51260). A 90-day comment period was provided for this notice which was extended an additional 60 days to March 9, 1992. This proposed policy also provided appropriate clarifying and explanatory material for those parts of the 1988 policy shown as areas of concern in the Assistant Secretary's decision. Analysis and Response to Public Comments The Forest Service received 7,793 comments on the October 10, 1991, notice of proposed policy. The analysis of the public comments was accomplished using standard Forest Service procedures designed to ensure an objective and systematic analysis. Information was tabulated electronically. The number and percentage of responses by category of respondents (as identified by the respondent) is as follows: ‚ê£ 1Respondent type 1Number 1Percentage Permittee 4,656 60 Friend or Family of Permittee 996 12 Permittee Association 47 1 Other Organization 3 (1) Interested Party, Not a Permittee 2,084 26 Forest Service Personnel 7 (1) n,s Total 7,793 100 1Less than 1 percent. Comments were received from 45 States, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. Over 50 percent of the responses came from California which contains about 40 percent of all recreation residences. There were 312 comments received after the closing date of the notice and not considered in the analysis of comments. Respondents comments were sorted according to the proposed policy provisions identified in the comment. They were further identified as: (1) Agreeing with the provision, (2) agreeing with the provision but with a contingency (comment), (3) disagreeing with the provision, and (4) disagreeing with the provision but with a contingency. Of the 7,793 responses received, 6,264 (80 percent) were in the form of questionnaires developed and distributed by 2 national permittee associations. The questionnaires presented several general statements describing a premise or belief of what the content of the revised policy should be to which the respondent could either agree or disagree. For example, question 1 of the National Forest Homeowners questionnaire stated ``I strongly support the policy provision that says recreation residences are a valid and important recreation use, and that it is Forest Service policy to continue them. Please leave this provision unchanged.'' The fourth question of the National Inholders Association questionnaire stated ``Removal of recreation residences will cause emotional pain and disruption for forest permittees and their families. It will cause waste of resources. For that reason, the proposed policy of allowing removal of existing recreation residences where there is no higher use (FSM 2721.23e) is arbitrary and wasteful.'' The questionnaire responses were analyzed and the general views of the respondents considered during preparation of this final revised policy. These views were helpful in identifying issues of concern to permittees.
