Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, has said: "I would like to point out that Yasir 'Arafat sent (Fatah Central Committee member) 'Abbas Zaki to meet with Hamas officials. And that Zaki conveyed to Muhammad Nazzal (Hamas representative in Amman) 'Arafat's offer to grant Hamas four seats only." But according to Ghawshah, the offer was completely rejected, "because we refuse to participate in the authority, proceeding from our rejection of the self-rule agreements, as they perpetuate the occupation of Arab territory in Palestine."
