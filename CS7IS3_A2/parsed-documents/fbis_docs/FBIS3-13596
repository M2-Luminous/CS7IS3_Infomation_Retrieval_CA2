[Al-Bid] Thank you and greetings to you and the entire Arab world. [Al-Jundi] Let us begin this dialogue with developments in Yemen. We will start with the ongoing efforts to contain the Yemeni crisis and consolidate Yemen's unity. You recently visited Egypt and several fraternal Arab states. President 'Ali Salih also came to Egypt. The Yemeni president and the vice president are constantly in touch with President Mubarak. Could you tell us about the effect of the current Egyptian efforts to contain the Yemeni crisis? [Al-Bid] Our contacts with Egypt fall within the context of the historic ties linking the Egyptian and Yemeni people. It is no surprise that Egypt shows an interest in Arab affairs, particularly in Yemen. It has been Egypt's custom to stand with us in the most difficult circumstances. When we run into difficulties, the first one we turn to is Egypt and its great people. Our contacts with brother Husni Mubarak have been fruitful. There was interest in the issue and we exchanged views on the Yemeni, Arab, and Islamic issues. The current circumstances in Yemen, where the unity march is stumbling, naturally necessitate the holding of contacts with the Arab brothers, chief among them Arab Egypt, along with our brothers in Jordan, Oman, the Arab League, and all the people who love good. We believe the contacts are necessary because the issue of Yemen's unity deserves attention, since it is closely connected with our Arab system and our unionist and democratic goal, God willing. [Al-Jundi] Following the signing of the Document of Pledge and Agreement in Amman a few weeks ago, there was a sense of optimism that the Yemeni crisis could be resolved. But the ceremony was followed by clashes between military units from the country's north and south. You returned to the commercial capital, Aden, and the crisis continued. [Al-Bid] We believe the solution lies in the Document of Pledge and Agreement, which is a national document that gained national consensus and provided ways out of this crisis. Immediately after the document was signed, we should have started the implementation and executive measures. But there are people who do not want this. The events of 21 February, a few hours after the document was signed in Amman, and events of 26 and 27 February are the product of those who reject the document and the Arab consensus. These people do not want stability for Yemen or the region. But there is a popular, peaceful, and democratic movement that demands the implementation of this document. We will side with this movement and with the democratic and peaceful struggle to put the document into effect, God willing. [Al-Jundi] Some officials in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] have proposed a federation in Yemen, which prompted many observers to accuse the YSP of seeking secession and separation. [Al-Bid] We hear many such remarks and rumors. In the circumstances and in view of the people's interest and haste, some like to make several statements. The drive for unity is stumbling mainly due to our failure to establish a state of unity, a state of law and order and institutions. There are numerous interpretations in this regard and they all seek a solution to the main topic, namely, the state of unity. The problem is not about unity, but about the state of the unity, the mechanism applied in this state, and the definition of the state. It is about whether it will be a simple or compound state and whether it will be a state that accommodates the changes created by unity, the democratic system, and the peaceful and democratic struggle and that makes room for competition and variation in views in several areas in Yemen. So this is the difficult situation we are trying to remedy. I believe the Document of Pledge and Agreement has touched on this issue. This document sought to build a modern state in Yemen. Thus, the discussion on the state of unity is a good thing and is needed, I believe. We must not hesitate to listen to every view. These views produced the document that we all signed, which dealt with the state of unity. It gives a new shape to the state of unity and represents a new social contract in the state of unity. So the faltering march of unity is due to the absence of the state of unity. We should not fear discussion of such topics; we should allow dialogue to take place and listen to all the views as long as the intention is to build the state of unity and find the mechanism that could make room for its progress. [Al-Jundi] Is the situation after the signing of the Amman document much different from what it was before it was signed, at least practically speaking? [Al-Bid] It is fraught with tension, which is what we expected, because there is a refusal to implement the document. We expected that some would be unable to honor the agreement, particularly with regard to the first clause, namely, the need to adopt measures against outlaws and the perpetrators of terrorism, bombings, assassinations, and every act that disturbs security and stability in Yemen. This clause is the stumbling bloc. Another clause is the need to provide security and constitutional guarantees for the implementation of the document. So this situation is the reason for the tension. Some people are reluctant to implement the agreement. They do not want to be exposed to the public, whose opinion is natural, of course. I expect the dialogue committee, the public here, all the peaceloving people, and the majority of the people who are committed to the implementation of the document to proceed with it, God willing, and we will overcome the difficulties. Narrowing the alternatives for those who are tampering with the situation will place them in a position to accept the implementation of the document. We have no choice but to proceed with its implementation. The current circumstances are the result of the refusal by some people and commitment by others to implement the document. We welcome every effort at home and abroad and all the efforts exerted by the Arab brothers. I believe Yemen will be fine as long as there are people at home and abroad who take an interest in it and show concern for it. God willing, things will be fine. [Al-Jundi] Thank you very much. [Al-Bid] Thank you.
