The newspaper SALAM made the point that 'Abdi has served 10 months of his sentence and only four months remain, and that taking a 10-million-tuman bond to free him is not appropriate for the remaining time. It regarded this as a violation of judicial procedure. During the month of Dey [22 December 1993-20 January 1994], concurrent with the issuance of the sentence punishing 'Abdi and the press discussions concerning the nature of his crime, the deputy minister of guidance for press affairs said: The charges against 'Abbas 'Abdi are not press related.
