In the first stage of the discussions, the PD(FSN) will be represented at the talks by the Internal Political Relations Department. Another communique of the same political grouping refers to the statements made on 5 February by Mr. Mircea Snegur, president of the Republic of Moldova, and Mr. Dimitru Motpan, leader of the Agrarian Democratic Party [PDAM] of the Republic of Moldova. The PD(FSN) Executive Bureau considers that they are uncultured allegations with an electoral tinge, running counter to the historic truth and to the interests of the Romanians living between the Prut and Dniester Rivers. Regarding the proposal that the parties advocating the unification with Romania should be excluded from the political life, the PD(FSN) considers it as an antidemocratic gesture, at variance with the course toward democracy and pluralism assumed by the Chisinau authorities before their own people and the European democratic institutions. The PD(FSN), the communique points out, is deeply involved and committed to achieving closer ties between Romania and the Republic of Moldova.
