Answering the opposition's emergency question in the Lords shortly after a second attack, Foreign Office Minister of State Baroness Chalker described the action as "prompt and appropriate." She said: "We hope that all parties will draw appropriate lessons from the use of air power and that attacks on the safe areas will now cease." Lady Chalker acknowledged that Britain had not been consulted before yesterday's air strike against the Bosnian Serb forces by NATO war planes, but stressed that the government would not have expected to have been. She said authority for "close air support" was delegated by the UN secretary general to his special representatives and by NATO to relevant military commanders. Humanitarian convoys crossing Bosnian Serb areas and some aid flights into Sarajevo had been temporarily suspended, she told peers. "We hope they will be able to resume shortly and the considerable progress made over the last few months will continue." In her statement, Lady Chalker told peers that the government had only just received reports of the second NATO attack and had no further information available at present. "The action taken yesterday by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and NATO has our full support," she said. "The decision was taken in accordance with normal UN and Nato procedures. UNPROFOR is neutral and not a party to the conflict but has the right of self defence. On this occasion the risk to UNPROFOR personnel was thought by UNPROFOR commanders to warrant a request to Nato for air support. I'm sure the House will welcome the prompt and appropriate action taken by NATO in support of UN personnel and with the full support of both organisations. We hope the parties will be able to agree to a global cessation of hostilities in Bosnia as a first step to an overall political settlement." Lord Richard, Labour leader in the Lords, said if it was true Bosnian Serb forces were endangering UN forces and civilian personnel it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Serbs had "brought this on themselves." He asked: "What steps are being taken to protect UNPROFOR forces and particularly British troops against the possibility of retaliation?" He also asked what had been the response of the Russian Government to the air strikes. Lady Chalker said: "We have heard that President Yeltsin has stated his concern that Russia wasn't consulted before yesterday's incident. The authority for close air support was delegated by the UN secretary general to his special representatives and by NATO to relevant military commanders. The UK Government wasn't consulted. We didn't expect to be consulted and we were not aware that any other NATO ally was being consulted -- so there was no reason why the Russian Government should have been consulted." On the possibility of Serb retaliation, the minister warned: "If there is retaliation we might need to retaliate with close air support in the future." But she stressed that such action would only be taken after careful consideration and if it was fully justified. For the Liberal Democrats, Lord Bonham-Carter said it might have been wise to have consulted the Russians before carrying out the bombing. He stressed: "It is extremely important that we do everything in our power to keep the Russians in step." Lady Chalker told him that authority had been given to the UN secretary general. No nation should be "seeking to second guess" the issue, she added. Former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Merlyn-Rees asked if the minister thought the action would be sufficient to deter the Serbs. Lady Chalker replied: "I sincerely hope that the Serb authorities will see that NATO and the UN mean business." She said the chance for peace had been going well until it was "quite clearly" broken by the Serbian advance on Friday: "That advance has to be stopped." Tory former Lord Chancellor Lord Hailsham asked if yesterday's attack had been effective. Lady Chalker said: "I cannot give you the exact detail. From general reporting that I have heard on the radio, it does seem that the strikes went home to stop a communication centre." Labour's Lord Stoddart of Swindon urged her to comment on reports that UNPROFOR observers in Gorazde included an SAS [Special Air Service] member who had directed fire onto Serb positions. But she told him: "It is long-standing policy not to comment on special forces matters. Beyond that I can make no further comment today." Tory the Earl of Onslow asked: "What happens if the Serbs are not deterred?" Lady Chalker insisted the Serbs had been deterred: "They were certainly deterred as far as Sarejevo was concerned."
