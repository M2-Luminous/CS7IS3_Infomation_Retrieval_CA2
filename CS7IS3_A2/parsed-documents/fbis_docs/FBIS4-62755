The Russian Government has had to stop the issue of state guarantees to the Western creditors who fund joint projects in Russia, Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, who is also economics minister, announced at a press conference today. The vice premier stressed that enterprises wishing to obtain centralised credits, including from the package of Western financial assistance to Russian market reforms will from now on have to decide what property -- land, buildings or securities -- they can mortgage in case their project turns out to be loss-making. As concerns the insolvent debtors, under whose obligations the Russian Government now has to pay in accordance with the country's foreign commitments, the Cabinet of Ministers is now working on a scheme of making them pay federal authorities, including through the court of arbitration, Shokhin said.
