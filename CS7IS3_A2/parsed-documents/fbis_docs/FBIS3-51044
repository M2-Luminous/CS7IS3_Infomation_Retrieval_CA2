They are the so-called Parliamentary and Provincial factions. The latter has taken the lead and already won recognition from Chamber President Alberto Pierri. The third force is the key to making up a quorum and passing any complex law when Peronists and Radicals cannot agree. Maneuvering on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies has recently risen in intensity, but it is now taking place between elements that are not part of the majority blocs (the PJ [Justicialist Party] and UCR [Radical Civic Union). The internal struggle involves lawmakers of a different stripe belonging to the so-called Provincial and Parliamentary groups. Both factions naturally lay claim to the banner of the "third force," a banner which, whether real or imaginary, may be of some bargaining value or when it comes time for give-and-take. Such an occasion will present itself whenever there are unresolvable differences between Justicialists and Radicals. The Provincial Group has taken the lead and was clearly recognized by the government when all of its members went as a nice little group to talk--over lunch--with Minister of Interior Carlos Ruckauf. The ministry dining room played host to 12 lawmakers with a mandate from parties that generally have complete control of their respective provincial governments. Together they represent the interests of the People's Movements of Neuquen, Tierra del Fuego, and Jujuy, joined by the Salta Renewal Party, the Chaco Action Party, and the Bloquista Party of San Juan. Furthermore, the Provincial Group already has officers, who were introduced to Chamber of Deputies President Alberto Pierri. They are: Jorge Folloni (Renewal Party), Enrique Sanchez Galdeano (Tierra del Fuego), and Carlos Gomez Centurion. The Parliamentary Group includes deputies from the Progressive Democratic Party, the Liberal Party of Corrientes, the Autonomist Party, the Democratic Party of Mendoza, the San Juan Renewal Crusade Party, the Republican Force of Tucuman, and the Integration and Development and Jujuy People's Movements. Are the people of Jujuy putting their eggs in both baskets? Indeed they are, in this case because the two deputies belonging to the bloc are engaged in a petty quarrel with no solution in sight: Cristina Guzman vs Pedro Figueroa, the latter preferring to align himself with the Provincial Group. The Parliamentary Group says the UCD deputies are all united. At least they claim that Alvaro Alsogaray, German Kammerath Gordillo, and Jose Maria Ibarbia have more or less given their word. They look askance at Francisco de Duranona y Vedia, however, labeling him--no value judgment intended--as a true Menemist lawyer. At one time, they were all part of the Center Interbloc. Actually, the Interbloc never got any further than good intentions because, when it came time to vote in the Chamber, each one heeded his own interests, which were often political! For example, Renewer Folloni maintains that he came to the Provincial Group naturally: "The Interbloc never developed any united action." More specifically, he recalls that those now aligning themselves with the other band hobbled government proposals, as in the case of laws privatizing the YPF [Government Oil Deposits], the State Gas Company, and social security reform. Pierri has recognized the Provincial Group as the third force. At least this is the general impression left by the last two sessions, during which its representatives spoke third, following the Peronists and the Radicals. It should be noted, however, that they reject the idea of making up a true bloc. No matter how the lead has changed hands, the Parliamentary Group has not stood idly by. Authorized spokesmen say its members are well organized and that "things are going quite well." They also claim to be willing to act independently of the Radicals and Peronists in the Chamber, adding that the one thing they have in common is their agreement on the government's program. Emerging as standard-bearers of the group are Ricardo Leconte (Liberal from Corrientes) and Progressive Democrat Alberto Natale. Commenting on the Provincial maneuvering, members of the opposing faction could not resist: "They thought we would not be able to respond. The Provincial Group thought they would have a majority, but it took only a weekend to fix everything." Actually, it will take a few--but not many--more sessions to see how it all turns out in the movie about those who are trying to take advantage of the differences between Justicialists and Radicals. In the meantime, the two sides will continue to eye one another with distrust. [Box, p 11] A Matter of Numbers The two factions fighting over the title of "third force" in the Chamber of Deputies are well aware that the "weakness" of the Justicialists resides precisely in the fact that they do not have the quorum they need to force their political position on the Chamber with ease. The members of the Provincial and Parliamentary factions base their hopes on the fact that, when the time comes, the Justicialists will be forced to seek their support when the Radicals and other parties resist passage of a proposal dear to the ruling party. The Justicialist Party has 128 deputies of its own, one less than a quorum and the majority needed to get a law passed. However, in practice, the justifiable absences and inexcusable cuts of deputies mean that the number drops to unacceptable levels. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Balance of Power | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |PJ |128 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |UCR |81 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Provincial Group* |12 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Parliamentary Group* |17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Others** |19 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Quorum |129 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |* Both groups were part of the so-called Interbloc. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |** Includes the Broad Front, Socialist Unity, MODIN [Movement for Dignity an-| |d Independence], and the Intransigent Party. | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
