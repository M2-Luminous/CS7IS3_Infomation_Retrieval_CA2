[passage omitted] Good morning, Dr. Gaviria Diaz. [Gaviria Diaz] Good morning, Dario. [Arizmendi] What do you think of the controversy unleashed in the country and the witch hunt that has apparently begun against certain members of the Constitutional Court? This witch hunt is apparently against the judges who studied two articles of the law having to do with lifting penalties on the consumption of personal doses of certain types of drugs? [Gaviria Diaz] Dario, you have clearly said that it is a true witch hunt. Actually, the most unfortunate thing about this is the fact that the mass of opinion is entirely emotional; that is, it does not really understand the scope of the ruling or is not even familiar with the ruling. Actually, this mass of opinion is jeopardizing the Constitutional Court, specifically the judges who approved lifting penalties. It makes us targets of very emotional reaction from the most fanatical groups. It is surprising that this type of reaction was begun by the president of the Republic and that the candidates -- particularly those who have the best options for winning the Presidency of the Republic -- are emulating this radical prohibition in order to curry public favor. Thus, I am very surprised about this reaction, but not because I did not think such an important ruling would entail challengers in the country. I am surprised by the sources of these challenges and what they are doing. They are encouraging the most destructive, emotional, fanatical, and dangerous reactions. [Arizmendi] Dr. Gaviria Diaz, in addition to the issues broached by the president of the Republic and by some candidates, the most outstanding aspect just a few hours following the announcement of the Constitutional Court's ruling was the statements made by some judges who voted against the ruling. They openly criticized the ruling, and they even encouraged the public to do so. [Gaviria Diaz] I do not want to adopt the same attitude they did. I deeply respect their points of view, which are different from ours, because everyone is entitled to his own opinion. However, I do regret they do not have that feeling of cohesion with the court. The rules of the game were observed, and once the ruling is approved the ruling belongs to the entire court and not just to some justices. [Arizmendi] Dr. Gaviria Diaz, when will the entire ruling be announced? [Gaviria Diaz] The entire ruling will be announced next week, when Court President Jorge Arango returns from President Mandela's inauguration. [Arizmendi] As far as you know -- because you are the author of the proposal -- will this ruling take into consideration certain restrictions as the president of the Republic respectfully suggested when he delivered a radio message before knowing the full text of the ruling? [Gaviria Diaz] There is a total lack of knowledge of what the mission of the court is, and I want to be very clear about this: People are acting as if the court had arbitrarily decided to lift penalties on drug consumption, as if we were acting as legislators, or deciding on something that simply pleased us. That is not the mission of the court. The mission of the court is to compare and decide if the contents of a law clash or not with the Constitution. In the event the court determines these contents clash with the Constitution, then the court is obliged to withdraw it, regardless of national or international reaction. In the second place, it is being said that now children and pregnant women are going to be using drugs, that drugs will be used in schools, and so forth. Dario, it is legal to drink liquor in Colombia, but I ask you: Is liquor being consumed in the schools? It is legal to smoke tobacco in Colombia, but are people smoking in church? With this, I am clearly saying that the court does not have to go into these details. The ruling simply makes general statements to this effect, but police regulations and other institutional regulations will restrict and control the consumption of drugs, just as it is does with the consumption of alcohol and tobacco.
