During his two-day stay in the Irish capital, the Iranian minister is scheduled to hold talks with Ireland's President Mary Robinson, Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, Foreign Minister Dick Spring, and various other senior officials in a hectic timetable. The joint commission was first established in April 1992, during a visit by the then Irish foreign minister, David Andrews, when a memorandum of understanding for political and economic cooperation was signed by the two countries. In April last year, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Euro-American Affairs Mahmud Va'ezi paved the way for the holding of the second commission, which was original scheduled for November but delayed until this month. Velayati's visit is expected to culminate in the inking of a further cooperation agreement, in such areas as electronics, computer technology, scientific and cultural exchanges, in which Ireland has already expressed its interest.
