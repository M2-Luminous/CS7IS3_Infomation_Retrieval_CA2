"Our patience is at an end," the cossacks stated, protesting at what in their opinion is the planned settlement of Kuban by Caucasians. "And we resolutely inform you that to avoid an ethnic explosion in our rayons you must take urgent steps to expel those who, having arrived in Kuban, are stirring up trouble, sowing interethnic hostility, and making the Kuban people hostage.... Unless you take resolute steps we retain the right to raise the people to a public tribunal against the Caucasians who are violating our traditions and customs."
