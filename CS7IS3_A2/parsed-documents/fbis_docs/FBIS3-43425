Arab Shuwas and Kotokos are once again at loggerheads. According to various estimates, the death toll runs from 20 to 50. Jean Mater Ndi has more details. [Begin Ndi recording] Between 23 and 24 December, a Kotoko was killed by an Arab Shuwa in the Makere District in the extreme north of the country. In retaliation, Kotokos decided to exact revenge on the night of 25 December; they went from mere words to action. The Arab Shuwa village of Sulfa was attacked and the two communities are now fighting with cold steel weapons, arrows, and rifles. Several people were killed or seriously wounded on both sides. As is usually the case in this region, the Arab Shuwa reacted swiftly. The day after the attack, 26 December, they attacked all Kotoko villages around the (Ndjamonou) District. This is the second day of terribly violent clashes between Arab Shuwa and Kotoko with some sources stating 20 dead and seriously wounded, while sources close to official circles say the death may be as high as 50. Last year, clashes took place between the two communities and led to scores of dead and injured. [end recording]
