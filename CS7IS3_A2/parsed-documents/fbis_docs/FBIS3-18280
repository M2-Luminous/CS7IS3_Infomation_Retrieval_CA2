And in advance Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is rejecting the possibility that the result in 1996 could be a new treaty. So said the prime minister yesterday at a conference arranged by the European Commission. "I seen one major problem that I would like to mention immediately. The time is not right to build new European castles in the air when it comes to relinquishing sovereignty. We must remember that the Maastricht treaty came into force on 1 November last year. We have scarcely become acquainted with the tools it contains as yet. There can be no point in our making changes six months later in our eagerness to achieve perfection. And, after all, the signal from the people of Europe is not great love of European institutions. People have to be able to come along with us," Nyrup Rasmussen said. He stressed that European cooperation will continue to be cooperation among nation-states and that the many words spoken must be seen in actions that the peoples of Europe can see in everyday life. In his speech to a number of invited politicians, business leaders, and civil servants, the prime minister outlined his vision of developments in the next 10-20 years. The United States will be alone in the role of superpower. Neither Russia, Japan, China, or Europe will be able to develop into great powers in this period. Europe probably can develop into an economic superpower, but not a military superpower. Nyrup predicted major problems in maintaining viable cooperation among the EU countries once they have become 20 or more after the end of the century. "The task is impossible. But it will be done," he said. In his address EU Commissioner Henning Christophersen predicted that it will now be almost impossible to set up the third phase of economic and monetary union -- the common currency -- in 1996 as planned. A number of countries are striving to achieve this goal, but in particular the large public sector deficits in many countries will prevent a sufficient number of countries being able to meet the criteria for creating monetary union. It is therefore more realistic that EMU -- economic and monetary union -- will not come until 1999.
