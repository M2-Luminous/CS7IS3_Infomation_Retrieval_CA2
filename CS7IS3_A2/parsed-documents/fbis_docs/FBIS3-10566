The political-military command issued a communique, which was disseminated today in Huancayo, Junin's capital, saying that on 4 March an Army patrol, alerted by local inhabitants, captured a terrorist group in Ipoki, between the jungle settlements of Satipo and Chanchamayo. The communique says that an undetermined number of subversives escaped, although one of them was wounded by the military. The wounded subversive died while on his way to a hospital. The terrorist had in his possession two grenades and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) propaganda. This group has been practically disbanded by security forces. On 3 and 4 March police raided three residences in the area surrounding Huancayo, 315 km east of Lima, and seized a large number of weapons, explosives, two grenade boxes, diverse caliber ammunition, and military clothing. The residences allegedly served as arsenals and hideouts for Shining Path activists. The police source did not give details but added that several people were detained. According to private and public statistics disseminated today, terrorist activities are gradually decreasing in the country. The relative Shining Path and MRTA presence has been reduced to only three areas in the country in recent years. Both subversive organizations have been hard hit by security forces since 1992 and 95 percent of their leaders have been captured and sentenced to life in prison, including Shining Path's highest- ranking leader, Abimael Guzman, and MRTA top leader Victor Polay.
