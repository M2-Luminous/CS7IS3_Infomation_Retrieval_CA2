The central government provided 2.5 million tons of grain and 32,000 tons of edible oil from State reserves to ease the shortages in some provinces and cities, according to official sources. The local governments in Shaanxi, Shandong and Anhui provinces and Beijing also supplied more grain and oil to satisfy demand. Administrative measures were also applied by local authorities to stabilize grain prices. The Beijing municipal government imposed price ceilings on 27 staples, including rice, flour, edible oil and pork. Changzhou, in Jiangsu Province, set price guidelines for grain and oil. Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province in the northeast, is strengthening the monitoring of market prices and restricting the margin between wholesale and retail prices. The local government is also preparing to establish a price regulatory fund to limit price fluctuations on the market. Experts believe local governments must adopt administrative methods to keep prices from climbing further. However, they said the most effective means of intervening in the market are economic, including setting up regulatory funds and perfecting the grain reserve systems. The key factors in keeping prices stable are raising grain output and reforming the grain purchase and selling systems, they said. Since last November, the prices of grain, rice, edible oil, pork and eggs have risen sharply around the country. In coastal provinces and large cities, prices have skyrocketed by 30 to 40 percent. According to statistics from major cities, the price of a kilogram of high-quality rice soared by 1.1 yuan (12.6 cents) to 2 yuan (22.9 cents). Prices of flour and noodles and other rice products subsequently increased by 0.4 yuan (46 cents) [figure as published] to 0.6 yuan (69 cents) [figure as published] per kilogram. In large and medium-sized cities of Liaoning Province, the price of pork jumped by 20 to 50 percent. In Henan Province the pork price rose last month from 7.35 yuan ($0.84) per kilogram to 8.25 yuan ($0.95). Experts attributed the increases to anticipation of continued inflation, delays in deliveries caused by the persistent transportation bottleneck, and psychological and speculative factors. Through the joint efforts of central and local governments, the prices of grain and edible oil have been brought under control. For example, Jiangsu Province fixed the prices for grain and cooking oil and secured an adequate supply for the market. Just before the new year, more than 10 million kilograms of rice and flour and 2.5 million kilograms of cooking oil were released onto the market in Nanjing, the provincial capital.
