Kim's remarks came during a speech at the commencement ceremony for the Korea Air Force Academy's 42nd class in Chongwon, North Chungchong Province. The president said, "North Korea is in a difficult situation, diplomatically isolated from the rest of the world and suffering from economic poverty. North Koreans are moving their military power close to the front line, and their air power can pose a threat to us in only a couple of minutes." He asked the graduates not to fail in defending the South's air space. In modern warfare, advanced weapons decide victory or defeat very quickly, the president said. Unless the country boosts its technology to the level of advanced nations, it will not be able to win an economic or technological war or achieve a self-reliant military. "In this respect, our national defense system should be scientific and efficient," President Kim said. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Yi Yang-ho and Kim Hong-nae, the newly appointed Air Force chief of Staff, also attended the ceremony.
