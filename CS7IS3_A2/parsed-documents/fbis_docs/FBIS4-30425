The two sides discussed the agenda and date for the third round of high-level talks expected to be held in Geneva in early July. The results of the contact is yet to be known. However, a relevant official at the North Korean mission said that there were no particular difficulties in the contact, thus hinting that the high-level talks are likely to be held on 8 July, as requested by the North Korean side, and that the two sides reached an agreement on the agenda. In the third round of high-level talks, the United States and North Korea are expected to discuss extensively the issue on permanently freezing North Korea's nuclear development, including its full return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, its suspension of reprocessing nuclear fuel, and the acceptance of special [tukbyol] inspections. In addition, chances are high that they would discuss the issue concerning the establishment of diplomatic ties, including the replacement of light-water moderated reactors and economic aid. In the contact, Gary Seymour, director of the U.S. State Department, led the U.S. delegation while Han Song-yol, counselor at the North Korean mission to the United Nations, represented the North Korean side.
