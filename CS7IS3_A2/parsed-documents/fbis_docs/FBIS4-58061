FBIS4-58061 "drnes084_j_94017" FBIS-NES-94-084 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Wrapup of Reports on Country's Political `Crisis' Wrapup of Reports on Country's Political `Crisis' Bureau Issues Statement EA0105205494 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1900 GMT 30 Apr 94 EA0105205494 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Statement issued by the Yemeni Socialist Party Political Bureau; place and date not given] [Text] The political bureau has been following with great concern the insistence by influential military forces in Sanaa of continuing the military crime in 'Imran, and in all of Yemen, to escalate military tension. These influential forces, up to the issuance of this statement, continue to amass large forces to besiege and strike at the 3d Armored Brigade and heroic citizens from among the sons of the people of Jabal Iyal, Yazid, Iyal Sarih, Sufyan, Arhab, Bani Abd, and other honorable citizens. The 3d Armored Battalion moved to new positions in the Sanaa Governorate, and was subjected to barbarous and treacherous aggression by the 1st Armored Brigade, Republican Guard forces, and central security and tribal forces, which were transported to 'Imran from other areas a few hours before the military conflict, which was led by such warmongers as Humud Atif and Ali Hamid Qulaydan. These forces were not satisfied with imposing an intensive siege on the new positions to which the 3d Armored Brigade had moved, but prevented the passage of food and medical supplies, as well as the transport of the dead and wounded to the hospitals. Indeed, they went further in their violations of human rights and the genuine ideals and norms of our Yemen people by throwing the wounded into prison and subjecting them to torture. They were treated as if they were POW's from a foreign army -- not the sons of the same homeland. This irresponsible stance by the ruling military family reached its peak when it left the wounded to die on the battlefields. The military family provided aid only for certain wounded persons -- this is the expression of an abominable secessionist trend. More atrocious than this was that the representatives of the ruling military family supervised the dragging of the wounded as POW's to central security cells, where they were tortured while interrogated. This is a cheap game they play for the media, without any conscience or moral restraint. There is no doubt that giving orders to strike at the 3d Brigade was tantamount to a declaration of civil war, which was issued by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, frankly and clearly, on 27 April, prior to the military conflict in 'Imran. This was the same day that aggression was committed against the 3d Armored Brigade in 'Imran, as part of a military and political plan by the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Alliance for Reform, and the ruling military family. The aggression was committed two hours after the war declaration was delivered by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the secretary general of the General People's Congress. It is now clear that the plan is aimed at emptying the northern governorates of the brigades which moved there after the declared union of north and south Yemen, and at their bloody liquidation by dealing with them one at a time in a gradual manner. This has been done by contriving many different, flimsy justifications as a prelude to engagement in an overall war, a war planned by fundamentalist forces in the General People's Congress and the Yemeni Alliance for Reform, in addition to external fundamentalist forces, and with the support of the ruling military family in Sanaa. It is now confirmed that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is the one who is personally commanding this grave military action from the operations room. It is he who is issuing directives to pursue the 3d Brigade and liquidate it, after having given orders for striking and annihilating it. He has been leaking misleading information to the international news media about the annihilation of the 3d Brigade during the incident, to cover his pursuit of the heroes of the brigade as they moved to to new positions. It is he who is personally supervising ongoing preparations to strike the Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar, as well as the build-up of reinforcements around it, and the besieging of that brigade by Republican Guard and central security brigades, along with the assistance from battalions from the Majd Brigade, which was moved from Bajil in the Hudaydah Governorate. The 3d Brigade faced with rare heroism the atrocious conspiracy and the loathsome crime to which it was subjected. It managed to withdraw outside its camp after its stores and ammunitions, as well as a part of its forces, had been destroyed. Had President Ali Salih been a unionist and responsible for all the people, in accordance with the oath he took before the House of Deputies, in the name of God Almighty, to bear his responsibility with honesty -- had the president been so, it was in his power, while commanding and directing the battle personally, to work for the preservation of what was left of the 1st and 3d Brigades. However, he gave orders for the pursuit of the 3d Brigade, with the aim of annihilating it. He pushed two brigades from the Republican Guards and central security forces, under the command of his brothers, in addition to other warmongers such as Sheikh Humud Atif and Sheikh Ali Hamid Qulaydan, to pursue the brigade after it was cut off from food supplies, fuel and water. We appeal to public opinion; human rights organizations; the Yemeni, Arab and International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; and to all those with living human consciences to provide essential and urgent assistance to save the wounded, remove the dead, and stop the horrific actions to which the wounded are being subjected in the prisons of the ruling military family. This crime indicates that those who are managing and implementing this operation, bit by bit, do not care about sacrificing everyone to stay in power. This confirms what President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih said in Amman, that he was ready to wage war and sacrifice 30,000 soldiers to liquidate the YSP. What is being prepared and planned now must be regarded as part of a bloody and horrible venture, which is likely to inflict great harm on the unity of the homeland, its security, and stability. Indications of the start of the implementation of this reckless venture appeared in a political statement issued personally by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in a speech he delivered in the Sab'in ground on 27 April. It included attacks which were inappropriate from a head of state against a party which is his partner in power, and against opposition parties and the dialogue commission which [word indistinct] that great historical and national achievement reflected in the pledge and accord document. The president was not satisfied with that only, but was keen to include in his speech an open call to spark off a civil war, and issue a fatwa for a jihad, similar to the fatwas issued by heads of terrorist organizations to justify their acts of murder and assissinations. The speech called on every individual to make himself a judge, a prosecutor general, and the president of a court. This indicates a desire to undermine the constitutional and legal foundations of the unified state and open the door to anarchy, terrorism, and civil war as an excuse for secession. The YSP, as it is part of the masses of our people and its political parties and its vital forces, expresses its deep concern over the insistence of the ruling military family in Sanaa to spark off of a civil war in Yemen. It holds responsible those adventurist forces. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih must bear full and personal responsibility for what has happened, and continues to happen with regard to the shedding of the blood of the Yemeni Armed Forces and the threatening of the unity of the homeland, since orders were issued to part of the Yemeni Army to strike at another part of the same army. This is unethical and unpatriotic, and we cannot remain silent about it. It is difficult for the people to understand the legitimacy about which General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was talking. It is also difficult for all of us to understand the unity which they speak about so flippantly, while they direct their treacherous artillery against it. The statement, leaked to the news media by the ruling military family and its puppets concerning the pursuit of the commander of the 3d Armored Brigade, the heroic Colonel (Sayf al- Bakri) and the militant brother Yahya Dahis, is a disgraceful act indicating the bankruptcy of its authors. It is an attempt to get a cover for the justification of the massacres. The adventurers in Sanaa are planning to continue the attack on the 3d Armored Brigade at its new positions north of Sanaa. Those who issued these orders should be ashamed of themselves. The commander of the brigade, accused by the ruling family of having given orders to the 3d Brigade, was taking his lunch in a mess with members of the joint military commission in the presence of the U.S. and French military attaches and a number of officers of the brigade. Brother Yahya Dahis was not even present at the camp. The commander of the brigade was surprised by the explosion inside the camp, as was the joint military commission. We can say with all confidence that those who should be put on trial are the adventurers who issued orders to start the implementation of the extermination plan and above all the civil war. The criminal and engineer of terror, murder and assassination, is Col. Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, who began the implementation of the first phase of this war when he struck the unarmed 5th Brigade at Harf Sufyan. He then continued his war against the 3d Brigade. He may continue it in a different phase tomorrow and in a different place in the northern governorates and face units moving towards southern governorates. The attack against the 3d Brigade is a detestable crime which will not pass away easily and the insistence on besieging and pursuit of this brigade, aimed at annihilating it, will also not pass away easily. Because that means the launching of total civil war, whose responsibility and aftermath will rest on those adventurous secessionists. The spokesman stressed that true unity is the unity being manifested today in its various aspects, insofar as the heroes of the 3d Armored Brigade are joining together with hundreds of thousands of the heroes of the al-Sanadid tribe in the areas to which the brigade's positions have been moved, and where it was welcomed in a brotherly, nationalistic and unionist manner. Those heroes who are coming together today as one are the true unionists, while those adventurists implementing the plot to detonate civil war in Yemen [words indistinct] are the true secessionists.
