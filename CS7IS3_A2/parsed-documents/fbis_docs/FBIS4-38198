The conditions for building bridges with Israel do not include burning the bridges with what remains of the Arabs, in other words with Syria and Lebanon. The Jordanian king did not have to hang "hang" Arab linen from the roof of the White House roof, because this is one of Israel's jobs; it has never ceased to be so. Based on what has been said about his sobriety, awareness, reverence, and seriousness, he should not have fallen into that unambiguous Israeli trap. Israel laid this trap for him, first through the words of Shim'on Peres, who asked him to stop linking his stance with the Syrians, bearing in mind the king's involvement in the peace process, and, second, through the tenacious questions he was asked by Jewish journalists or by journalists filled with Israeli ideas. These journalists meant to cast doubt on the sincerity of his recent peaceful approach, perhaps to prompt him to adopt the sudden stance he did adopt. [passage omitted] No one knows the reason for this exciting royal emotion, which reached the point of asserting that Jordan's decision on peace with Israel was "an issue of sovereignty concerning Jordan itself, one with no connection or link with any move on any other track." Obviously it is an issue concerning Jordan. But throughout the area from the Ocean to the Gulf not one protest was staged. And no statement of denunciation was issued except by some of the "pan-Arab utopians" in Beirut. [passage omitted] Does Husayn's acquisition of sovereignty and recognition justify this kind of bitter reproach to the Syrians and Lebanese? Did the secret bills for obtaining sovereignty and recognition include slapping the faces of "the brothers" and receiving "flowers" from the enemies' hands? Have these bills set out a condition that Arabs be slapped as a prelude to hugging the Jews? There is no justification for that stance adopted by the king in the form of a free and nervy storm in the face of Damascus and Beirut claiming that there was someone trying to take him out of the Israelis' lap or take them out of his lap. In the era of "confrontation" the king knew how to maintain the royal lines of communication with the enemy. But now in this time, which lacks minimal levels of "steadfastness," there is no one who thinks of preventing Amman from competing against Jericho to come under the banner of the "Israeli empire." [passage omitted] Do the nervous royal revelations in Washington constitute a departure from a "deliberate plan" to perpetuate the spirit of division in the Arab ranks, even if one day they came under Israeli command? The next peaceful "delivery" will be in Washington this fall when King Husayn will drink from the same glass from which Anwar al-Sadat and Yasir 'Arafat drank before him. In the interim the Jordanians will encounter a very hard process and negotiations that will rebuild every piece of their minds and concepts, not least because the "sovereignty" they have gained should be in line with Israeli conditions. We say in advance: Spare us the dirty linen over the White House.
