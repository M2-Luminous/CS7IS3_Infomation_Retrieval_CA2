Raul Castro was accompanied by Commander of the Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque, Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del Toro, and other high-ranking FAR officers and representatives of the peoples and political organizations. In the morning, Raul and his delegation met Division Gen. Joaquin Quintas Sola at Central Army headquarters. The FAR minister and his delegation first laid a wreath in honor of the militia leaders who died in combat during the Bay of Pigs attack: [Begin Quintas recording] We are honored today with a visit to this Central Army territory, including parts of Matanzas and Villa Clara Provinces. [end recording] Yadira Garcia, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Matanzas, gave a briefing on the province's economic, political, and social situation. Garcia stressed key accomplishments and highlighted difficulties encountered in some economic activities and the efforts that are being made to move forward. Colonel Alberto Cabrera Valdez, second chief of staff of the province, gave a briefing on combat preparation and readiness, conservation of equipment and weapons, evaluating the defensive readiness and awareness of the population, and the development of the self-sufficiency program. Cabrera emphasized the work being carried out in Varadero, Limonar, and Cienaga Municipalities to attain the second-level defensive readiness condition. The evening was dedicated to visiting people's tunnels, caves readied for defense, and larger fortified constructions, from which an active defense is guaranteed. The visitors were also able to ascertain how activities are carried out in one of these command stations. Living and working conditions are assured in these facilities, no matter how difficult they may be. The delegation also visited a high security area in which an artillery unit is located. Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del Toro stressed the need to preserve and improve this type of facility. Another visit of interest was made to the (?espirulina) plant, a microseaweed that allows the production of high-protein food supplements that, in tablet form, can be used by soldiers under any circumstances. This microseaweed has proved that it works to combat illnesses, such as optic neuritis. Commander of the Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque asked about the plant's investments, the cost, number of workers, and the conditions under which this production takes place. Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union of Young Communists, stated that over 50 percent of the plant workers are young and have intermediate-level schooling. There is no doubt after visiting these Central Army units that this area's protection is assured and that the FAR members and the population work intensively to assure that this is so. [Havana Radio Progreso Network in Spanish at 1100 GMT on 8 June reports during its regularly scheduled "First Thing" program that Raul Castro's delegation visited the "No. 2 Citrus Farm," in Jaguey Grande, and met Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan, Matanzas Province leaders, citrus farm representatives, and chiefs of the Youth Labor Army's (EJT) 102d Division. The report adds that the officials "agreed to convert the citrus farm, considered among the world's largest, into the EJT integral farm mode, whose efficiency has been proved in the area and other parts of the country."]
