The cohabitation is already under way. The new parliament met this afternoon at the Palais de Congres under the supervision of their chairman. Adjoa Ayizouwa reports. [Begin Ayizouwa recording] Today, no one contests the fact that Togo has become a full member of the community of democratic nations. After the democratic presidential election of last 25 August, which was won by the candidate of the Rally of the Togolese People, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, who assumed office a month later, the new National Assembly democratically elected in February met this afternoon. The 81 legislators, elected for five-year terms, met in accordance with Article 52 of the Constitution which stipulates that the elected National Assembly shall meet on the second Tuesday following the official proclamation of the results. The meeting was chaired by Ayetor Yentumi Kouassi, deputy for Wawa, who had by his side the youngest member of parliament, Oyenga Aguta, deputy for Fante. The meeting began with the parliamentarians observing a minute's silence in memory of those who laid down their lives for the cause of democracy, in particular, their colleague Ede Gaston, the slain deputy of the Action Committee for Renewal. This was followed by the national anthem and then the opening address made by Ayetor Yentumi Kouassi. The Wawa deputy seized the opportunity to congratulate his colleagues for the trust placed in them by the people. He then spoke of the purpose of this afternoon's meeting. He said the session was being held in accordance with constitutional provisions with a view to enabling the members to become familiar with each other. He did not forget to thank all those who in one way or the other contributed to this historic work, in particular, the head of state, the government as a whole, the International Monitoring Committee, the National Electoral Commission, the Supreme Court, the military and civilian observers and Force 93. Finally, he invited the new members to put themselves at the service of the nation. He then introduced the members of parliament and the meeting ended after a nine-member commission was set up to draw up the draft rules of procedure of the National Assembly. It is composed in principle of two members of each party represented in Parliament. The next meeting of parliament is slated for 29 March. [end recording]
