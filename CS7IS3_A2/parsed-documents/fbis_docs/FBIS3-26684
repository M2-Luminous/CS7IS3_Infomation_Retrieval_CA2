The message came in a last-minute letter from China's London ambassador, Ma Yuzhen, to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC), just as they finished taking evidence last week in their high-profile inquiry into Sino-British relations. Senior committee members said the letter was "political dynamite" and "a bombshell". Mr. Ma accuses Governor Chris Patten and other senior British officials of being "irresponsible and grossly misleading to the British public and the people in Hong Kong" for saying Beijing may not carry out its threats "for fear of international pressure." He also claimed China made major concessions during the 17 rounds of political reform talks in Beijing and agreement was "almost in sight" when Britain unilaterally terminated the negotiations. Mr. Ma's letter is seen as a last-ditch attempt to influence the committee's impending report, following revelations that the all-party group intends to back Mr. Patten and his proposals to widen the territory's democratic base. The ambassador has been waging a behind-the-scenes campaign to undermine support for Mr. Patten in London. News of the letter came as China's Vice-President, Rong Yiren, was yesterday reported to have reiterated that Beijing will stand by its agreements with Britain over Hong Kong's future. XINHUA (the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) quoted Mr. Rong as saying whatever happens, China will adhere to the principles of "one country, two systems" and "letting the people in Hong Kong administer Hong Kong". Mr. Ma says in his letter to FAC chairman David Howell he "felt a need" for a fuller explanation on Chinese efforts to resolve differences over Hong Kong, adding he welcomed further opportunities to discuss them and other questions of common interest. He also demolished suggestions by the Governor and others that Beijing will not necessarily dismantle the Legislative Council, Urban and Regional Councils and District Boards in 1997. "May I say that they [British officials] are grossly mistaken if they really think so," Mr. Ma says. "In the absence of an agreement between China and Britain, China will definitely disband and re-establish Hong Kong's three tier councils on July 1, 1997. "Politically, China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Britain's executive power will terminate on June 30, 1997, together with the end of British-Hong Kong authorities' institutions. "As a matter of course, China will re-establish Hong Kong's three tier councils in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law. To say otherwise and dismiss China's justified action as something impossible is irresponsible and misleading to the British public and the people in Hong Kong." Mr. Ma also accuses Mr. Patten of violating the Joint Declaration with his call for "fair, open and acceptable" elections. "Another oft-repeated view consists in working for an `arrangement for a fair and credible election in Hong Kong'," the letter says. "According to the proponents of this theory, this is what the Sino-British Joint Declaration is all about. This is a travesty of the spirit of this important document. The central theme of the Sino-British Joint Declaration is the resumption of and the exercise of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong and the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China on July 1, 1997, as well as the implementation of the concept of one country, two systems. "It is totally different from the transfer of political power from one political party to the other in Britain. The implementation of the concept of one country, two systems, including the holding of elections, will take place according to the basic law under China's sovereignty. This can in no way be confused with what Britain is doing in haste without prior agreement with China." Mr. Ma concludes by claiming China made major compromises in an effort to reach agreement during last year's political reform talks in Beijing. "Contrary to the assertion that China only made one concession during 17 rounds of talks, China actually made great efforts on three questions," he says. "Firstly, the Chinese side agreed to lower the voting age; secondly, it accepted the British proposal for using the single set, single vote method in the elections of the district boards and the two municipal councils; thirdly, although the Chinese side held different views on the abolition of appointed seats in the local organisations, it went on to propose a solution to accommodate the British position, i.e., Britain may go ahead with abolishing the appointed seats in the 1994-95 elections while after 1997 necessary adjustments may be made by the government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the light of relevant provisions of the Basic Law." Mr. Ma attempts to lay the blame for the breakdown of the talks firmly on the British. "We were completely puzzled why the British side, while talking about time constraints, blocked the reaching of an agreement which was almost in sight, and let that opportunity slip by," he says. "That things should come to such a pass is not the making of the Chinese side."
