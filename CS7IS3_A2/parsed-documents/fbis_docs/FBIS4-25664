The statement says: The IAEA's 10 June resolution is an act of grave encroachment on the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK. The statement says: The DPRK Foreign Ministry will take three countermeasures: First, we will immediately withdraw from the IAEA. We will consider invalid all the resolutions adopted by the agency; second, inspections for the continuity of safeguards which we in our unique status have accepted will no longer be permitted; and third, the DPRK reaffirms its position that UN sanctions will be regarded as a declaration of war. In conclusion, the statement says: The DPRK's aforementioned position will never change until the nuclear issue has been solved fairly through dialogue and negotiation.
