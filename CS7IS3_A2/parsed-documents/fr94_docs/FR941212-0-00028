FR941212-0-00028 FR941212-0-00013 5. Redesignate §57.4112, entitled `` Termination of fellowships. '', as §57.4111, and §57.4113, entitled `` For what purposes may grant funds be spent? '', as §57.4112, and §57.4114, entitled `` What additional Department regulations apply to grantees?'', as 113. 6. Redesignate §57.4115, entitled `` What other audit and inspection requirements apply to grantees? '', as §57.4114 and revise the section number ``705'' in the text to ``798(e)'', in accordance with Pub. L. 102&hyph;408. The Department is further revising §57.4115 by removing the reference to ``section 705 of the PHS Act'' instead of renumbering the section number to ``798(e)'' as proposed in the NPRM. The reference to section 705 concerning audit and inspection requirements is redundant to the requirements that are already covered under 45 CFR part 74. We are also removing the parenthetical phrase at the end of the section text citing the OMB approval number regarding information collection requirements as no longer necessary. 7. Redesignate §57.4116, entitled `` Additional conditions. '', as §57.4115. Further, Public Law 103&hyph;227, enacted on March 11, 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities in which minors will be present. The Department of Health and Human Services is now preparing to implement the provision of that law. Until those implementation plans are in place, the PHS continues to strongly encourage all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. Economic Impact Executive Order 12866 requires that all regulations reflect consideration of alternatives, of costs, of benefits, of incentives, of equity, and of available information. Regulations must meet certain standards, such as avoiding unnecessary burden. Regulations which are ``significant'' because of cost, adverse effects on the economy, inconsistency with other agency actions, effects on the budget, or novel legal or policy issues, require special analysis. The Department believes that the resources required to implement the requirements in these regulations are minimal. Therefore, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Secretary certifies that these regulations will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For the same reasons, the Secretary has also determined that this is not a ``significant'' rule under Executive Order 12866. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 This final rule does not affect the recordkeeping or reporting requirements in the existing regulations for the Grants for Faculty Training Projects in Geriatric Medicine and Dentistry.
