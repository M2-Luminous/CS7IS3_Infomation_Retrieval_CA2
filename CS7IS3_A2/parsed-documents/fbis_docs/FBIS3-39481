If the Serbs ignore -- as they have in the past -- the ultimatums that the United Nations, NATO, and Europe will issue to them once again before ordering their aircraft to take off from their Italian bases, the operation will be carried out. Those, like myself, who have many doubts about the effectiveness of such an intervention, and who perceive all its unknown factors and dangers, must now forcefully stress the following new factor: After the latest deliberate and intolerable massacre of civilians in Sarajevo and after the stances adopted by Butrus-Ghali, the European Union, and Bill Clinton, there can no longer be any doubt that the Western democracies are preparing soon to cross the fatal threshold of an air operation. Then whatever will be, will be. And if the Serbs do not understand what is about to happen, they are making a big mistake. The Serbs have many reasons for continuing to delude themselves. Too many past threats have not been followed up by deeds. And also there are too many gray areas that still prompt many people to doubt the Western governments' determination. These have taken turns in putting forward and rejecting the idea of raids. Last spring America was ready to carry out bombardments, but the French and British, who have thousands of men in the former Yugoslavia (inadequately armed in order to be invulnerable) opposed it. They said, and rightly so, that the effectiveness of raids was doubtful, the risk of hitting civilians too high, and the threat to the blue helmets unacceptable; and nothing was done. Now Paris and London seem to have changed their minds. But still three days ago U.S. Defense Secretary Perry was voicing reservations, asking: "Our strike capability is not in question, but what would be the political result of the bombardments? If they were to be the first act in a new tragedy, what would be the second and third acts, and what would the conclusion be?" It is all too easy to portray alarming scenarios. In response to NATO bombardments ordered by the United Nations, we must expect Serbian attacks on the blue helmets throughout Bosnia. What will NATO and the United Nations do then? Immediately after the massacre in Sarajevo Perry stressed: "The United States and NATO are unwilling to send armies into Sarajevo to impose an agreement against the will of the region's peoples." But if that is so, "what would the second and third acts be?" There are many hypotheses. Is it likely that the major European powers would witness major attacks on their blue helmets without responding and that America would not rush in to help its allies and the United Nations? Alternatively, is it possible that the British, French, and all the other UN forces could escape from Bosnia, like the marines from Beirut? Would that not render inevitable the huge land operation, the "great war to end the little war" that all the democracies have hitherto deemed absurd and impracticable (and not out of cowardice but out of proper prudence)? Promises and Ambiguities The Serbs, encouraged by Zhirinovskiy's crazy promises and Yeltsin's ambiguities, may believe that the democracies will not cross this Rubicon, that they will not send in the great army -- almost on a Gulf War scale -- that would be needed to impose peace in Bosnia. Nobody now can be sure that this will happen, but it is prudent to remember that democracies are by nature slow to respond to the defiance of the violent -- this, partly because ours are peaceful peoples who have suffered too many wars to throw themselves into another without pondering it. But at the last moment democracies have ultimately always responded to threats. And they have won all the major wars of this century. We do not know whether, when they chose the script for the first act -- that of air strikes -- the NATO governments already set the scene for the second and third acts. And this uncertainty worries us. We would like them to have done so; and we would like it to be explained clearly to the democratic peoples why it is impossible to continue witnessing the massacres in Sarajevo -- which are, as American Secretary of State Christopher said, "part of a plan that the Serbian artillery has pursued despite repeated warnings from NATO" -- and we would also like them to explain what would be the cost of a land intervention, which could prove necessary in order not to lose all credibility, in order not to encourage all Europe's extremists and further violent actions. This time, unless the Serbs yield and stop stifling Sarajevo, we believe that a bombardment is certain. Sometimes, as De Gaulle said, "you engage first, and then see what happens." At the Negotiating Table The hope is that such a move, if it must be made, will not spark a vicious circle of reprisals but that it will bring everyone back to the negotiating table and make everyone at last accept the European Union's peace plan, which would restore 33 percent of territory to the Bosnians, instead of the 22 percent that they now control. But perhaps the reserves of Balkan madness have not yet been exhausted. Soon we will know.
