"The State Duma deputy's murder, one of thousands of serious crimes that have swamped the towns and villages of Russia, should justify the adoption of decisive steps in the fight against crime," says the statement, an account of which has been released by the State Duma's press service. The statement establishes that, in a situation where the crime world is openly on the offensive, the government and the law enforcement agencies are not taking effective action to stop criminal encroachments upon citizens and are thereby risking not only the lives of individuals, but the very existence of the Russian state system. The document goes on to say: "Realistically assessing the situation which has arisen today, the extent of the approaching danger, the threshold which has been crossed by the criminal milieu and the potential tragic consequences for the country's multimillion population, we most decisively demand that the President of the Russian Federation [RF], as the guarantor of human and civil rights and liberties to the maximal degree, uses his constitutional powers to bring order, without delay or compromise, to this most important area of our everyday life." The State Duma considered it necessary to demand that the country's president dismiss the minister of internal affairs of the RF immediately. As for themselves, the deputies voiced their readiness to examine and adopt as a priority "urgent legislative acts in the fight against crime."
