On Monday morning [2 January], the Turkish Government issued a communique stating that the Belgian authorities were responsible for the incidents. They were responsible firstly for allowing Kurdish intellectuals from Bonn -- whom the Turkish Government claims are supporters of the separatist Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] -- to "demonstrate in an area with a large Turkish population," and then for "laying the way open for the spread of such incidents" by the decision not to ban the PKK in Belgium, as has been done in France and Germany. In particular, the Turkish Government was outraged by the "inadmissible" statement of Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback who had "shifted the blame" for these incidents onto the Turks. The result was a veritable diplomatic merry-go-round, with the charge d'affaires at the Belgian Embassy in Ankara being summoned to the Turkish Foreign Ministry while Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes received the Turkish ambassador before speaking directly with his Turkish counterpart, Mr. Hikmet Cetin. According to the semi-official Turkish press agency, ANATOLIA, Mr. Cetin again stressed the need to extend the ban on the PKK to cover Belgium. The same source claims that Mr. Claes, for his part, stated that the demonstrators would be "expelled" from Belgium and that Brussels "in no way accepted the use of violence," adding that his government "would not tolerate terrorism and terrorists." These reported statements were quickly denied by Willy Claes, who made it known that any possible expulsions could only be decided on in agreement with the other government departments. This statement was in line with the moderate tone taken yesterday afternoon by the foreign minister when he received -- another sign -- a delegation from the Union for the Protection of the Kurdish Culture [YRWK], which had organized Saturday's meeting. According to the Foreign Ministry communique, "the delegation informed the minister of the Kurdish people's hopes for the recognition of its identity." In response, Mr. Claes "expressed his understanding for the Kurdish problem but condemned the use of force as a way of fighting political battles." The minister added that "Belgium, with its tradition of hospitality for political refugees," nevertheless refused "to become the stage for violent confrontation between foreign groups." This Belgian-Turkish incident comes precisely at the time when Ankara has launched a major campaign to neutralize the PKK. This campaign operates at every level: Observers say that there is pressure on "friendly countries" and NATO allies -- and the Turkish Government will not fail to stress the useful geostrategic position of Turkey and the barrier it provides against the Islamic regimes. There are also diplomatic moves afoot in Syria, Lebanon, and Iran to obtain assurances from these countries that they will cease backing the PKK. Only Monday, the Turkish daily newspaper HURRIYET reported that the Turkish Prime Minister Mrs. Ciller intended using the NATO summit to be held in Brussels on 10 January as an opportunity to ask President Clinton to put pressure on Damascus during his meeting with President al-Asad. The PKK rebellion has cost Turkey dearly -- $7.5 billion last year -- not to mention the cost in lives for the Turkish Army, the PKK fighters, and the civilian population. The ANATOLIA agency claims that 21 people, civilians and rebels, have been killed since 1 January in the Anatolian southeast, although these official figures should not be considered definitive.
