GRANMA, mouthpiece of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC), said that once more the Atlantic and east coast of the United States will be the scene of the Fleetex 2/94 Combined Exercise, whose operational goal is the effective coordination of naval, air, and ground forces in fulfilling different integral missions. The U.S. Government, under the guise of calming residents worldwide over possible deployment of its military forces, has announced that the maneuvers are "routine" or "innocent exercises," the newspaper indicated. GRANMA added that it is very difficult to understand this idea and, even more, passively contemplate the scene when this supposed innocence includes approximately 13,000 soldiers (2,000 are Marine Corps assault forces); 23 warships, including one nuclear aircraft carrier; and more than 100 attack and transport planes. GRANMA explained that according to spokespersons for the U.S. State Department, the new exercise has as its main objective the approval for a large part of these forces to transfer to Europe. The advanced technology of nearly all of the Fleetex 2/94 Exercise forces contradicts the common saying "there is a big distance between what is said and what is done" because any change in course or increase in velocity would reduce any distance, particularly if it is a short distance, the newspaper remarked. The announced participation of an Argentine destroyer and a submarine should be pointed out. Argentina is in fact joining a dangerous military buildup in regions very distant from its natural bases, GRANMA concluded.
