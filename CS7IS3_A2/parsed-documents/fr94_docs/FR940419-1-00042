FR940419-1-00042 FR940419-1-00008 Prior to implementation of Conf. 8.14. certain taxa listed in Appendix II could be traded internationally without qualification or assurance of their identification. The CITES resolution on the universal tagging system for the identification of crocodilian skins (Conf. 8.14) requires, in part: (1) The universal tagging of raw and processed crocodilian skins with non-reusable tags for all crocodilian skins entering trade or being re-exported, unless substantial processing and manufacturing has taken place; (2) That such non-reusable tags include as a minimum the International Organization for Standardization two-letter code for the country of origin, a unique serial identification number, a species code and the year of production, and further that such non-reusable tags have as a minimum the following characteristics: a self-locking system, heat resistance, inertia to chemical and mechanical processing, information that has been applied by permanent stamping [These requirements have been further specified by the CITES Animals Committee and, as a result, the Secretariat has identified manufacturers in three countries that are producing CITES-acceptable tags] and, (3) That the same information as is on the tags [for whole skins, flanks, bellies, and ``chalecos''] be given on the export permit, re-export certificate or other Convention document, or on a separate sheet which shall be considered an integral part of the permit, certificate or document and which should be validated by the same issuing authority; (4) That each Party in which tags are applied maintain records accounting for tags issued and maintain records that relate each Convention document number to the tags of the crocodilian specimens traded thereunder and vice versa, and include this information in its annual report; and (5) That Parties establish, where legally possible, a system of registration or licensing, or both, for importers and exporters of crocodilian skins and parts thereof. 2. Special Rule. This proposed rule allows trade through intermediary countries, i.e., all countries of re-export by definition, for Nile and saltwater crocodiles as long as such countries are effectively implementing CITES and they have adopted certain management measures to control trade in crocodilian skins and products. Countries are not considered as countries of re-export if the specimen remains in customs control while transiting or being transshipped through the country and provided those specimens have not entered into the commerce of that country. The special rule is intended to complement and strengthen the universal crocodilian tagging system as presently envisioned in CITES resolution Conf. 8.14 and the implementing resolutions prepared by the CITES Animals Committee. These measures include effective inspection of shipments to determine if the CITES country-of-origin tag is intact for skin imports and exports and implementing a monitoring system that relates goods produced to tagged skins received. The purpose of this special rule is to address the monitoring measures in the countries of re-export in order to have a more accountable system for the transfer and processing of skins and products in the commercial crocodilian trade. The United States is a major importer of crocodilian products produced by countries of re-export. The Service inspections of importations have revealed a continuing pattern of commingling and misidentification of crocodilian leathers. Accompanying CITES documents have often declared the merchandise as American alligator when the product contains some species of crocodile, or as crocodile, when the goods are made from American alligator hide. The new CITES tagging system will represent a significant step towards eliminating misidentification of skins as they leave the country of origin. Since all American alligator skins are tagged upon export from the country of origin, the problems of commingling of alligator and crocodile clearly arise during the tanning and manufacturing process. In addition, there are several species of crocodiles throughout Africa and Asia that remain listed as endangered. While identification of crocodile versus alligator can be made consistently in manufactured products, species identification of crocodile products is more difficult. Despite these difficulties, various species of endangered crocodilians have been identified in products declared as American alligator or non-endangered crocodiles. This special rule is proposed with the goal of ensuring adequate control in the manufacturing countries to deter intermingling of the protected populations of the Nile and saltwater crocodiles, as well as the endangered populations of other crocodiles and alligators without imposing the overburdensome requirement of tracking each piece through the production process, and recording all incoming tag numbers on the re-exporting permit for products. The new CITES tagging system does not require that country of origin tags remain intact up to the point of manufacture. Since the commingling problems described above principally arise in the re-exporting countries, the special rule is designed to address these problems, to fulfill the ESA's criteria for the protection of threatened species and those with similar appearance, and to allow trade within the parameters outlined below.
