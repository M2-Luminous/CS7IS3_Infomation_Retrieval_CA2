FR940406-2-00169 FR940406-2-00094 [FAR Case 92&hyph;40] OMB Clearance Request for Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Notice of new request for OMB clearance. SUMMARY: Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve a new information collection requirement concerning Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews. DATES: Comments may be submitted on or before June 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments to Mr. Peter Weiss, FAR Desk Officer, OMB, room 3235, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Beverly Fayson, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy, GSA (202) 501&hyph;4755. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Purpose The proposed rule revises 44.302, Requirements, and 52.244&hyph;2, Subcontracts (Cost-Requirements, and Letter Contracts), pertaining to performance of Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews (CPSR's) and subcontractor consent requirements, respectively. The rule raises the threshold at (1) 44.302(a) for performing CPSR's from $10 million to $25 million to recognize the effects of inflation on this threshold; (2) 52.244&hyph;2(a)(4) to recognize the increased costs of special test equipment and the effects of inflation since the threshold was established; and (3) 52.244&hyph;2(b)(1) to recognize the effects of raising hourly wage rates and contract costs. No previous clearance for this requirement existed. The burden hours being requested take into consideration the revised (raised) thresholds; i.e., a reduction in burden on contractors from the present requirement. The objective of a contractor purchasing system review (CPSR), as discussed in part 44 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, is to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness with which the contractor spends Government funds and complies with Government policy when subcontracting. The review provides the administrative contracting officer a basis for granting, withholding, or withdrawing approval of the contractor's purchasing system. These revisions are a result of recommendations submitted by industry. The rule reduces burden on contractors by decreasing surveillance and increasing dollar thresholds at which contractors are required to provide notification of intent to subcontract. B. Annual Reporting Burden Total annual public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 26,860 hours, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat, 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4035, Washington, DC 20405, and to the FAR Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. The annual reporting burden is estimated as follows: Respondents, 1,580; responses per respondent, 1; total annual responses, 1,580; preparation hours per response, 17; and total response burden hours, 26,860. Obtaining copies of proposals: Requester may obtain copies of OMB applications or justifications from the General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), room 4037, Washington, DC 20405, telephone (202) 501&hyph;4755.
