It raised a premeditated hue and cry over the 'Afula operation in order to cover up two serious crimes it recently committed: The holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the subsequent Israeli Army killings, and the Zionist special forces' execution of six Palestinians in the Jabaliya camp. The latter was described by world circles at the time as the most serious violation of human rights in the occupied Arab territories. Israel also imposed a military siege on our people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip under the pretext of providing security to its Jewish inhabitants. Security, as all know, cannot be provided under occupation. If Israel was really concerned about security, it would have accepted the Security Council resolutions governing the peace process and it would have negotiated on that basis in a way that leads to the withdrawal of its forces and settlers from occupied Arab territory and to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state where people can live a free and honorable life. But Israel does not want to withdraw from the occupied territories. The flimsy security pretext it uses to confront the world will not stand up to the test. The Israeli occupation is a source of danger to the Israelis themselves and the very reason of the lack of security. The more the occupation steps up its bestial acts, the more resistance escalates and violence aggravates. The Arabs have taken part in the Madrid conference and presented objective proposals in the Washington talks for the sake of establishing a real, just, and comprehensive peace because only a just and comprehensive peace based on the international community resolutions, charters, and principles can provide security and stability in the region and end the cycle of violence. Instead of responding to Arab proposals, particularly the Syrian ones, Israel continued its maneuvers and prevarications in a bid to avoid the principles on which the peace process was based. These principles are land for peace, namely, full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories as stipulated by the UN resolutions. The Israeli rulers refuse to admit facts. They turn a blind eye to developments and try to delude themselves into believing that it is possible to achieve peace through the continuation of occupation. If they think so, they will undoubtedly reap further bitter fruit. Peace and occupation cannot coexist. There can be no peace in the Middle East without full Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied territories and without the realization of the Palestinian people's real hopes and aspirations, led by freedom, dignity, and self- determination. Only a just and comprehensive peace can provide security and stability. A just and comprehensive peace should be based on specific international resolutions that should be implemented in full and lead to Israel's withdrawal from every inch of the occupied territories. Otherwise, not one Israeli will enjoy peace or security.
