Hata, who is also deputy prime minister, is scheduled to have separate talks later in the day with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Premier Li Peng. Hata will meet President and Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin on Sunday before returning to Tokyo later the same day. Talks between Hata and Qian, who met twice last year -- in New York in late September and in Seattle in November -- will cover bilateral and international affairs, according to Foreign Ministry officials. The two foreign ministers will discuss the situation on the Korean peninsula as well as problems concerning North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, the officials said. Japan is likely to call on China to urge Pyongyang to accept international inspections of its nuclear facilities, since Beijing has the "largest official channel" with Pyongyang, they said.
