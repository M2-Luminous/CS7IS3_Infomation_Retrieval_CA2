According to officials with the regional administration of industry and commerce, a network of commodities markets of various kinds has been formed in Ningxia, one of China's relatively undeveloped provinces. At present, large and medium-sized state-owned commercial wholesale firms in the region handle wholesale and retail businesses at the same time. Local large commercial retail stores have adopted various forms of the responsibility system in operation, while half of the small commercial shops, which make up 80 percent of the region's total number of commercial centers, have introduced flexible management methods, with the central government as the owner of fixed assets. Last year, the autonomous region, with more than 30,000 commercial organizations, achieved 4.3 billion yuan in turnover from retail trade. So far, the autonomous region has also built 261 rural and urban free markets, as well as 31 markets of means of production, with 60,000 households engaging in such businesses. While the autonomous region has been making efforts to invigorate commodities markets, markets of finance, technology, labor and real estate have also come into existence. Last year, the autonomous region issued 800 million yuan in valuable papers and 30 million yuan in shares, and swapped 20 million U.S. dollars through the markets. The autonomous region has issued licenses for the establishment of 300 technological and trade organizations and non-governmental scientific research units. The business volume at the technological markets hit 230 million yuan last year. Technology trading has also helped launch 80 percent of the region's projects on "Spark program," designed to use practical skills to promote local economy, transform outdated technology and enhance economic efficiency. The officials said 80,000 people have found jobs with the help of various labor organizations. While stepping up market construction, the autonomous region has worked out a series of local rules and regulations to standardize market operations and ensure a healthy development of the market, in accordance with relevant laws of the central government and compatible with local conditions. Last year, more than 80 percent of the region's farm products and by-products, as well as 70 percent of its means of production, were traded through markets, said the officials. Ningxia has also made active efforts to win over international aid and preferential loans, while luring more overseas investors to sink their money into the region. So far, about 300 foreign-funded enterprises have been set up in the autonomous region, involving a use of 120 million U.S. dollars in foreign investment. Meanwhile, the autonomous region has expanded its business overseas. Besides setting up six enterprises in foreign countries, the region has signed contracts concerning contracting foreign projects and exports of labor involving 60 million yuan. A total of 240 kinds of local products have entered the international market.
