The move, beginning in the current fiscal year ending March 31, is intended to speed up the liquidation of bad loans to housing loan companies and other debt-ridden nonbank financial institutions, the officials said. Under present plans, financial institutions will create new companies to buy their interest-exempted loans to nonbanks. The institutions, which have exempted interest payments on some loans to help bail out debt-ridden loan recipients, will be allowed to make tax-free write-offs of losses from the selling of loans. Write-offs of interest-exempted loans, tax-free or otherwise, have not been allowed since they are intended to help the bailout of loan recipients.
