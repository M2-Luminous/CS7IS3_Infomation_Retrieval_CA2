In connection with the implementation of construction projects -- the construction of a hotel in Almaty by the ABV -- machines and structural steel have so far been exported. Moreover, telephone systems, television and radio sets, medicine, medical-technical equipment, and drugs are supplied. Altogether two dozen Austrian companies already are active in Kazakhstan, eight have their own representations. Many enterprises handle the market via Moscow. The 40 participants in the fourth Austrian economic mission in Kazakhstan were very satisfied with the talks. The export business is facilitated by a credit line established by the Control Bank. However, importance is attached to a high Austrian net output (70 percent), Richter stressed. The Kazakh Alem Bank is responsible for inclusion in the guarantee line. The Kazakh Government has worked out a list of priorities, which encompasses 34 projects that can be included in the guarantee line of the Control Bank. Documentation on 15 projects with a volume of $350 million (about 4.2 billion schillings), on which an expert report already exists, have been passed on to the Alem Bank. B.V. Utemuratov, deputy minister for foreign trade, stressed that there are already 21 joint ventures with Austria. Among the projects already in progress are the delivery of machines for the production of enamel varnish wires, the establishment of a plant for plastic doors and windows, a spirits factory, the delivery of electronic television and radio facilities, and of medical equipment. The Voest-Industrieanlagenbau Company wants to modernize a metallurgical combine in Karaganda and build two continuous casting plants. The project will probably cost 4 billion schillings (Austrian share). The project is to be implemented in a consortium with Turkish and Japanese partners. One is also negotiating on the establishment of joint ventures within the framework of the agreement on railroad cooperation.
