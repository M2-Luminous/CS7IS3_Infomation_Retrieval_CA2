The state minister for food affairs /chairman of the national logistics agency made these remarks after giving an account of the development of the national food stock to President Suharto at the Merdeka [Presidential] Palace. Minister Ibrahim Hasan said that the food stock controlled by the government reached at present 700,000 to 900,000 tonnes, but it will continue to increase until it reached the safe level of 1.2 to 1.3 million tonnes. The government will continue to purchase rice not only to meet the people's demand but also to prevent a negative impact of the dry season, he added. The Central Bureau of Statistics has predicted that the dry season this year will cause a reduction of 2.7 per cent in the production of rice. Indonesia's demand for rice each year reaches about 2.5 million tonnes. The minister said that although rice production declined, the government had no intention whatsoever to import this commodity. Although Indonesia will not commercially import rice, but it will receive 500,000 to 600,000 tonnes of rice in the next few months as reimbursements of the rice lent by Indonesia to several countries, including the Philippines. The minister also reported about the result of the recent meeting of 16 ministers in the fields of agriculture and food in Montevideo, Uruguay, discussing the implementation of the Uruguay Round which was ratified in Morocco recently. One of the items discussed at the meeting was the abolishment of subsidies on agricultural produce which have so far been provided by advanced as well as developing countries. Commenting on the result of the meeting, the head of state said that Indonesia should constantly implement the Uruguay Round decisions, however with taking the national interest into consideration. "We should always give priority to the national production and imports only as complementary", Minister Ibrahim Hasan said, quoting the president. He also stressed that Indonesia would fulfilled its obligation to import 70,000 tonnes of rice, although it would only be implemented early in 1995.
