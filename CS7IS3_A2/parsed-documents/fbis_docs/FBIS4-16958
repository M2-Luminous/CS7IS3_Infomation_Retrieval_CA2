At a joint news conference by the defense ministers that took place on the same day, it was emphasized that Estonia and Ukraine have common views--in particular, as far as international security is concerned. According to Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukraine's defense minister, a special commission will be set up to work out the possibility of handing conventional armaments, subject to reduction, to the Estonian side under barter conditions. In Kannik's opinion, the granting of special status to Russia in the "Partnership for Peace" program--if it joins the program--is out of the question. Tallinn and Moscow cannot find a common approach on settling the issue of withdrawing Russian troops from the Estonian territory. Radetskyy told journalists that he maintains regular ties with Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and intends to begin negotiations with him on 21 April in Sevastopol concerning the final solution of the Black Sea Fleet issue, negotiations that will last until 23 April approximately. The head of the Ukrainian military department pointed out that Ukraine would propose that Russia take the main base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet--which Sevastopol would probably remain as--for a term of five years. "However, such a proposal will need to be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament after it is coordinated with the Russian side," said Radetskyy. Radetskyy also informed journalists that social issues will be a priority at the Black Sea Fleet negotiations. "On 20 April, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk reaffirmed the fact that the economic security of Ukrainian naval sailors and those officers and warrant officers who would like to transfer from the Black Sea Fleet to the Naval Forces of Ukraine would be the same," the Ukrainian defense minister assured.
