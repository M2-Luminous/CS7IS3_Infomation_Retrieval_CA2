This seems to indicate that starting today, Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer is keeping his promise to implement the blockade imposed by the United Nations. On Wednesday, Balaguer promised Dante Caputo, UN and OAS negotiator for Haiti, and William Grey, special U.S. envoy, that he would close the border completely, and yesterday, Balaguer met with his secretary of the Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Matos Villanueva. Since early this morning, Dominican soldiers have been preventing the entry of Haitians through the border crossing at Dajabon, the Dominican town closest to Haitian territory. The Dominican Government's efforts are also being supported by Haitian guards, who are preventing their fellow countrymen from getting closer than 700 meters to the border. As is common on Mondays and Fridays, these Haitians had planned to cross the border to buy and sell goods. In addition, hundreds of Haitians normally enter the Dominican Republic every day to buy fuel and take it back to Haiti. The Dominican Armed Forces have increased the number of soldiers on the border to enforce the total closure of the border. The surveillance posts along the Dominican border are located every 10 meters and are now under the constant supervision of officers in vehicles. On the Haitian side, soldiers are also preventing their compatriots from crossing the Masacre River into the Dominican Republic. Since 0500, senior officers have been personally ensuring that "neither Haitians nor Dominicans" cross the border. The parks and main streets in Dajabon also have been placed under military control. The closing of the border surprised the residents of Dajabon and hundreds of Dominicans who arrive from other cities to buy clothes, shoes, liquor, and arts and crafts from Haitians. It also affected Dominican merchants who travel up to 300 km to sell food to the Haitians. A Dominican Army officer at one border post warned: "No one will be able to control these Haitians. When they are starving to death, they will want to cross the border, even if they get killed in the process."
