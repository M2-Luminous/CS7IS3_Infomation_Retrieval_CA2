The GDP's development was "quite remarkable" compared with the average of the new laender, which was 6.3 percent, and confirms the economic course that is being followed, Economic State Secretary Friedrich Stamm said in Erfurt on Thursday [17 February]. According to first estimates by the Economic Overall Calculation for the Laender Working Group, Saxony came in second in 1993 with a real growth of 6.6 percent. East Berlin experienced a growth of 1.8 percent compared with the previous year, Brandenburg 5.2 percent, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania 5.9 percent, and Saxony-Anhalt 5.6 percent. In 1993, however, Thuringia was clearly below the average regarding the per capita GDP in the new laender, which, according to Stamm, was 13,500 marks. Thuringia reached only 12,500 marks. Stamm justified this primarily with the large number of approximately 70,000 commuters, whose performance is not included in the calculations.
