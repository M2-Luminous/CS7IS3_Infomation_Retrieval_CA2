FBIS4-8428 "dreeu071_y_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Federal Lilic: UN `Compromised Itself' by Air Strikes Lilic: UN `Compromised Itself' by Air Strikes LD1204175294 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1724 GMT 12 Apr 94 LD1204175294 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Belgrade, April 12 (TANJUG) -- The president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) Zoran Lilic assessed tuesday that by its air raids in the territory of the Bosnian Serb republic (RS) near Gorazde, the U.N. has compromised itself and become directly involved in the conflict precisely at the time when the Moslem side was militarily defeated in this area. Lilic said this during his talks with the delegation of the Greek town Xanti headed by Mayor Filipos Amiridis, it was reported by the presidential information service. NATO aircraft raided Bosnian Serb army positions around Gorazde on April 10 and 11, after Bosnian Serb forces crushed a Moslem offensive launched in late May [as received] from Gorazde, a U.N.-protected "safe area" which should have been demilitarized in late spring. "The Serbs were bombed by NATO because they were exercising their right to self-defence. The goal in fact, was to prevent a military defeat of the Moslem side, to prolong the fighting and even contribute to its escalation", Lilic said. The attack was allegedly carried out to protect the UN peacekeepers in Gorazde, though there were only 8 of them according to our information at the moment of the strikes and the clashes were taking place quite a long way away from where they were stationed. Therefore there was no question about UNPROFOR troops being in danger. The case of Gorazde is a clear misuse of the protected areas, first by the Moslems and then by the U.N. and NATO. Attacks in the Gorazde area were launched by the Moslem forces and this was known and tolerated, the Yugoslav president set out. It is particularly surprising that, as some American media report, only 25 minutes were needed for the U.N. to give a go-ahead for the air strikes. At the same time, when we ask for UN authorisation to import medicine or any other humanitarian aid, which is not even restricted under resolution 820, days and months are needed and it is sometimes even denied, Lilic said. This points to the double standard policy pursued by the international community or a larger part of it, and particularly the U.N. which has definitely become the handyman of the powerful. Lilic expressed his conviction that all peace-loving countries will condemn NATO and that the Security Council will have sufficient wisdom and power to return to the peace process. In this context, he stressed that Yugoslavia would continue its policy of peace but that it will know how to defend itself if necessary. Lilic expressed his gratitude to the Greek people for the friendly support extended to the Serb people. Xanti Mayor Amiridis regretted that during the visit of his delegation to the mother and child hospital in new Belgrade, it unfortunately witnessed the "devastating effects of the stringent embargo introduced against Yugoslavia".
