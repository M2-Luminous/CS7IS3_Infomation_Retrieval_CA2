Minister for Foreign Affairs. Head of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. Born 1935. Joined Odakyu Bus Co. after graduating from Seijo University. First elected to Diet in 1969. Has held posts of minister of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; minister of finance. [Kanamori] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which was negative toward security and the Self-Defense Forces, joined the coalition government. Isn't it difficult to manage the coalition government's foreign policy? [Hata] When forming the coalition government following the general election, we agreed, before starting, to take over such basic things as foreign policy and security. But we did not say it was all right to take over everything. Time passes. We must seize the opportunity, and, while holding proper consultations, go on building a Japan which connects with the world. It is probably healthier if there are all sorts of debates during that process. By having all sorts of debates, the problem points will begin to be visible to the public. There were some who worried about whether a coalition government would be safe, but has it not, conversely, progressed in a good direction because the process can be seen? [Kanamori] But there are dissenting views even within the coalition government concerning Japan becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and it appears that Prime Minister Hosokawa, too, has become negative since the time of the Miyazawa government, saying "a reform of the United Nations is necessary as a precondition for that." Would you care to comment on that? [Hata] There are all sorts of opinions regarding the fact that Japan has become a major power. One holds that it is better for Japan to live modestly, without trying to do something beyond its power, and one holds that the world would not recognize Japan if it did that. When I was minister of finance, I also had various meetings with presidents and prime ministers of various countries. I was often told "Japan should address the world in a more active manner." The role of Japan has begun to be given more attention than Japan thinks. Even looking at the conflicts in various regions of the world, most are not so much ideological rivalries as they are conflicts with a historical background, such as ethnic or religious rivalries. What has begun to be necessary in order to deal with them is not strength, but very delicate consideration and attention. I think Japan is a master of that aspect. A good example is that UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] head Yasushi Akashi, in Cambodia often did such things as appeal to people by radio, saying "putting the election into operation is the beginning of democracy." [Kanamori] What are the benefits of becoming a permanent member of the Security Council? [Hata] It is not a matter of benefit, it is that we are being asked to do so by the world. It is not a matter of looking good, or of saying that it is natural to become a permanent member of the Security Council because Japan has become a major power. [Kanamori] What about disadvantages? [Hata] It is probably feared that Japan might be forced to shoulder a military role in PKO [UN peacekeeping operations] if it became a permanent member of the Security Council, but there are any number of roles for Japan to play. Some people immediately let their imagination run in that direction, and shy away, but conversely, one can also propose that the United Nations get along without using military means. When I visited the United States in September to attend the UN General Assembly, expectations for Japan were so strong that there were requests for meetings from some 60 countries. [Kanamori] They were from the economic side, were they not? [Hata] Some were from that side, but others wanted to join forces with Japan and work to solve conflicts within regions. And there was also talk of wanting to use Japan's power in the economic development of neighboring countries. "Taboos Are Bad" [Kanamori] Did the situation which divided public opinion end because the SDPJ joined the coalition? [Hata] In such things as (then) chairman Yamahana visiting the Republic of Korea, the SDPJ has also begun to change after becoming a governing party. And though it is criticized this way and that, the one that has contacts with North Korea is the SDPJ, so I think the SDPJ will have a big role to play in improving relations with North Korea, which have now reached an impasse. [Kanamori] One hears that one impediment to deregulation of rice has also been removed. [Hata] People often say that taboos are bad. But, particularly in regard to rice, there is a strong aspect in which the media have gone and made it into a political and symbolic issue. It has begun to become clear that if the Uruguay Round reaches a showdown, actually not only Japan, but every country will have problems. Diplomacy is speaking frankly with each other during a clash between the egos of various countries. [Kanamori] Secretary General Ozawa of Shinseito, who has great influence with the Hosokawa government, favors accepting tariffication of rice, so there are also many who are apprehensive, suspecting that it will probably happen. Would you care to comment on that? [Hata] Ozawa has said for a long time that "it is better to protect what should be protected by a high tariff." But I fear that, even if it is initially a 70-percent tariff, Japan will probably be pressed repeatedly to make concessions by countries saying "Japan has a surplus, so concede more." I intend to develop foreign policy by seeking the best way to solve it, not a masochistic policy of saying that Japan will become isolated if it does not deregulate rice.
