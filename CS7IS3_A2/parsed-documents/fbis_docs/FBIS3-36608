"Abkhazia is Georgia's pain and a journalist should not ignore any question pertaining to it. Moreover, such important events and documents as the negotiations in Geneva and the communique and resolutions adopted by the UN demand constant attention on the part of the media. Belated news evokes justified indignation and confusion." Objective information should be provided on the fate of the 300,000 refugees and thus satisfy journalists and the interest of 5 million people. The journalists reacted to these justified remarks in silence and silence is a sign of agreement. Then Ioseliani acquainted those present with UN Security Council Resolution 896. "The main thing," he explained, "is for the refugees to return to their homeland without being presented with any preliminary conditions. Let anyone return who does not present any kind of danger [a condition advanced by the Abkhazian side] -- this is an absolutely absurd idea. Who determines this danger? This violates the chief principle of the UN: the protection of human rights. "No less important," continued Mr. Dzhaba, "is that the resolution condemns any forms of changing the demographic composition of Abkhazia and the Republic of Georgia, including by means of settling people who did not live there before." The news that the UN supports the deployment of UN peacekeeping forces or other forces sanctioned by the UN in the conflict zone aroused great interest. The peacekeeping forces will become a guarantee for the return of refugees to their native land. "It is essential to point out that this resolution," said Mr. Dzhaba, "adopted on 31 January of this year is the outcome of the meeting in Paris between our head of state, Eduard Shevardnadze, and UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali." Naturally, the journalists raised many questions in connection with the visit of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Georgia. "This is indeed an historic event. A legal basis will be laid for all our relations." Many questions related to the political status of Abkhazia. "Georgia has never abolished the autonomy of Abkhazia; however, nor has it agreed with the feudal reasoning of the Abkhazian separatists." Everyone was interested in hearing his views on recent events [the killing of several Mkhedrioni leaders and the planned disbandment of the organization]. Mr. Dzhaba similarly did not refuse to give an answer to this complex question. "It is indeed difficult for me to speak about this. It suits some people to speak out against the Mkhedrioni but let them not forget that the Mkhedrioni has lost more than 600 young men during the last four years. Our idea focused on the creation of a Georgian army, based on a national army, one led by professionals. "As for the Rescue Corps [into which the Mkhedrioni has been incorporated], we still have few professionals; therefore, we are sending young people to other countries to be trained and to acquire experience."
