He said China was the lead country among the five nuclear powers to commit itself to not being first to use nuclear weapons. In a newspaper interview published in AL-AHRAM today, Li Peng welcomed the recent progress in the Arab-Israeli talks, describing it as a good beginning to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict. But the Chinese premier said a real settlement of the conflict requires both sides to keep trying to overcome the various obstacles until permanent peace is achieved. Li Peng said he believed the end of the Cold War has not brought people security and reassurance. He said the developing countries' economic suffering has increased and regional conflicts have continued. He noted that peace and development--two basic issues in our age--have not seen the light of solution. Li Peng said China, itself a developing country, considers good relations with the developing countries a mainstay of its foreign policy. China expresses its great sympathy with the plight of the developing countries. On the march of development in China, Li Peng noted that his country has recorded a high annual growth rate of 8.9 percent. Gross national product increased 12.8 percent in 1992 on the figure for 1991. Grain production reached 450 million tons. Li Peng said his country encourages foreign investors as part of its socialist market economy. He explained that over 50,000 establishments with an investment of $50 billion dollars were operating in China by the end of September 1993. Their participation in industrial production amounts to 6 percent of total production and 20 percent of China's total exports.
