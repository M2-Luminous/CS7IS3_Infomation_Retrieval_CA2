The Agency also developed estimates of available commercial treatment capacity. Table 3 summarizes available capacity for each alternative treatment technology required for the newly identified TC nonwastewaters. The table also summarizes the required capacity for each technology. A comparison of required and available treatment capacity indicates that adequate combustion capacity exists for TC nonwastewaters. Therefore, in the proposed rule, EPA indicated they would not be granting a national capacity variance for D018&hyph;D043 nonwastewaters. EPA requested comments and any additional data on its assessment that there is adequate treatment capacity for these wastes. EPA received one comment on this issue. The commenter supported EPA's determination that sufficient capacity exists to treat D018&hyph;D043 nonwastewaters. Thus, EPA has not changed its assessment and is not granting a variance for these nonwastewaters.
