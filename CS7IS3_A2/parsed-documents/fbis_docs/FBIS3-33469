The Social Emergency Fund bill received 402 votes, equivalent to 80 percent of the 500 congressmen -- of a total of 584 -- who participated in the vote. Ninety-five legislators voted against the government. After the general support for the bill, the congressmen will vote on various proposals to change particular points. The government guarantees that it has enough support to achieve the rejection of these proposals to change particular points. The Social Emergency Fund, endowed with $16 billion, will allow the government to curb inflation through direct control on public spending in social security and special health and housing programs and programs to eradicate hunger and misery.
