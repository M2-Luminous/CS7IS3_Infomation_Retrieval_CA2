FBIS4-54293 "dreas103__a94026" FBIS-EAS-94-103-A Daily Report 13 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Aid Requested for Aluminum Industry in Indonesia Aid Requested for Aluminum Industry in Indonesia OW1805191294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 13 May 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1805191294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Excerpt] The Indonesian Government has asked the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI) to extend financial assistance to Asahan [name as published] Aluminum, a state-run aluminum smelting company in which Japanese firms have a stake. The financial assistance being sought by the Indonesian Government is that: 1) Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and Japanese firms that invest in Asahan Aluminum subscribe for about 10 billion worth of shares in a fresh capital increase to be made by Asahan Aluminum; and 2) the current interest rate on approximately 190 billion yen in loans extended by the Export and Import Bank of Japan be lowered. Asahan Aluminum has come into being as the sole overseas aluminum production base for Japanese firms that have withdrawn from their overseas aluminum smelting business, and the Japanese firms have staked their survival on the aluminum smelting industry in Indonesia. Nonetheless, Asahan Aluminum has continued to register a poor performance because of sluggish aluminum markets around the world. MITI plans to accept in principle the Indonesian Government's request for the financial assistance after concluding that Japan needs to secure an overseas source of aluminum ingots to prepare itself for potential fluctuations of the world aluminum market. MITI will discuss specific ways to provide the financial assistance with 12 Japanese firms, including the Sumimoto Chemical Company and the Nippon Light Metal Company, which have invested in Asahan Aluminum, and the Finance Ministry and the Export and Import Bank of Japan.
