The journal is published by the Geopolitics and Security Section of the Military History Division of the Russian Federation Academy of Natural Sciences, and printed by the Voyentekhizdat printing plant. Vaganov describes it as a "200-page, large format academic journal," printed on good paper with high-quality printing, with "something for the dilettante to read as well as something for the specialist to analyze." He quotes the journal's editors as describing it as an "experimental journal-almanac." Among the articles in the first issue are "Why Democracy Is Triumphing in Russia," by Cornell University Profesor Richard Darlington, "Forecast of the State and Tendencies for Change in the Geopolitical Map of the World in Regions of the Far Abroad," "Ethnographic Factors of Military Security," "Military Security and Defense," and "Military Aspects of Ecological Security," as well as several articles on military history. Vaganov writes that the first issue contains no information as to the size of the new journal's print run or its periodicity. He speculates that in view of its high-quality printing and paper, it will attract no more than 1,000 buyers.
