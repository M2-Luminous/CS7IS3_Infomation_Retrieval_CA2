FR940503-0-00034 FR940503-0-00009 Summary of Comments On July 27, 1993, the National Institute of Standards and Technology published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register (58 FR 40087). A total of 11 letters were received: Four trade associations, three manufacturers, one government agency, one laboratory accrediting organization, one testing laboratory, and one consultant commented. All eleven supported the proposal, especially the changes in procedures that will result in achieving compatibility with international standards and guides and broadening the scope of NVLAP to include accreditation of calibration laboratories. Other than recommendations to strengthen the national and international recognition of NVLAP accredited laboratory data, the comments covered a wide range of suggestions made by only one or two of the respondents. Recommendations are addressed below with a summary ``Recommendation'' and a ``Response'' for each. Comment. One accreditation organization and one consultant suggested that NVLAP clarify §285.24 Denying, Suspending, and revoking accreditation, to specify the conditions for making a suspension decision vis-a-vis a revocation decision. Response. Section 285.24 (e) clearly states that invoking suspension or revocation ``will depend on the nature of the violation(s)''. It is very difficult to be prescriptive because of the vast possible combinations of laboratory operations and deficiencies. Selecting suspension action implies the expectation that deficiencies can be resolved before actual suspension is invoked; additionally, if suspension is invoked, the expectation is that it will be rather short lived. Revocation, in contrast, is clearly used in cases of more serious deficiencies that are not likely to be resolved. The return of the Certificate and Scope of Accreditation are required under revocation; it is expected that suspension will be short lived, therefore return of the Certificate and Scope are not required. Comment. One manufacturer and one laboratory suggested that NVLAP procedures should provide for an ``office of government liaison'' to work toward reduction of redundant accreditation programs in the United States to save laboratories the expense of paying for multiple programs. Response. Although redundant programs and multiple audits cause confusion and added expense to accredited laboratories, NVLAP has no authority to add a provision regarding redundant programs and/or multiple audits. The NVLAP process is designed so that NVLAP itself does not offer a LAP that duplicates one that exists or could be offered by a public sector accreditor. Comment. One consultant suggested that although a definition is provided for the term ``Certificate of Accreditation'', a definition is needed for the term ``Certificate'' as used in the definition of ``Reference material''. Response. See NIST Special Publication 260, ``Standard Reference Materials Catalog'', for definition and discussion of the term ``certificate'' as it applies to Standard Reference Materials. Defining the term in the NVLAP procedures would be confusing and out of context with its use. Comment. One manufacturer suggested that part 285 should be referenced in §285.6 NVLAP documentation. Response. Section 285.6 (a) will be changed to include such a reference. Comment. One trade association suggested that NVLAP modify the definition for Authorized Representative in §285.5 Definitions to provide an organization with more flexibility in naming an Authorized Representative. Response. This section will be reworded to provide additional flexibility by stating that the Authorized Representative of an accredited laboratory may be an individual who is authorized by the laboratory or the parent organization. Comment. One manufacturer suggested adding a definition for Competent to §285.5 Definitions. Response. The definition of Competence will be added as ``the ability of a laboratory to meet the NVLAP conditions and to conform to the criteria in NVLAP publications for specific calibration and test methods''. Comment. One manufacturer suggested modifying the definition of NVLAP in §285.5 Definitions to include its relationship to NIST. Response. Agree. The definition for NVLAP will be changed to state that NVLAP ``is an Office within the National Institute of Standards and Technology''. Comment. One trade association suggested changing the definition of Traceability of the accuracy_in §285.5 Definitions by changing ``primary'' standard to ``reference'' standard. Response. The definition is correct as written. Traceability follows a path which may include the ``reference standard'' in the laboratory but, as the definition states, must be traceable ``ultimately to a primary standard''. Comment. One trade association suggested that §285.33 (k) Certificates and reports identify the type of laboratory issuing the certificate and report (e.g., independent, manufacturer's, etc.). It is the belief of the writer of this comment that ``in-house'' laboratories can not necessary produce ``unbiased'' results. Response. No change is needed. Information describing the type of laboratory accredited is provided by the laboratory in its application and included in the NVLAP data base. However, the type of laboratory has no bearing on the accreditation decision; rather, the accreditation decision is based on the judgment (using results from on-site assessments, proficiency testing, and monitoring visits) that the laboratory meets all of the criteria established for a particular Laboratory Accreditation Program (LAP), independent of the ``organizational'' association of the laboratory.
