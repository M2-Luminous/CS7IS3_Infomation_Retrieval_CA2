In the forging of parts as well, the application of computers (CAE) began in the field of CAD and CAM, and has now expanded into analytical simulation. This paper introduces the application of CAE to forged part design. First, we introduce a comprehensive two-dimensional forging process design support system, FESTE, which Toyota Motor Corporation has successfully developed in-house. Secondly, the current topics of CAE application, such as three-dimensional parts simulation and automatic three-dimensional modeling, are described. 1. Introduction The production of automobile forged parts is characterized by the fact that a wide variety of such parts are produced in large quantities. So during the production preparation process, the efficient use of computers is indispensable. The application of computers to forging in our company began with CAD and CAM, and has now expanded to analytical simulation. In this report, CAE denotes comprehensive computer-aided support, including CAD, CAM and simulation. This report introduces a comprehensive design process support system, FESTE, developed with forging simulation techniques as its nucleus, and refers to examples of CAE application to forged part design. 2. Purpose of Forging CAE Forging process design used to depend largely on the know-how, or empirical rules, of expert designers. Before making the final decision for mass-production, the conventional method was to repeat designs and test on a trial-and-error basis. There is increasing demand for better quality raw materials, more precise shapes and the use of light alloy, and a special need in the preparatory stage of such production is to shorten the lead time, the time from development to mass-production. Hence the requirement for a more active role of CAE. Figure 1 shows the flow of the design process with CAE. The following paragraphs describe the purpose of introducing CAE into practical design work. a) Reduction of test frequency: This is achieved through simulation experiments to screen proposed designs. b) Efficient procedure of the design process: Design work itself improved via computerized automation. c) Better quality: Designer fully uses CAE to develop high value forging parts. d) Cost reduction: Cost for die production and test are reduced as a result of better design. e) Single-source data control: To use common data in CAD/CAE/CAM can shorten the time from design to mass-production. 3. Two-Dimensional Forging Process Design Support System 3.1. Features and General Description of FESTE, Two-Dimensional Forging Process Design Support System Even in the case of symmetrical parts, such as transmission gears, it is becoming more and more difficult to get the best production design within a short period, based solely on empirical rules. Hence, FESTE is designed to form a simple system, available for die designers themselves, to run simulation, and automatically following a standardized die design process. FESTE has the following features: a) easy operation; b) high analytical precision; c) time-saving procedures; d) short time requirement and e) single-source data control. 3.2. Forging Rigid-Plastic FEM Simulator The features of the simulator, which stands at the center of the FESTE system, are as follows. (1) Rigid-plastic finite element method The rigid-plastic finite element method (FEM) is a method of numerical analysis where the subject material is treated as a rigid-plastic body, so elastic deformation of the materials may be ignored. Among the advantages of this method are that errors attributable to stress do not accumulate, it permits greater deformation per step, and strain rate sensitivity can be considered in the design. Due to these advantages, it provides a practical means of analysis which has a rapid calculation ability in the case of extensive plastic deformation, as occurs in forging. Hence, we adopted a theory (1) based on the compression characteristics method, which is free from theoretical contradictions in yielding conditions, stress and the like. (2) Database In practical use of the simulation system, two factors play a key role, the way the database (DB) is used, and its precision. The database consists of: 1) material characteristics DB; and 2) tool-to-material friction conditions DB. The material characteristics are approximated according to the following expression: </graphic> The material characteristics DB is expressed by a matrix of the nature of materials with temperature, which classifies the values, a, b, n and m. The tool-to-material friction conditions DB is a matrix of the processing method with temperature, in which the friction coefficient &mgr; obtained from Coulomb friction is classified. We have succeeded in expressing vast amounts of our experimental data and previous expertise numerically, which makes it possible to use the most appropriate database for practical analysis conditions. (3) Output of analysis results The information which designers must obtain from analysis includes: 1) deformed profile; 2) cavity filling; 3) stroke vs. load curve; 4) die pressure distribution; 5) stress distribution (e.g., equivalent stress and stresses in respective directions); and 6) strain distribution (e.g., equivalent strain and strains in respective directions). Figure 2 shows the results of the forming simulation of a forged transmission gear, including the results of analysis of deformed profile, equivalent strain distribution and die pressure distribution. 3.3. Example of System Application The example given here is the system applied to the design process of forged raw materials for a transmission gear, in a closed forging process using a high-speed automatic press (Figure 3). As shown in Figure 4, the raw materials are generally worked into final shape from cut materials in three to four steps. (1) Determination of forged material shape The forged material shape is determined with the aid of two-dimensional CAD based on the forged material shape data, to which machining stock removal and die draft angle are added, considering the best possible forging method with reference to the CAD database of shape of parts determined at our development division (Figure 5). (2) Consideration of process plan In forging generally, several processes should be considered. It is conventional to rely on empirical know-how in screening proposed designs. FESTE makes it possible to judge the design based on simulation, so all the designer has to do is to draft on CAD more than one plan with different volume distributions (Figure 6). (3) FEM data preparation Process data prepared with CAD are automatically converted into FEM analysis data. Process drawing data for the second process, for example, is converted into pre-forming material shape data for use in FEM analysis and the third process data into upper and lower tool shape data for the same purpose (Figure 7). For material forming, the best element division is automatically accomplished with reference to the element division database in consideration of tool shape and working method. Further, once the type of forming material and the press to be used are specified, FEM data are completed. Moreover, apart from the preparation of process plans with CAD, the forming material shape can be freely converted with the use of shape parameters, which provide a simple means of considering the design assuming different dimensions (Figure 8). (4) Execution of FEM analysis FEM analysis is executed on EWS, which are exclusively used by CAE, in about 10 minutes. The results of analysis are controlled as a database, classified by type of part, to allow designers to refer to past analysis results on similar parts. (5) Evaluation of analysis results Analysis results provide designers with information as to forming load, die pressure, cavity filling and others, which allow them to make a comprehensive judgment. Figure 9 shows the results of a comparison of cavity filling between plans A and B. In plan A, as the material deformed, it filled the outer portion. This implies the possibility that flash could develop if the material penetrated into the clearance between upper and lower tools as work proceeds. In plan B, however, filling turned out to be uniform and well-balanced until the final stage. With consideration given to other factors as well, such as forming load, plan B was adopted for mass-production. Furthermore, using elastic FEM software, dies are evaluated for strength based on the results of analyzed die pressure distribution (Figure 10). Should problems be found with process plans during this stage, designers return to steps (1) and (2), and seek again the best process design on computer. (6) Automatic drafting of die, assembly, and process drawing This is done based on the process data used for simulation. Although die design work was standardized to a large extent, it used to take a great deal of time because of the great number of dies to be designed. FESTE picks up the process data on CAD described in (5), and works automatically to submit the design of the best die division, details and installation jigs, automatically printing out process and die design, and die assembly drawings. Figure 11 shows a die assembly drawing thus automatically designed. (7) Die manufacturing NC data are prepared based on die manufacturing data, subsequently initiating die manufacturing. After inspection, the die is tested on an actual press, before proceeding with mass-production. 3.4. System Evaluation Test results agreed very well with simulation results from FESTE and no problems occurred in mass-production. The support system shortened design time to one quarter that of conventional design. Owing to the high precision of the improved design process, the frequency of tests required is reduced, and lead time has been greatly shortened. 4. CAE for Three-Dimensional Forging Parts 4.1. Three-Dimensional Simulation Technique Many problems remain to be solved in the analysis of three-dimensional parts, such as increased calculation time, and the establishment of automatic division techniques into element and tool definition methods. At present, this type of analysis is performed with nearly axially symmetrical parts. Figure 12 shows the results of three-dimensional analysis for extrusion of an inner spline extrusion.<sup> (2)</sup> 4.2. Automatic Modeling System Although it is now difficult to simulate specially shaped parts with three dimensions, automatic process design, based on parameter input, and the automatic three-dimensional modeling system, can be employed for the parts for which the design process is standardized. With dimension parameters input as parts data, this system automatically calculates stock removal, draft angle and other requirements, and formed out forging process design including preforming design, to automatically draw up a model in three dimensions. The expertise of die designers is incorporated in this design process, making it possible to generate the desired forging process as three-dimensional data. Figure 13 shows the results of automatic three-dimensional modeling of a connecting rod using this support system and the cutter location obtained from the data used. It is clear from this diagram that three-dimensional modeling work time, which used to be very long, is shortened and that the system reduces the time for design work, significantly reducing lead time. 5. Conclusions This report introduced the practical application of two-dimensional CAE to the forging of automobile parts and the current state of development of the three-dimensional system at Toyota Motor Corporation. The recent expansion of CAE application was made possible by rapid progress in computer technology, the strong need for such a system from the very beginning of research, and strenuous efforts in its development. In the future it should achieve drastic work transformation, following the concept of concurrent engineering, which encompasses in its scope all the design stages, from design to production, based on CAE.
