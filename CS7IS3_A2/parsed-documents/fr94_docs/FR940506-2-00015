FR940506-2-00015 FR940506-2-00006 In general, the Department relies on monthly weighted-average prices in the calculation of FMV. In consideration of the significant volume of third-country sales involved in this review, we decided to test respondents' third-country sales to determine whether we could use annual FMVs as a basis of comparison to U.S. sales. To determine whether a period of review (POR) weighted-average price was representative of the transactions under consideration, we performed a three-step test. See Antifriction Bearings from Japan, et al.; Final Results of Review, 58 FR 42289 (1993). We first compared the monthly weighted-average third-country price for each model with the weighted-average POR price of that model. We calculated the proportion of each model's sales whose POR weighted-average price did not vary more than plus or minus 10 percent from the monthly weighted-average prices. We did this test for each model of kiwifruit. We then compared the volume of sales of all models of kiwifruit whose POR weighted-average price did not vary more than plus or minus 10 percent from the monthly weighted-average price with the total volume of sales of kiwifruit. If the POR weighted-average price of at least 90 percent of sales of kiwifruit did not vary more than plus or minus 10 percent from the monthly weighted-average price, we considered the POR weighted-average price to be representative of the transactions under consideration. Finally, we tested whether there was any correlation between fluctuations in price and time for each model. We found that no significant correlation existed between price and time (See analysis memorandum to the file, 4/25/94). That is, prices did not consistently rise or fall so as to make annual weighted-average prices unrepresentative of home market prices. Because many of the NZKMB's sales were determined to be at prices below the cost of production (COP) during the investigation, the Department initiated a COP investigation for the purposes of this administrative review. Just as the Department found in the investigation, we find that in comparing third-country sales to COP, the reseller/exporter's acquisition prices are irrelevant because section 773(b) of the Tariff Act requires that the Department look at the actual COP of the subject merchandise. Thus, we used the cost incurred by kiwifruit farmers, the actual producers of the subject merchandise, to calculate the COP benchmark. Due to the large number of growers from which the NZKMB purchased kiwifruit during the POR, the Department determined that sampling was both administratively necessary and methodologically appropriate to calculate a representative cost of producing the subject merchandise for purposes of this administrative review (See section 777A of the Tariff Act). Based on comments submitted by the petitioner and the respondent, we decided to select kiwifruit growers on a stratified basis across the categories of regional location. Farms were stratified by geographic regions into either the Bay of Plenty region or non-Bay of Plenty regions. This division was made because 70 percent of the New Zealand kiwifruit is produced in the Bay of Plenty region and it is considered to be the most cost-effective area in which to grow kiwifruit. Once farms were categorized into two geographic regions, a random sample of 20 growers was selected. Since 70 percent of the New Zealand kiwifruit production originates in the Bay of Plenty region, we selected 14 growers representing this region. An additional six growers were selected from the non-Bay of Plenty regions. We sent COP questionnaires through the NZKMB to the 20 kiwifruit growers, all of which responded to the Department's questionnaire. These 20 responses, along with supplemental responses and verification results, were analyzed and relied upon, where appropriate, in reaching the preliminary results of the review. We calculated the cost of cultivation for each grower by summing all costs for the 1992 kiwifruit season. These costs included the cost of materials, farm labor, farm overhead, and packing. We allocated the cost on a per tray-equivalent basis over the total number of tray-equivalents submitted by each grower to the NZKMB. We then adjusted those costs to reflect the fruit loss of 22 percent, which was disclosed by the NZKMB in its financial statement. We added the NZKMB's general and administrative expenses to the farm's average cost per tray.
