As the Council of Ministers has still not adopted the 4th Framework Programme for European Union R&D of which the specific nuclear programmes form part, it is not yet clear what procedure the coming Commission meeting will adopt: Any change in the overall budget agreed on for the Framework Programme could, of course, have repercussions on the amount available for the specific programmes. There are three specific Euratom programmes for Union research and education actions in the nuclear domain, covering nuclear safety and security, controlled thermonuclear fusion and the future activities of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) between 1995 and 1998. The draft Decisions which are due to be adopted on March 10 set out the criteria which should govern the selection of joint EU action in these fields, the scientific and technological aims of the programmes and, of course, the budget figures. Provisional funding for the three programmes is set at 160 million ECUs, 794 mECUs and 300 mECUs for nuclear safety, fusion and JRC activities respectively. Nuclear Safety Although the EU's nuclear industry is considered relatively safe, at least when compared with other parts of the world, it remains unacceptable in the eyes of significant sections of European society. The Commission argues, therefore, that European research in this field should be targeted towards raising understanding of the issues involved and awareness of the risks associated with the use of nuclear energy and the entire nuclear fuel cycle. The technical maturity of EU nuclear technology by no means rules out the desirability of seeking new technological solutions for the industry's problems, particularly concentrating on the areas of radiation exposure for people and the environment. The activities proposed illustrate the new approach the Commission would like to adopt, exploring ways of improving the use of nuclear energy through an integrated approach dealing with the three areas that cause most concern: reactor safety, management of highly-radioactive material and the dangers of fissile material falling into the wrong hands. Nuclear Fusion The long-term aim of EU action in this field, which brings together in one international programme all the thermonuclear fusion activities carried out in the EU Member States, Sweden and Switzerland, is to produce safe and environmentally-friendly prototype reactors, which can eventually be used to produce acceptably-priced electricity. It will take decades and huge amounts of cash to attain this goal. For the period 1994-1998, the priority aim is to set out the detailed plans for the Next Step experimental reactor, whose purpose is to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of nuclear fusion for peaceful purposes. Next Step comes under the four-partner cooperation between Euratom, the US, Japan and Russia on ITER-EDA, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor-Engineering Design Activities. In parallel, research efforts will be concentrated on two other areas of activity: a) improving the technological concepts necessary for the design, in the more distant future, of a demonstration reactor (DEMO) capable of producing substantial quantities of electricity; and b) in the even more distant future, providing technically-, economically- and environmentally-acceptable solutions to the problems associated with using nuclear fusion to produce energy. These activities will be conducted through both DEMO and ITER. Given the overwhelming cost and time-span involved, the Commission intends actively to encourage industry to participate in the research and will be examining the possibilities of extending international cooperation beyond ITER. Joint Research Centre The JRC will continue to conduct strategic and applied European research. In accordance with the priorities set out in the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, its activities will be geared towards reinforcing the international competitivity of European industry. They will also aim to guarantee the independent scientific expertise necessary for implementating EU policies, provide the EU institutions with competent scientific services, improve public safety and environmental protection and, finally, reduce the disparities existing between the Member States in terms of scientific and technological know-how. Over the next four years, the Commission recommends that the work of the JRC should be concentrated on two categories of research into nuclear fission safety and controlled thermonuclear fusion: institutional research activities, on the one hand, and scientific and technical support for EU policies, on the other.
