Jiang and King Sihanouk spoke highly of Sino-Cambodian friendship and hoped that the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries will be further developed. Welcoming the king and queen on their official good-will visit to China, Jiang said that the visit is a big event in bilateral relations, which he believed will push the relations to a new height. Jiang said that in the past year, historical changes have taken place in Cambodia. Under the leadership of King Sihanouk, he said, the country, which had undergone chaos caused by war for years, has entered into the stage of restoration and reconstruction. The Chinese president said that China appreciates King Sihanouk's view of a comprehensive national reconciliation and his efforts for such goal. "We hope that under King Sihanouk's leadership, the various political parties will properly settle the domestic problems by peaceful means and build Cambodia into an independent. Peaceful, unified, integrated and prosperous country," he said. China hopes that the efforts made by the international community will be helpful in promoting Cambodia's national reconciliation and peace and stability in the country, Jiang said. China and Cambodia have had long-term traditional friendly relations, Jiang said. During the Bandung conference in 1955, King Sihanouk got to know the late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and they opened a new page of bilateral relations between China and Cambodia. Jiang said the king had visited China many times and had made valuable contributions to the friendship between the two countries. The Chinese president expressed China's willingness to work with Cambodia to further develop the friendly cooperative relations in all fields, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence. Sihanouk said that the Cambodian people were very grateful to the Chinese people and government, as well as to Deng Xiaoping and President Jiang, for the support and help in the country's reconstruction, and would never forget it. Briefing Jiang on the situation in Cambodia and the recent Pyongyang round-table conference, Sihanouk noted that the urgent task at present in Cambodia is to realize a ceasefire and peace. Without peace and stability in the country, said Sihanouk, there is no way for restoration and reconstruction. The king said that holding the round-table conference was to seek peace, adding that the first conference was over now, but future efforts were also needed. Sihanouk pointed out that the Cambodian issue can only be solved by negotiations and peaceful methods. Taking part in the meeting were Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Wu Jieping, vice-chairman of China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, and senior Cambodian officials accompanying King Sihanouk. Before the meeting, President Jiang presided over a ceremony welcoming the Cambodian guests. This evening he hosted a banquet in their honor at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
