He voiced the hope that those released from Lefortovo "will wage the political struggle in civilized forms." "There is in me, as in anyone else, an element of alarm in connection with the political statements of the inmates of Lefortovo released yesterday," Sergey Shakhray added. "The political organizations which achieved only a political amnesty, should take upon themselves responsibility for the actions of the released leaders. If the latter plan to continue the struggle in the elections like other citizens of the Russian Federation, that is a normal phenomenon, but if they are planning to fight in order with the help of slogans to seize, destroy, or gun down -- that means fresh criminal cases will be instituted and there will be no consensus or reconciliation." But Deputy Konstantin Zatulin in an interview to ITAR-TASS expressed the opinion that any political statements by Ruslan Khasbulatov and Viktor Anpilov on leaving Lefortovo are "quite natural." The most important thing was whether these statements would be followed by any political actions. Konstantin Zatulin considers it expedient to "discuss in the Duma the question of a possible ban on political activity by active participants in the October events of 1993." We remind you that after coming out of Lefortovo Viktor Anpilov spoke today on Moscow's Theater Square, calling on several hundred activists of "Working Moscow" and the Russian Communist Workers' Party to set up a workers' party. In an interview to REUTER's agency Aleksandr Rutskoy's aide Andrey Fedorov stated that his boss "will not stay out of politics because he has never given up the idea of becoming president. He has come out of prison in a fighting mood." As for Ruslan Khasbulatov, he told journalists that he was leaving politics and intends shortly to visit his relatives in Chechnya.
