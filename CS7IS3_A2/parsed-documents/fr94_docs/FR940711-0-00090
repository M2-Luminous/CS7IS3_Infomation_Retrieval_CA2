ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is revising its regulations on inmate release preparation to provide for greater standardization for institution programs and to make various editorial or organizational changes. As revised, this program is intended to enhance the likelihood that sentenced inmates will successfully reintegrate into the community upon their release from incarceration. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, HOLC Room 754, 320 First Street NW., Washington, DC 20534. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roy Nanovic, Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, phone (202) 514&hyph;6655. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Pre-Release Program (28 CFR part 571, subpart A), which will now be entitled Release Preparation Program. A final rule on this subject was published in the Federal Register June 30, 1980 (45 FR 44234) and was amended on September 30, 1983 (48 FR 45053). The primary change in these amendments is to provide for greater standardization in release preparation programming at Bureau institutions. New section 571.13 contains the core curriculum of topics/courses to be offered. Other amendments are primarily editorial in nature and make no change in the intent of the regulations. For ease of use, the entire subpart is being revised. A summary of the changes follows. As noted above, the title of the program has been changed from ``pre-release program'' to ``release preparation program''. This change is reflected in revised §571.10, §571.11 (b) and (d) (formerly §571.11(a) (2) and (4)), §571.12 (a) and (b). Section 571.10 is further amended to reflect the Bureau's recognition of the continuity of an inmate's needs for release preparation and to standardize the release preparation program for all sentenced inmates reintegrating into the community from Bureau facilities. Section 571.11 is further amended by adjusting the codification for the purpose of editorial consistency. Former paragraph (a)(1) has been removed. This provision is addressed more completely in new §571.13 (b). As revised, the introductory text and paragraph (a) of new §571.11 specify that a designated staff member has the responsibility to determine the general release needs of the inmate population. These provisions replace the provisions of former paragraphs (a) introductory text and (a)(2). Former paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) are revised as paragraphs (b) and (d), and a new paragraph (c) is added specifying that the designated staff member chairs the institution's Release Preparation Program Committee. In §571.12, paragraph (b) has been revised to remove reference to requirements for inmate participation in a specific number of sessions. The intent of the revised paragraph is that the inmate is responsible for registering in recommended release preparation courses. Documentation of the inmate's participation in the program serves to help staff measure the institutional adjustment of the inmate. The provisions in former paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of §571.12 have been revised as paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of a new §571.13 on the institution release preparation program. New paragraph (a) of §571.13 specifies that the institution's release preparation program shall be administered by the Release Preparation Program Committee. New paragraph (b) of §571.13 states the core curriculum of the institution program: health and nutrition, employment, personal finance/consumer skills, information/community resources, release requirements and procedures, and personal growth and development. Because these changes are administrative in nature and do not impose further restrictions on inmates, the Bureau finds good cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment, and delay in effective date. Members of the public may submit comments concerning this rule by writing to the previously cited address. These comments will be considered but will receive no response in the Federal Register . The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866, and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 571 Prisoners. Wade B. Houk, Acting Director, Bureau of Prisons.
