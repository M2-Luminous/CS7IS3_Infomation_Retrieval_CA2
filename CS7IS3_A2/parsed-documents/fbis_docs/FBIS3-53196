The foreign ministers informed His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad of their countries' complete support and recognition of Syria's pan-Arab orientation. Their closing statement also took note of Syria's visible and vital role in the peace process and the importance of the upcoming Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. They expressed the hope that the session will advance a just and comprehensive peace based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, the land-for-peace formula, an Israeli pullout from all the occupied Arab territories, and the restoration of Palestinian rights. President al-Asad made it clear to the Arab foreign ministers that Syria will continue to be driven by the same pan-Arab policies it has set for itself; namely to defend Arab rights and pursue a just and universal peace in the region. Thus, the Arab foreign ministers who came to Damascus to voice their solidarity with Syria and its stands, have, in effect, confirmed President al-Asad as a spokesman for the Arab nation and a champion of its rights and causes in the planned summit with the U.S. president. As well as being Syria's roaring voice, Al-Asad will be the voice of all the Arabs and the true articulator of their aspirations. Against the background of a stalled Middle East peace process, Arabs across the Arab world naturally attach the highest importance to this summit. Israel has been trying to deal with the Arab states one at a time and promote partial settlements and separate deals that can hardly lead to peace or meet the aspirations of Arab masses. Syria has won the international community over to its argument that a Middle East settlement found lacking in justice and universality is doomed. That Mr. Clinton is going to a summit in Geneva shows that the United States is sold on the idea of a just and universal peace and a central role for Syria, not only in its own right, but also as a spokesman for all the Arabs and a repository for their hopes and aspirations. The genuine support voiced by the Arabs for Syria's agenda and al-Asad's pan-Arab orientations will make the historic Geneva session even more important. Assuming that the session proves useful, it will give a fresh impetus to the peace process and advance a just and universal peace and put the stalled talks back on track. However, if the summit is to succeed the United States will have to further implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions -- the principles on which the Madrid conference and the Washington talks were launched. These resolutions are absolutely clear on a number of key issues: A total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, a halt to Jewish settlement building there, and the restoration of Palestinian rights. The Americans themselves have summed these up as the land-for-peace formula. The Washington talks were an opportunity for Israel to climb on the bandwagon of the Middle East peace process. But Israel has deliberately passed up all the chances to make peace, choosing land grabbing and repression over peace and tranquility. It has almost wrecked all the American peacemaking efforts and led the region to the brink of an explosion. It is high time Israel showed a real interest in peace and the international community moved to impose a just and universal peace and force Israel from all occupied Arab territory.
