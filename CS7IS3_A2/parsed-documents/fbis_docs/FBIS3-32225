Government Minister Marcelo Santos Vera expressed a few minutes ago that it is not necessary to declare a state of mobilization [estado de mobilizacion] in the country, because protests have not been violent. He said the situation is calm -- a view we do not share. Let us listen: [Begin recording] [Santos] We are receiving constant reports on the strike. Obviously, the situation is not normal. Urban transportation has been largely reduced in some of the most important cities of the country. There are demonstrations. There is uncertainty. Nevertheless, I do not think this should take us to the extreme point of thinking about more drastic measures. [Unidentified reporter] [question indistinct] [Santos] Not so far. As the situation now stands, there is no reason to decree a mobilization. We do not know the plans of the FUT [United Workers Front] leaders. I hope that in response to appeals from government officials and media representatives, they conduct their protests peacefully. [passage omitted]
