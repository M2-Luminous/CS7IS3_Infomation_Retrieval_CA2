Cuban-Mexican Relations Face a Very Complex, but Also Promising, in More Than One Way, Future"] [Text] Havana -- Passing over hurdles and skirting stumbling blocks and snares, Cuba and Mexico have consolidated a relationship that, due to its duration and fruitfulness, is unique: above empty rhetorics, the times, differences in projects, foreign pressure, and circumstantial emergencies. Forefather Benito Juarez' expression "peace is the fruit of the respect shown for the rights of others" had shaped the already lengthy period that began when Mexican President Adolfo Lopez Mateos refused to break relations with Cuba when the rest of the Latin American governments obeyed an order to that effect from Washington. At that moment, the already excellent relations ascended to that of exceptional relations, and this was the diamond that topped the tiara of a historic phase of respect for Cuba's decision to take its own road in exercise of the principle of self-determination, and the Mexican decision served as a lesson and example for others who, in due time, decided to follow suit. This recounting is timely in view of the visit to Cuba by Mexican President Carlos Salinas, the fourth Mexican president who by his visit, a very brief one, will endorse ties and nurture feelings that transcend authorities and promote a sense of brotherhood and not just unite neighboring nations. Salinas' visit upholds a tradition that was initiated by Luis Echeverria in August 1975 and preserved by Jose Lopez Portillo, in July 1980, and Miguel de la Madrid in 1981. On those occasions, the rejection of the isolation the United States wants to impose on the Cuban process was made evident. Today's situation is more complex for the two nations: Cuba is enduring an intensification of the blockade that has compounded a crisis produced by the vanishing traditional and unfaltering trade partners. Mexico is facing a massive process of integration with two big economic powers, one of which is Cuba's main antagonist. Domestically, Mexican authorities are facing what is, perhaps, the most rickety election process in its history, with unprecedented political tension (the armed uprising in Chiapas and the assassination of the presidential candidate of the governing party, among others). In this context, Salinas' visit to Cuba can be interpreted as a diplomatic gesture or, perhaps, as a tactic, or as an expression of a more important and profound will. The visit could represent all of this. The truth is that the visit has come as a U.S. legislator, who has the airs of a proconsul, has launched overseer-type demands against Mexico's rights to self-determination the same way he headed the anti-Cuban campaign in the U.S. Congress to make Cuba yield to its particular vision of what democracy and liberty mean. It could be the sight of stable and promising relations that are unaffected by eventual problems have moved the industrious inquisitor Robert Torricelli to aim his guns at a government that definitely does not yield to blackmail despite powerful economic commitments and remains firm to a tradition that has overcome all types of pressure. Current Situation and Outlook Salinas will find in Cuba a situation different from what he found when he visited the island in March 1987 on the occasion of the 6th Conference of Ministers and Chiefs of Economic Planning of Latin America, when he was the Mexican Government's programming and budget secretary. Although the island's current economic situation is more difficult than ever, Cuba's relations with Mexico during this period have been most intense in the fields of cooperation, investments, and cultural, sports, scientific and technological, and educational ties, among others. One recent example is the celebration of the 11th plenary session of the Bilateral Business Committee, in which 50 Mexican firms participated. This session strengthened the decision to increase Cuban exports and promote negotiations capable of benefiting trade between the two countries. As Cuba imports food, chemical products, and raw materials, Mexico buys tobacco, rum, marble, construction materials, equipment, and products from the health and veterinary sectors. Since the trade balance favors Mexico, the challenge of increasing these relations is being met by balancing the difference "through the creation of patrimonial interests," read investments, by Mexican businessmen in Cuba. Luis Miguel Porras, who was Mexico's commercial adviser on the island until his recent death, reported that in 1993, Mexican annual exports to Cuba, which in the 1980's had been for $60 million or $80 million, reached a record high of $150 million. Porras once told newsman Fernando Davalos that "Mexico is interested in Mexican investors getting settled in Cuba because as Cuba's agricultural, industrial, and services sectors increase their activities and are able to export, the island will be resolving its trade balance deficit." This is why here there is talk about the possibility of exporting to Mexico goods such as sea products, essential oils, zeolite, citrus, and computer software, and about joint productions, reestablishing industrial production using Mexican raw material, and servicing markets from Cuba. There is a hush about this because there are abundant examples of how Washington's anti-Cuban paranoia and meddling have worked to frustrate more than one important deal for the two sides. This is why it is not possible to give details about the growing patrimonial links being established here by Mexican businessmen whose interests are linked to the development of Cuban products intended for Mexican markets. For example, investments in tourism, such as Varadero's Tuxpan Hotel, and in textiles and tourism. The same diplomat said that there is work going on on projects such as the refining of oil and mining and that there are studies "for participating in the exploitation and processing of nickel." In some important operations, he said, it has become necessary to consider the problem of the Cuban foreign debt (the amount of which he did not report but that some believe is around $400 million, peanuts compared to others that exist throughout the world). There is a tacit understanding on this between the two countries. This has been confirmed by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. He has said: "There are many ways of resolving the debt, and we are in no position to say which ways these are" because "there is all sort of pressure" on whoever tries to trade with Cuba. In February, the Cuban foreign minister told LA JORNADA of Mexico that he has "much evidence on how Mexico is capable of overcoming pressure." He noted that "the situations of the world, of Mexico, and Cuba are different." Bilateral ties have checked facts that were not appreciated here, such as President Salinas receiving Cuban counterrevolutionaries, and episodes of boat people and of persons who forced their departure from the country with illegal actions. Robaina would explain this in a few words: (With Mexico) "there are exceptional relations, respect, and understanding..." The fact is that beyond the ups and downs of politics there is progress in projects in key sectors such as agriculture and livestock, industrial, telecommunications, fisheries, and food sectors and the importance of the recent visit by an significant Mexican Parliamentary delegation to the island cannot be ignored. It is almost commonplace to report that 90 Mexican sportsmen have participated in eight disciplines in competitions held in Cuba during the first four months of the year, that university rectors from the two countries will meet in Mexico during the second half of June, and that cities like Monterrey and Holguin have become sister cities. It is also commonplace to report that Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello fully agreed with his Canadian counterpart in condemning the U.S. blockade on Cuba, or that he told Warren Christopher that the Cuban issue is one of the differences his country has with the United States. In a recounting of this we cannot fail to mention the powerful and active movement of popular solidarity with Cuba in Mexico, a movement that serves as a liaison for the breaking in U.S. territory of the blockade against Cuba. Cuban-Mexican relations are a very complex issue, but promising, in more than one sense. This situation is endorsed by those who, like colleague Luis Soto likes to say, no longer fear U.S. Government threats and dare "pull the tiger's whiskers," even if it gets angry. One does not have to be a sorcerer to imagine how the White House sees Salinas' visit to Cuba only a few weeks after William Clinton raised the tone of his anti-Cuban discourse to almost the regressive level of his predecessors. The Mexican gesture will be interpreted in many ways, but it cannot fail to be seen as a sign that Cuba and Mexico continue blazing a trail as they march on.
