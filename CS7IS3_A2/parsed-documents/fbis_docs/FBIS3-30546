"Since UNPROFOR's command did not respond by 1800 as we demanded, I made a phone call to the UNPROFOR command in Kiseljak. General Ramsey, the chief of staff of the UNPROFOR command for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, told me that the Muslim side had refused to take part in the setting up of the joint military experts team and its activities," Major General Manojlo Milovanovic, the chief of staff of the republic of Srpska army, stressed. The main headquarters [of the republic of Srpska army] is dissatisfied with the UNPROFOR command's insufficient insistence on the Muslim side's participation, and on the need to establish the truth and inform the world public about it, outraged and horrified by the massacre, for which the Serbs are being accused without any proof, the statement by the main headquarters stresses. Since the Muslim side refuses to take part in the work of the mixed commission of military experts, the main headquarters of the republic of Srpska is convinced that they planned and carried out the horrific massacre. Therefore, the republic of Srpska army categorically refutes and does not accept any involvement or responsibility for the serious crime. The UNPROFOR command has rejected [the proposal] that UNPROFOR's chief of staff and the chief of staff of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, together with the chief of staff of the republic of Srpska army, go to the scene of the crime together and investigate the consequences and circumstances of the tragedy, the statement says.
