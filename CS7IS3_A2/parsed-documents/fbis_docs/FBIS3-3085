Confidence in the territory would be seriously affected, with international investors thinking twice because of the judicial uncertainty, he said. Mr Hoare said the Government planned to secure passage of the bill authorising the establishment of the court by July 1995. He said one of the factors that concerned international investors was certainty and Hong Kong was renowned for its stable system of law. "Once you start to introduce uncertainty into the system you will start to unravel everything," he said. Mr Hoare said the situation would get worse as 1997 approached. Legislators and the administration have been locked in a dispute over the setting up of the Court of Final Appeal since the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group reached an agreement on the body in autumn 1991. While the diplomatic body agreed that the number of overseas judges sitting on the five-member court should be confined to one, both liberal and conservative legislators maintain that the arrangement went against the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. Legislative Councillors have vowed to vote down any government bill drafted along the line of the Sino-British accord and none has indicated they have had second thoughts on their original position. Although the Government had earlier indicated that the draft on the complex legislation would be available for consultation with the legal profession some time this year, Mr Hoare yesterday for the first time offered a clear legislative timetable. Noting possible pressure from the Legislative Council [Legco], Mr Hoare urged the lawmakers to have a second look before proposing any amendments. Mr Hoare said the draft bill would be submitted to the Executive Council next month, before consultation with China and the legal profession. It was planned the bill would be tabled in Legco towards the end of the year. Mr Hoare stressed that the Court of Final Appeal must be set up in 1996 as it usually took a year for cases to reach the Privy Council, so that process had to be terminated before mid-1996. The Government therefore wanted to secure the passage of the bill by July 1995 or the consequences would be serious, he said. Without the bill, he envisaged a legal vacuum of two-to-three years on the basis that some time would be expected to be taken by the future Special Administrative Region legislature to establish such a court. United Democrat legislators have already indicated that they would introduce an amendment to the bill if the Government insisted on the Sino-British version of restricting the number of overseas judges to one. But Mr Hoare warned that if the amendment succeeded, the Government might set up the court according to Legco's decision, bearing in mind that it would be disbanded after the change-over. Or the Government would simply withdraw the legislation and notet up the court, he said. "It would not in anyway help to resolve the problem," said Mr Hoare. He said it was essential for the top level court to be set up by the handover to ensure a smooth running and operation before then.
