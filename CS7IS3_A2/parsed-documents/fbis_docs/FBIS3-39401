Noting that where the negotiator's duty ends the people's will begins, Denktas added that for the agreement to be viable the people should give their approval of their free will. Stressing that he is the defense advocate of the people and not a marketing manager, Denktas said that the only way to show the Greek Cypriots' ploy to the world is by means of negotiations and not by lamenting that the Turkish Cypriot is being sold. In answer to questions regarding the recent statement by Glavkos Kliridhis, leader of the south Cypriot administration, Denktas said that he has long since considered a referendum necessary should an agreement be reached on the confidence-building measures. He added that according to the Constitution a referendum is a prerequisite. In answer to a question about Kliridhis' repeating the EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] oath at a meeting in Europe as well as pledging on the Greek Cypriot flag that they are in office to fulfill to the utmost their duties toward Cyprus, Denktas recalled that Makarios, Kiprianou, and Vasiliou also shared the same views. Further stating that the Turkish Cypriots are aware of the Greek Cypriots' goals, Denktas added that the Greek Cypriots in turn are aware that the Turkish Cypriots are not going to let them have access to that goal. Denktas indicated that the Turkish Cypriot side will continue with negotiations so long as they do not pose a threat. Denktas reiterated that they will not consent to an agreement that will not be to the advantage of the people. Noting that there are reports as to the package containing items favorable to the Turkish side, Denktas added that the truth of these rumors will be revealed on the negotiating table. Stating that they depend on the people of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Denktas added that he expects the people to act with common sense concluding that the Turkish Cypriot side should not be the one to leave the negotiating table.
