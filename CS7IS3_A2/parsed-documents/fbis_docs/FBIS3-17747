Our correspondent Ihor Bak reports: [Begin Bak recording] Members of this delegation which arrived in Ukraine on 24 March -- including well-known politicians from a number of European countries -- have had the opportunity to obtain information, so to speak, first hand, in particular from the head of the Supreme Council, the head of the Central Electoral Commission, representatives of political parties, etc. Members of the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly delegation visited Zhytomir, Lvov, Donetsk, and a number of other oblasts, in addition to Kiev. On 27 March, that is, on the day of elections, the parliamentarians of foreign countries observed the progress of the elections in 80 constituencies, including those located in military units. Thus, having informed Ukrainian and foreign journalists of their conclusions, the foreign observers emphasized that the elections in Ukraine were held in accordance with Ukraine's law on the elections of Ukraine's people's deputies and with a high rate of citizen participation. They were gratified to note that the elections were held on an alternative basis [alternatyvna osnova]. However, at the same time, they stated that a great number of candidates for deputy seats in many constituencies caused serious troubles in the process of voting. Because of this, electors made mistakes during the voting, and a significant number of election ballots was found invalid. In spite of this, Peter Emery, head of the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly delegation, said during the news conference that we can state that the Ukrainian elections were democratic and successful.
