The process of formulation will begin as soon as possible and will be followed by signature and implementation. I also believe that this will take place within a few weeks, or rather in some days before the end of this month. What is important, however, is that there is a real breakthrough, seriousness, and a desire for quick accomplishment in order to implement the Declaration of Principles as soon as possible. I do not believe that there are significant problems on any topic now. ['Alima] Mr. Khalid al-Qidrah, member of the Palestinian delegation and the Civilian Affairs Committee: Apparently there is a breakthrough in some matters being discussed by this committee. Could you give us an idea in this regard? [Al-Qidrah] In fact, the Civilian Affairs Committee began its work in this round of talks yesterday. Negotiations in all fields, even in the Security Committee, are proceeding in an intensive and serious manner and with a clear breakthrough and a real desire to achieve a full agreement in order to implement the Declaration of Principles as quickly as possible. Yesterday and today, a review was made of all civil departments and issues which were not finalized in the previous rounds of negotiations. I believe that we have ended discussions on the public works department and electricity, and we are in the process of discussing the department of antiquities, population, and other issues. I also believe that these discussions will end because, as I said, work is taking place positively and with a desire to make an achievement and a breakthrough.
