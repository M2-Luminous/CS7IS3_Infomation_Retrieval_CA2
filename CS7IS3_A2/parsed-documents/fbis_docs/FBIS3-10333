The minister said the union leaders will not accept a bonus or a 100-, 200-, or 300-quetzal wage increase because obviously the salary hike is not the real reason why the government is being pressured. "If there was a genuine desire to find a solution to the problem, the situation would be different," de Molina affirmed. The finance minister said it still cannot be determined who is behind the destabilizing movement, adding that several fronts have been opened against the current administration. "There is invasion of land in the area of agriculture, kidnappings in the area of security, strikes in the area of labor, and limitations on the finance minister to obtaining resources. This cannot be a mere coincidence," Ana de Molina asserted. The minister declared that the position expressed by the economic cabinet on Tuesday remains unchanged; specifically, no salary negotiating process is being held with union representatives. The issue must be treated as part of the Great National Agreement (GAN) proposed by President Ramiro De Leon Carpio. The minister argued that a wage increase for all state workers cannot be called a coherent salary policy because a salary hike program includes a review of the efficiency and profile of the employee as well as his abilities. She added that by reorganizing the executive branch there could be room for a reclassification of wages for those who deserve it. The minister also said that if the government's offer of a 50-quetzal wage increase for workers earning less than 2,000 quetzales does not meet workers' expectations, it still represents a gain for workers and an expense of 120 million quetzales annually for the state treasury. The government proposal was to increase basic salaries by 50 quetzales and reduce the 360-quetzal bonus for fiscal collections by 100 quetzales, a proposal made previously by the National Federation of Public Employees Unions (FENASEP) and accepted by the government. Public workers, however, rejected the aforementioned offer. Bureaucrats Reject 50-Quetzal Increase Leaders of FENASEP and FENASTEG [National Federation of State Workers Unions] as well as leaders of other state labor unions yesterday rejected the 50-quetzal hike proposed by the government to solve the labor conflict. The bureaucrats termed the salary increase "an insult to the working class." FENASTEG Secretary General Felix Hernandez said: "The 50-quetzal hike proposed by the government does not meet the aspirations or expectations of state workers." FENASEP Will Not Talk With the Economic Cabinet The FENASEP leadership was scheduled to meet yesterday with the economic cabinet. However, the labor leader explained that they had changed their mind because "they are fed up" with those officials.
