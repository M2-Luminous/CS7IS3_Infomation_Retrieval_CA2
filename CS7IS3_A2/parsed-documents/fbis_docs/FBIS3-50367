He indicated in it that the rapid admission of the Visegrad Four states into NATO could have unfortunate repercussions for the fate of democracy in Russia. From this point of view, what is your assessment of President Clinton's visit to Moscow and the Partnership for Peace plan? [Yastrzhembskiy] I would like to turn first to President Yeltsin's letter, from which it is obvious that we are not opposed to individual countries choosing their allies according to their own way of thinking or to their joining military-political organizations. We wanted to make sure, however, that the interests of Russia are also taken into consideration in any measures to guarantee peace and security in Europe. In my opinion, the rapid admission of the Visegrad Four countries into NATO would mean a new division of Europe, whose lines would be drawn on the borders of the former Soviet Union. Therefore, we have proposed that security in Europe be discussed with the Russian Federation, and the course of President Clinton's visit to Brussels, Prague, and Moscow shows that the West has taken our point of view into consideration. The outcome of this is the Partnership for Peace plan, which, in many respects, is identical to our views. We rate the visit to Moscow by President Clinton very positively, and we see it as a heartfelt sign of the solidarity of Washington and the U.S. President with Russia. We think that the decision made by NATO in Brussels is sensible and realistic because it respects both the interests of NATO and those of the postcommunist countries in East Europe and the Russian Federation. [Sugar] The Atlantic Alliance was established after World War II as a defense against the penetration of communism into Western Europe. This danger has passed because the Soviet Union has collapsed, and its ideology has been discredited. Where does Russia see the mission and purpose of NATO in today's postcommunist Europe? [Yastrzhembskiy] This is an apt question. The former military and ideological adversary of the West, organized within the Warsaw Pact, has indeed disintegrated, and the question now is with and against whom NATO intends to devise Europe's security. We consider NATO to be an important partner, and we support all of its measures to bolster peace in Europe. NATO is still needed in Europe because a new threat to peace has arisen. The war in Yugoslavia is the most tragic example of where aggressive nationalism--which is rearing its head in many European countries, including the states of the former Soviet Union--can lead. In some countries this aggressive nationalism is even beginning to manifest itself in military actions, and that is a challenge worthy of NATO. The second question is, with whom. Partnership for Peace answers it because it expands the sphere of partnership not only to the members of the Visegrad Four but also to the other countries of the former socialist bloc. It is in the common interest of all of us to ensure that the transformation of postcommunist Europe proceeds calmly and in peace by civilized means without bloodletting and tense relations. [Sugar] This is true, but on both sides there is a certain mistrust founded in historical experiences. The Visegrad Four countries are concerned that democratic developments in Russia may spin out of control, and, therefore, they want to join NATO quickly. On the other hand, the idea that NATO military structures would be on the borders of the former Soviet Union is unacceptable to the Russian Federation. What is Russia afraid of? Of future developments in Germany, perhaps, against which Margaret Thatcher is also warning? [Yastrzhembskiy] As far as Germany is concerned, it is forgotten that NATO was also established to guarantee democratic developments in the former Nazi Germany and to prevent any return by Germany to its aggressive past. It seems to me that, in this concert of states, the German voice is a democratic one. Today's Germany is completely new and is one of democratic Russia's closest partners. Of course, in Germany--and in other countries--there are also extremist forces that make themselves known from time to time. Today's Germany, however, very sensibly nips these manifestations in the bud. [Sugar] What danger did President Yeltsin have in mind when he recommended in his letter that the Visegrad Four states not be admitted into NATO? [Yastrzhembskiy] We have already discussed this issue several times with our Slovak colleagues. The democratic leadership and a certain part of Russian society do not consider NATO to be their adversary. In politics, however, we have to take into consideration the psychology of the whole of society and the intellectual orientation of the army. Namely, we cannot claim that Russian society is united in its assessment of NATO. A certain part of society would view the presence of NATO military structures on the borders of the former Soviet Union as a threat to Russia's national interests, and the postcommunist forces would immediately use this course of action by NATO toward the East to unleash a campaign against Russia's democratic leadership and to discredit it. Under the current conditions, pushing NATO's borders toward the East would, objectively speaking, be directed against the interests of democracy in Russia because this would place President Yeltsin and his colleagues in a very delicate situation. The decision made by NATO in Brussels has sent us a signal that it accepts the interests of democratic Russia and that Europe's security cannot be resolved at variance with Russia's interests. [Sugar] Concern about further democratic development in Russia is aroused in particular by Zhirinovskiy's statements about Russia's aspirations for power and about the new division of the world. Zhirinovskiy is reminiscent only of Adolf Hitler in his tactlessness. Some Russian politicians make light of the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon, but Hitler was also just a figure of fun at the beginning. On what wave is Zhirinovskiy riding? [Yastrzhembskiy] We could devote the entire interview to this man because a whole series of issues is associated with him. It seems that several factors played into Zhirinovskiy's hands in the elections. For example, the factor of national humiliation. The collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from East Europe, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the apparent decline--temporarily, I am convinced--of Russia's political importance in the world have all had a very painful effect on the self-confidence of the Russian people. The mood was just as depressing in the Weimar Republic following the acceptance of the Treaty of Versailles. Zhirinovskiy is using this mood to propagate an ultranationalistic and ultrapatriotic program. Zhirinovskiy is also making use of the cruel aftermath of the shock treatment on the population's standard of living and is scoring points with his very simple recipes for dealing with problems. If we take a closer look, we can easily convince ourselves that this is demagoguery, but, during elections, citizens do not normally seek reality in election promises. For example, Zhirinovskiy declares that he would resolve the crime problem in three months. This really is just demagoguery because the crime rate is associated with the overall economic decline, and there are no miraculous solutions. After 70 years of the Soviet Union, our people have learned to believe in fairy tales, and they also believed Zhirinovskiy and his fairy tales about painless solutions to problems. He concealed the fact that the situation is really grave and complicated and that the government, if it wants to improve the situation, has to adopt unpopular measures. There is no other way. [Sugar] In the democratic elections, Russia adopted a constitution that executes the so-called presidential principle of government. However, isn't this system just a trap for democracy? What if Zhirinovskiy wins the next presidential election? [Yastrzhembskiy] In the situation in which Russian society finds itself, the best solution is, in my opinion, a presidential republic. Incidentally, strong executive power is a tradition in Russia, and it would be impossible to push for economic reforms and systemic changes in Russia without it. By the way, perhaps unity and internal stability are also best guaranteed by strong presidential--but democratic--power. Perhaps there will be a new constitution in Russia when the reforms make progress and democracy is bolstered. However, if it were to turn out that this presidential constitution could be a springboard for Zhirinovskiy, it would be in our common interest to prevent this. [Sugar] Russian politicians say that, following the elections, the social interests of the population will also be taken into consideration in the economic reforms. Can we also interpret this, in a certain way, as a kind of self-criticism on the part of the initiators of the shock treatment? [Yastrzhembskiy] I think that the strategic course of the Gaydar government's reforms was correct. Its failing was, however, that it did not devote enough attention to the social aspects of reform and that it also forgot to provide information on the economic policy. Macroeconomic schemes are quite incomprehensible to ordinary people, and, therefore, it was necessary to present them in ordinary language so they could be understood. The election results also revealed that, in a country like Russia, with the social habits of its population, the shock treatment should have been accompanied by stronger social assistance for the socially most dependent sectors of the population. The new government will do more as far as social policy is concerned. [Sugar] I would like to return to what you said about the aggressive nationalism that, as in the case of Yugoslavia, fans conflagrations on other territories by means of its ethnic minorities. The Russian Federation also faces this danger because there are strong groups of Russian inhabitants in many of the former Soviet republics. What will Moscow's policy be in this sphere? [Yastrzhembskiy] We will strive to ensure that the Russian-speaking population feels like an organic element of the state in which it lives and not an autonomous element. We are not advocating any special collective rights for them. We are asking, first and foremost, for individual civil rights that correspond to the world standard. We are interested in ensuring that these people continue to live where they were born, where they work, and where they gain recognition for helping the state to prosper through their work. [Sugar] When the Slovak prime minister or minister of national defense visit Moscow, some of the mass media begin to sound the alarm that Slovakia has ulterior motives and that it obviously does not belong to the camp of democratic countries. However, when the Hungarian prime minister or minister of national defense visits Moscow, the aforementioned mass media keeps quiet about this. Tell us, Mr. Ambassador, is there something dangerous for other countries behind good Russian-Slovak relations? [Yastrzhembskiy] If there are good relations between the governments of two countries, this will begin to alarm certain people and even arouse some jealousy. This jealousy has various motives and various aims. As far as the relations between Russia and Slovakia are concerned, I admit that we harbor warm friendly feelings toward Slovakia and that, in our relations with Slovakia and its young state, we are also following up on the cultural and spiritual ties that reach deep into the past. I will make no secret of the fact that, with regard to our current strategic interests, cooperation between Slovakia and Russia has great prospects, first and foremost, in the technical and economic spheres. We all know that a major part of Slovak output was oriented toward the Soviet market and, whether people like it or not, it is therefore in Slovakia's interest to make use of this orientation. This does not mean that Slovakia should forge good relations only with democratic Russia. There is a proverb: In order to fly, a man would need two wings. Therefore, I think that good relations between Slovakia and the East and Slovakia and the West would best suit Slovakia's national interests. Let me reiterate: The Russian market is very promising for Slovakia and, on the other hand, it is very important for us to have Slovakia as an economic partner. [Sugar] Thank you for the interview.
