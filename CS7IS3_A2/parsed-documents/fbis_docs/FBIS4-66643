Sharma: "Pack on Bilateral Investments: Rao for Global Pressure on Pakistan"] [Excerpts] London, March 14. India's growing impatience with Pakistan's role in Kashmir and its tactics at international forums was reflected here in the statements of the Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao. He reiterated his government's determination to achieve normalisation in that state through a democratic, political and consensual approach. (Britain today announced a \Pten million assistance for the World Bank rehabilitation projects in the quake hit areas of Maharashtra, report UNI [United News of India] and PTI [Press Trust of India]. This would be in addition to the \Pthree million assistance already given by Britain for the purpose. The British overseas development minister, Baroness Lynda Chalker, conveyed this decision when she called on Mr. Narasimha Rao here this morning. Expressing appreciation for British development assistance to India, the Prime Minister reiterated New Delhi's commitment to economic reforms. He said his government would pay special attention to the weaker sections of the society while initiating development programmes. Mr. Rao said India would welcome assistance in the infrastructural sector particularly in the field of energy. New Delhi is the largest recipient of British overseas assistance for 1993-94. The UK had pledged \P239 million to India during the period. Later in his meeting with the secretary of defence, Mr. Malcolm Rifkind, Mr. Rao stressed the need for greater technology transfer as also co-production, sub contract and joint marketing in the defence sector. The leaders in their 30-minute meeting discussed ways and means to increase defence cooperation between India and Britain. Earlier in the morning Mr. Rao had a breakfast meeting with the Mayor of London. [passage omitted] Mr. Rao's message to his host government as well as to the Indian community was more or less the same. He highlighted Pakistan's role in helping terrorists and described Kashmir as "another victim of a proxy war directed against India." Addressing the community at Guild Hall, Mr. Rao said terrorism in Kashmir sought to destroy India's sense of nationhood, secularism and democracy. Misguided youths indoctrinated, and equipped with instruments of violence from outside were engaged in mindless violence. It was not a religious problem and if the external factor was removed from Jammu and Kashmir, the state could return to normalcy, hold elections and revive economic activity. "The world must recognise that it is this external factor of Pakistan's instigation which keeps alive terrorist activity in Kashmir. The only intervention that is needed is pressure on that external factor to cease such support and enter into serious discussions with us on a peaceful and durable understanding. We have shown ourselves to be open to such a dialogue in spite of the provocative and unreasonable attitude of our neighbours, and will continue to remain so. He reminded the world of the amusing irony that a country on the verge of being declared a terrorist state should be able to loftily proclaim that they could not have discussions with us until our human rights record improved. It was because of a massive disinformation campaign that India, a victim of terrorism organised and financed from across the border, should sometimes find itself subjected to unwarranted criticism. It also found that the world was worried about the human rights of terrorists, who massacred innocent people or used religious places for political ends, but not of those who were being forced out of their homes, attacked and terrorised. Mr. Rao recalled that Punjab, after a decade-long nightmare of terrorist violence, had been turned into a peaceful state. The transformation was made possible by the patriotism of the people of Punjab and their faith in democracy. "Their fortitude and determination in the face of terrorism would be a remarkable chapter in India's post independence history," he added. Mr. Rao said India remained fully committed to secularism while fully respecting all religions. Over the centuries, minorities in India had enriched the mosaic of India's multicultural heritage, he said. India's economic reforms was another subject on which Mr. Rao addressed the Non-Resident Indians [NRI]. Mr. Rao said the economic situation had improved tremendously. Foreign investments had grown and there was a further role for NRIs who would find investments in India very attractive. India had taken several measures to remove difficulties of businessmen and the state governments were competing with each other for NRI investments. The NRI community was the second largest investor in India in 1993, going by approval figures, Mr. Rao said. The NRI community in Britain also had a role in shaping the Indo-British relationship which had reached a very exciting phase, he said.
