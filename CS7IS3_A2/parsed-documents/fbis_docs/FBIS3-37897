In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Kazannik noted that, "Boris Yeltsin perfectly correctly laid out a plan of legislative work. Without that it will be impossible to ensure law and order". The procurator-general said he was sure that, after the adoption of the anti-crime programme which the Russian president is now intensively working on, law and order bodies will find it much easier to increase the strength of laws in the Russian society. The president's address emphasized that, "A law-based state should be a strong one in order to guarantee peoples' safety, strike out against crime, and begin an offensive against corruption. A strong state is the basis for the continuation of reforms, the overcoming of the country's crisis, the establishment of basic economic restructuring, and the creation of conditions for economic stabilisation and growth". It was also noted in the address that, "In a law-based state, power is limited by the law, which is a necessary condition for such a state. For that exact reason the development of law can be considered a concrete policy towards the strengthening of the Russian state".
