FR940822-2-00047 FR940822-2-00035 [FRL&hyph;5040&hyph;6] Agency Information Collection Activities Under OMB Review AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected cost and burden. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before September 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information or to obtain a copy of this ICR contact Sandy Farmer at EPA, (202) 260&hyph;2740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Office of the Administrator Title: Information Collection Request (ICR) for Customer Satisfaction Surveys (EPA ICR No. 1711.01). Abstract: This is a new information collection request seeking generic clearance for EPA customer surveys, in accordance with the objectives of Executive Order (E.O.) 12862 ``Setting Customer Standards'' (September 11, 1993). The E.O. states that ``...Federal agencies shall take steps to survey their customers for the purposes of determining the kind and quality of services they want and measure the level of satisfaction with existing services.'' A subsequent OMB memorandum to Federal agencies (September 29, 1993) encourages agencies to seek generic clearance through OMB for information collection activities associated with customer surveys. This ICR fulfills the EPA's obligations under the E.O. by providing an efficient, expedited clearance process within the EPA for customer surveys. EPA services (such as hotlines, information clearinghouses, public affairs offices) conducting customer service surveys may request their customers to provide: (1) Identification information; and (2) opinion information related to the quality, timeliness and value of their service. The EPA may gather this information through mail or telephone questionnaires, or through focus interviews with selected customers. In addition, EPA programs that provide materials (software, guidance documents, manuals, brochures) to the public may seek customer feedback through short self-addressed customer feedback forms on distributed materials. The information will be used by the EPA to establish a baseline of information for developing strategies to improve Agency services, and as a yardstick for measuring the success of these strategies over time. Burden Statement: Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 20 minutes for mail surveys, 10 minutes for customer feedback forms, 15 minutes for telephone surveys, and 2 hours for focus sessions, for an average burden of 15 minutes per response including time for reviewing instructions, gathering and compiling the information, and completing and reviewing the response. Respondents: Individuals or entities that are directly served by EPA service organizations. Estimated Number of Respondents: 65,766. Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 1. Frequency of Collection: One time. Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 16,430 hours. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden to: Sandy Farmer, U.S.Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. and Timothy Hunt, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503. Dated: August 16, 1994. Paul Lapsley, Director, Regulatory Management Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20554 Filed 8&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
