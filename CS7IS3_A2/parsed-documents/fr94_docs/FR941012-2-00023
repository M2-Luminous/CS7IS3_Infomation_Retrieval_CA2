FR941012-2-00023 FR941012-2-00009 [C&hyph;301&hyph;401] Certain Textile Mill Products From Colombia; Notice of Conversion AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Conversion of the Scope of the Suspended Investigation from the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. SUMMARY: On April 15, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register the proposed conversion of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA) to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) for the suspended countervailing duty investigation on certain textile mill products from Colombia (59 FR 18101). Interested parties were invited to comment on the proposed conversion. No comments were received concerning the scope of the suspended countervailing duty investigation on certain textile mill products from Colombia; therefore, no changes have been made. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda L. Pasden, Office of Agreements Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230, telephone (202) 482&hyph;0162. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In 1985, the Department suspended the countervailing duty investigation on certain textile mill products and apparel from Colombia (C&hyph;301&hyph;401) (50 FR 9863; March 12, 1985). The scope of the suspended investigation was originally defined solely in terms of the TSUSA item numbers; no narrative product description was provided. On January 1, 1989, the United States fully converted from the TSUSA to the HTS, pursuant to section 1211 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The suspended investigation was terminated in 1990, and the HTS conversion was never implemented. However, the Court of International Trade (CIT) ordered that the suspended investigation be reinstated (except with regard to apparel from Colombia) in its decision dated May 7, 1992 ( Belton Industries, Inc. v. United States , slip op. No. 92&hyph;64). The CIT ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on September 7, 1993 ( Belton Industries, Inc. v. United States , 6f.3d 756). As a result, the suspended investigation was reinstated effective May 18, 1992 ( see 58 FR 54552, October 22, 1993, and decision memorandum dated February 25, 1994). Therefore, the Department took action to conform the scope of the investigation with the tariff classification system of the HTS. The Department, with the assistance of the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. International Trade Commission, analyzed the TSUSA-defined scope and identified those HTS numbers that reasonably correspond with the TSUSA-defined scope of the subject suspended investigation. On April 15, 1994, the Department published a proposed conversion (59 FR 18108) and invited interested parties to comment on this proposed conversion. Because no comments were received, the Department has not changed the HTS numbers for the scope of the suspended investigation on certain textile mill products from Colombia from those published in the proposed conversion. The HTS numbers for this suspended countervailing duty investigation are found in the attached Appendix. Dated: October 5, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
