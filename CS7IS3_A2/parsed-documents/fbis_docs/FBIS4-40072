The results of his tour are reviewed by correspondent Sergey Omelchenko: [Omelchenko] A Russian military presence in the Transcaucasus, whether in the form of bases, peacekeeping forces or specialists, is not some whim of generals or politicians. It is absolutely indispensable to the maintenance of stability, security and peace in the region. This conclusion can be drawn from the results of the talks which Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev held during his four-day whistle-stop tour of the Caucasus. Agreement was reached with Armenian President Levon Ter- Petrosyan, one of those in favor of having Russian military bases in the region, on the status of the base to be manned by a Russian motor rifle division at Gyumri, formerly Leninakan, and the stationing of a regiment in Yerevan. In Baku President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan proposed that a separate agreement on military- technical cooperation should not be signed. Instead this should form part of a general treaty on friendship and cooperation between our states. During the talks in Baku it transpired that Azerbaijan was not opposed to the idea of joint Russo-Azerbaijani control over the early warning radar station at Gabala, one of the biggest in the south. However, this question will be finally decided after further work has been done by experts. Incidentally Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia unanimously called for participation in a common system of CIS air defense. As far as a settlement of the Karabakh conflict is concerned, Azerbaijan did not in the end sign the protocol on a cease-fire and disengagement of forces, which Armenia and Russia signed on 17 May. However, Aliyev assured the Russian defense minister that he would do his utmost to stop the hostilities. From the results of the talks with the Georgian head of state and the Abkhaz leader one can draw the conclusion that the situation as regards a solution to the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict is significantly better. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said as much to me in an interview: [Begin Grachev recording] Both the President of Georgia and the President of Abkhazia are giving their agreement to peace- keeping operations. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin will sign a decree. This decree will be ratified by the Federal Assembly on 14 June, and we will be able to embark on the peacekeeping mission within three days -- five at the most -- after orders have been given for the operation to get underway. All our forces are ready. All we have left to do is to decide what combat equipment and how many men can be spared from the 345th Regiment. Then everything will be ready, I think. I consider that my mission here is over. I shall report to the president, and then we shall get down to work. [end recording]
