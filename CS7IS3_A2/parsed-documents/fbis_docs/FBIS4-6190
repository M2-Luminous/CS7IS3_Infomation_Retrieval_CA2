Foreign Minister Han, who is in Belgium, said: Although many experts believe North Korea will accept the additional nuclear inspections in late April, in early May, or in mid-May, the IAEA has set the deadline for North Korea's acceptance at around mid-May. Foreign Minister Han said: The IAEA has not set a definite date in mid-May as its deadline for North Korea to accept the additional inspections, but it will report to the UN Security Council when it is believed North Korea has exceeded the deadline. As a result, the North Korean nuclear issue will again be handled by the UN Security Council, as was the case in the UN Security Council presidential statement.
