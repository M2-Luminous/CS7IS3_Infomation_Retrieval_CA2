The law has clear deficiencies that require an amendment. The Federal Asylum Office checks the actual reasons for a person's flight only cursorily and in a superficial manner. In particular regarding the deportation of refugees to so-called safe third countries, procedures are not careful enough. Here one must check whether it is indeed to be expected that the refugee will be safe there. The great latitude in exercising the asylum law is also criticized. Interior Minister Loeschnak, on the other hand, presented a completely positive balance sheet yesterday: With a recognition rate of more than 19 percent of asylum applications, Austria is right at the top of the list in Europe. For the Greens, Loeschnak's balance sheet is a "cynical game of numbers." The UNHCR is starting a new poster campaign with the slogan: "Refugees are Human Beings Just Like You and Me."
