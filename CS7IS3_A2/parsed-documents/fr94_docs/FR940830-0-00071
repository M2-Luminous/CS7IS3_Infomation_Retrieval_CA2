FR940830-0-00071 FR940830-0-00013 Response: It is not accurate to suggest that HUD has combined the Annual Statement and Five-Year Action Plan in a way that violates the Act. The information related to the Annual Statement and Five-Year Action Plan remain distinguishable. The work expected to be accomplished in each of the five years will be identified on a Work Statement for that year by major work categories. Requiring HAs to only describe a major work category with quantity and cost without specifying work items within a major work category is in keeping with the statutory intent of granting more flexibility to HAs and eases the transition to full five-year fungibility. The HA must continue to provide residents with the opportunity to review the Annual Statement and comment on it, and such comments must be taken into account in finalizing the Annual Statement prior to submission to HUD. Definitions of Annual Statement, Work Statements and Annual Submission have been added to the rule. Level of Detail in Five-Year Action Plan vs. Performance and Evaluation Report (P&E Report) Comment: Numerous comments were received concerning the level of detail in the Annual Statement versus the level of detail in the P&E Report. Currently, the level of detail is the same in both documents; however, in the proposed rule, this provision was modified to require less detail in the Annual Statement and more detail in the P&E Report. One HA agreed with HUD's proposal to eliminate the current Annual Statement and Five-Year Action Plan and incorporate their information into a modified Five-Year Action Plan. They agreed that requiring HAs to describe a major work category with only quantity and cost without specifying work items is in keeping with the statutory intent of granting more flexibility to HAs and as such eases the transition to full five-year fungibility. However, they requested that HUD clarify the issue regarding ineligible costs in the Five-Year Action Plan. To further minimize major disagreements at the end of the process, CLPHA recommended that HUD should clearly spell out in advance any items which HUD will consider strictly ineligible. CLPHA urged that the list of ineligible items be shortened and that additional items be made specifically eligible under CGP. NAHR0 supported a five-year ``fungible'' approach to the CGP. However, NAHRO commented on the level of detail to be required in the new Five-Year Action Plan. NAHRO was concerned by HUD's statement on ineligible costs. It was found to give HAs the impression that when their P&E Reports are filed with the Field Offices, work items can be disallowed even if they are eligible expenses. In order for the Five-Year Action Plan to be ``fungible'' the actual details of how the funds were spent should be included at the end of the year, not at the beginning, in the Annual Submission. Both Field Offices and HAs should be familiar with eligibility of work items and guidance to both groups about eligible costs should be clear. However, NAHRO did not want Field Offices to believe that they can disallow eligible items. According to NAHRO, fungibility should allow the HA to decide what items they will do and where. Four IHAs indicated satisfaction with the guidance on eligible and ineligible costs, but noted that if HUD expands and or clarify these lists, they suggest that IHA's should be included in developing such lists in light of their unique modernization needs and differences from PHAs. Two commenters questioned HUD's proposal that if the HA performs a work item that HUD will not be able to determine if it was an eligible work item, then HA's would have to repay ineligible costs discovered during review of the P&E Report. It was suggested that this procedure could permit HUD to fail to properly review and then seek denial of funds or reimbursement later. A better approach is for HUD to have sufficient detail in the Annual Statement in order to make an eligibility determination up-front. This eliminates any question of how the HA should proceed. HUD still has the authority to deny funds or seek reimbursement from the HA that has clearly performed ineligible work. The HA did not support the Five-Year Action Plan minimal level of detail and the resulting discretion by HUD to seek reimbursement for ineligible costs. Another suggested approach was to reduce the agency's future CGP amount to recoup the ineligible expenditure.
