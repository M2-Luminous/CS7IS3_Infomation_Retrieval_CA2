Barkashov, leader of Russian National Unity, who is under investigation following the well-known events of October, corresponds to the truth. However, they refused to comment on this event, citing the fact that an official ministry report is being prepared. Barkashov was identified in hospital, where he underwent two operations after receiving gunshot wounds. In his words, he was shot at from a passing car at 0300 hours not far from the "Oktyabrskoye Pole" subway station. Someone brought him to hospital, bleeding profusely. There Barkashov spent a week before being identified. The arrested man was transferred to another hospital, under heavy guard. His condition is serious. But journalists visiting his wife have reported that he is still conscious. Stop Press: The Russian MVD Public Relations Center has announced that, as a result of current investigative measures by the internal affairs organs on 30 December 1993, Aleksandr Barkashov, leader of the so-called "Russian National Unity" movement, was discovered in a Moscow Oblast medical establishment. He was brought to the Russian MVD hospital, where he was given medical aid. The same source said that Barkashov was in hospital in connection with gunshot wounds received in a certain population center in Moscow Oblast -- not in the capital, as reported earlier. Criminal proceedings have been instituted in connection with the attack on Barkashov.
