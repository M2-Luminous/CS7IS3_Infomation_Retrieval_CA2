This decision was made, according to an official communique, because the situation "does not allow the normal functioning of bilateral cooperation between the two countries." The communique adds that Germany's interests in Haiti will be represented after 31 March by the German Consulate in Miami and that German humanitarian aid will continue to flow through nongovernment organizations and churches. Germany has traditional ties with Haiti and is one of the principal countries to offer aid to this Caribbean country. This aid includes the installation of hydroelectric plants over the past few years, as well as agricultural infrastructure assistance and scholarships for professionals and students. The Haitian-German Institute has been operating for one year in Port-au-Prince and offers classes in German.
