FR940812-2-00262 FR940812-2-00093 Federal Aviation Administration Approval of Noise Compatibility Program; Kissimmee Municipal Airport, Kissimmee, FL AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted by the City of Kissimmee under the provisions of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&hyph;193) and 14 CFR Part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description of Federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96&hyph;52 (1980). On January 11, 1994, the FAA determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by the City of Kissimmee under Part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements. On July 8, 1994, the Administrator approved the Kissimmee Municipal Airport noise compatibility program. Most of the recommendations of the program were approved. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of the FAA's approval of the Kissimmee Municipal Airport noise compatibility program is July 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tommy J. Pickering, P.E., Federal Aviation Administration, Orlando Airports District Office, 9677 Tradeport Drive, suite 130, Orlando, Florida 32827&hyph;3596, (407) 648&hyph;6583. Documents reflecting this FAA action may be reviewed at this same location. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for Kissimmee Municipal Airport, effective July 8, 1994. Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act (ASNA) OF 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility program which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps. The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel. Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor with respect to which measure should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150 program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act, and is limited to the following determinations: a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150; b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses; c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against types or classes of aeronautical users, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted by the Federal Government; and
