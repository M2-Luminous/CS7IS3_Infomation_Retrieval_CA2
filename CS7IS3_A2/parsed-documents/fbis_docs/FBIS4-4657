Commenting on the statement, the Japanese Government said it was very regrettable that the country failed to fully understand the international community's real intention. The government expressed particularly grave concern that the North Korean statement, in which the country said it had been forced to resume its suspended nuclear development, may become a decisive factor in leaving the country isolated in the international community. On the other hand, the government intends to make additional efforts to influence North Korea to accept inspections of its nuclear facilities, this time in cooperation with China, which still has influence in North Korea. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa held talks today with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is currently visiting Japan. In the talks they shared the view that China's cooperation is necessary to solving the issue of nuclear inspections of North Korea. Foreign Minister Han said the significance of the UNSC's presidential statement adopted at the end of March was that it held China to a sense of obligation to make progress on the issue. He said there was an impression that China was trying to play a more positive role than before. In response, Prime Minister Hosokawa said it is necessary for the countries concerned -- namely Japan, the United States, and South Korea as well as China -- to cooperate in influencing North Korea to solve the issue. They confirmed the intention to continue to urge North Korea to accept the inspections by the end of this month [April].
