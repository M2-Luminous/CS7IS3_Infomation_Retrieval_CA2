The restrictions on helicopter flights put in place by the Serbs are unacceptable, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said here. "We have therefore asked the French helicopter crews making these missions to refuse," these controls, she said. "The French authorities note that UN Security Council Resolution 913 demands an immediate and definite lifting of all blockages on the free circulation of UNPROFOR," (the UN Protection Force) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colonna added. Flights by British and French UN helicopters between Gorazde and Sarajevo were delayed again Monday by the Serbs. According to the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) -- struggling to save the most seriously wounded people in Gorazde -- travelling times have been quadrupled by Serb controls. The delays were fatal for the most seriously wounded patients at Gorazde hospital, an aid worker said at Sarajevo. Of the 600 due for emergency evacuation, 154 have been evacuated from Gorazde since Sunday. Sixty nine people were evacuated Monday up to the middle of the afternoon. [passage omitted]
