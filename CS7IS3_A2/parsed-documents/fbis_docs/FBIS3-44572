When asked to comment on French Foreign Minister Juppe's recent reiteration on hoping to restore Sino-French relations as soon as possible, Wu Jianmin said: "We welcome the positive statement made by Foreign Minister Juppe. We have time and again made clear China's principled stand and positive attitude toward improving the Sino-French relations. We hope to restore and develop the Sino- French relations at the earliest possible date on the basis of the principles for establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries." When asked to comment on the prospect that a new organization would be set up after the Paris-based Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] is disbanded in early April and it would invite China to join in, he said: The Cocom is a product of the Cold War and should have been abolished earlier. Any new organization to be established after the Cocom is disbanded should be conducive to the development of economic and trade ties, scientific and technological cooperation, and exchanges between nations.
