He graduated from the Vocational-Technical School on Mechanization of Agriculture and the Zaporozhskiy Machine Building Institute. He worked at an auto test site near Dmitrovo, having travelled the path from engineer to general director. Since November 1991, he has served as the head of the RF Gosstandart. [End of box] [Correspondent] With what, in your opinion, did the Gosstandart of Russia begin? [Bezverkhiy] Officially, it began in November of 1991 after the signing of the Edict on the Gosstandart of Russia by Boris Yeltsin. However, its roots go back to the Petrine times, when by the order of the Russian emperor the fleet was created, arms production was developed, the deliveries of flax and other products to foreign countries were expanded or, in the words of the poet, the "window to Europe was being cut." Under these conditions, life itself demanded the issuance of edicts by Peter I on establishing standards and requirements for good quality products, including export products, so as not to undermine the prestige of the Russian Empire. [Correspondent] What do you see as the primary tasks of Gosstandart at the current stage? [Bezverkhiy] If we try to express the essence of our activity in concentrated form, I would say this: To formulate a standards base for the implementation of economic reforms being undertaken in the country, and to implement a unified state technical policy in the field of standardization, metrology and certification. At the same time, I will emphasize: Our main goal is to help consumers, to protect the population against dangerous products, to support the entrepreneur and to create favorable conditions for goods producers on the entire territory of Russia, stimulating interest in the manufacture of only high quality, competitive products. Standards must open the door to the world market for producers. The Gosstandart of Russia has the capacity for providing specific services to goods producers. Among them are: Information on product requirements in Russia as well as abroad; Aid in performing certification of products under any requirements of standard documents, including international; Preparation of practical recommendations on improving products not corresponding to current requirements, performed by our qualified experts for enterprises, as well as aid in formulating quality systems which have been tested in world practice. We have to some degree inherited the structure of the USSR Gosstandart. However, the conception of the approach has principally changed. First of all, this is an orientation toward the international standard, a changeover to its direct application. At the same time, we have introduced the voluntary nature of the standard. Its requirements are mandatory for the producer only from the standpoint of safety of man and the environment. The standards, as I have already said, are international, and therefore if you want to trade only within the country and to make products which are not competitive on the foreign market, then you will consequently get a low price for these products. But if you want to earn currency, then you must fulfill the requirements of the international standard, or no one will take your goods. [Correspondent] Will the introduction of European standards not leave Russia outside the bounds of trade-economic relations with the countries of the European Union? [Bezverkhiy] Yes, the European Union is a closed economic group which has its own standards. If we want to cooperate with it on an equal footing, naturally we must raise the level of our standard-technical documents to the international level, and guarantee them if possible. Only in this way will we be able to establish the necessary trade-economic contacts. Since our greatest commodity turnover is with Europe, our producers must primarily be aware of the European standards. Our next step is to create a federal fund of standards of all types and categories, including international (regional) and national standards of foreign countries. [Correspondent] Has the restructuring within the Gosstandart itself been completed? [Bezverkhiy] For the present day, the legislative base for work under conditions of a market economy has generally been created. Legislation on consumer rights protection, on standardization, on ensuring the unity of measurements, and on certification of products and services has been adopted at our initiative. Other departments have prepared a number of the laws concerning questions of safety and environmental protection which have been issued, and which also touch upon questions of standardization, certification and metrology. Moreover, we have developed a set of sub-legal documents, as for example principle documents on certification. Altogether during the past two years there have been over 100 standards documents adopted, which create the principles, I would say, of a technical constitution regulating mutual relations of all economic subjects under conditions of a market economy. But this is only the first part. The second is the reform of the system of Gosstandart itself. On 12 February 1994, the government adopted the decree, "On Organization of Work on Standardization, Provision of Unity of Measurement and Certification of Products and Services." This government statute has exclusively important significance. Basically, it organizationally completes the creation of a state system of control and supervision over correspondence of products to mandatory requirements of state standards and provision of unity of measurements in the country. The principle for our committee and for the regions has become the government decision which states that the local centers of standardization and metrology receive the status of territorial organs of the Gosstandart of Russia. In essence, within their regions they implement the policy of the committee and act as the organ of state executive power, and at the same time as a state institution with the right to manage certain types of work on a contractual basis (noncommercial, nonprofit). It is no secret that the center of gravity for direct regulation of questions associated with the vital provision and resolution of social problems and the development of market economic relations is today ever more tangibly being shifted to the regions, and is being placed upon the local organs of executive power. This is specifically what determines the need for precisely formulating the basic guidelines of Gosstandart regional technical policy, so as to be able to maximally aid in the socioeconomic development of the regions and to give aid to the local administrative organs in this matter. [Correspondent] What legal sanctions are provided for violators of the standards and certification regulations? [Bezverkhiy] The law on protection of consumer rights, the law on standardization, and the laws on metrology and certification provide for rather strict measures of action--ranging from economic sanctions (fines) to criminal prosecution. While recently the manager of an enterprise which manufactured substandard products was fined by the ispolkom [executive committee] commission, in a symbolic manner, we might say, today such directors are given fines of hundreds and even thousands, and the enterprises are fined millions. For example, the A/O "Dartlend" was fined more than 60 million rubles (R). Unfortunately, the entrepreneur still rarely pays. We appealed to the court of arbitration, and they promised to find us methods of collecting this money. I spoke with the chairman of the RF Supreme Arbitration Court, Veniamin Yakovlev, and he support us. We agreed that in the near future we would appeal to the government or the Duma for adoption of an appropriate legislative statute. [Correspondent] Is there a real mechanism for realization of the Law on Consumer Rights? Or is it necessary to rely on public control which is implemented by the consumer societies? [Bezverkhiy] I believe that there is. Goods and services for which there are safety requirements are prohibited from sale without a certificate of compliance. Aside from this law, as I have already said, the Law on Certification of Goods and Services has been adopted, principle documents in this field have been developed, and around 60 orders of certification on types of products have been approved. After all, the certification of a tape recorder involves one set of regulations and standards. The certification of space products has its own requirements. The certification of tobacco goods--in general you do not know how to approach it, because smoking is harmful. In principle, it should be banned, but as long as they smoke, let them smoke tobacco, and not its substitute. Well, and so forth. For every group of uniform product, the central organs have also approved a certification--a sort of higher level, which defines the ideology and policy. There are 21 of them. They have also ratified a middle level which, specifically, is the one which issues the certificates. There are around 200 of these. I would like to stress: This is not only Gosstandart. Half is Gosstandart, and half is other organs of state administration and public associations. Around 600 laboratories have been accredicted. The essence of certification, the basis of consumer rights protection, is the testing of goods by a third, independent, party to see that they correspond to the standard. We are often accused of monopolism. Well, 7 percent of these laboratories are within the Gosstandart system, and 93 percent are outside of it. It is important for us that they operate according to unified regulations, which correspond to the international ones, and that they be independent if possible. We do not have a law like they have, for example, in the FRG [Federative Republic of Germany]. There they have fines ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 marks for dishonest entrepreneurial activity. And for violation of testing and falsification or omission of negative results--a jail term of up to 3 years. If we had such a law, the affiliation of the testing laboratory would be unimportant. I hope that we too will come to this. [Correspondent] Tell us, what are your relations with the state and social structures? Primarily with the State Committee on Anti-Monopoly Policy? [Bezverkhiy] They are normal business relations, although sometimes there is some friction and an absence of mutual understanding. But this, I believe, is an inevitable thing. For example, the representatives of the committee actively help us in the local areas. Nine supervisory departments--the anti-monopoly committee, the sanitary-epidemiological inspection, the Ministry of Health, our committee, the trade inspection, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and other agencies of executive power and departments--have signed a joint appeal to the heads of local administration with a request to create coordinating councils or commissions in the regions, which under the management of one of the deputy heads of administration would jointly resolve problems on ensuring the rights of consumers to safe and good quality products. Thus, we are delegating our powers and authorities to those organizations which are better informed in their field. This is how it is done throughout the world. However, at the same time we must, we are obligated, to remain monopolists in fulfilling our functions as the national organ of Russia which formulates the tactics and strategy for development of standardization, metrology and certification. It is we who ensure the work of the departments within the framework of mutually coordinated regulations and procedures. We maintain constant contacts with societies for the protection of consumer rights. Their representatives are present, as a rule, at most of our collegium meetings, speaking out with their comments and proposals. We always try to take them into consideration. We also invite representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and the Congress of Exchanges to our collegium meetings. We have concluded agreements with them. We have delegated them powers and authorities within the framework of the functions which they fulfill. [Correspondent] In other countries, the financing of standards development is performed primarily by companies interested in these standards. How is it in our country? [Bezverkhiy] In Russia, for a number of years standards have been developed not by institutes, as was done previously, but by technical committees. There the principle of consensus reigns supreme. The contractor, manufacturer, consumer, and representatives of Gosstandart and societies for the protection of consumer rights have the right to participate in them. However, none of the commercial merchants has invested a single ruble in this endeavor, perhaps because they live by ready-made standards which already exist and which may be used free of charge. Especially since these standards suit them for the present time. However, since the state does not finance such technical committees, we have found ourselves in an unenviable position. Let me cite an example. The president of a certain firm came to me and asked for an international certificate: I want to supply oil and oil refining products abroad, he says. He has mastered one thing well: Without a certificate, the price on his product immediately drops by 30-50 percent. I tell him that in principle it is possible to obtain such a certificate. For this we have accredited laboratories and developed procedures. The trouble is that 35 of our standards on oil and petroleum products still do not correspond to the international standards. Thus, in order to issue a certificate to the businessman, Gosstandart would have to revise our standards, which would require around R350 million. Where can we get this money? The entrepreneurs do not give it to us. The Minister of Finance also does not give it. Imagine how many years we would spend revising all 25,000 standards which are in effect today in Russia and the CIS countries if the merchants do not get involved in this work? [Correspondent] What is the premium for quality? [Bezverkhiy] In the USA, Japan and a number of other industrially developed countries, premiums for quality are very popular. They are given the names of outstanding people and, as a rule, they are awarded at a very high level, including the presidential. A country cannot have unconditional international recognition if it has not attained world standards in the quality of its goods. You yourselves know: If it is Japanese, that means it is good. After all, there is neither oil, nor cotton, nor other resources in the Land of the Rising Sun... So the Japanese have decided to make product quality the main priority in their work. This has become the national task, a matter of national prestige for every Japanese. In our country there have also been premiums for achievement of high technical-economic product indicators at various times. But, unfortunately, they enjoyed neither particular popularity nor authority. Well, and recently quality has generally faded into the background. However, we will not be able to make our ruble convertible if we do not manufacture products which are able to compete on the foreign market and which are capable of bringing us hard currency. I am convinced that the time is not far off when quality will become the national task and national prestige in Russia as well. As soon as the political passions subside more or less, Gosstandart will submit for the president's signature an edict on introducing a Russian premium on quality. Its distinguishing peculiarity will be the absence of monetary remuneration. It will be awarded each year in the name of the president. Goods producers who are laureates of this prize will receive tax benefits or the right to free advertising. It is true, the very fact of presentation of such a prize is already an advertisement. I believe this should motivate our producers to fight for this prize. [Correspondent] What is your attitude toward the elimination of barriers in international trade? [Bezverkhiy] The press has repeatedly announced Russia's intention to join in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). If we join in it, then we will be forced to bring all of our national standards--and, as I have already mentioned, for the present day there are 25,000 of them--into line with international practice. As for the former USSR republics, Gosstandart has concluded an interstate agreement with them, stating that "we will live according to unified standards." An interstate council has been created, and not only the CIS countries will participate in its work. A representative from Lithuania is always present at its meetings. Moreover, bilateral agreements have been signed with practically all the former republics, specifically on the mutual recognition of the certificate of compliance, so as to exclude expensive retesting. If we perform testing of a "KamaAZ" and supply it to Belorussia, they will recognize our certificates in that country. This also constitutes the elimination of technical barriers in trade. In general, I must say, the elimination of barriers is a clever thing: In words, everyone is `in favor' of it. Yet in fact, the EEC [European Economic Community], as I have already noted, is in practice a closed grouping of countries. In essence, normal access to this market is closed to any of our producers until we join in the EEC and until we harmonize our standards with the European ones. We also have our difficulties with GATT. Contrivances and tricks are being devised within its framework in order to support the industry of the member states of this organization and not to allow competitors. Of course, we are interested in removing the technical barriers in trade for our goods producers. For this purpose, the committee actively works within international organizations on a bilateral basis. Treaties have been concluded with England, Israel, Japan, and South Korea. I would like to stress that we have come to agreement on the mutual recognition of certificates. Please, let us perform mutual accreditation of testing laboratories. You may control them and perform inspection control. However, our relations must be on an equal basis. The ideal variant is large international agreements such as the Geneva Agreement on Automobile Technology. Its participants are practically all the countries of Europe, including Russia. Our certificates on automotive technology are recognized in all the European countries. If we issue the symbol E-22 to a car, then it is recognized as an international certificate in any country in Europe and the world. The same is true also in the production of firearms and munitions. Here the Brussels Convention is in effect, and we are completing arrangements for joining in it. You probably know that a treaty on partnership and cooperation between Russia and the European Union is to be signed in the near future. One of the articles of this treaty, prepared with the direct participation of Gosstandart, provides for measures directed at increasing the compatibility of systems of standardization and metrology and evaluating the level of compliance and consumer protection of the agreeing parties. Recently we held successful negotiations with our colleagues from the European Commission, at which we reviewed in detail the systems of mandatory certification. In my opinion, one more practical step has been taken in expanding the spheres of trust between Russia and Europe.
