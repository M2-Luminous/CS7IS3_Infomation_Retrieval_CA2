The direct cause of their deaths, in the shooting down over northern Iraq of two US helicopters carrying British, French, American, and Turkish officers, was that most embarrassing and terrible of military accidents known as friendly fire. American aircraft monitoring the "no-fly zone north of the 36th parallel mistakenly took the two Black Hawks for the Hinds used by the Iraqi military. This was an accident that should not have happened if established military procedures had been properly followed, and the Pentagon's investigation must be swift and thorough. But Saddam's brutality towards his own people is the reason for the presence in Iraq of the officers, and for the military surveillance operation itself. They were on a mission to liaise with Kurdish leaders and United Nations officials on ways to counter the increased threat from Baghdad to the aptly named Operation Provide Comfort. This humanitarian rescue mission was launched, at John Major's instigation, in April 1991 when Saddam's troops drove nearly two million Iraqi Kurds to what would otherwise have been death from exposure and starvation in the mountains to which they had been forced to flee. Three years after Iraq was chased out of Kuwait, Saddam still poses so direct a menace to Iraq's Kurdish citizens that they remain heavily dependent on UN assistance, within a "safe haven" which has constantly to be monitored by a multinational taskforce. Saddam has subjected this wholly admirable humanitarian operation to constant and brutal harassment. He has imposed an economic blockade against the north far more savage than the UN sanctions against which he inveighs. Iraqi agents constantly attempt to project into the safe haven the systematic state terror condemned by the UN's special rapporteur on human rights in the rest of Iraq as "crimes against humanity". UN guards protect relief workers, journalists and human rights monitors from ambushes, car-bombs and other forms of armed harassment. Since the beginning of March alone, eight UN guards have been murdered or wounded by Iraqi agents, in an escalation of attacks which supports the US State Department's allegation that Saddam has put a bounty of up to 6,000 pounds on the heads of UN personnel and other foreigners. The tension has increased since mid-March, when Saddam issued unspecific threats that Iraq would not "stand with its hands tied" and his key aides vowed, rather more specifically, to "return the beloved north to the motherland". Since then, the three army corps permanently stationed just below the 36th parallel have been reinforced by the deployment of three divisions of crack Republican Guards to join two already there. The Allied military force based at Incirlik in Turkey, which polices the no-fly zone imposed in August 1992, has been on heightened alert against a repetition of last year's Iraqi attacks on Allied aircraft. Saddam has been emboldened by the emergence of divisions within the UN Security Council over sanctions. Previous decisions to maintain them have been routine, but last month's was reached only after three days of intense discussion, with Britain and America resisting French, Russian and Chinese pressure to ease them. Firmness remains vital. Sanctions must not be relaxed until Iraq is in total compliance with all relevant UN resolutions. The UN needs at least a year to be sure that Iraq cannot manufacture prohibited weaponry and is finally co-operating fully with the UN's systematic longterm monitoring programme to prevent future cheating; but that is not the only issue. Saddam has yet to account for hundreds of Kuwaitis and other hostages taken during the Gulf War. Above all, in defiance of the UN ceasefire resolution and international law, he has renewed his claim to Kuwait. For all these reasons, his criminal regime remains as clear a threat to international peace as it is to the wellbeing of Iraq's terribly persecuted people. There is no case for letting vigilance slip.
