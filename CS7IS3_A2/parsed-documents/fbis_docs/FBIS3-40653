TRIMS and TRIPS, AMS and PSI, MFN and MFA, welcome to the alphabet world of the GATT. Little wonder that initials are so popular in an organisation whose boss is called "the DG" -- short for the director-general Peter Sutherland. GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, may be the world's best known four-letter word, and its signatories could not resist calling one of its eagerly anticipated offspring, GATS. That's short for General Agreement on Trade in Services, which will govern trade in services like banking and insurance if the seven-year Uruguay round of talks ever ends. Some of the acronyms were coined well before the round was launched in the sunny Uruguayan resort of Punta Del Este in 1986. MFN, the most favoured nation, can claim a certain following among people who have followed trade disputes. It refers to a country offering the same favourable terms to all trade partners, and is a pillar of the GATT. MRA, or the multi-fibre arrangement, has governed textile and clothing quotas for two decades. But the round has spawned an entire constellation of abbreviations that spin off the tongues of envoys like curses from the lips of sailors. There is DFA -- draft final act, for a two-year old rough copy of the treaty that might someday emerge. There are TRIMS -- trade-related investment measures, or rules and regulations that can distort trade. The GATT wants to protect (trade-related intellectual property rights), clean up PSI (preshipment inspection) and measure farm handouts with AMS (aggregate measure of support). Negotiators want to set up a DSB (dispute settlement body) once it has a DSU (understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes). And when new rules on safeguards, grey areas, serious injury and amber and green policies have been accepted, they will all be supervised by a whole new trade watchdog. GATT will become MTO -- multilateral trade organisation.
