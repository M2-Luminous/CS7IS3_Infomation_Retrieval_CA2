FR940927-2-00094 FR940927-2-00067 Metro-North Commuter Railroad (MNCW) Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;94&hyph;10 MNCW seeks a temporary waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Locomotive Safety Standards (49 CFR Part 229) for their locomotives. MNCW is seeking relief from the requirements of Section 229.135 that all trains operating over 30 mph shall be equipped with an event recorder by May 5, 1995. MNCW requests the compliance date be extended to December 5, 1997. The Locomotive Safety Standards were revised on July 8, 1993, to require each lead locomotive of trains operating over 30 mph to be equipped with an event recorder by May 5, 1995. The railroad states that off-the-shelf event recorders will be installed on conventional (non-MU locomotives) locomotives within the specified time, however, new design event recorders will be required for the Electric MU Locomotives. MNCW is requesting two years additional time for the design, procurement, manufacture and installation of event recorders on their locomotive fleet of 413 units to be equipped. The railroad cites funding, FRA and State-mandated purchasing practices, non-availability of off-the-shelf event recorders for electric rail cars, impact on car availability, limited physical plant and energy conservation/cost savings as the justification for the delay. MNCW estimates that 43 percent of their fleet will be equipped with event recorders by May 5, 1995. The Western Railway Museum (WRM) (Waiver Petition Docket Number RSGM&hyph;94&hyph;9) The WRM, of Suisun City, California, seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR Part 223) for one caboose. The caboose is used for educational purposes only and is operated at speeds of 15 mph or less in a rural area with no history of vandalism. The Ohio Central Railroad Company (OHCR) Waiver Petition Docket Number RSGM&hyph;94&hyph;10 The OHCR on behalf of their affiliate Ohio Southern Railroad, Incorporated (OSRR), seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR Part 223) for one caboose. The caboose, OHCR 553, a former New York Central all-steel caboose was rebuilt in the 1960's by the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad and is not equipped with FRA certified glazing. The OSRR operates between South Zanesville and Glass Rock, a distance of approximately 19 miles. An out of service line extends 14 miles from East Fultonham Junction to New Lexington, Ohio. The railroad states there is no record of vandalism regarding train movements. Train speed is limited to 5 mph in this rural area. Two trains are operated per week and mostly in day light hours. Owego Harford Railway (OHRY) Waiver Petition Docket Number RSGM 94&hyph;11 The OHRY seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR Part 223) for one locomotive. The locomotive, an EMD Model GP&hyph;9, is equipped with FRA certified glazing in the front and rear locations but not in the side windows. The railroad states there has been no vandalism in this rural area. The OHRY operates between Owego and Harford, New York, a distance of approximately 30 miles. Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (PW) Waiver Petition Docket Numbers RSGM&hyph;94&hyph;12 and SA&hyph;94&hyph;6 The PW seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR Part 223) for one locomotive. Locomotive PW 150 is a 25-ton diesel electric industrial switcher built by General Electric which was recently purchased to provide service on an industrial track which cannot accommodate a full size locomotive. This operation is on one-half mile of track at the end of the Bell Dock Railroad at New Haven Terminal, Connecticut. In addition, PW is restoring a section of track for a customer in South Providence, Rhode Island, and the locomotive will be used at that location. The locomotive is now equipped with new laminated safety glass. PW seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR Part 231) for Locomotive PW 150. Section 231.30 specifies requirements for locomotives used in switching service. PW requests relief from the requirements of this section since the locomotive was built without corner stairway openings and switching steps. The railroad states that a crew member would be either in the locomotive cab, on the cars or walking next to the equipment when in the street. Thus, safety is not compromised by non-compliance with Section 231.30. Nash County Railroad (NCYR) Waiver Petition Docket Number RSGM 94&hyph;13 The NCYR seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR Part 223) for four locomotives. The NCYR operates over approximately 20 miles of track between Spring Hope and Rocky Mount, North Carolina.
