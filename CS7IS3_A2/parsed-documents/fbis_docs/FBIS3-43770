Doe you think that real progress is being made and will the talks lead to a lasting peace? [Bires] The talks have now restarted and according to the agenda are going to discuss the political spectrum. I believe that the discussions will take some more time. If there is good faith from UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] the results will be favourable. We don't have a set time to end the negotiations. We want to discuss in a very serious way as we don't want misinterpretations of the agreement we eventually reach. So it will take time -- it's not a problem for us. We want the peace to be lasting of course and that will benefit the Frontline States and the SADC [South African Development Coordination] countries. [Hopwood] The UN special representative has appealed to both sides not to launch attacks while the talks are ongoing. What is the government's position on this? [Bires] We are on the defensive (militarily) to facilitate humanitarian aid to different parts of the country. There is no need for Angolans to die while we are discussing a lasting peace. It's very unfortunate that UNITA launched some attacks in Bengo, Cuando Cubango and both north and south Lunda provinces and at Malanje and Cabinda. Naturally the government has the right to defend itself. [Hopwood] It has been claimed that the Angolan government has requested a South African company to supply former SADF [South African Defense Force] soldiers to help the army? As far as you know is there any truth in the company (Executive Outcomes) claims? [Bires] It's not true -- because the Angolan armed forces were formed according to the principles in the Bicesse agreement (the 1991 Angolan peace accord). There are former UNITA elements in the army, even commanders who were UNITA. If we had foreigners in the army we would be denounced. Today we are capable of forming an army without foreign support -- except in the fields of logistics, the navy and the air force. [Hopwood] Is any aid to UNITA in the form of material goods and personnel passing through Namibia on its way to the UNITA strongholds? [Bires] I don't believe that. I don't think that Namibian soil is being used as a transition place for aid to UNITA. The Namibian government is taking measures to avoid weapons being directed to Angola and is enforcing the sanctions adopted by the UN Security Council. It is true that UNITA is receiving support from the extremist rightwing in South Africa via Zaire -- there is evidence of that. That is why UNITA is putting its vehicles and weapons in the north of the country and on the eastern border. They cannot gain such aid through the South. It was after the independence of Namibia that Savimbi chose Zaire to launch atrocities inside the country. As you can see Malanje, Lunda north and south and Zaire province itself are near Zaire. Further south in Cuando Cubango and Bie provinces there is not a lot of pressure compared to the areas near Zaire. [Hopwood] Is there concrete evidence of South African support? [Bires] There are some coordinated rightwing groups in South Africa supplying aid -- those extremists who were fighting the ANC are the same who are continuing to give support to UNITA. There is hard evidence for instance of the violations of airspace and the presence of heavy artillery, armoured cars and other war material in the north. Material that was in south-eastern Angola is now concentrated in the north of Angola. All of this cannot go through by land. It is being transferred by air. Airspace violations have been confirmed by Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia. [Hopwood] Is there evidence of mercenaries assisting UNITA? [Bires] In the past we captured whites working with UNITA. Today there are still whites assisting UNITA in strategic areas. There is evidence that there are mercenaries -- there are reports from local people that they were attacked by whites. There are also Zairean mercenaries -- Lingala and French speakers among UNITA forces -- according to local people. [Hopwood] Presuming there is a settlement could the government accept Jonas Savimbi taking up a position in a new coalition government? [Bires] Let me clarify some things. There have been negotiations with UNITA for the government which came out of the multi-party elections. UNITA participated in multi-party meetings before the election took place. UNITA contributed to the constitution and the electoral law. So a coalition existed. UNITA won seventy seats in the National Assembly. The discussions that are taking place now are seeking to create the necessary conditions for the second round of Presidential elections. That is the immediate objective. According to the constitution and other laws if Mr. Savimbi is to be given a status he may be deserves, then it should be a compromise according to the legal system of the country and the wish of the Angolan government. [Hopwood] How has the present war affected the embassy's efforts to promote economic, cultural and other ties between Namibians and Angolans? [Bires] Of course war brings destabilisation to economic and cultural ties. Unfortunately the war is affecting the country -- reducing the economy and there is not much opportunity for both peoples to promote economic and cultural links. Nevertheless there are very positive ongoing relations in some areas -- fisheries, public works and the Epupa project for example. These are some of the efforts being made by both governments. Once we get a relative peace there will be a qualitative jump forward in relations. [Hopwood] How many Angolans are living in Namibia? Does the Embassy experience any problems with divisions in the Angolan community here, i.e. between UNITA and government supporters? [Bires] There are many Angolans here -- hundreds and hundreds. It's not a phenomenen that results from the war, but from the movement of people between the south of Angola and the north of Namibia. At the moment there are four different groups in the Angolan community here. The first group are those who voluntarily decided to stay in Namibia before Angolan independence. The second group is here through family connections. The third are those who came here in 1975 (after Angola's independence). And the fourth are those who are coming in from the 1980s until now. We don't distinguish Angolans by political affiliation -- we simply treat all Angolans as Angolans. If they have a political role it is with their own parties and not with the Embassy. In 1978 the then Angolan government opted for a policy of national reconciliation. After ten years elements belonging to the FNLA [Front for the National Liberation of Angola] became involved in the structures of government and other institutions. Some Angolans from different parties were offered posts in government as ministers and so on. And the there was the full opening after the Bicesse Accords. So that's why I emphasise there is no difference in being Angolans of UNITA, MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] or FNLA. Of course there are fears. As an example UNITA has been refusing to transfer Angolan citizens from Jamba to Namibia for medical treatment. But we represent the Angolan government and are here to defend all Angolans. [Hopwood] Do you think that the situation in Angola is getting enough international attention, especially compared with other world trouble spots such as Bosnia and Somalia. [Bires] I don't think so -- what is going on in Angola is sometimes forgotten. The Bicesse agreements were reached because of the efforts of the UN and OAU. We have a special representative of UN Secretary General for Angola. Yet there was a lack of personnel, material and other aspects to direct a stable transition process. Our country is big -- some 1,246,000 sq km. But the assistance programme that was prepared by the UN for Angola was ten times less than the assistance sent to Cambodia for instance. The humanitarian assistance for Angola is twenty times less than what is being sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The UN was supposed to play an important role, but nothing is being done at all. One thousand are dying daily -- the assistance is not sufficient. I do not think the international community has assumed its responsibility for Angola. [Hopwood] Are you satisfied with the Namibian government's stance of neutrality on the Angolan conflict? [Bires] Namibia has not taken a neutral attitude in classical terms. Until very recently Namibian soil was being used to send humanitarian aid to the Angolan people. In Namibia there have been a lot of workshops and conferences looking at Angolan issues. Blondin Beye (the UN special representative) was here to inform President Nujoma of the Angolan situation. I think the Namibian government is giving all moral and diplomatic support to the Angolan government -- which we appreciate very much. Namibia is party to the efforts of the Frontline States. Our President was here recently to discuss Angola with President Nujoma and we asked for continued diplomatic and moral support. Namibia is being active in the application of sanctions against UNITA. [Hopwood] Finally, there many obvious links which tie Namibians and Angolans together. What is your vision for future Angolan-Namibian cooperation? [Bires] I think it will be a very dynamic cooperation. In terms of communications and road transport -- these are suitable areas for cooperation. We have a common coastline which is rich for fishing. We think the fishing industry can be an area for mutual cooperation between our two countries. Angola and Namibia can exchange experience in the mining of diamonds and copper. We have rivers bordering our two countries where various joint projects can be undertaken. The EC and the Nordic countries have expressed interest in using the Kunene river basin for various projects. In a time of peace we can change the physical spectrum of the sub-region.
