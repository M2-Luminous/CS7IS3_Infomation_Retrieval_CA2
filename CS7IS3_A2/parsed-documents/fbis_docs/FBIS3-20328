Therefore our country is no longer a battle zone. It is now a communications zone, insofar as conflicts can be prevented or offset. This is an opportunity that we have never before had in our history. Taking advantage of this opportunity is a challenge for German politics. German politics requires armed forces as a means of implementing a policy that prevents conflicts. The shape of the armed forces must correspond to this changed situation. To this end, one must consider what constants and what variables determine the development of the armed forces, so that we may reach planning decisions accordingly. The following factors have medium-term and long-term validity: -- The need to be able to defend German territory remains valid. This is the primary task for all sectors of the armed forces. In the future, however, this task can only be accomplished following mobilization, and only together with the alliance partners. When one considers the armed forces of Europe in relation to the defense capability of each of them, one concludes that the only serious land-based threat to Germany is Russia. Theoretically, any country not allied to us could pose an aerial threat if it possesses nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons of sufficient range. A serious maritime threat to Germany could only occur if all maritime links were broken off. But this is pure theory, because such a measure would also affect our NATO partners, and as far as one can judge there is no force on earth that could defeat, now or in the future, a NATO sea-based military operation. To defend itself, Germany requires the following: -- The ability to reconnoiter in good time any developments that could develop into a crisis; -- Land forces that, following a period of mobilization and military preparations, are fully capable, in cooperation with our alliance partners, of defending Germany against a potential danger from the East; -- Air forces capable of surveilling German air space in peacetime, and defending this air space in a time of war or crisis, following mobilization, and in cooperation with the alliance partners. -- Naval forces that, acting in cooperation with the alliance partners, can keep sea lanes open and prevent landings on the German coast. These are our defense measures against a situation that our politics must be aimed at preventing. This defense capability has a preventive effect. But conflicts can really only be offset when one conducts negotiations at an early stage and thus prevents the conflicts from developing further. Therefore, participation in alliance activity, especially in the containment of crises and prevention of conflicts, remains a constant for us. For this purpose, Germany needs army, air force, and naval units that can be rapidly mobilized and deployed, and can maintain their positions. These units are to be deployed in such a way that our country can meet its obligations vis-a-vis NATO and the WEU [Western European Union] and exercise its full responsibility as a UN member. Finally, the supply of modern, high-quality equipment to our troops is also a constant, for technological developments in the sphere of armaments are continuing, albeit at a somewhat slower pace. However, hopes that reduced quantities of high-quality military equipment would be sufficient for today's times have turned out to be somewhat naive. Here are some of the variable factors. The development of the situation in and around Europe can no longer be accurately predicted, unlike during the era of confrontation. But for the foreseeable future, it must be assumed that: -- An offensive by the strongest military power in Europe, the 1.5-2 million-strong Russian Army, would be possible only if there were a complete change in Russian politics, and there is no sign of such a change. But even in such a case, an offensive could not take place without extensive prior preparations, including at least a partial mobilization. Therefore, for the time being, one can expect advance warning of such a danger of at least 12 months. But we would only have a fraction of this time to prepare ourselves militarily. -- Europe must be prepared for the new risks and dangers. On the one hand, these risks can be explained by the fact that a new order has arisen following the collapse of the Soviet Union. But on the other hand, they can be attributed to the innumerable unsolved national and ethnic disputes in Europe; -- Our principle of security policy, defense measures, and armed forces activity will no longer be geared to just alliance commitments. Henceforth they will be determined by a mixture of our national security interest in offsetting conflicts together with our partners and our international commitments. Guaranteeing security in Europe is no longer sufficient. It is necessary to achieve security for Europe. Therefore, when assessing the situation, we must consider the problems that are spreading to Europe from the highly unstable peripheral areas of Africa and Asia. It is necessary to eliminate the causes of conflicts in security policy. For this purpose one requires armed forces that can be set in motion without a long period of preparation, and that can be used in various ways, from humanitarian missions to fighting operations. Our alliance commitments are as variable as the development of risks and the effects thereof on the shape of the armed forces. The basic commitment of contributing to collective defense remains unaltered, but the German contribution no longer consists of merely defending Central Europe. The Bundeswehr's "new" set of tasks is as follows: This fundamentally revised political framework shows the extent of Germany's increased international responsibility. It also indicates the need for a conceptual orientation of the Bundeswehr that acknowledges the fact that support for and participation in international moves to contain and prevent conflicts and crises is a task equal to the primary function of collective defense. This means having to maintain three categories of tasks for the armed forces, while adhering strictly to the principle that only the three categories together make up the Bundeswehr, and no category can exist without the other. The first category of tasks serves a protective purpose. It involves being at the disposal of NATO allies beyond German territory, and includes crisis management within the NATO framework. This is how we interpret the defense of Germany within the NATO alliance, whereby the defense of NATO territory is placed on a par with that of Germany. As part of the second category of tasks, the German armed forces must be in a position to contribute to the international prevention of conflicts and crises. The third category of tasks involves Bundeswehr participation in humanitarian and special missions, as well as preliminary training, and logistical and medical work. With this broad spectrum of tasks, the point is no longer to marshal the armed forces in the face of a broad-scale aggression, as was the case during the period of East-West confrontation. We will continue to be an army of unity, but we shall dispense with the idea of being a unified army, for we all know that the Bundeswehr was never unified in the past, and was unable to perform all its tasks independently. What is manifesting itself today is a "Bundeswehr of variety" not because of resources, but because of the altered political situation. Concerning the restructuring of our armed forces: Generally, the point is to gear the Bundeswehr more strongly than before to the two large but different tasks; a defense of the alliance on the one hand, and the containment of crises of the other. This will not lead to a separation, for military personnel must be interchangeable between each set of tasks. In the defense of the alliance, the hitherto broad-scale and rather static principle of frontal defense must make way for the principle of a flexible counter-concentration of forces. This requires even greater cooperation between the air, sea, and land forces, as well as mobility and flexible military structures. But the troops must be geared to a single form of operations, and they must achieve full operational ability only after an extensive period of training. In crises and conflict prevention, however, NATO-wide means of action will be implemented in the form of army, navy, and air force contingents that can be mobilized quickly and deployed rapidly and at great distances. In the sphere of planning, the fulcrum of our activity lies in the following fields: leadership, electronic command systems, wide-scale reconnaissance, helicopters, long-range artillery, air defense, air transport, first aid, and logistics. Our experiences from earlier operations are to be taken onto consideration. The following can be said: In the army, it is expedient to adhere to a balanced combination of mechanized, light, airborne, and air-mechanized forces, in other words, forces that are capable of providing fighting power for the air, coupled with ground support, logistics, and first aid. However, one must consider how to reconcile the considerable differences between NATO defense and crisis prevention in terms of structure, equipment, training, and logistics. This reconciliation cannot take place without changes to the infrastructure. The air force is faced mainly with the duties of air defense, precision weapons, and air transport, whereby it also has to face adaptation and modernization. The navy's main task will be to contribute to anticrisis operations without any geographic or time limitations. It will deliver supplies to personnel serving in destroyers and frigates distant from our shores. In addition, one must examine whether the navy can supply platforms serving as command, supply, and first aid bases for combat units. For the air industry, this involves even greater international cooperation, and at the same time a greater concentration on national production capacity of the following, which we need on account of defense capability: armored fighting vehicles, conventional submarines, sensor and transponder technology, aviation, and information technology. Concerning training in the Bundeswehr: Not only is training and equipment undergoing changes on account of the broader spectrum of tasks and operations for our Bundeswehr, but training also requires changes, something I have been emphasizing ever since I took office. Until now, the entire Bundeswehr has been geared to the task of deploying troops for defense purposes after a relatively brief period of preparation and, at the same time, commencing general mobilization. We must abandon this uniformity as well, as a result of the altered situation, in order to save money for investments. Training for national defense requires the adoption of a priority method of operation, in other words defense in a predetermined geographical area, under operational conditions that have largely been determined beforehand. This requires a period of intensive training of at least one month in advance of deployment, following partial mobilization. The training of units to counteract crises must be shaped in such a way that efficient units can quickly be formed out of larger closed units and quickly be sent to their area of operations. The training must involve all types of combat and all operational scenarios, cannot take just one area of operations into consideration, and must take into account the fact that there must be a fluid transition between all types of operations, whether humanitarian missions or peacekeeping operations according to Chapter VII of the Basic Law, and that any operation can develop into a combat one. There is good progress in facing up to the new spectrum of tasks. Motivation and dedication have risen in an impressive manner, and there is a broad-scale readiness to go into action even at great risk and at the expense of personal comfort, something one does not encounter too often in our country. But, on the other hand, military service has a bad reputation, and our society views soldiers as compelled to play a special part in the alliance. There is a lack of consensus in our country about the deployment and future role of the Bundeswehr. I am no longer capable of explaining to one of our marines in the Adriatic why a German ship or aircraft cannot enter Albanian waters or air space, even though Albania has permitted NATO to use its territorial areas to enforce the embargo against Yugoslavia. As a German, I also feel embarrassed when I imagine a situation where an aircraft flying over the Adriatic receives a radioed order to identify a ship in Albanian waters, followed by the sentence: You are a German aircraft, are you not? These are the expectations vis-a-vis society: A readiness to accept duties. Military service means a readiness to accept duties and risk one's life in discharging them. If we succeed in achieving a broad social consensus on this matter, then it will be easy to hold a debate about the Bundeswehr, its tasks, and its operations. Soldiers require support. We require a broad social consensus about the role of the Bundeswehr. The population must stand by the side of its soldiers and their families whenever they have to enter combat operations as a result of a political decision. The implementation of German unity must be the unequivocal priority of our country. It is also unequivocal among our soldiers. Nevertheless, reliable long-term financial planning for the Bundeswehr contributes to the credibility of our security and NATO policy. Just like the rest of society, our Bundeswehr is in the throes of a profound transformation. The armed forces are undergoing a change that is equal to a new beginning.
