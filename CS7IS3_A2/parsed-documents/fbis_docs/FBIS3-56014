Once again the North Atlantic alliance has demonstrated its powerlessness and internal discord over this problem. This is how a Berlin newspaper evaluated the results of the NATO Council emergency session. On the other hand, a number of French and British mass media sources believe the time is ripe for more resolute action by the bloc. The "France-3" television company and THE DAILY TELEGRAPH, for instance, reported with reference to Western officials that air strikes against targets in Bosnia and Herzegovina will in fact be carried out over the next few days. Mention is made in particular of the allegedly blockaded humanitarian route into Srebrenica and the Serb positions around Sarajevo. So what has actually happened? Has the North Atlantic bloc really made direct moves toward open military intervention in Bosnia? Naturally, there is no direct reference to air strikes or the decision taken in the concluding document of the NATO Council session. The NATO partners merely confirmed their "readiness to participate in launching air strikes in the event of continued gunfire by Sarajevo and attacks on servicemen from UN forces." At the same time, important changes have occurred in the approaches to the decision on the use of air power. Whereas previously the main ringleader militating for the use of air power was the United States, while France and Britain expressed opposition, believing that were this to happen their "blue helmets" would become targets for partisans, now both Paris and London favor strikes from the air. As for the United States, Washington seems to have swapped roles with its allies. Commenting on the outcome of the session, President Clinton noted cautiously that "NATO could be embarking on a very risky path." Most experts are inclined to assess the declaration on the readiness to carry out bombings as pressure tactics on the Bosnian sides prior to the new round of talks to be held in a week's time. That is, it is basically a matter of a peculiar military-diplomatic game. However, there is in this game a highly important factor which often remains outside observers' field of vision. Military figures like General Jean Cot, commander of the French "blue helmets" contingent, often get carried away with purely military logic. Let us recall the general's highly debatable conviction that "only force will stop the war in the Balkans." Civilian officials from the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in their turn suggest that direct military action will signify an end to humanitarian operations and hopes of a peaceful settlement. The conflict between General J. Cot and Cedric Thornberry, leader of the civilian mission, escalated a short while ago and led to the latter's recent resignation. It is J. Cot who has repeatedly submitted the issue of deploying air power for discussion at UNPROFOR headquarters, striving to attain the right to take a decision on this autonomously. The chaos which would arise if this right were used even once is obvious even to the uninitiated. UNPROFOR would then appear to the warring parties not as neutral but as a warring side, an ally for some and an enemy for others. The line between bombing raids "for the purpose of facilitating humanitarian operations" and air strikes aimed at weakening the potential of one or other side is too fine.
