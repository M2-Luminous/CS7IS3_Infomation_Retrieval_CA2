According to Yuriy Korenevskiy, deputy head of the air transport department of Russia's Transport Ministry, the plane's abrupt fall and crash could only have been caused by instantaneous decompression of the interior, caused by an explosion aboard the aircraft or collision with another object. However, Korenevskiy said that the professionalism and training of the A-310 crew is not in any doubt. Yuriy Vorobyev, first deputy minister for emergencies, said literally the following: The plane crash in Siberia happened suddenly. The crew did not transmit an SOS. So, the possibility of an act of terrorism cannot be ruled out.
