At the meeting, they exchanged views on how to deal with the "job summit" to be held in Detroit 14-15 March. Nagano said that "severe criticism may be voiced against Japan's trade and employment policies due to Japan's enormous amount of trade surplus and low unemployment rate." He then requested that "Our efforts to reduce the surplus or to ease regulations should be strongly stressed so that Japan will not be criticized for `exporting unemployment.'" In response, Sakaguchi said: "Due to the breakdown at the last Japan-U.S. summit talks, there is a possibility that Japan will be faced with a difficult situation. I would like to ask for cooperation also from the economic circles."
