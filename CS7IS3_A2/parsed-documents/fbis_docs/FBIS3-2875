The spokesman for the association, Yang Zhou, who was also detained, said he had spent three consecutive nights at police headquarters in Shanghai and was set free at midday Monday. "It's become a routine," Yang said by telephone. "They come to get me in the evening, I take my cigarettes and my tea, I sleep there and come home again in the morning." "They want to keep up the pressure, and they're not arresting me to show how human they are," added Yang, 50, who is a veteran human rights campaigner and one of nine founders of the Charter for Peace movement begun last November. Wang, 39, has also been campaigning for human rights for many years, spending three years in prison for his activity during the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement. The detentions of both men were part of a massive offensive against dissidents to coincide with the current session of the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, and the visit of United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher, which ended Monday. Bao Ge, another Shanghai dissident, said Monday police had instructed him to "keep quiet" during the upcoming visit to China of Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosakawa. He will be in China March 19 to 21. Xu Liangying, 74, a professor at China's National Academy of Sciences, said Monday he was still under heavy surveillance and was not allowed to receive foreign visitors. Xu and six other intellectuals wrote a letter to the government last week, asking it to release political prisoners.
