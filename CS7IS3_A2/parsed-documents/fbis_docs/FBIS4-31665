[begin Schmoegnerova recording] The letter of intent incorporates economic policy intentions for 1994 and 1995, which include a budget deficit of 4 percent for 1994 and a GDP rise of 3 percent for 1995. Our further aim is to hold inflation at 10 percent in 1994 and at 8 percent in 1995. Another of our macroeconomic aims is to maintain the internal convertibility in 1994 and 1995, with the proviso that, by 1 January 1996, we will have prepared a so-called full internal convertibility of the current account of the balance of payments. Apart from these macroeconomic intentions, or rather the government economic policy aims, the letter of intent also contains measures related to financial policies, the external financial sector, privatization, the financial restructuring of enterprises, and the building up of the financial sector.
