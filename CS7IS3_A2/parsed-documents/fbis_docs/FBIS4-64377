To the irritation of British diplomats, the Tehran street on which the depleted British embassy stands has been named Bobby Sands Avenue. A year after he died, a Sinn Fein delegation attended a "Conference of World Movements" in the Iranian capital. Iran repaid that compliment by sending observers to Sinn Fein's annual conference in the early 1980s. Two members of Sinn Fein visited the Iranian-backed Hezbollah organisation in Beirut in 1987 in an attempt to secure the release of Irish hostage Brian Keenan. The same year, Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, visited Tehran. British intelligence has been trying ever since to find out whether those open contacts -- more at the level of political solidarity than anything else -- would lead to more threatening covert links. This is the backdrop described yesterday by Whitehall sources after the Foreign Office announced that the Iranian charge d'affaires, Gholamreza Ansari, had been summoned for a ticking-off after intelligence reports of meetings between the IRA and Iranian intelligence officials in West Europe. Despite the perceived threat from Iran, there is no evidence that it has supplied the IRA with weapons or funds. Yesterday's initiative was pre-emptive. "At this stage specific alarm bells began to ring and they're still ringing," one official said, "and now the Iranians can hear them." According to British officials, the man in charge of links with the IRA is Amirhossein Taghavi, head of the Western European Section of Iran's Ministry for Intelligence Services. MOIS, as it is known by Western spy agencies, is the body responsible for contacts with subversive or terrorist organisations abroad, and is headed by a cleric, 'Ali Fallahian. Taghavi is also said to have co-ordinated ties with organisations such as Abu Nidal, Lebanon's Hizballah and the Greek November 17th movement. Some Iran-watchers doubted yesterday whether contacts with the IRA would have been initiated by the hard-pressed government of President Hashemi Rafsanjani and argued that it was more likely that radical factions outside the government were involved. Other experts pointed out that Iran's record on subversion and terrorism has been improving recently, a fact attributed to the country's need to reschedule its debts with foreign, especially European, creditors. Britain takes the Iranian threat seriously, although it sees a need to balance fears about terrorism with concern for trade and broader relations. Diplomatic ties, severed in 1989, were restored in 1990 and there are 14 British diplomats in Iran, serving under a charge d'affaires. The long-standing threat to kill Salman Rushdie, author of The Satanic Verses -- repeated recently -- is seen as evidence of Tehran's intentions. And there was fury in London when Ali Fallahian, the MOIS chief was invited for official talks in Bonn last year. In the past Iranian intelligence organisations have become a battleground in the fight between reformist and radical factions which has plagued the Islamic regime virtually since its inception in 1979. Ordinary Iranians live in fear of these bodies, which have been behind the arrest and execution thousands of people and the regular campaigns on Islamic dress which have led to the detention of hundreds of women. Western intelligence sources have also focused on the activities of the Pasdaran or Revolutionary Guards, the ideological army of the republic. In the last year or more, the radicals are said to have lost a lot of support as most Iranians became preoccupied with the economic crisis. But the latest move comes at a time when the IRA's financial resources are under increasing pressure from security and intelligence agencies in the UK and the United States and when it is seeking more sophisticated arms, including specialist sniper rifles and anti-helicopter missiles. A spate of armed robberies the early 1990s offered a clue that the IRA -- which is estimated to spend 5 million pounds to 7 million a year -- needed funds. Contributions from US sympathisers have been falling and are estimated to amount to less than 100,000 pounds a year. Law enforcement agencies have turned their attention sources of funds including drinking clubs, cross-border smuggling and fraud. This month, police in Britain and both sides of the Irish border launched operation Madronna, seizing cash stolen property and financial documents. The operation was symptomatic of a squeeze on paramilitary funding by the Royal Ulster Constabulary's C13 unit. Where weapons are concerned, the IRA still holds huge arsenal provided by Libya in the mid-1980s, hidden underground bunkers across the Irish Republic. At the end of 1992 it was estimated that the Provisional, north and south of the border still had 650 Kalashnikov AK type semi-automatic rifles more than a dozen general purpose machine-guns; about 20 DSHK Russian heavy-calibre armour-piercing machine-guns; one SAM-7 surface-to-air missile (nine others have been recovered); more than 40 RPG rocket launchers six flame throwers; 70 Webley revolvers; more than 600 detonators, a three tons of Semtex explosive -- half the Libyan arms ship six years earlier. Security sources believe this could sustain the armed conflict for years.
