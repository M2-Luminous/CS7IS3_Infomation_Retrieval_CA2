Farell met with the media in the Carranza Room of the Los Pinos presidential residence. He was accompanied by Attorney General Diego Valades and Federal District Prosecutor Humberto Benitez Trevino. Valades said the new office "is a noble project." Benitez commented this is an efficacious response to the people's rightful demand for security. The coordinator discussed the need for citizens to cooperate with the authorities in preventing and fighting crime. He reiterated what was said Monday during the announcement of the creation of the new office, that it will establish avenues for communication with the Secretariats of Government and Defense, the Navy, the Federal District, and state governments in "working to safeguard public order." Farell said his office will try to forge links among security corps so that they become more effective in both preventive tasks and the fight against crime. The coordinator said the most adequate course will be sought to determine the guidelines and actions that must be undertaken by offices directly or indirectly in charge of matters having a bearing on public security. Referring to Valades and Benitez, who were at his side, Farell said both are "old friends who have told me they want to cooperate enthusiastically in this endeavor which will strengthen peace in Mexico." Valades and Benitez spoke later, after being introduced by Jose Carreno Carlon, the director general of the Presidency's Public Relations Office. Valades said he will work enthusiastically on the mission the president assigned to Farell for the sake of the country's security. He noted: "As an aide to the president of the country, as a public official, a citizen, and an attorney, I am convinced of this project's worthiness and of the need for establishing efficient coordination mechanisms." As Valades sees it, "no one better than an illustrious attorney, a distinguished public figure, an eminent teacher, and an outstanding Mexican could lead this coordination effort." He continued referring to Farell by noting: "He will have all my support and that of all officials in the Attorney General's Office." Immediately thereafter, Federal District Attorney General Humberto Benitez Trevino spoke in more or less the same terms as Valades. He pledged to support Farell "so the people will have what they deserve and are demanding: more and better security." Benitez Trevino said: "Our chief, President Salinas, has appointed Arsenio Farell, an exceptional Mexican, a man of law, an impeccable public servant, and an accredited university professor. He is the best guarantee that the inhabitants of the entire country will have the improved security which they are rightfully demanding." Thus concluded the Public Security coordinator's brief presentation to the news media. Later, reporters received copies of the agreement whereby the new office was created, which was published yesterday in the DIARIO OFFIICAL DE LA FEDERACION [official gazette]. The agreement establishes that it will be the coordinator's duty to: coordinate national public security actions established by the federal executive in accordance with applicable laws; establish mechanisms for the Attorney General's Office of the republic and the attorney general in the Federal District to adequately and efficiently fulfill their duties; and to propose pertinent measures and establish agreements with the state attorney generalships on national public security matters. The presidential agreement also points out that the coordinator will propose and establish efficient and timely channels of communication between the aforementioned institutions to safeguard national public security; it will coordinate and follow up on the agreements that are reached by the National Security Cabinet, sending them to the president of the republic for consideration and to ensure their fulfillment. The coordinator will also carry out duties entrusted to him expressly by the federal executive. Finally, the agreement establishes that federal administration departments and institutions will provide, in a timely manner, the coordinator with the information and support he may require to fulfill his duties.
