FBIS4-45258 "jptdd025__l94010" JPRS-TDD-94-025-L JPRS Narcotics 31 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA BOLIVIA Operation To Halt Exchange of Stolen Cars for Cocaine in Operation To Halt Exchange of Stolen Cars for Cocaine in Santa Cruz Detailed PY3105224194 La Paz Television Nacional Network in Spanish 1700 GMT 31 May 94 PY3105224194 La Paz Television Nacional Network Spanish BFN [Text] Amalia Pando has a report for us from Santa Cruz on a recent operation against drug trafficking involving customs and Army personnel. [Being recording] [Pando] Military and customs personnel have been involved in allowing stolen cars in Brazil and Paraguay to enter the country. The vehicles were exchanged for cocaine at the border. This ring was discovered during an operation named Trebol. Santa Cruz District Prosecutor Francisco Bornstein has a report on this case. [Bornstein] More than 20 people have been arrested, 15 vehicles confiscated, and two car sales lots have been closed down. The investigation continues because the ring is very large. [Pando] Has the size of the drug trafficking organization been established? [Bornstein] This is a ring that even has links with the United States and Europe, which is where the drugs are definitely sent. This discovery will allow customs authorities and Army and police officials to take the necessary measures, as some of their personnel are involved, because otherwise it would be impossible to bring a vehicle from the Paraguayan or Brazilian borders. These vehicles would have to cover certain roads where they cannot be found. Those under investigation said they handed over sums of money to customs and Army personnel. [Pando] This drug trafficking ring has used practically all the border posts, and the smaller the post the better for them. [Bornstein] Customs will have to make some corrections in the control system. It will have to carry out an appropriate investigation and control of its personnel. The Army will have to do the same, as the vehicles enter the country from Pedro Juan Caballero, (Joe), and Eugenio Garay in Paraguay at the Bolivian border, where the Army has personnel for carrying out control operations. [Pando] The stolen vehicles that were exchanged for cocaine were mainly Mitsubishi and Toyota vehicles, and were exhibited for sale until last week in two car sales lots in Santa Cruz. The two businesses were closed down. Bornstein regretted that military officials at the border points were not cooperating as they should to identify the military personnel who cooperated with this ring of cocaine and stolen car traffickers. He added that despite this situation, the names of all the members of this ring will soon be known. [end recording]
