Prime Minister Rabin last night spoke on the phone with Presidents Clinton and Mubarak mainly on how to secure the continuation of the peace talks. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports: [Begin Hecht recording] In Jerusalem, the Hebron massacre is being compared with the deadly mortar shell in the Sarajevo marketplace. Jerusalem hopes the shock, here just as there, will make the parties realize that there is no other way but to join in an effort to complete the negotiations as quickly as possible. The comparison with Sarajevo was mentioned more than once in the discussion the prime minister held last night with U.S. President Clinton, who called after midnight. He reiterated his personal commitment to the success of the peace process. Egypt's President Mubarak also called the prime minister and updated him on Yasir 'Arafat's difficulties in dealing with his fellow PLO leaders. The way to bring the PLO back to the negotiating table also goes through Moscow. The Russian foreign minister last night spoke to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and promised his help. Kozyrev also spoke to Yasir 'Arafat. This, therefore, is the message Jerusalem delivered to Tunis through Washington, Cairo, and Moscow: Do not be silly; do not let terrorism win. We are also having a hard time with our excited opposition. We have always distinguished between handling terror and making the effort to bring peace. The prime minister knows that the resolutions the cabinet will pass this morning should cushion 'Arafat's way back to the talks. Following recommendations from the attorney general, Rabin will present the ministers with several ideas, such as imposing travel restrictions on Kakh activists, disarming extreme settlers, and deporting the hard core of the settlers from Hebron. Rabin will brief the ministers about the imminent release of Palestinian prisoners. He has not yet accepted the idea of setting up a state commission of inquiry. This is public relations, the prime minister said, this is no real answer. [end recording] Last night, Prime Minister Rabin met with 70 foreign ambassadors in Israel, including the U.S. and Russian ambassadors. In the meeting, Rabin for the first time revealed that the negotiations will resume in Washington on 2 March. Sheli Yehimovich reports: [Begin Yehimovich recording] We, the prime minister told the ambassadors, immediately accepted the U.S. invitation to come to Washington and resume the talks there on 2 March. We do not have any information regarding the PLO response, and we expect developments in the coming week. I understand the shock the Palestinians are in. After all, they were the victims, but I expect them to follow our example. We also suffered casualties of terror acts, yet we made a distinction between this and the political process. I expect the Palestinians not to create a linkage or conditioning between this incident and the political process. The ambassadors only asked a few questions: Did the assailant have personal motives, or was he a member of an ideological group? The prime minister said: There is no proof that the act was part of an organized activity. As far as we know, this dreadful and mad act was perpetrated by a single individual. Will Israel make more compromises? the ambassadors asked. Israel will do everything to speed up the process, Rabin said. We are very close to concluding an agreement on the security issues, but there are several macroeconomic problems. This is not a question of making compromises, he said. We are committed to the Declaration of Principles. Both sides must make compromises in negotiations. [end recording]
