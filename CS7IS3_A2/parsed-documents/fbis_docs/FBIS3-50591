Denying the participation of former Salvadoran guerrillas in the Mexican guerrilla movement, Juan Ramon Medrano, one of the former FMLN commanders, said "it is extremely speculative" to make charges when there is no "concrete proof" about an alleged Central American participation in the uprising. A senior Mexican Government official said on 3 January that Central American guerrillas might be involved in the armed actions of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), which publicly appeared on 1 January and has been involved in clashes with the Mexican Army. According to the latest official figures, the fighting has left 86 people dead. "There is much speculation. Our only responsibility has been to serve as an example," Medrano said, adding that the FMLN waged a civil war in El Salvador for more than 10 years. Medrano, current FMLN propaganda chief, said that the armed actions that broke out in the last few days in southern Chiapas State, on the border with Guatemala, "sound a warning bell that the Mexican Government should hear." The leader of the former guerrilla movement said that Mexican President Carlos Salinas, who firmly supported the peace process in El Salvador, "has shown that he has a modern outlook, so we trust he will hear the demands" of the rebels. Medrano added that the causes of the outbreak of violence in Chiapas are deeply rooted in the economic and social problems of the people of the region.
