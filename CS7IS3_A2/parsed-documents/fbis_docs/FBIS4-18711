GATT economists say in an annual report that global exports grew by only 2.5 percent in 1993, a deceleration from the 4.5 percent increase seen in 1992. The value of global merchandise trade dropped 2 percent to $3,580 billion between 1992 and 1993. Trade in services -- including tourism, transport, telecommunications, insurance and banking -- is estimated to have grown a modest 3 percent in 1993 to $1.03 billion according to preliminary findings. This compares with a 12 percent increase in 1992. GATT says that this poor performance in trade was largely due to recession in continental Europe, where both exports and imports fell for the first time in 40 years, and that recovery in this area was crucial to its forecast. The report says that if there is a mild recovery in Europe, the volume of world trade could expand 5 percent or more. But "if, instead, delays occur in the recovery of West Europe or in Japan, trade growth is likely to be closer to last years 2.5 percent," it adds. Low demand in several European countries, including France, Germany and Italy, coupled with the dollars appreciation against European currencies, meant the dollar value of West Europe's trade had fallen 10 percent, the largest decline since the Second World War. The report says that the latest figures for continental Europe and Japan suggest that recessionary pressures had receded by the end of last year but that it is still too early to tell whether recovery has begun. Trade activity remains relatively weak in Africa, the Middle East, Central and East Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union. In contrast, Asia, Latin America and North America recorded above-average growth in Import volumes. Latin America had the biggest growth in export volumes, up 9.5 percent in the last year, followed by Asia with a 6 per cent rise in exports. North American export volumes rose 5.5 percent in 1993 compared with 8 percent in 1992. Canadian and U.S. import volumes Jumped 11 percent compared with 8 percent the previous year.
