FR940406-0-00189 FR940406-0-00012 B. National Environmental Policy Act The agency has analyzed the environmental impacts of the MY 1996&hyph;97 light truck average fuel economy standard in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. Copies of the Environmental Assessment are available from the Docket Section. The agency has concluded that no significant environmental impact will result from this rulemaking action. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency has considered the impact this rulemaking will have on small entities. I certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required for this action. No light truck manufacturer subject to the standard will be classified as a ``small business'' under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In the case of other small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units which purchase light trucks, the standard will not affect the availability of the full range of light trucks or have a significant effect on the overall cost of purchasing and operating light trucks. D. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the MYs 1996&hyph;97 standard will not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. E. Civil Justice Reform This final rule will not have any retroactive effect. Under section 509(a) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (the Cost Savings Act; 15 U.S.C. 2009(a)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle fuel economy standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or enforce any law or regulation relating to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy standards applicable to vehicles covered by the Federal standard. Under section 509(b) of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2009(b)) a state may not require fuel economy labels on vehicles covered by section 506 of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2006) which are not identical to the Federal standard. Section 509 does not apply to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 504 of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2004) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal average fuel economy standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. F. Department of Energy Review In accordance with section 502(j) of the Act, NHTSA submitted a pre-publication copy of this rule to the Department of Energy for review. The Department made no unaccomodated comments. List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 533 Energy conservation, Motor vehicles.
