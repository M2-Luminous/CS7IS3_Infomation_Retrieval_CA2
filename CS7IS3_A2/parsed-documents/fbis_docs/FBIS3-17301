Quoting Russian airborne troops commander Colonel-General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, the paper said that there are 1,200 Russian paratroopers in former Yugoslavia. A month ago from the Klis airport in Serb Krajina, where then 900 Russian paratroopers were stationed, 400 men were moved to Sarajevo, who, contrary to normal regulations marched some 500 km in 24 hours. The Russian battalion in former Yugoslavia, popularly called "Rusbat," has been divided, Yevgeniy Podkolzin said. Now there are two Russian battalions in Yugoslavia. The first one, which left in Klis, is commanded by Colonel Sergey Voznesenski, and the second one in Sarajevo -- by Colonel Viktor Vorobyov. The federal assembly has decided to despatch another 300 paratroopers and an echelon with armoured vehicles. According to U.N. peacekeeping force regulations, any military equipment arriving at the places, where U.N. missions are being carried out, is paid for according to international prices. In the given case the United Nations will purchase armoured personnel carriers from Russia, the paper writes.
