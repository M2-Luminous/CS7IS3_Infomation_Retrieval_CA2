According to a recent poll, 40 percent of the people want the occupied territories in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be retained, whereas 60 percent favor unification with other parts of the former Yugoslavia. Similar answers were also given with regard to the consequences of the [UN] sanctions. Of those polled, 20 percent think that the sanctions against the Serbs and Croats in Bosnia [as published] could remain in force for another couple of months, while 40 percent argue that the sanctions should be lifted because the country is facing starvation. Any belief that the super-dinar might work wonders has dwindled into insignificance. The Easter liturgy, which was broadcast on all the radio and television stations of former Yugoslavia, was conducted by Patriarch Pavel II in the monastery of Peja in Kosova. The Serbian militants see this liturgy as representing their rightful claim to part to Kosova and Metohija -- the heartland of the medieval Serbian empire. The chetnik leader Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan, an individual who is wanted by Interpol as a war criminal and whose Party of Serbian Unity suffered a fiasco in the last elections, last Friday [29 April] in Prishtina, in the presence of his idolaters, demanded the deportation of 700,000 [Kosovar] Albanians to Albania. Arkan threatened to amputate the legs of the U.S. soldiers stationed in the neighboring republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] if they dared to cross the border with Kosova. At the same time he publicly made numerous territorial claims on Macedonia. On the eve of the Orthodox Easter, the army of the former Yugoslavia ended its large-scale military maneuvers in Kosova and Sandzak, which, according to the chief of the [Yugoslav Army's] General Staff, showed that the Yugoslav Army fears no enemy whatsoever.
