During his inspection of Hubei, Liu Huaqing energetically called for building a national defense industry characterized by high and new technologies, speeding up the national defense modernization drive, making the national defense industry submit to and serve the central task of economic construction, and contributing more to national economic growth. Liu Huaqing stated: The old generation of revolutionaries have all along been very concerned about the national defense industry. They have not only offered brilliant expositions on national defense development but have also personally supervised a large number of key defense-related scientific research projects. As a result, China has now joined the ranks of the scientifically and technologically developed countries. Over the past few years, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, China's defense-related scientific and technological undertakings have registered faster growth. In the years to come, we should continue to carry out more arduous work, constantly forge ahead, continually make explorations, and strive to live up to each and every ardent expectation placed on us by the old generation of revolutionaries in this connection. Liu Huaqing pointed out: Having been tempered and trained over the past several decades, China's defense-related scientific and technical personnel and managerial personnel have now become a professional contingent capable of doing hard work, offering selfless devotion, and making more contributions to China's national defense cause. With this highly competent and commendable contingent, China's national defense modernization drive definitely stands a very good chance of success. Liu Huaqing maintained: China's national defense industry should strive to keep abreast with the current rapid high and new technological development, should organically combine domestic scientific research achievements with advanced foreign technology and equipment, should continually improve and upgrade defense-related technology and equipment, and should more efficiently implement the strategic principle of active defense. In the years ahead, in order to ensure systematization, integration, and reliability, we should set higher technological requirements on and new goals for the country's defense-related scientific research, should vigorously improve scientific research management and quality, should avoid formalism and fraud in scientific research, and should conscientiously and meticulously conduct scientific research. Liu Huaqing emphatically noted: Now that the whole country is giving top priority to and taking economic construction as the central task, the country's national defense industry should unswervingly submit to and serve the overall interests of economic construction and should actively support industrial and national economic development in local areas.
