But I wonder, disregarding official reactions, how the event has been received by the public in the countries of the East, which have been knocking on Brussels' door for some time. Will they perceive in it the raising of another barrier and a reaffirmation of the old divisions of the continent? Will they perceive in this enlargement to new members yet another reaffirmation of their status as second-class Europeans? When the struggle between the east and west blocs ended, many predicted that the partitioning of the old Europe into two political areas would end soon, too. Unfortunately, anyone who follows the affairs of these countries, known until recently as the Iron Curtain countries, must now acknowledge that this prediction, if not groundless, was at least premature. In practice the division remains, and is perhaps growing sharper. Just as though, where once there stood the barbed wire and watchtowers of the so-called Iron Curtain, there is still an intangible but real barrier. In so saying, I am referring not only to the economic and commercial factors that are slowing and complicating the negotiations for some of these countries' full European Union membership. Nor do I want for the moment to talk about the prospects facing the major country of the East, that is, Russia, which now seems more uncertain than ever before. Let us keep to the part of central East Europe that is closest to us and that we could therefore have expected to be within closer reach of the membership process. However, some problem signs have been emerging from there recently. They tell us that, despite everything, the two Europes remain distant, in spite of the hopes. They are political events that reveal the difficulty still being encountered by their governments' process of integration into the West European outlook and therefore suggest dangers of their lapse back toward more or less grim solutions. Let us consider, first, the case of Hungary, that is, the country that in many respects seemed one of the most "ready" and best suited to inclusion in the West European circle. Recently several dozen journalists were dismissed by the state radio and television service without any explanation other than that their attitude was inconsistent with the government's. There is no doubt that Hungary is having to deal with some serious problems of conversion, including that of an inflation rate which is much higher than those of its the western counterparts and the need for foreign investments. We must also give credit to the successive governments since the collapse of communism for having curbed the internal radical nationalist tendencies, traditionally strong among a people who believe that they have always been sacrificed -- to a world conspiracy, on the subject of borders. Nevertheless, it is a bad sign, or at least a sign of precariousness, when a government takes issue with the representatives of the media. Another warning has come from Slovakia. We must remember that when that country decided about three years ago to separate from Prague, there were some people in our country who regretted the fact, recalling that a similar separation took place in the Hitler era. But there were also some, starting with the League and other irresponsible people, who celebrated the event. The fact is that Slovakia is now in the midst of a political and economic storm. Its backwardness with respect to the neighboring Czech Republic is obvious, but the political repercussions are even more serious. Its leader, Vladimir Meciar, the former communist who donned a new nationalist guise and who promoted the split, has in turn been disowned by his supporters and forced to resign, so all the signs are that a period of turbulence and dangers has begun for this Eastern republic, too. The situation with which Romania is grappling seems even more serious. When Ceausescu was brought down, for some days the whole world followed anxiously, live on television, what appeared to be a people's revolution. But how much news coverage is devoted now to events in Romania? The fact is that some sad things are happening in that country. The 1989 revolt is increasingly emerging as a mere palace coup planned and carried out within a single ruling class. Romania's economic situation has not made any decisive progress even from the dark days of the Conducator, with inflation running at around 200 percent. Under these circumstances the two demagogic nationalist parties -- the PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party] and the PRM [Great Romania Party] -- are able to dictate their own terms, influencing the government with the threat of stirring up the people over the issues of nationality. Thus, after a brief pause during which it attracted the world's attention, Romania seems to have lapsed back into its Balkan oblivion. We have left until last the recent good news about the conclusion of an agreement on Bosnia between Croats and Muslims for the formation of a federal republic. But will this be the much hoped-for turning point? Will it spell the end of the latest Balkan bloodbath? It is justifiable to express skepticism. It may be doubted that a diplomatic operation carried out in private far from the battlefields can actually disarm the opposing sides, can bury traditional rancors and hatreds revived in recent years by massacres of one home after another, one family after another. All the more, since there are still many unresolved issues. For instance, how can Slovenia and Croatia aspire to join the family of European peoples if they cannot even succeed in resolving their own modest dispute? To conclude: The enlargement of Europe to the north (Sweden, Finland, Norway) and to the center (Austria) takes Europe to its furthest possible extent. But at the same time, it underlines the enduring division between the two Europes. It will take time before the other Europe frees itself from its old plagues, which are now revealing themselves in returns to authoritarianism and eruptions of nationalism.
