[Rodriguez] Look, it is rather difficult to talk about who has the money, because everyone says: Well, who has it, because I do not have it. And there are those who even question whether there is an excess of currency. I believe some colleagues are still thinking that this issue of the 14 salaries, or the 14 months of pay cannot be true, that there must be an error. However, when you make an analysis of the bank accounts....[pauses] I recently had access to some data, to some research made by some banks and some economic research centers, and they said that 10 percent of those people having savings accounts accrue almost 60 percent of all the money saved by savings account owners in the People's Savings Bank. If we analyze the fact that the money can be kept by society in the same manner, we are saying that approximately 10 percent of the active population, 10 percent of the people who are actively working, must have accrued that high percentage of money. [Roque] But this is only a supposition. [Rodriguez] A supposition in the case of the money on the street, but there are precise data about the money kept in the bank. I believe that... [Roque, interrupting] Are you trying to establish a parallel line between the number of people who have money in the bank and those who might have that excess money on the street? [Rodriguez] Yes, I base this on the argument used by the economists as well. I agree with them in this point: If you analyze that 10 percent of the people with savings accounts have 60 percent of all the money, and that the remaining 90 percent of savers have only 40 percent of the money, well then we can transfer that to the remaining money which is circulating outside and we can say, not categorically, but we can logically say that 10 percent of the working people have most of the money which is circulating today. [Roque] You said you would delve deeper into this subject. [Rodriguez] Yes. Let us delve deeper. I believe that in order to reach certain conclusions regarding the highly complex issue of who has the excess currency... [pauses] because we cannot know since we cannot conduct a door to door search because that would be a violation of everyone's right to keep money at home. Thus we have to conduct an anlysis in an effort to get an approximation of the truth. For example, underground market prices... [Roque, interrupting] The black market, so that everyone understands clearly. [Rodriguez] What happens is that according to economists, the term black market does not encompass everything. The black market is only that part of the market based on illegal merchandise. However, when you and I exchange our rations of cigarettes or rum, that is also the underground economy and this we are seeing more of this. When I render a service and charge you a lot, that is the underground economy. It is not precisely the black market. Thus, the term underground economy is broader. [Roque] I am glad you clarified this because in a recent program we were left with doubts about the underground economy and the black market. [Rodriguez] The black market falls within the underground economy. [Roque] Let us return to our subject. [Rodriguez] When we analyze the underground economy and its prices, undoubtely it is clear that most people participating in the underground economy have gone from purely buyers to sellers. Why, if this did not happen before, is it taking place now? When you speak with the people you hear: I have to sell something in order to buy something. The high prices are not set by the money in circulation money or the lack of supply alone, but because there are people with plenty of money capable of affording that merchandise because they have money in abundance. You and I, perhaps, who live off our salaries alone, who do not have another source of income but our slaries, find it hard to fully participate in that market because that is a market which has become smaller. [Roque] The truth be told, we frequently have no choice but to access that market. [Rodriguez] We have to because, as everyone knows, the official market does not guarantee all the basic needs of the Cuban family nowadays. Therefore, we have to access that informal, underground economy to meet a number of needs, merchandise as well as services. [Roque] Particularly, essential needs. [Rodriguez] The most necessary. For example, food. That is one of the things for which most people have to access that market. However, when you access this market you are not in a position to do this at any price because you are not well off. Undoubtedly, there is someone who sets the prices. That someone is the people who have a lot of money. In a study....[pauses] There are several studies on the underground economy; this has not escaped study by specialists. They have studied the underground economy thoroughly in terms of research and polls. Although there is no data, because is it highly difficult to determine the percentage of merchandise moved, there are estimates. It is known that at the same level that the national economy experienced a shortage of supplies, the underground economy experienced the same crisis, in the same proportion. The movement of merchandise within the underground economy for 1992 was estimated at 15 billion pesos. This does not mean 15 billion in the hands of the underground economy but that the same peso that you give someone is given to someone else and the money circulates. [Roque] What should be understood clearly is that the phenomenon of the underground economy is not a trait of the special period alone. It is something that has been there all along and it happens in other societies. Capitalism also has an underground economy. [Rodriguez] Capitalism is the seed. The origin of the underground economy origin lies in capitalism. When you analyze the underground economy and the way it operates in a capitalist country, and the way it operates in our country, the characteristics are very different. [Roque] Well, I think we are moving away from the objective we have set for today, which is to learn who has the excess currency. [Rodriguez] I want to return to that part when we got into the disquisitions about the way the underground economy operates. We must clearly understand that the merchandise circulating within the underground economy comes from the state companies or from the state stores. [Roque] And this is caused by the lack of control and leads to theft, etc. [Rodriguez] Of course, theft is fostered by the lack of control, and this lack of economic control is what gives an injection of merchandise to the underground economy. Many people often ask: And if that merchandise is found in the black market, why is it not controlled and returned to the state stores? I think this is a question asked by everyone, even by the company directors. They ask: Well, what happened to my merchandise? It was taken from my store. Well, when you make an inventory at the end of the year, it is reported as a loss, and often not even as loss because it involves products not yet paid for, and this is what unleashes all these problems we are experiencing in our own homes. [Roque] It is time now to arrive at a conclusion on this subject. [Rodriguez] Well, to conclude this idea, it is obvious that a small group of citizens have most of that excess of currency, more than 11 billion pesos -- well, it was 11 billion by December. We are now deep into 1994, and perhaps it must have already increased to almost 12 billion, or perhaps to 11.5 or 11.6 billion, because I have no idea of the rate of increase in the excess currency. But it is known that only a small number of citizens have it. It is known that this small group of citizens are today called money hoarders [macetas]. We know that these people are the ones who are today affecting the tranquillity and the development of this society. But the workers in the workplaces are loudly demanding firm action against these people. I believe that when action is taken against them, and when measures are adopted to make a financial balance, when there is control, and when production supplies the markets again, then we will talk about other subjects, but no longer about excess currency or who has the money, or what problems are there to increase the black market. [Roque] I am happy that you concluded your statement in this manner, but I want to make it clear to you that there is more need to make people aware of this problem, and that they must be willing to solve it. [Rodriguez] Of course. I think we must say that this will not be solved by collecting all the money, because money is not a problem in itself, but something that serves to barter, a means of barter, but it is nothing materially important. [Roque] I want to thank Osvaldo Rodriguez for being with us to answer this question: Who has the excess currency?
