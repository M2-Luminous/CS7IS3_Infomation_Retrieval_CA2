Provincial leaders fear the new tax may drive away foreign investment, which has been the key to the fast growth of many coastal areas. Officials in Guangdong, Fujian and Shanghai will delay implementing the tax, and instead try to bargain with Beijing. They have told foreign businessmen that they would be able to flexibly set their own capital gains tax rates on property. In the Special Economic Zone of Shenzhen, officials have told investors that property deals signed last year would not be subject to the new tax. But the Minister of Finance, Liu Zhongli, said on Monday [31 January] that local governments had no choice but to obey the new regulations laid down by the central authorities, the pro Beijing Wen Wei Po reported. But Liu said that any modifications or adjustments in the tax set by local authorities will be considered "invalid without any exceptions". The minister added that the views and suggestions of some foreign businessmen would be solicited before detailed regulations for implementing the new tax are released. Shanghai's mayor, Huang Ju, is scheduled to visit Beijing next week to demand a reduction in the tax rate, an official at the city's Foreign Investment Commission said. Huang's trip follows an unsuccessful attempt last week by State Planning Commission officials to persuade the city to accept the tax. A delegation from Beijing which visited Shanghai last week was subjected to biting criticism from Huang Ju and other Shanghai officials. "This is a very big problem. We want to follow other provinces in fighting the tax," the Shanghai official said. Meanwhile, Guangzhou's Vice-Mayor Dai Zhiguo told visiting foreign businessmen on Friday the city would send a delegation to Beijing before the Spring Festival to fight the tax. "Our strategy is to delay for as long as possible while we bargain with Beijing," Dai reportedly said. Fujian is also now considering ways to get around the tax, following a special meeting of province-wide foreign investment officials in mid-January, a Fuzhou official said. One approach being discussed in Fujian is to delegate collection of the tax to municipal and county governments, which would be left to decide whether to levy the tax themselves, the official said. Local officials seeking to attract outside investment are not likely to be over-zealous in administering a tax whose revenues flow to Beijing. But it will be extremely difficult for the central government to monitor compliance if implementation is delegated to the county and municipal level. Fujian's response had been prompted by news of Guangdong's intent to resist the new tax, she added. "Guangdong's actions are being used as a reference by all of us." The anti-tax sentiment is strongest in coastal provinces and cities, where officials see it as a threat to foreign investment. The controversial new tax requires all capital gains on property to be taxed on a sliding ranging up to 65 per cent for gains over 200 per cent. But the deductions allowable under the new law are vague and unclear, according to Michael Taylor, an economist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. "This makes it impossible for investors to calculate their actual liability." There seems to be no provision for this to be offset against the profits tax of 33 per cent to which property developers and investors are already liable. The Finance Minister defended the new tax as a means of suppressing pre-sales of property developments. A People's Daily commentary on January 16 called for strict enforcement of the new property capital gains tax, asserting that the "property fad" is rearing its head again, creating a negative impact on national economic development and efforts to curb inflation." [no opening quotation marks as published] "If large amounts of social capital flow into property and real estate and it is allowed to develop blindly, infrastructure and the revitalisation of key manufacturing industries will be seriously affected," the commentary said. There was little sign of resistance from provinces and municipalities in northern China, however, which have traditionally been less bold than the south in defying orders from the centre.
