Frei said that the government is aware that the sea is one of the bases for national development, and he thus wants to act accordingly in that area. He noted that the government will decisively support the modernization of the Navy, which plays a key role in safeguarding Chilean sovereignty, in effectively patrolling the sea, and in protecting Chilean rights on the high seas. Frei said that he would continue to develop a comprehensive fishing policy, which at this stage should reinforce its administrative mechanisms to promote equitable access to these resources and make rational use of them. Frei announced publicly that he is committed to creating the conditions for and facilities to bring about the adequate improvement and development of the ports, which he characterized as the backbone of Chile's maritime presence. In this regard, he emphasized the decision to incorporate the private sector in developing these ports. Frei was the only speaker last night at the opening ceremony of the Month of the Sea celebration. He thus became the first chief executive to open this celebration since it was instituted 20 years ago by Admiral Jose Toribio Merino, retired. Attending the ceremony, which was held at the Playa Ancha naval auditorium, were Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma; Secretary General of the Presidency Genaro Arriada; Transport Minister Narciso Irureta; Chamber Speaker Jorge Schaulsohn; Navy Commander Jorge Martinez Busch; General Richard Quass, representing the Army; General Jose de la Fuente, representing the Air Force; General Fernando Cordero, representing the Carabineros; and members of the Navy high command, among other officials. Frei stated that there have been contradictory interpretations of the right to fish on the high seas, which have led to the abusive depredation of resources and environmental degradation. He called for an international regulation process to prevent this sort of abuse without affecting the fundamental freedom to fish or the high seas laws, and without aspiring to an extension of the national maritime jurisdiction. Frei pointed out that the Convention on Sea Rights grants the country having the coastline the sovereign rights to explore, exploit, preserve, and administer natural resources within its exclusive economic zone. He added, however, that regarding the shared fish species, these rights lose their validity because the country having the coastline has no ability to preserve and administer the said resources found beyond the 200 mile zone. Frei explained that in order to improve the legislation on the high seas, which are conceived of as an asset for the public good, the objectives of Agenda 21 approved at the Rio-92 summit must be taken into account. On this basis Frei pointed out that Chile has a five-point proposal which, as its first step, calls for international acceptance of the UN Convention on Sea Rights, which has been paralyzed as a result of disputes over ocean mining. The said proposal considers first of all the negotiation of an international convention on the preservation of fish species that live in various zones and are highly migratory.
