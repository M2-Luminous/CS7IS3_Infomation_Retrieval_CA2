The appeal was issued by the Vatican's "Cor Unum" Papal Council, which is headed by Roger Etchegaray and deals with relations between Catholic organizations and international aid bodies. In its statement, the council also urged the international community "to intensify its presence in the field and diplomatic mediation, since one cannot remain indifferent or passive in the face of this genocide." Cor Unum officials on April 25 met officials from about 30 Catholic organizations and from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to discuss ways and means of allowing relief aid to reach Rwandan refugees who are fleeing attacks from Hutu and Tutsi tribes. "To understand the seriousness of the conflict," the Vatican's statement said, "one must remember that the largest exodus is taking place since the Gulf War, involving hundreds of thousands of people in flight. Victims are innumerable, especially among civilians."
