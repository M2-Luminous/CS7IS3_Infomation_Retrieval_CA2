"'Arafat's call is simple theatrics with no substance," said Ibrahim Ghawshah, the Amman-based spokesman for Hamas. "He is trying to cicumvent Hamas' demand for shelving the so-called peace talks with Israel," Mr. Ghawshah told the JORDAN TIMES. Mr. Ghawshah was referring to a Feb. 28 letter from Mr. 'Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), to Musa Abu Marzuk, head of the political department of Hamas. The PLO leader's letter, which came in response to a Hamas message calling on him to abandon the peace talks in the wake of the Feb. 25 Massacre of Muslim worshippers by one or more Jewish settlers at a Hebron mosque, "did not touch the essence of Hamas' position," Mr. Ghawshah said. Furthermore, by sending an envoy to Washington in response to a call by U.S. President Bill Clinton on Arabs and Israelis to resume the peace talks, Mr. 'Arafat "has reaffirmed that he has no intention of moving from the course of surrender he has adopted," Mr. Ghawshah said. In a Feb. 28 open appeal to the rank of file of Fatah, the mainstream PLO group founded by Mr. 'Arafat, Hamas said: "We appeal to our brothers in Fatah to join hands and escalate the Intifadah and holy war against the enemy." "The (Hebron massacre) in which hundreds of our people died confirms the righteousness of resistance and armed struggle, and exposes the Zionists' claims that they wish to coexist in peace with our people," it said. In his message to Hamas, Mr. 'Arafat said: "It is the hour of unity and solidarity and uniting ranks and not differences and divisions." "This unity is most needed when we are fighting one of our fiercest battles to find a radical and comprehensive solution to the settlements and the disarming of settlers and securing international protection for our people," he wrote. According to Mr. Ghawshah, "this is not a language of reconciliation as we had proposed. We wanted 'Arafat to abandon the negotiations with Israel and return to armed struggle to liberate our lands." Mr. Ghawshah said Mr. 'Arafat "is ignoring the streets of Amman, Damascus, Cairo and the occupied territories which have erupted in protest against negotiations with Israel." "Arafat no longer represents the Palestinian people," he added. Hamas, which is locked in a running battle with Mr. 'Arafat's Fatah for leadership of the Palestinians living in the occupied territories, rules out any dealings with Israel and propagates jihad (holy war) as the means to achieve liberation. The group has vowed to step up armed attacks atgainst Israelis and, in a Feb. 25 statement, singled out settlers as potential targets for revenge attacks following the Hebron massacre. "We will not let up our resistance against Israel until the lands are totally liberated," Mr. Ghawshah vowed Friday. He said a group of 10 Palestinian groups in an alliance based in Damascus would meet after 'id al-Fitr "to concentrate on our further course of action" to undermine the peace process. The coalition, known as the Alliance of Palestinian Forces, "was preoccupied with internal affairs so far," Mr. Ghawshah said. "Now we can turn our full attention to activities in the occupied territories." He was referring to the formation of a leadership council for the allaince. After several months of deliberations, the council was formed in January, with each of the 10 factions nominating two members each to the body. All secretary generals of the groups plus members are now members of the council. The only exception is the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), whose secretary-general, George Habash, did not join the council because of ill-health and nominated his deputy. For the first time after the Sept. 13 Israeli-PLO accord was signed, Hamas has threatened Palestinians from the occupied territories who are members of the delegation negotiating peace with Israel. "We demand that the Oslo team announce their immediate withdrawal from the negotiations with Israel," the group said in an open letter addressed to the Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The reference to Oslo was to the site where Isaeli and PLO negotitors worked out in secret the autonomy accord which was formally signed in Washington in September. "We will not allow a handful of us (Palestinians) to continue negotiations with those murderers at the expenses of the Palestinian people."
