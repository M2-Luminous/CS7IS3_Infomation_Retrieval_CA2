The Consultative National Security Council, as envisioned in the Bulgarian Constitution, finally was fully adopted at a second reading. Its functions were finally clarified at the National Assembly session. This will not only be an auxiliary organ of the president; the council will adopt no obligatory stands or proposals addressed at other institutions. The clarification of the council's functions again posed the old disputed issue of its composition. This issue was discussed amid growing tension until the end of the session. According to the Constitution, the president of the Republic is chairman of the council. The prime minister, the four ministers most directly involved in security issues, the chief of the General Staff, the National Assembly chairman, and one representative from each parliamentary faction also are members of the council. No changes in this permanent composition were adopted, despite the fact that there were many new proposals.
