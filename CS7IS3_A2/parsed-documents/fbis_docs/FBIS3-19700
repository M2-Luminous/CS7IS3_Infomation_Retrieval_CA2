Yet -- putting it simply -- everything will remain much the same for the U.S. side; the capacity reduction in U.S. flights to Germany and beyond Germany, which were the starting point of talks about a new German-U.S. aviation agreement last year, will not take place. The German side has achieved that Lufthansa will be able to start the much-discussed code-sharing with its partner United Airlines as of 1 May. In addition, the airlines of the two countries, together with other partners, may offer flights going from Germany to the East, and from the United States to Latin America and the Caribbean, under their own flight numbers. Yet, the latest agreement will only remain a temporary arrangement. On 15 May, representatives of the two countries are to meet to discuss the medium-term enforcement of an "open sky" -- the complete liberalization of aviation between the United States and Germany. In four years, at the latest, the agreement being concluded now will be replaced by a more comprehensive "bilateral or multinational settlement." One can expect the Brussels Commission's plans to replace existing bilateral aviation agreements between individual European Union [EU] members by EU agreements negotiated in Brussels to have been effected by then. Now -- for the next four years -- Lufthansa can offer an increasing number of flights to destinations that have so far not been included in its program, with through flight numbers, changing between Lufthansa and United planes. But this code-sharing must remain a makeshift solution. If the problem of neutral presentation, especially in the U.S. travel agency reservation systems, did not exist, the advantages in which this term leads the customer to believe could also have been achieved by a cooperation agreement among individual airlines: Good connections, through check-in, joint programs for frequent travelers, other joint services, such as the use of lounges, are not subject to code-sharing. European and U.S. consumer protection organizations, as well as Brussels, are beginning to realize that a joint flight number, where you have to change planes once or twice and change airlines, makes the traveler believe that he gets to his destination "in one go." Alliances, such as the one Swissair has formed with Delta Airlines going west, and with Singapore Airlines going to Asia, are more honest to the user. Now the German-U.S. aviation problem has -- hopefully -- been settled for the next four years. Lufthansa must use this time to continue getting its own house in order so that it can do without protective fences against non-EU countries, as is already the case with EU airlines. By the end of this decade, aviation must do without any protective fences by the state and must only be subject to GATT competition regulations.
