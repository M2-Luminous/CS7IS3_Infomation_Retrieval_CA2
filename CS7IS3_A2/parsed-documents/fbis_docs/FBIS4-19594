For this reason, he added, Foreign Ministry Director General Tasos Panayidhis called the deputy British high commissioner and U.S. charge d'affairs to the Foreign Ministry. The government spokesman confirmed the fact that British military personnel, whose number he did not reveal, were interrogated by police for their observation in Larnaca airport of an area where projects related to the National Guard were under way. In this case, he said, a U.S. citizen who earlier had met with one of the British military officials also became involved. The area, he said, is not prohibited, and initially it was not confirmed that anything wrongful had been done. He added that the issue is under further examination by the Ministries of Justice and Public Order and Foreign Affairs. The government spokesman clarified that the British military officials work at the British bases in Cyprus and that they traveled in a car with regular license plates. The U.S. citizen, though, used a car with diplomatic license plates, and he might work at the U.S. Embassy. Replying to another question, the government spokesman said that the persons interrogated have not been placed on the stop list and that they are free to leave whenever they want to. Kasoulidhis said that no cameras or binoculars were discovered in their possession, as was written in the press. He also said that an investigation is also under way to determine how the information regarding the National Guard work at Larnaca airport was leaked. According to the government spokesman, the version that the British and U.S. nationals gave is that it is their habit to observe airplanes landing and taking off. Asked whether the Republic's authorities accept this version, the government spokesman said no. The report on the action of the British and U.S. nationals was exclusively reported last night by CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation].
