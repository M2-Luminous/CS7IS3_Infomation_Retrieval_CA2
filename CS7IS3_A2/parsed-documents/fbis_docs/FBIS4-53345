The Culture and Sports Ministry had arranged the meeting as part of the administrative move to mend discords between the administration and the Buddhist circles caused by the recent Chogye-sa incident. "We had prepared for a meeting between President Kim and the Rev. Wolha, the new Chogye order patriarch, and other Chogye leaders at the suggestion of the Culture-Sports Ministry, but it failed to take place due to objection by some reformist leaders," a Chongwadae [presidential offices] official said. He said Chongwadae planned to hold the meeting on next Monday, two days before the Buddha's coming day, Wednesday. "But, some reformist Chogye leaders demanded that prior to the meeting, President Kim should make an apology and Home Minister Choe Hyong-u resign in connection with the violence at the Chogye temple," he said. The official hinted that the administration would try to realize the meeting again once the inhouse situation of the Chogye order is put to an order. Noting that dialogue is going on with Buddhist leaders in various channels, the official said that when an atmosphere is fostered through a dialogue, Buddhist leaders' meeting with the president will be materialized as a matter of course.
