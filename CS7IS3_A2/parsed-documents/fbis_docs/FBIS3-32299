MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] and Condepa [Conscience of the Fatherland] senators walked out of the session that dragged on until nearly midnight because they challenged the promotion of two officers. Those promoted to the rank of general are Colonel Luis Rocha Martinez -- who is mentioned as the most likely candidate for the post of police commander -- and Colonel Rogelio Vargas -- whose candidacy was questioned by MIR and Condepa due to his involvement in the thwarted burning of precursors in the Huanchaca case. The Senate did not approve the promotion of Colonel Willy Arriaza -- whose candidacy was also questioned by the parties that walked out of the session. [passage omitted] Condepa Senator Andres Solis Rada said: [Begin recording] I want to report that Condepa and MIR senators walked out of the Senate session because senators of the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] and UCS [Solidarity Civic Union] ruling coalition joined forces with ADN [Nationalist Democratic Action] to promote Col. Arriaza, who worked as Arce Gomez's [interior minister under General Luis Garcia Meza] aide at the time of the terrible Harrington Street massacre which claimed the lifes of eight young MIR members. [passage omitted]. They even wanted to overrule the Bolivian Police command who believe only two officers should be promoted. Our decision to leave the session was instrumental in making the Senate stop and think about this. In the end only two officers were promoted. [passage omitted] [end recording] [passage omitted]
