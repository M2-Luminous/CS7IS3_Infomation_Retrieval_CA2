Even though government representatives claim that there is no secret agreement, facts prove the exact opposite. We have ascertained that the eight- point catalogue of Hungarian politicians' demands was the subject of Coalition Council talks and has been discussed at other important forums as well. The third point of the secret pact between Moravcik's and Duray's coalition reads: "To halt the organizing of alternative education in areas inhabited by Hungarians." Let us recall: Alternative education (and not alternative schools as certain gentlemen imprecisely write) is quite normal in areas with mixed populations in the advanced world. Under this method, children learn not only their mother tongue but, at the same time, they also master the state language perfectly (see, for instance, the bright example of South Tyrol). Under this policy, some subjects are taught in the mother tongue and some in the state language. The parents decide what is best for their children. In Slovakia, however, the national minority politicians know better than the parents. [passage omitted] On Wednesday [18 May], Minister of Education Lubomir Harach recalled Lydia Bencova from the post of director of the Department for Ethnic Education, without giving any reasons. Is it possible that the true reason was the dissatisfaction of the minister's "voluntary" advisers with Lydia Bencova because she had enforced the project of alternative education? The fact is that [ethnic Hungarian] deputies V. Bugar, J. Fothy, and A. Duka-Zolyomi are all very frequent guests at this ministry. [passage omitted] In addition to the evidently functioning secret pact between Moravcik's and Duray's coalition, one can also discover at the Ministry of Education the phantom of proletarian internationalism. Virtually all the leading figures of this government department are distinguished by their "more than pink" political past (we may still return to this issue in greater detail in SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA). Evidently the phantom of educational autonomy is also present there, which -- as is known -- represents one of the strategic goals of Hungarian policy in Slovakia. [passage omitted] After all, it is necessary to also fulfill the other points of the pact with Hungarian parties. For example, its point six reads: "To set up minority departments at the Ministries of Education and Culture, within the framework of which there will be separate Hungarian sections...." Educational autonomy is thus beginning to acquire realistic features. Otherwise, the Hungarians, who hold the balance of power, might withhold their support, as Miklos Duray let himself be heard. Whether the Hungarian minority and, more specifically, Hungarian children, will derive any benefit from this is, apparently, an altogether different question. It is a question, for example, also for the president, who should not keep quiet when the state interests of Slovakia are threatened.
