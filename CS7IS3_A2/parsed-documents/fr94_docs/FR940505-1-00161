FR940505-1-00161 FR940505-1-00012 Comments are specifically requested on the need for an emissions control program for general aviation operations in each control area based on local air quality concerns. EPA requests comment on whether the proposed operations fee is appropriate given the program's objective of reducing emissions from general aviation activity in the control areas. EPA requests comment on the possibility of FAA assistance in EPA implementation of the proposed takeoff fee program at tower controlled airports. The Agency solicits comment on the legal and policy implications of a strategy that has the potential to create economic incentives for general aviation to limit operations at airports in the FIP areas. EPA requests comment on differentiating the operations fee structure for specific airports where other emission reduction schemes have been implemented by the airport proprietor. EPA requests comment on the need for a comprehensive reporting requirement for general aviation airport owners/operators. EPA requests comment on three alternative emission reduction concepts for general aviation: takeoff slot program; environmental surcharge on general aviation fuels; and registration fee program. EPA requests comment on the desirability of providing exemptions from the requirements of this control program for certain types of general aviation aircraft operations, such as operations at non-tower controlled facilities or atypical operations. Persons submitting comments on these issues or other specific aspects of today's proposal should consider and discuss the possible impact of their comments on other elements of the control program, particularly when such comments propose alternative strategies that would achieve smaller or larger emission reductions from general aviation. (e) Public Aviation. EPA requests comment on the manner in which public aircraft emission sources should be included in the FIP control strategy. Such sources range from aircraft operated by federal agencies such as the Coast Guard and the Forest Service to aircraft operated by local governments, for example police helicopters. EPA does not have sufficient inventory data concerning such aircraft operations to assess their contribution to the overall emissions inventory in the control area, although such emissions are likely to be limited relative to other aviation sources. It may be desirable to exempt these types of aircraft operations from a specific FIP control program, given their importance to the local community and the limited emissions benefits that likely would result from their control. EPA requests comment on the desirability of such an exemption. (3) Locomotives. (a) Introduction. Locomotives and locomotive engines contribute approximately 5 percent, 1 percent and 2 percent of the total NO X emissions in the Sacramento, Ventura and South Coast areas respectively. As with all emission sources, NO X emissions from locomotives and locomotive engines in the three California FIP areas must be reduced for the areas to reach attainment in the most equitable and cost effective manner possible. Locomotives are not significant sources of HC at this time. In 1990 Congress passed major amendments to the Clean Air Act of 1970. New Section 213(a)(5) of the Act directs EPA to promulgate the first national regulation governing emissions from locomotives. EPA is required by statute to promulgate final national rules for the control of locomotive emissions by November 15, 1995. Final issuance of the national rule for locomotives is legally required within eight months of the date required for promulgation of the final rule for this FIP, and well in advance of the date required for compliance with the FIP regulations. Because of the imminence of the national rule for locomotives and because EPA's commitment to it is legally guaranteed, EPA believes it is appropriate to give credit in the FIP for the emissions reductions that will result from the national rule for locomotives. Moreover, since the locomotive rulemaking is national in scope, it would be inappropriate to foreshorten consideration of it solely to conform to the FIP schedule. Some special issues are present in the development of locomotive emission regulations. These issues include the relationships between: (a) Locomotive life, rebuild practices and emissions benefits, (b) the mode selected for freight transportation and its effects on emissions, (c) interstate commerce and state and national standards and (d) the requirement for national control and the different emission control requirements in different areas of the nation. Each of these problem areas is briefly discussed in the following paragraphs. The first point requiring special attention is the long life of locomotives and procedures used to keep the locomotive operating reliably throughout its life. Locomotives are typically operated by their original owners for millions of miles over periods of thirty years or more. At the end of these periods, the locomotive may be scrapped or sold to a smaller railroad and continue in service for many more years. During this total life of a locomotive, the engine and other components of the propulsion system undergo several rebuilds which restore the components to an essentially new condition. Typically these rebuilds occur on a five to seven year schedule. As a result of the long life spans of locomotives and their engines, replacement rates are low and it takes forty or more years for fleet turnover to occur.
