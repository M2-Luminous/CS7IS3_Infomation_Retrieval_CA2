It is becoming increasingly international and brutal. The current annual report by the Interior Ministry, which has become exclusively available to KURIER, leaves no doubt that the fight against right-wing extremism will become tougher. Statistically, the number of right-wing extremist offenses hardly changed in 1993 as compared with 1992. A total of 525 reports were made, 113 house searches were carried out, and 20 people were arrested. The police activities in connection with the letter-bomb attacks are not included in these statistics. The brutalization of the scene shows a shift in the offenses: There were fewer violations of the laws banning neo-Nazi activities and the wearing of Nazi insignia, but more offenses under the Penal Code. A succession of generations is taking place. "In the executive committees of associations that cultivate the traditions and in moderately large organizations, revisionists and right-wing extremists are increasingly replacing the war generation," the report stresses. Of the 425 political parties that are registered with the Interior Ministry, 77 have been classified as leaning toward the right; nine have been banned. Several associations are being examined, including the Action Committee for Politics (AFP), which allegedly maintains close relations with the Military Sports Group Trenck. Since the establishment of a separate group at the Vienna police headquarters for the fight against youth gangs, this problem is under control. Vorarlberg is an exception, where more right-wing extremist youth groups exist than in the rest of the country. One reason is reportedly the large number of foreigners in the province. Right-wing extremist agitation at the political level declined in 1993. However, underground activities have increased -- above all in the provinces of Carinthia, Upper Austria, and Styria. So-called purposeful cell activities are involved there. Efforts to form a collective movement, as embodied by Gottfried Kuessel, for example, no longer exist. Joint action is being avoided. The activities by subgroups and small groups that have now developed are difficult to control by the police. The terrorists responsible for the letter-bomb attacks are also believed to belong to such cells. The Congress of Revisionists has been described as the international platform. Such congresses took place in 1991 (Munich) and 1992 (Stockholm). It has been proved that links exist with Germany, the United States, Hungary, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and France. German skinheads are mainly active in Vorarlberg, Salzburg, Upper Austria, and Vienna. In Carinthia, extremists from Spain and Switzerland have been seen. There is a lively exchange of propaganda material. A Canadian revisionist disseminates his falsification of history through radio programs on short wave. In addition, a trade in computer diskettes that are also mailed to spokesmen at secondary and high schools is taking place. A modern mailbox system has also been developed. On one level, the Thule Network, installed in Germany, disseminates propaganda. On another, it is being used for communications. Austrian extremists are considered regular customers. The executive bodies are also reacting with globalization. The Bern Club, to which the security services of the European Union and Austria belong, actions against right-wing extremism are being coordinated. Other security agreements have also been concluded.
