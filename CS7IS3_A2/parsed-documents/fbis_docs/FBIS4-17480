"From the very beginning the Black Sea Fleet was shared in the wrong way," he told a press conference. According to Plyushch, the "zero option" of sharing the fleet would have settled many problems, including the Crimean one. In the meantime, the Russian and Ukrainian defence ministers are currently discussing in Sevastopol how to share the fleet between the two countries. Russia wants to have 85 per cent of the fleet and leave 15 per cent to Ukraine. Kiev disagrees and insists on 20 and more per cent.
