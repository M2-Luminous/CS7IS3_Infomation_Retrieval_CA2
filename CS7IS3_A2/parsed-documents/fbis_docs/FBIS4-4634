It has been learned that the United States has expressed its intention to change its previous policy by attaching less importance to the exchange of North-South special envoys. The ROK, however, is opposed to this policy. The difference in opinions between the two countries regarding the issue has been disclosed. The United States seems to believe it can make North Korea come to the negotiating table to discuss the nuclear issue if it attaches less importance to the exchange of special envoys. Also, it seems to believe that this can be another way to settle the North Korean nuclear issue, and that it will make some progress in resolving the nuclear issue when it holds the third round of high-level talks with North Korea, while the North and South are carrying out their exchange of special envoys. The ROK worries that its efforts to denuclerize the Korean peninsula may be fruitless under the pretext of the improvement of North Korean-U.S. diplomatic relations when the United States excludes the exchange of North-South special envoys from its preconditions for holding the third U.S.-North Korean high-level talks or intends to discuss the issue at the third U.S.-North Korean talks as demanded by North Korea. North Korea has maintained that it did not agree with the exchange of North-South special envoys in either the second round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks or in the past unofficial contacts between the United States and North Korea in New York. It has said, however, that the exchange of North-South special envoys can be discussed as an agenda item at the third North Korean-U.S. high-level talks. The ROK and the United States have stressed: The North Korean side first proposed the exchange of North-South special envoys, then the South Korean side accepted it. Therefore, this is a precondition that should be kept by North Korea. The ROK believes that although the North Korean nuclear issue involves the international community, it is, ultimately, a matter of the Korean peninsula. Accordingly, it worries that the issue of signing an agreement on the denuclerization on the Korean peninsula through the exchange of North-South special envoys would be discussed as an supplementary agenda item, when the issue of improving diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States is being mainly discussed at the third U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. This is the reason for the ROK's objection. The ROK believes that it is highly possible that North Korea would put forward the exchange of North-South special envoys as a condition for negotiations in improving relations with the United States if those negotiations are not going smoothly during the third U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. It also believes that if something goes wrong, the ROK will be the victim of negotiations between North Korea and the United States. The United States is likely to review the change of the timing of the exchange of North-South special envoys, considering that it would be better to discuss other important issues after inducing North Korea to the negotiating table. It has been learned, however, that the U.S. Government has not yet decided on its policy regarding the precondition for the third U.S.-North Korean high-level talks after the coordination of the timing of the exchange of the special envoys. U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry believes that North Korea's demands are an attempt to strengthen its position in negotiations with the United States by splitting the ROK and the United States and to exclude the ROK from participating in the negotiations by downgrading it as a third-party, not as a party concerned. Therefore, he said that it is the position of the Department of Defense to block in advance North Korea's attempts in order to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. He also said that the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea, as well as the ROK Forces, must strengthen their combatant capability to prepare for the emergency situation on the assumption that the UN Security Council may impose sanctions on North Korea. He stressed that the United States and the ROK must closely cooperate with each other to strengthen their capability.
