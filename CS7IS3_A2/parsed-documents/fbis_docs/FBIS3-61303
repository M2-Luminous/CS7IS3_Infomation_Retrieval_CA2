What is being done to this end in the southern Kazakhstan region, where industry and agriculture have developed, and where recently the number of banks has grown rapidly? What kind of unresolved problems are there between central and local banking layers? Our reporter spoke on this theme with Qudaybergen Seyitmambetov, deputy chairman of the administration of the Southern Kazakhstan Oblast Agro-Industrial Bank, Inc., one of the largest organizations in Shymkent in its sector. [Qydyr] The view has frequently been expressed recently that the independence and sovereignty of a country without its own financing and means of exchange are uncertain. As an experienced specialist with 20 years experience in the banking system what are your views on this issue? [Seyitmambetov] What you say is true. Even among the people there are those who would have us think that our failure to introduce our own currency is because our leaders are unenterprising and indecisive. I cannot agree with this position. To be sure, arrogance and sometimes pomposity have created problems with Russian ruble policy. However, there have been complaints about this and hurried measures have been taken, and we should not repeat the Ukrainian example. At a time of economic relations which have been entangled like a spider's web for 70 years, it is presently beneficial for us to remain within the ruble zone. What we need is for the head of state to make known his adherence to such a policy. In addition, we have still not fully resolved the question of foreign exchange, goods, and gold stocks which would serve as a basis for issuing a national currency in our Republic which for long years has developed only as a source of raw materials. For that reason, it would be proper for us to think about developing production and about how to expend correctly and properly our existing financial resources. [Qydyr] Two or three years ago the number of bankers in the southern part of Kazakhstan could be counted with the fingers. There are at present more than 60. However, financial resources and hard cash have not grown along with the increase in the number of banks. There are those who say that this has made it possible for a few bankers to get rich. Some of those administering banks have had nothing to do with financial activities, and there is nothing special [i.e., they have no special qualifications] about those in control. This no doubt means that the prestige of these new activities has sunk... [Seyitmambetov] As in the Soviet Union, all accounting in our country until 1988 was carried out through the state banking system. After that perestroyka began, and banks became specialized for sectors such as agriculture and industry. Starting in 1990, commercial banks began to appear. We can say that these things were the first manifestations of a transition to market relationships. Unfortunately, just as you have said, twice as many banks have now been established. However, those establishing banks with private capital are very few if not nonexistent. However, it is written in articles 20 and 22 of the "Law on Banks in the Republic of Kazakhstan" that, during their first two years of operations, banks are to live off their own resources, and that the heads of banks are to be professionally qualified and prepared. However, are these provisions being carried out in fact? During recent years, with the rapid growth in banks, sources of finance have not increased. In addition to this honest competition has not gained ground. We have been deprived of tens of large-scale agro-industrial sector enterprises whose accounts were kept by us for a number of years. That was the reason why they opened the new bank. It was the livelihood of officials with power in their hands. They forced those enterprises to establish accounts with the new bank. Can we talk of honest competition under such conditions? When these same enterprises, encountering market pressures, found themselves suffering from a shortage of capital, the new bank could give them no help whatever. It came about that some [of these] enterprises again became our customers. Thus the stability and administrative methods of the banking system and even the national economy have been harmed. It is a fact that V.I. Lenin said: "There are 26,000 banks in America. All are small and will not survive for long." In truth, whereas there were 30,139 large and small banks in the United States in 1920, at the end of the 1960s, as a result of consolidations and sector mergers, only 13,986 of them remained. However, during that period bank financial resources rose from 52 billion to 293 billion dollars. The Americans are not concerned about the number of banks but their quality. And what about us? Some banks even perform various subterfuges to provide the reserves required by law and go over to deception. For example, the recently established "Zhaqsylyq" Commercial Bank gave a loan of 50 million rubles in the form of a check to a client of ours, the "Ordabasy" Trade House. The "Ordabasy" Trade House, however, returned the money to the bank according to agreement, unused and untouched. Only through the intervention of officials of our bank was this illegality stopped. The reason is that "Ordabasy" had obtained a loan of millions of rubles from our bank. The matching capital obtained from the second bank was only to come from net profit. Here we must recall the wise proverb of our people: "Do not wear a club you cannot lift" [Do not bite off more than you can chew]. Let me take advantage of the situation to made the following suggestion through your newspaper: We must henceforth (up until 1994) re-register [i.e., recharter] only banks with reserve funds exceeding one billion rubles. In fact, it would be suitable if this suggestion were discussed by the appropriate authorities and made into law. In particular, the opening of so many new banks is reducing the status of a complex service of importance for our independent country just like the saying: "if you are going to be a bootmaker, do not be a slow one." As I have said above, due to a lack of completely honest competition, it is no secret that the proliferation of new banks is creating difficulties for our well-established organization. We would like to express our feelings of thanks to the managers and chief bookkeepers of the "Qazaqitalqarakol" Consolidated Industry, "Shymkentsyra," "Shymkentsut," production unions carrying out the procurement and primary processing of Kazakh cotton, and producing oblast grain products, the grease and antifreeze plant, the confections factory, and the "Angsat-Shymkent" trade firm for withstanding the pressures and constraints under such conditions and remaining our customers. [Qydyr] Qudaybergen, you are aware that, at the time the Republic law on banking was ratified at a session of the Supreme Kenges, there was considerable discussion about the central accounting clearing house. Does our Republic, which has achieved its independence and has entered upon the path of a market economy, need such a center? [Seyitmambetov] This is a question which was hitherto raised in the Kazakh press, which only led to an exchange of opinions among specialists. Now as for the central clearing houses of the National Bank, the state bank of former times, they are one of the last of the tricks thought up by the state bank prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union to keep the republics under control and dependent. During June of 1991 for the first time in the Soviet Union such centers were established in the Republic in Southern Kazakhstan Oblast, without any preparations or preliminaries. A great deal has become known in the two years that have passed. As has been stated, it has become known that such centers are an unnecessary layer [of the banking system], and that they have created difficulties for the economy of our nation from the very beginning. Whereas clearings and exchanges of documents between organizations and between banks used to take a day at the time of the former state bank, things have now gotten so bad that it takes several months using the clearing houses within a city. If is fine to go slowly and take months, but how many organizations are there where all traces of the funds sent have been "lost?" All of this is doubtless leading to the formation of a false image about the newly opened banks and about the entire banking system. The reason is that the public as whole does not know that all clearings are carried out solely through the State Bank Center... I think I should mention one thing: the clearing house of the National Bank in Turkistan City got together with the governor of the city, and during May of last year abolished the operational tellers of the bank in Turkistan. The clearing house is itself providing payment and income services to the customers of the bank. Although this action is against the "Law on Banks in the Republic of Kazakhstan," it still continues to this day. We have informed the oblast administration of the National Bank about this illegality orally and in writing but to no avail. All in all, this illegal action must be very beneficial for them. Such illegalities are a barrier to our work. There is one more thing I wish to say on this issue. Prior to the neighboring Republic of Kyrgyzstan introducing its own currency, the clearing center of the state bank was abolished. I hope that we too are thinking of taking this step. [Qydyr] Last question: it would seem as if there was laziness in the matter of training national specialists in a banking system from which Kazakhs have previously shied away. Why is there reluctance about placing national specialists, who will be devoted and will not go off the foreign countries after they have filled their purses, into the highest levels of the economy. [Seyitmambetov] This is a question which should be directed at the leaders who are deciding the fates of specialists in our Republic. Let me try to answer as best I can. In order that our county become an independent, fully-developed nation, we must develop stable, well-financed, full-service banks equipped with the most modern technology, capable of establishing communications with the world banking system. That is to say, we must understand that banks are one of the arteries of the economy. This being the case, such banks should be managed by managers who are devoted to their nation and their people, who have mastered their specialties in all aspects and well, who are competent and knowledgeable, and young national specialists must be prepared for these roles. Unfortunately, we lack a tried and true official policy in this area. One of the most important questions facing young specialists is that of housing. Only if they have housing over their heads and a suitable salary will they work to their full capacities and be productive. As for our bank, the housing question has been settled fundamentally in the last two years. More than 20 young women and men have been given housing at company expense. The existing employees of the company have also not been left out of consideration. We have purchased in the last few years computers to ease the work of bank employees and to bring bank operations up to date. We, the bank managers, while doing things for our workers, have strongly maintained the work ethic. We have devoted attention in our organization to the learning and teaching of the official language, and have hired a special expert for this purpose. This expert, in addition to making translations, helps those learning Kazakh. At the same time, we gave aid last year in the amount of 6 million rubles out of net profits to national programs and activities, to social organizations and to individuals with special needs. May this benefit people and create good will. [Qydyr] Let us not forget good intentions, good works, and philanthropy. Thank you very much for the interview!
