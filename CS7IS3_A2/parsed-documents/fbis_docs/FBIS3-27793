Diplomatic sources say the Thai Foreign Ministry in Bangkok and embassy in Vientiane have been applying gentle pressure on Lao authorities to proceed with the land sale. It was agreed upon by both sides previously but the Laotian Government has declined to finalise the deal, citing recent legislative change forbidding land sales to foreign diplomatic missions. The dispute dates back to the period of former Thai foreign minister Asa Sarasin who signed an Exchange of Notes with Lao ambassador to Thailand, Bounkeut Sangsomsak, in 1992 for Bangkok to purchase for 18 million baht about seven rai on the main highway from Vientiane to the border checkpoint at Tha Deua. It is planned to accommodate both a Thai diplomatic mission and the embassy. The embassy in downtown Vientiane which now houses both the chancery and the ambassador's residence would house the latter only. The Thai plans were blocked after Vientiane late last year amended laws on land transactions. Deputy Thai Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan raised the issue with Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat during a visit to Vientiane last December. Sources say there was no conclusive outcome as the Lao side stood firm on its legal amendments. The deadlock is causing budgetary problems to the Thai side. According to the sources, about 30 million baht was allocated for the land deal and other related expenditure in the fiscal 1993 budget, which lapsed last September. The Chuan Likphai Government subsequently extended the disbursement deadline of this item to March 1994. Since budgetary matters are normally subject to parliamentary approval, there is concern that it will be difficult to get another extension if the March deadline passes without the deal being consummated. So the Thais are stepping up their campaign to persuade the Laotians to honour the 1992 Exchange of Notes. "As far as we are concerned, this is a fairly straightforward matter which the Lao side has to honour," a senior Thai diplomat told INSIDE INDOCHINA. "The Exchange of Notes is a legally binding commitment. If (an international commitment of this nature) is over-ruled by subsequent Lao legislative changes, who would be confident enough to invest in Laos?" The Thais, pressing for the land deal, are hopeful of a positive conclusion before the March deadline.
