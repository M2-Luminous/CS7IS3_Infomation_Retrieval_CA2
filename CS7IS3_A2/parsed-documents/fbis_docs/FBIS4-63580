She said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's visit to missile carrying cruiser Admiral Nakhimov at Severomorsk on Monday must be seen as one more gesture towards partnership. Sidorova described the Russian-British partnership to this end as being significant in a sense. "We have no differences, let alone, slightest misunderstanding with Britons. This is also indicated by Britain's position on Russia's cooperation with the G-7 countries and the Bosnian conflict as well as identical approaches to key international issues the two countries share", she said. On Sunday's talks in Murmansk between the heads of the Russian and British foreign political departments, Sidorova made it clear that Britain was keen to see peaceful developments both in Crimea and Ukraine. "Britain appears to proceed from the principle of not doing harm", she said.
