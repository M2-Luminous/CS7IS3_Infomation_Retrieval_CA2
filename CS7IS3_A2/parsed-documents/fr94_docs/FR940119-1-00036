FR940119-1-00036 FR940119-1-00011 Report From the National Institute of Standards and Technology The legislative history of the 1992 Act also cites a July 1989 report from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), U.S. Department of Commerce (Report Number NISTIR 89&hyph;4136) which resulted from an investigation of the Maries County, Missouri pipeline failure. In the report, titled ``An Assessment of the Performance of Older ERW Pipelines'', NIST found that the installation of EFRDs could significantly reduce the damage from pipeline failures and recommended that they be installed in ``critical risk locations.'' Current SCADA Study by the VNTSC In May 1992, the RSPA commenced a research study with the VNTSC to analyze SCADA systems and computer-generated leak detection systems. The purpose of the research study is to determine the feasibility and costs of requiring pipeline operators to install a SCADA system including a leak detection subsystem, and determine what impediments exist or what system improvements are needed to minimize the time it takes SCADA systems to detect and locate leaks, and make recommendations to resolve these difficulties. As mentioned previously, this new initiative is based on findings from the Department's March 1991 EFRD study concerning RCVs. These valves maximize the value of SCADA-based leak detection systems by helping to mitigate damages from detected leaks. The first phase of this study included a literature search on the subject, on-site interviews with seven pipeline operators, interviews with five equipment vendors, and development of a mathematical model describing optimal valve spacing for given annual pipeline failure rates per mile and costs, and a method to evaluate alternative leak detection system performance characteristics to reduce pipeline spill volumes. Every pipeline operator surveyed by the contractor used some sort of SCADA system. Most operators had at least one computerized leak detection system, either one purchased from a vendor, custom designed by the operator, or a combination of the two systems. All operators interviewed believed that the condition of high false alarm rates was a major drawback to the installation and operation of leak detection systems. The problem occurs due to the required trade-off between the threshold volume sensitivity of the leak detection system and the resulting false alarm rate when this sensitivity is too high. All the operators interviewed emphasized that the most critical link in leak detection was the interface between the system itself and the pipeline dispatcher, and that there was no substitute for a highly competent pipeline dispatcher. The VNTSC is drafting a report on the first phase of the study. Once the report is completed, a copy will be placed in the docket to this rulemaking. Regulatory Analysis and Notices A. Impact Assessment This ANPRM is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The ANPRM is not considered significant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). B. Regulatory Flexibility Act This ANPRM would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (i.e., small businesses, governmental jurisdictions, and non-for-profit organizations) under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This ANPRM would apply to operators of hazardous liquid pipelines, all of whom are large businesses. Therefore, I certify that this ANPRM will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is subject to modification as a result of a review of comments received in response to this ANPRM. C. Federalism Assessment The ANPRM has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism''), and does not have sufficient federalism impacts to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.
