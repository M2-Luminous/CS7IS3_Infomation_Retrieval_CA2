Vega made these remarks during a speech he delivered on 21 March at El Bosque Air Base to mark the FACh's 64th anniversary. The ceremony was presided over by President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle and attended by Interior Minister German Correa, Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma, acting Senate President Ricardo Nunez, Army Commander Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, Carabineros Director Rodolfo Stange, and Vice Admiral Jorge Patricio Arancibia, chief of the National Defense Staff. Also attending the ceremony were four defense ministers from friendly countries who had been invited by the FACh to attend Fidae '94 [International Aerospace Fair]. They are: Oscar Camilion (Argentina), Army General Victor Malca Villanueva (Peru), Daniel Hugo Martinez (Uruguay), and Hugo Estigarribia (Paraguay). Those defense ministers met on 21 March with their Chilean counterpart at the Diego Portales building. Commanding officers from the air forces of Argentina, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, China, France, Russia, and Venezuela also were present at El Bosque Air Base. They are all attending Fidae '94 too. In his 25-minute speech, Gen. Vega stated that the sphere of action and influence of a modern air force must be in keeping with national security commitments coherent with the country's development and with space challenges facing the institution. "From a multipurpose perspective, from the standpoint of FACh capabilities regarding space sciences, it is obvious that FACh tasks go far beyond the principles and limits of this concept." The FACh chief said that to solve this problem it is incumbent upon the highest political level to outline specific objectives, scope, doctrines, and purposes. Vega added that ties between the government leadership and the FACh leadership must be strengthened to become "a symbiosis between politicians and experts" that would be instrumental in defining permanent guidelines aiming at higher objectives, "all of which must be fully integrated into the nation's overall aerospace system." In his speech, Gen. Vega reaffirmed that the FACh is committed to meeting the challenges posed by space, "a vital resource for a nation that is seeking to go hand in hand with modernity." Vega noted that the FACh has worked for two years in this endeavor and already has implemented a project to build an experimental microsatellite to evaluate four basic experiments: the evaluation of the ozone layer, the transfer of meteorological data, communications, and search and rescue operations. Vega added that the Fasat-Alfa project is an essential first step toward acquiring the basic scientific experience required to move on to more difficult, complex stages. After the speech, there was a ground parade and an air show. For the first time in Chilean history, Peruvian and Argentine military aircraft participated in this show.
