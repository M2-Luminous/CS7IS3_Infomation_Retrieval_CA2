Reports say fierce fighting is now taking place between the northern and southern forces to control the oil-rich southern governorate of Shabwah. Though Aden denied the fall of Shabwah's capital 'Ataq to the northern forces, northern officials said their forces took control of the 'Ataq military base. They added that Shabwah Governorate, including all its military installations, is now under Sanaa's control. Despite appeals by several Arab leaders to Yemneni leaders to stop the fighting, Sanaa asserted that the continuation of war is now inevitable.
