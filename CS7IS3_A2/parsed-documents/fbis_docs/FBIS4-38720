Despite their strictly economic content, the political consequences of these decisions are quite major. These two facts alone are entirely sufficient to draw the conclusion that changes are taking place today in the Kremlin, and there are grounds for talking about a search for a new political strategy to overcome the crisis. The situation looks all the more important in the light of the spiraling decline of the regime's social, financial, and military support. The president received the most recent painful blow from the State Duma, which officially questioned the results of the referendum on the Constitution and instructed the Credentials Commission to verify the vote. This, despite the opinion of representatives of the president's team, is a blow to the legitimacy of the president, not of the Federal Assembly. It is the fate of the referendum that is at stake. In addition, according to natural law, power should belong to the people and their representatives. Therefore, in subjecting the results of the elections and the referendum to review, the Duma in particular is risking very little. In the course of the past month, since the start of the campaign to sign the Treaty on Social Accord, the president has adopted a number of decisions which contravene the Constitution and existing legislation. In addition to signing the Law on the Status of Deputy adopted by parliament -- which B. Yeltsin himself acknowledged as contravening the Constitution -- he has signed six economic edicts. And in the opinion of many specialists -- in particular Central Bank Chairman V. Gerashchenko -- they contravene such legislative acts currently in force as the Law on Enterprises, Property, and Bankruptcy and the RSFSR Civil Code. General Prosecutor A. Ilyushenko remains in his post, despite the Constitution's requirements. The country still has no Constitutional Court. It is perfectly obvious that a painful search is under way in the president's entourage for a solution to the unstable political situation, which is exacerbated by the intensifying economic crisis. The question is what this solution will be. There are currently weighty grounds for suggesting that the choice could be made in favor of strengthening the state apparatus and the power of functionaries. At any rate, this follows from the revised draft of the federal budget. The role of the special services in politics is markedly increased. This is confirmed not only by the president's speech to officers of the Federal Counterintelligence Service last week. Among the edicts signed by B. Yeltsin last week is one extremely curious edict which has nothing to do with the economy: the edict setting up another department in the Presidential Staff -- for collaboration with the Federal Assembly. Though it is well known that structures ensuring collaboration with parliament have been functioning smoothly in the Presidential Staff for a long time already. This includes the president's official representative, A.M. Yakovlev. One of the department's officially defined tasks is "to inform the president on the mutual relations among the factions and groups of deputies in the Federal Assembly chambers." A. Loginov, who formerly worked in the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, has been put in charge of the new department. In recalling him, his former colleagues from the ministry slap one another on the back knowingly. It seems that this tendency, which can be clearly seen today, to gamble on strengthening the state apparatus and the special services in the search for a solution to the political crisis does have its own logic. On the one hand, the president's agreement to increase budget expenditure, primarily in favor of the military-industrial complex, and the publication of economic edicts benefiting the military-industrial complex objectively presuppose an increased state role in the economy, and, as a consequence, in politics. On the other hand, the adoption by parliament of an inflationary budget could well lead the country to an extremely severe economic crisis by as early as this fall. And then a change of government will inevitably be required, with the appearance in the executive leadership of people capable of taking tough measures. Including state regulation of the economy. And if you stretch out the chain of logic further, it seems perfectly apt that, according to trustworthy sources, on the eve of the publication of the edicts and the adoption of the decision to support increased budgetary expenditure, the president was visited by Yu. Skokov. A man who, as is well known, enjoys the reputation of being a powerful administrator capable of decisive actions. It would appear that Yu. Skokov has fully assessed the statement made some time ago by S. Shakhray that it is he, Skokov, who is the most probable candidate to replace V. Chernomyrdin and is doing everything to avoid refuting the opinion of his former colleague in the president's team. Today the political standing of this leader is stronger than ever. Yu. Skokov has begun the formation of his own party on the basis of the "New Regional Policy" parliamentary group and the Union of Commodity Producers. He also enjoys support, as far as is known, in the Presidential Staff. Primarily from V. Ilyushin, who is drawn to Yu. Skokov by many things, including -- to judge by a recent interview in TRUD -- an inclination toward "closed policy." It would appear that the president's chief aide has already decided for himself whose side he will be on in the event of B. Yeltsin's retirement from active service. Today the president seems to be attempting to maneuver politically in an increasingly narrow space. The economic problems are insoluble. The military-industrial complex is a millstone round the country's neck. And there are no recipes on how to cast off this millstone while saving our head. B. Yeltsin's former major political support base -- the people -- are increasingly shying away from politics. In effect the president is becoming hostage to the forces on which he gambled last October and on whom his power rests today -- the bureaucracy, the power structures, and the special services.
