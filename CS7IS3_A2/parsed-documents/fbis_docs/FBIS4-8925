The sources said Moslems fired 82 mm and 120 mm mortar shells, infantry arms and rifle grenades on the Serb defense positions northeast of Doboj. After the Serb side's response, in which several trenches were destroyed, the Moslem activity ceased. Serbs in Doboj have for days been exposed to strong mortar and artillery fire, but although the Serb side suffered many casualties, the world public, including UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force], did nothing to prevent the plight of the Serb civilian population. In the Teslic war zone, south of Doboj, the Moslem formations stepped up provocations, mostly using infantry and anti-aircraft weapons, and regrouped. The Serb forces did not respond to occasional provocations by the Moslem forces which used infantry arms in the Mt. Ozren war zone. It was quiet in the night of Tuesday-Wednesday along the whole length of the confrontation line at Brcko, in the Sava river region, the Serb military sources set out. The same sources also said Serb reconnaissance parties observed the arrival of fresh Moslem forces. This was an indication that the Moslems did not abandon attempts to cut the R.S. in two at this point in the Sava river region. Minor provocations by the Croatian forces were recorded in some parts of the front near Orasje, in the Sava river region.
