President Rauf Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side has accepted all of the United Nations' requests and that now the requests of the Turkish Cypriot side should be accepted. He added that the rights granted to the Turkish Cypriot people should be included in the 21 March document. Denktas noted that the next phase will deal with the preparation of the draft agreement, adding that the ball is now in the court of the United Nations and of Greek Cypriot administration leader Kliridhis. Denktas received Gustav Feissel, UN secretary general's deputy special representative in Cyprus, at 1030 today and conferred with him for on and one-half hours. Also present at the meeting were Feissel's secretary; Atay Ahmet Rasit, the minister for foreign affairs and defense; Ozer Koray, under secretary of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministry; and presidential political advisers Necati Munir Ertekun and Ergun Olgun. In a statement given to reporters after the meeting, Denktas said the main problem facing the Turkish Cypriot side is to prepare and sign the agreement on the CBM's as a single text. Reiterating that the Turkish Cypriot side wants the rights specified in Vienna to be included in the agreement, Denktas said: We cannot accept any other alternative on the issue. Pointing out that the Turkish Cypriot side does not accept artificial proposals, such as letters written by the UN secretary general and approved by the UN Security Council, Denktas added: We are ready to conclude an agreement that will be formulated and prepared for signature through negotiations to be held with us. This is our right. This is what we promised our people. We cannot accept any other kind of agreement. At this point, we are defending our rights. Denktas said that the United Nations wants the Turkish troops to withdraw 1 km from the Dherinia road and that the Turkish Cypriot side has accepted this request. He added, however, that Feissel was told that the withdrawal would place the troops some 200 meters from the Greek Cypriots and that the correct and appropriate thing would be to remain in the middle. Denktas said: Our condition, however, is that the agreement be concluded as a whole. The agreement should be prepared for signature. Noting that the issue of the access road and the distance has thus been resolved, Denktas added that the Turkish police station east of the road will be relocated to the west, provided aid is extended for the construction of the new police station. He added that the Turkish Cypriot side has also agreed that the issue of Turkish troops crossing from the east to the west via the Dherinia road will be solved through negotiations to be held by the officers on finding a suitable route and method. Denktas said: We have actually agreed to everything they requested. The only thing we want is to have a concrete agreement written as a single text. This shows that the ball is in the Greek Cypriot court. In reply to a question on whether all the United Nations' requests were accepted and whether the United Nations had any additional requests, Denktas said: We believe that through the negotiations we have been holding for some time now at the request of the United Nation, we have secured concrete advantages for our people. We now want them to materialize. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Feissel said that the Turkish Cypriot side gave the necessary responses to the United Nations' requests and that he will convey them to the UN secretary general. In reply to a question, Feissel said that the UN secretary general will determine whether the Turkish Cypriot replies are satisfactory. He concluded by saying that he believes they are constructive.
