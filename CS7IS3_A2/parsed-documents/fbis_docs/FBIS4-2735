Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), based in the mainland, met here this afternoon with Shih Chi-ping, deputy secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) based in Taiwan. After the meeting, Tang told reporters that they had reached the following three points of common understanding: First, both held that it is necessary to make all efforts to step up the investigation of the accident and carry it through to the end to find out the truth of the accident and make it public by suitable means. Second, it is agreed in principle that the two organizations should as soon as possible exchange opinions on incidents involving the lives and damage to property of compatriots on the mainland and Taiwan. Only after necessary preparations are made can it be decided when and where such a meeting is to be held. Third, both held that it is necessary for both organisations to do all they can to clear up the negative effects of the boat-fire accident on exchanges between the two sides of the straits. Tang Shubei said that after the facts of the accident have been established, ARATS will inform SEF. As to the proposal of Secretary-General Shih Chi-ping that the two organizations should exchange within ten days at a third place their opinions on the incidents involving the lives and the damages to property of compatriots on both sides of the straits, Tang Shubei said that the ARATS will give an official answer after studying the proposal. Tang Shubei stressed that the boat fire was merely a sudden accident and therefore could not and should not impede the development of the relations between the two sides of the straits. He noted that the exchanges across the straits benefit the people on both sides, stressing that anybody trying to use an accident as an excuse to impede these exchanges would be going against the interests of the people on both sides of the straits. As a matter of fact, Tang pointed out, leaders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council have paid close attention to the accident. They ordered the leaders of Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the CPC and Zhejiang provincial government to deal with the aftermath of the accident properly and to go all out to investigate the accident together with the Ministry of Public Security. Meanwhile, Tang said, many other relevant departments went into action immediately after the accident and have done a lot of work. They have tried to respect the will of the family members of the victims and provided them with help. However, Tang pointed out, since the two sides of the straits have been isolated from each other for over four decades, they have now different regulations and habits in dealing with the aftermath of accidents. As a result, the compatriots from Taiwan may not accept completely the ways of dealing with the aftermath of the accident on the mainland and the mainland side may not understand completely the will of the family members of the victims. Therefore, it is hard to avoid that the family members of some victims from Taiwan have complaints against the departments concerned on the mainland in dealing with the aftermath of the accident. Tang reaffirmed that the lives and property of compatriots from Taiwan are safeguarded on the mainland just as those of the mainlanders and no discrimination is allowed, according to the law of China. Of course, Tang admitted, the mainland should further improve the environment of tourism and better guarantee the safety of the lives and property of tourists from Taiwan. He pointed out that if anybody, using guesswork, makes irresponsible or even insulting speeches, he could only enhance the sense of non-confidence among the compatriots on both sides of the straits. This not only could not lead to the solution of the problem, but might also deteriorate the relations already established between the two sides of the straits, Tang said.
