Mr. Minister, how do you reconcile your youth with your ministry post? [Robaina] First of all, I would like to say that a person with certain responsibilities right now cannot be missing this Sunday; what is important to me is the young people on whom Cuba relies. I believe that today, and every Sunday, the young people are present through their effort, work, and participation. I believe that to reconcile this is not so hard, for several reasons. First, I am not as young as many think. Second, I believe that Cuba's foreign policy is made by the people; in this, that youth have a real and specific participation. On the other hand, I do not think my youth is at the helm of the Ministry. The Ministry and Cuba's foreign policy are made up of an accumulation of youth who lead and conduct our foreign policies. Therefore, I do not think my mission is the hardest. [Rodriguez] You have just returned from a tour of eight Asian nations. What is your opinion of the trip? [Robaina] I believe it was highly positive, particularly since it was a remarkably open forum to tell the truth about our project and to explain to the world that Cuba is not only seeking the solutions it needs but has many highly positive and successful things to offer, things needed by many worldwide, particularly in that region. I believe that it is important for us to thoroughly study that region which has so many economic accomplishments in order to find out how many can be adapted to our character, our ways, and the pressures we are subject to and under which we are building our project. [Cabada] You will be departing to Latin America shortly. I would like to confirm the countries you will be visiting and what your expectations are. [Robaina] This is simply a follow-up to the effort being made in South America; this is one aspect of that effort. This trip is in response to invitations from countries such as Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador, and Paraguay. We seek the same thing that Cuba has sought throughout the years with its foreign policy: a forum to explain what we are doing, with all our virtues and defects, and also a forum from which to learn. When we speak of this, Latin America has a special place. I believe that doing this as the Latin American summit nears gives us an opportunity to turn that forum into what the Latin American peoples hope it will become.
