FR941103-2-00130 FR941103-2-00073 [Release No. 34&hyph;34909; File No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;94&hyph;35] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Storage of Option Customer Account Information for Supervisory Purposes October 27, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 on July 5, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposal to amend paragraph (d), ``Maintenance of Customer Account Records,'' of PHLX Rule 1025, ``Supervision of Accounts,'' to allow member organizations to maintain customer information and account statements off-site, rather than at the principal supervisory office, as long as the records are readily accessible and promptly retrievable. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 On October 27, 1994, the PHLX submitted a letter indicating that ``readily accessible and promptly retrievable'' generally means that the records will be available on the business day following the request. See Letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Market Regulation and Trading Operations, PHLX, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Options Branch, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated October 26, 1994 (``October 26 Letter''). The proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34561 (September 12, 1994), 59 FR 47660 (September 16, 1994). 4 No comments were received on the proposal. 4 On August 26, 1994, the PHLX submitted Amendment No. 1 to the proposal to clarify that the purpose of the proposal is to allow members to maintain required customer information and account statements off-site, rather than at the member's principal supervisory office, as long as the records are readily accessible and promptly retrievable. Currently, PHLX Rule 1025(d) requires member organizations to maintain at the branch office servicing the customer's account and at the principal supervisory office background and financial information of customers who have been approved for options transactions. In addition, Commentary .03 to PHLX Rule 1025 requires member organizations to maintain, at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over the office servicing the customer's account, information to permit review of each customer's options account to determine the compatibility of options transactions with investment objectives, the size and frequency of options transactions, commission activity in the account, profit or loss in the account, undue concentration in any options class or classes, and compliance with the provisions of Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board. The PHLX proposes to amend PHLX Rule 1025(d) and Commentary .03 to allow member organizations to maintain the required customer information and account statements off-site, rather than at the principal supervisory office, as long as the records are readily accessible and promptly retrievable. However, branch offices must continue to maintain customer account information on site.
