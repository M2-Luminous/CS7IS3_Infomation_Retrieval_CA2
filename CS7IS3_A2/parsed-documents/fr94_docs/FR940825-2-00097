FR940825-2-00097 FR940825-2-00067 General Management Plan; Joshua Tree National Monument; Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement Summary: Pursuant to Section 102 (2) (C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91&hyph;190 as amended), the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) assessing the potential impacts of the proposed General Management Plan for Joshua Tree National Monument, which is in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, California. Once approved, the plan will guide the management of the monument over the next 15 years. The proposed action, Alternative A, would improve visitor contact facilities and services at each of the three main entrances, with a new visitor center developed at the west entrance. Interpretive programs and wayside exhibits would be updated and expanded. Facilities in existing developed areas would be replaced or redesigned to improve aesthetics, efficiency, and resource protection. Campground capacities would remain basically unchanged, but campsites would be improved through redesign. Picnic facilities and day use parking would be expanded somewhat, primarily in already-disturbed areas. Resource management programs would be increased to ensure better resource protection. Two alternatives are evaluated in the DEIS. Alternative B_No Action would continue current management strategies with no changes in visitor and park support facilities and no change in programs. Alternative C_Minimum Requirements would provide for the rehabilitation of deteriorated facilities in their current locations. Capacities of camp areas and day use parking areas would be unchanged, while the number of picnic sites would be slightly increased. The primary visitor center would remain at the Oasis of Mara. The environmental consequences of the proposed action and the alternatives are fully documented, and mitigation provided as appropriate to minimize impacts. No significant impacts are anticipated as a result of implementing the proposed action. Supplementary Information: Written comments on the draft General Management Plan (GMP) and DEIS should be directed to the Regional Director, Western Regional Office, National Park Service, 600 Harrison St., Ste. 600, San Francisco, CA 94107&hyph;1372. Comments on the draft plan must be received by November 7, 1994. Two public open house sessions will be held to facilitate public review of the draft plan and DEIS.
