The idea was, like in the case of Argentina, to allow the freedom to exchange one real for $1 as of 1 July. This would give credibility to the new currency given that the government would guarantee the exchange with its reserves. That was the idea conceived by the economic team last September when it began preparing the Real Plan, an idea that prevailed until a few months ago. Now, during the first months of the year, the elections have turned up as a real factor in the political scene, as well as all the variables and alternatives that could take place in case the government insisted on its idea of free conversion. Thus, the economic team began to think about the measure's consequences and then retracted it. The greatest difficulty was the certainty that the elections would interrupt the economic plan's continuity and a new administration might change its guidelines or simply revoke the plan, as indicated during the election campaign. Lula's growing popularity has reinforced the economic team's decision to retreat from its initial idea. During his campaign, Lula will certainly try to mark a difference with Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the field in which the Brazilian Social Democracy Party candidate has the greatest advantage -- the economic plan -- by creating an atmosphere of uncertainty regarding its future. What is more, the most important aspect is that the economic agents believe that Lula may somehow freeze the domestic debt, a fear that will be reinforced if, in keeping with its prevailing trend, the PT's campaign propaganda is to promise to take action against the fast and profitable enrichment of banks in the past few years. If the government decided to allow free conversion of reals for dollars, it would seriously run the risk of seeing its exchange reserves diminish quickly as people rushed for dollars in order to avoid having their financial assets frozen [confisco]. The consequence of such an action would be an exchange crisis worse than that which took place at the end of the Cruzado Plan when Brazil had to declare a moratorium on its debt.
