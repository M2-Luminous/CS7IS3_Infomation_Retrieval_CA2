FR940406-1-00034 FR940406-1-00011 57 FR 61379, December 14, 1992. The agency notes that manufacturers commenting on the December 1992 NPRM argued that the leadtimes discussed above are more typical for passenger cars and that light truck leadtimes are even longer. If the upcoming light truck CAFE rulemaking is to be effective in encouraging manufacturers to improve their light truck fuel economy by means of significant technological improvements, it must address model years for which the manufacturers would have substantial leadtime. Thus, the rulemaking must address model years well beyond MY 1997, the last model year for which a standard has been established. There are several reasons why it appears necessary now for the agency to change the way it has been setting light truck CAFE standards and to establish them high enough and far enough in advance to require significant fuel economy improvements. First, the need of the Nation to conserve energy is increasing. The import share of oil is growing, as is the percentage from Arab OPEC sources. The United States imported 15 percent of its oil needs in 1955. The import share reached 36.8 percent in 1975, the year EPCA was passed, and peaked at 46.4 percent in 1977, at a cost of $91 billion (stated in 1992 dollars). Although the share declined to below 30 percent in the mid-1980's, lately the United States has again become increasingly dependent on imported oil. In 1992, imports totaled 43.6 percent. The Department of Energy projects that imports will rise to between 52 percent and 72 percent of total use in 2010. Thus, the United States now imports a higher percentage of its oil needs than it did during 1975, the year EPCA was passed. Despite the establishment of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the late 1970s, concern still exists over the stability of the oil import supply. The trend during the 1980s toward increasing diversity in sources of oil imports appears to be reversing. In 1975, OPEC accounted for 61 percent of U.S. oil imports; by 1984, OPEC's share had dropped to 43 percent. However, in 1992 OPEC accounted for 59 percent of U.S. oil imports. Moreover, the percentage of total U.S. oil consumption supplied by Arab OPEC sources was 11.6 percent in 1992, higher than the 8.5 percent level for 1975. Oil continues to account for over 40 percent of all energy used in the United States, and 97 percent of the energy consumed in the transportation sector. Despite legislation such as the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and California's strict ``clean fuel'' and emissions standards, fuels derived from petroleum will likely remain the predominant fuels in the transportation sector. Domestic oil production has declined steadily since reaching a peak of 10.6 million barrels per day in 1985. By 1992, it had dropped to 9.0 million barrels per day. Domestic production is expected to continue declining by roughly 200,000 barrels per day each year through the year 2000. While the United States is currently the world's second largest oil producer, it contains only about three percent of the world's known oil reserves. Persian Gulf countries contain 63 percent of known world reserves, and former Communist countries contain 9 percent. The Department of Energy projects a continuing decline in domestic oil production to between 3.54 and 6.73 million barrels per day in 2010. A second reason why NHTSA believes there may be a need now to change its approach to setting light truck CAFE standards is the current lack of consumer demand or other market pressure for manufacturers to improve light truck fuel economy. In the early 1980's, during the energy crisis brought on by events in Iran, gasoline prices rose rapidly. That rise significantly increased consumer demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. Thereafter, however, gasoline prices fell sharply and have remained at very low levels for a decade. Consumers now place much greater emphasis on high performance, and make little demand for improved light truck fuel economy. Performance levels are now higher than they were when EPCA was enacted. In the absence of strong consumer demand or other market pressure for improved light truck fuel economy, there is no reason to expect manufacturers to make significant technological improvements for the purpose of improving light truck fuel economy, absent higher light truck CAFE standards or other government measures. Indeed, light truck CAFE has not changed appreciably in the last six years and is not expected to do so in the next several years. The average light truck fuel economy of the domestic manufacturers was 20.5 mpg in MY 1987, and 20.4 mpg in MY 1992, five model years later. (The import manufacturers' average light truck CAFE, representing a relatively small market share, declined significantly during this time, from slightly more than 25 mpg in MY 1987 to less than 23 mpg in MY 1992.) Moreover, as discussed in today's final rule establishing the MY 1996&hyph;97 light truck CAFE standards, GM currently projects a MY 1997 CAFE of 20.5 mpg, Ford 21.6 mpg, and Chrysler 20.9 mpg. A third reason why effective light truck CAFE standards assume increased importance now is the continued growth in market share of those vehicles. Light truck production increased from 1.9 million in MY 1980 to 4.1 million in MY 1992. Data Resources, Inc., projects sales of 6 million light trucks in MY 1998 and close to 7 million by MY 2004. Light trucks comprised nearly 33 percent of the total light vehicle production in MY 1992, almost double their share in MY 1980. That share is expected to increase to 39 percent in MY 1998 and 42 percent by MY 2004. As light trucks increase in market share, so does their impact on energy consumption and the importance of their potential contribution in addressing the Nation's need to conserve energy.
