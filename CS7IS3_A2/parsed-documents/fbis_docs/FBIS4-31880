Every democratic state as well as a state striving genuinely to build a democratic system had its place in the CEI, Uhde said. He pointed out, however, that "we seek to prevent the CEI from forming firm structures or becoming a "small Europe" within a "great Europe." Nastase described Uhde's remarks as an exceptionally positive comment. He said his statements took into consideration certain realities in Central Europe and at the same time corresponded to joint interests of the Czech Republic and Romania which are orientated towards integration into European structures and not the "institutionalisation of antechambers." Uhde stressed that since the collapse of the communist systems in Central and Eastern Europe, no problems had arisen which would hamper Czech-Romanian relations. He pointed to the process of ratification of a Czech-Romanian agreement on the prevention of double taxation, which is currently underway, and to an agreement on a free-trade zone which is almost ready to be signed. The conclusion of a basic Czech-Romanian treaty of friendly relations and cooperation can also be expected soon, Uhde said. Uhde and Nastase agreed to support cooperation between the two countries' parliaments and, especially, cooperation between the parliaments' Economy and Foreign Affairs Committees. They also supported the exchange of visits by state representatives and information on building the legislation and economic reform in both countries.
