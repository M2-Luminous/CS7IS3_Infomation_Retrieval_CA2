The move was announced by the leader of the United Democrats, Martin Lee, and the chairman of Meeting Point, Anthony Cheung. The new party will take up 17 directly- elected seats out of 18 in the Legislative Council and will become the party with the most seats. In a move that unites the democratic forces of Hong Kong and appears to be a setback to China's united front tactic, Lee appealed to other democrats to join the new party. Lee hailed the merger as a historic milestone in Hong Kong's democratic development and warned China that the new party would be "too big" for China to "handle". "This is the time for Hong Kong people who want a bright future for Hong Kong to stand together," he said. "The new party will not be intimidated by threats from Beijing, (and) will take a stand on principles, including human rights, the rule of law and democracy." Cheung said he would still convey the anxiety and concern of the Hong Kong people to China as a Hong Kong affairs adviser after the new party was launched. "I did not tell Beijing (about the impending merger) when they invited me to become a Hong Kong affairs adviser," Cheung said. "If the Chinese government hopes these Hong Kong affairs advisers appointed will channel Hong Kong people's opinions, then I do not see any reasons why my status as a Hong Kong affairs adviser will be affected by this move and why the Chinese government should dislike the new party." Lee said that the intensity of the pressure coming from China was the reason why the two parties had decided to merge. "Those who often read newspapers will be left in no doubt that our pressure has been increasing and our room has been decreasing," Lee said. "Just listen to what the Chinese have been saying in recent years and look at things like the Xi Yang case." Both leaders said that they had common ground on several issues and that they would bury the minor differences between the two sides to work for an open and democratic government for Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. They said they would work closely together in the elections. Since the two parties will not formally merge until October, they will still field separate candidates to contest the district board elections to be held in September. Lee said he hoped that the new Democratic Party would win at least 14 seats in the 1995 Legislative Council election. Details of the merger will be discussed at a general meeting on May 15. Federick Fung Kin-kee, chairman of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, said his party would certainly consider joining the new Democratic Party as an option. Selina Chow, of the Liberals, said she was not surprised by the move and this would not affect the Liberal Party's political course. "In the past they have been voting together and they have been politically very close. "It is a natural development," Chow said. James Tien, another Liberal member, was less optimistic and said his party would have to reconsider its strategy in this year's district board elections. "It is obvious now that the two parties will be fielding only one candidate in each district. "This will give us a difficult time," Tien said. Tsang Yok-shing, chairman of the pro-Chinese Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), said the new party "would not help to dilute the anti-communist image of the United Democrats".
