However, it offers an opportunity to delve into another topic, that we could say is a parallel one. Why is the Left obliged to clutch to worn-out and frayed pretexts such as the rebirth of fascism in Italy to demonstrate its vitality, or rather, its very existence? Is it because every time a person of some importance emerges, such as [Northern League Secretary] Bossi or a [Prime Minister] Berlusconi, it feels the need to bring back to mind that balcony on Piazza Venezia where the "square jawbone" [Mussolini] exhibited himself? Do these seem to be the proper reasons for blocking the rise of new political forces? For half a century now the Left has dug up the corpse of Mussolini and thrown it in our faces when it finds itself in difficulty. Those who have a good memory will not have forgotten what the Christian Democrats were called in the 1920's: "clerical fascists." Nor will they have forgotten the slogans of 1968 against anybody who did not support 1968: "fascist, bourgeois, only a few months more." Slogans from which one deduced that, in the language used by the barbarians of the era, fascist and bourgeois were synonymous. The decades have passed, walls have fallen, religious ideologies have faded, empires that seemed unassailable behind iron curtains have dissolved, but our left-wing parties, even those that have given themselves a new coat of paint, continue to act in the same way, almost as if time has stopped in the era of Giolitti. Fossil-like parties, conservatives wearing the label of progressives illicitly, stiffened with an anti-fascist manner that prevents them from seeing no other enemy except the duce [Mussolini] and his grandchildren. And the fact that the duce's grandchildren do not count at all, do not have a role in the government, does not matter to the Left. It undauntedly continues to see in all of them the adversaries, and to waste energy in fighting them, energy that could be much better used for its reconstruction in order to finally become a valid, reliable, and modern alternative to the hated Right. A Right that may even be a shuffler -- as [LA VOCE editor] Indro Montanelli maintains one day yes and the other day also yes -- it may be a hotchpotch, it may be a Brancaleone army, it may even have a naive and extemporaneous leader, however, whatever it may be, it has found room for growth in a few months. It has found this room because it has looked for it, it has had the courage to challenge even the ridiculous, it has resorted to flamboyant gestures: repeated opinion polls, marketing, mass communications, few concepts but clear ones, no concession being made to abstract ideas, the utmost attention being placed on the daily problems that afflict the people, a low profile but an extremely high regard for the voter, no disdain for things that are popular. Yes, popular. An adjective that horrifies the Left instead. And it would be sufficient to analyze this horror to understand where the would-be progressives failed. They do not like the people because they make the air unbreathable in the subways, because they watch Wheel of Fortune on television, live in dejected and opaque apartment buildings in the suburbs, or -- those that are the more fortunate live in townhouses with statues of dwarves in their gardens -- go to Rimini instead of Capalbio, read little and the little that they do read is from IL MANIFESTO, love the consumer world because it is better than famine. The progressives do not like the people because they vote, and vote for the League, Forza Italia, and National Alliance. Excuse me, but why should they vote for somebody that they do not respect. The real problem of this country is not the presence of a disjointed right-wing majority, but the absence of a Left that is not repressive, reactionary, conceited, antiquated, a snob, closed from the western world, in love with bureaucracy, utopias, beautiful laws (like Law No. 180 for the mentally ill) that cannot be applied and have not been applied, of public schools and all the public services that the progressives do not use. Yes, the danger is precisely this, an anachronistic, archaic Left, that has remained with Luciano Lama and his orchestra in the square, nostalgic of Marxist dogmas, unable to free itself of the old communist attire and give itself a modern, European, free trade, and social identity. Of course Occhetto did try to renew things. He did renew things. However, he did not go right through to the end, nor could he, with his past and his background. The Left needs more in order to avoid being confused over what it was, a daughter of the Soviet Union. It will take one generation, or rather two. Provided these are enough. But as long as we do not have a Left made of men of the Left, and have instead false intellectual snobs, or masked PPI [Italian Popular Party] men, the Right will have no rivals.
