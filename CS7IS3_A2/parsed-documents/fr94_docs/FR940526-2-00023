FR940526-2-00023 FR940526-2-00015 Williams Natural Gas Co.; Request Under Blanket Authorization May 20, 1994. Take notice that on May 18, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (Williams), P.O. Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;554&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205, 157.208, and 257.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.208 and 157.216) for authorization to replace approximately 9 miles of 4-inch lateral pipeline and appurtenant facilities with 6-inch pipeline located in Brown County, Kansas, under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;479&hyph;000, pursuant to sections 7(b) and (c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Williams indicates that the existing 4-inch facilities were originally constructed in 1929 to serve the Cities of Sabetha, Fairview, and Morrill, Kansas. Williams also states that, although the 4-inch facility is sufficient to serve the three cities, there has been enough population growth in Sabetha over the years to cause an excessive pressure drop during peak demands. It is alleged that replacing the 4-inch pipeline with 6-inch pipeline would alleviate the pressure drop and assure adequate peak day deliveries for all three communities. Williams indicates that it proposes to abandon the 4-inch pipeline in place with the exception of creek crossings where the pipeline is exposed and where landowners request removal. Williams estimates the cost of the project at approximately $1,011,690, which would be paid from available funds. Williams states that the total volume delivered after installation of the new facilities is not expected to exceed the total volumes authorized prior to this request. Williams states that it has included with its request a letter indicating that Kansas Power and Light, the local distributor for the three towns, is aware of the planned pipeline replacement. Williams also indicates that it included with its request letters acknowledging that eight of the ten residential customers served off the existing line are also aware of the pipeline replacement. Williams also states that it anticipates that it would soon receive signed letters from the other two domestic customers and that it would file those letters with the Commission. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to §157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
