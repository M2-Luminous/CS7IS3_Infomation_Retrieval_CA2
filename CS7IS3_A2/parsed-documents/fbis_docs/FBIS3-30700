The guests spoke about the stage of the negotiations conducted in search of a solution to the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Adrian Nastase reiterated Romania's viewpoints on this issue. The speaker of the Chamber of Deputies underlined that Romania had scrupulously observed the UN embargo on Yugoslavia, and mentioned the direct and indirect losses the embargo had caused to the Romanian economy, totalling seven million U.S. dollars. The very huge negative effects of such a situation may make Romania and other countries find it impossible to observe such international measures in the future, added he. In reply, Lord Owen said that he was sure that a mechanism had to be put in place by which losses caused by the enforcement of international sanctions automatically trigger compensations. The speaker of the Chamber of Deputies said that Romania was appreciative of the efforts made by the negotiators in search of a viable, peaceful solution to the crisis in former Yugoslavia. He added that Romania was ready to be host to a number of activities related to the negotiations. The meeting at the Chamber of Deputies had the aspect of consultations on Romania's stance regarding the solutions proposed for the crisis in its proximity.
