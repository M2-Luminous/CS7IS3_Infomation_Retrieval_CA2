Quiroga said that in view of this it is indispensable to increase drug enforcement in this region. Ten years of statistics show that by increasing interdiction, market values decrease and more peasants decide to resort to alternative products. Quiroga said that currently there are virtually no valid arguments to convince coca growers to replace their crops, because it is not economically profitable. Quiroga delivered a speech during the opening ceremony of the Seminar on Alternative Development sponsored by the U.S. Embassy's USIS in conjunction with the Social Defense Undersecretariat and the La Paz Journalists Association. The seminar was held for around 20 journalists from several departments who are traveling today to Chapare to observe the development of banana, citrus fruit, and pineapple plantations and the like. Quiroga added that peasants would be willing to replace their excess coca crops when they were convinced it was more profitable to produce other crops. He said that for farmers it is a question of opportunity and necessity, and that it is essential to take this into account to achieve proper levels of alternative development. Quiroga stated: "It is meaningless to invest in infrastructure and equipment in the Chapare region if it is not profitable for coca growers to switch crops." Quiroga said: "With current prices, we will never be able to replace coca farming if we exclusively rely on the good will of coca growers, and Bolivia will continue to be the second largest drug producer." Quiroga explained that the current policy of control of dangerous substances groups under one single unit the three aspects of drug enforcement (interdiction, alternative development, and drug prevention). He said that from this point of view the Ministry of Government will implement alternative development and peasant education programs wherever there are interdiction and drug enforcement programs. Quiroga said it is regrettable that in Bolivia the only newsworthy articles are those related to trafficking activities in what he described as the "bad Chapare" region, and that this represents only 20 percent of the population. He said that the remaining 80 percent has either always been devoted to legal activities or is voluntarily replacing its excess coca crops. He added that five years ago the Chapare region only produced coca that was sold in the market. Quiroga said that nowadays coca is neither transported nor marketed. He said that instead cocaine paste is being produced on nearby plantations, because peasants have available the technical facilities to macerate coca. Sixty percent of the coca growers in the Cochabamba tropical region are involved in drug trafficking. Quiroga warned that "we have a time bomb on our hands." Moreover, Social Defense Under Secretary Mario Soliz said that, through an agreement approved by the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] on 23 March, coca growers have agreed to eradicate 5,000 hectares of coca by the end of the year, and that they are therefore obliged to comply with this. Soliz said that the government is empowered to exercise interdiction mechanisms if this goal is not achieved. He added, however, that the current policy favors dialogue with coca producers, as there is no intention of turning the alternative development program into a violent issue, and even less of turning against the peasants.
