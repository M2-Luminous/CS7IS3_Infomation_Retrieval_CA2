According to our correspondent's report, the Belgian minister expressed the determination of his country to support Romania both in the PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program as well as in the Group of 24. The two ministers also examined the possibility of facilitating trips of certain Romanian citizens to Belgium. In a statement made at the end of talks, Claes said that the most important message that he brings to Romania is that the Group of 12 has no intention of promoting a discriminatory policy between Central European countries and that Romania is not a second-class Central European country. As far as Romania's association with the European Union [EU] is concerned, Willy Claes said that the treaty of association should be regarded as a last step before the association, however, before 1996 no negotiations can begin on this issue because neither Romania nor the other Central and Eastern European countries are prepared for this stage.
