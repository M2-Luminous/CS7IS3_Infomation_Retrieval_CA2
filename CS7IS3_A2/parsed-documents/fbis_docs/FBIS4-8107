Winding up the discussion Assembly Speaker Branko Vojnica described the agreement as a constructive step in the negotiating process toward the restoration of peace. The Assembly tasked a delegation of the republic of Serb Krajina to the so-called second phase of negotiations referring to economic and humanitarian cooperation not to accept talks on issues which could prejudice political solutions. As the second phase of negotiations with the Croatian side is yet to begin, the assembly decided that these negotiations be led by a new Krajina government, which is to be formed in about 10 days. The Krajina parliament also unanimously decided that all agreements and treaties reached in negotiations with Croatia are subject to ratification by the assembly. The assembly session continues.
