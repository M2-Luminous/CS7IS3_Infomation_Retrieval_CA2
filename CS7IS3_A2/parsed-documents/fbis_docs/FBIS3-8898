If the meeting with Waldemar Pawlak does not result in negotiations, "S" will announce the preparation of a "schedule of broader pressure." There may be a mass protest, a strike cumbersome to the people, as a reaction to the deteriorating material situation of employees; however, there may also be a doubly-strong reaction to the slighting of the people by the authorities. "Such a reaction is often greater because people do not like to be slighted by the authorities," said the "S" chairman. The First "Exchange of Views" At the press conference, Krzaklewski said that the meeting with the Senate speaker was "the first platform for an exchange of views" with the authorities. The talk, to which he was invited by Struzik, served, among other purposes, as "the preparation of the ground" for the Friday meeting with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. "I drew the speaker's attention to the fact that the talk with the prime minister cannot be prepared in advance, be courteous, and be held only for the sake of being held. If this is what the government thought, the scenario for further developments will be more dramatic." Asked about whether Struzik is playing the role of a mediator in the talks between "S" and the government, Krzaklewski said that "one can certainly speak about the role of a mediator, but not just that" because the speaker "is not a neutral person." According to the "S" head, during that meeting he discussed the strike situation and the union demands; both of them debated them and "jointly sought ways to reach agreement": methods, scope, and consistency in implementing these demands. Krzaklewski added that, before that, Struzik had forwarded a letter to "S," in which he signaled the possibilities of including the issues suggested by the union in the Senate debate. The "S" head is not counting on a radical change in the Budget Law, but on "resolving the problem through decisions around the budget." Krzaklewski stated that he and Struzik had come to a mutual conclusion that "it is bad that so far no substantive talk on the demands has been held, and that the polemic is being held through the mass media." According to them, the "information hype in the mass media" impedes agreement, even though they have similar views. Both of them agreed that there must be more direct contacts between the parliament and the trade unions. The speaker and the "S" head also discussed "issues concerning the political system": implementation of the "Pact on Enterprise" and giving state property to citizens. Clubs and a Serious Force According to Krzaklewski, the government treats agreement with "S" as a concession to a serious force, the only opponent (with the current parliamentary majority, it does not need to be afraid of either the president or the opposition), which may become stronger after agreement is reached. During the protests, the union saw what the real program of the center left is really like, and it turned out, said the "S" head, that many parties have an antiemployee program. Asked about "S" political clubs, Krzaklewski said that the decisions must be made by the union's congress; however, for the time being, "S" cannot afford to "draw attention to specific issues" because it must implement important union tasks. The "S" head added that he could see the necessity for the union activists to get in touch with people and that discussions, without the establishment of any parties and the usage of the "S" sign, are within the limits of trade union activities. Krzaklewski would like to take advantage of these contacts by building "the broadest possible contract," a contract for names and for the resolution of problems before the self-governmental elections." Pickets and Strikes Yesterday the action was joined by the Swietokrzyski Region, with the strike by the plant in Konskie as well as the Slupsk Region (among other strikes, the strike by the Uska Shipyard). National Committee Press Spokesman Piotr Zak explained that 24 miners who are on strike in the "Andaluzja" mine went underground and submitted not only wage demands to the Bytom Coal Partnership, but also national "S" demands. Zak says that a similar situation may develop in the "Silesia" mine, which belongs to the Vistula partnership. Today, from 0400 to 0800, the municipal transportation establishments in the Katowice Voivodship (among other places, in Katowice, Sosnowiec, and Zawiercie) will go on strike. Contrary to earlier statements, Bydgoszcz will strike only today. Also, Bialystok will participate in a protest on Thursday, when the union's "popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] picketing begins in front of the Sejm. The picketing is supposed to end regardless of whether the new popiwek law is passed.
