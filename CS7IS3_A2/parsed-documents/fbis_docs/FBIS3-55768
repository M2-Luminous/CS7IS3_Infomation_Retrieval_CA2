Several Ukrainian mass media sources, referring to a statement by Viktor Yushchenko, chairman of the board of the Ukrainian National Bank, even named specific deadlines: The noncash hryvnya should have been brought into circulation 6 January, and the cash hryvnya 10 January. So far, however, this has not come about. The proposed exchange rate for the hryvnya in respect of the karbovanets is one to 10,000. It is possible that this will be the main achievement of the financial operation, insofar as the number of zeros on price lists at regular food stores right now simply shocks the purchaser. In other respects, only at a stretch can the aforementioned action be considered necessary and well-timed. It is impossible to keep track of the names of authoritative economists, politicians, scientists, and financiers who warned: If it is necessary to introduce the hryvnya, only do it once the karbovanets has stabilized, and, most importantly, once the economy stabilizes. Otherwise, the entire inflationary squall of what went before will rain down on the new national currency, and the hryvnya's image will be undermined even faster than that of its predecessor, the karbovanets. But it is difficult to link the temporary fall just prior to the New Year of the dollar and Russian ruble rate in respect of the karbovanets with any kind of major positive progress on the part of the Ukrainian economy. It is simply that, following the colossal November price hikes against a background of a natural increase of the activeness of purchasers before the holidays, there were too few banknotes in circulation, and monetary turnover slowed sharply. Therefore, savings accrued by citizens in the form of foreign currency came into play... Of course, this has not altered the essence of what is going on in the economy. Suffice it to cite facts expounded in the latest interview by Ukraine's Power Engineering and Electrification Minister Vilen Semenyuk: "Enough coal remains in our depots to last roughly one month.... Fuel oil is now coming into our stations in quantities representing 15-20 percent of what is needed.... Only emergency reserves are left in the depots...." Of course, people feel the effects of this in terms of cold radiators in their apartments, the regular disconnection of hot water and light, and television sets which remain lifeless until evening (by limiting television operating time, the country saves 3.6 million kW-hours of electricity every day.) However, few expect the new currency to change any aspect of life drastically, or to warm people up....
