The statement, issued on 27 February, showed optimism that the cease-fire agreement between the KNPLF and the SLORC would be signed in the near future. It stated that the present world situation and Myanmar's [Burma] circumstances have shown that all political problems can be solved peacefully by negotiation. Myanmar, which is part of the international community, should resolve ethnic problems and armed insurrections peacefully using political means. The KNPLF, for the good of all the people in the Karenni State -- who have suffered bitterly from the civil war which has been going on for more than 40 years -- has decided to hold talks with the SLORC. The statement also noted that the decision was made to stop the use of Karenni people as forced labor, prevent forced relocation, and overcome economic difficulties. In accordance with SLORC's invitation of 18 November 1993 to hold talks with ethnic armed organizations, the KNPLF sent Lieutenant Colonel Tin Tun to hold talks with the SLORC on 18 December 1993. Colonel Maung Kyi, Major Zaw Thet Naing from the No.27 military intelligence unit, and other members from the SLORC's side held talks with Col. Tun Kyaw, KNPLF vice chairman and commander in chief, and a delegation in Me Thet Village, Loikaw Township, on 8 February 1994. Religious leaders -- Roman Catholic Bishop Sotero Phamo and Baptist Pastor Saw Ambia -- attended the meeting as observers. The KNPLF hopes that the SLORC will be able to sign a cease-fire agreement in the near future and believes the bilateral talks will lead to peace for the benefit of the Karenni people and for the development of peace, tranquility, democracy, and harmony in the Karenni State.
