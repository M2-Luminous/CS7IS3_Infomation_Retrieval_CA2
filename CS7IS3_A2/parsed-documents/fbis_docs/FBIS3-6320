"We can't but feel concerned that North Korea did not fully and sincerely uphold its agreement with the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) and that diversion of nuclear material for military purposes could not be verified," Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told a press conference. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura also said during an earlier press conference that Japan is "deeply concerned." The IAEA said Wednesday Pyongyang obstructed checks at a key nuclear facility and that the agency would hold a special meeting of its board of governors next Monday, as the long-standing nuclear controversy with North Korea soared to new heights. The Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog said North Korea barred a team of its inspectors from carrying out "important measures" at a radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon which the IAEA regards as a nuclear reprocessing plant. The United States also said a third round of talks with North Korea, scheduled for next Monday in Geneva, would be postponed due to North Korea's refusal to cooperate. Hata and Takemura both cited the necessity of renewed calls to North Korea to completely accept international inspections of all its facilities. Hata said the problem of North Korea's suspected nuclear program would naturally be discussed when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa visits China from Saturday to Monday. Government officials have said Hosokawa is expected to call for China's continued role in persuading Pyongyang to accept full inspections to sweep away international concern over its alleged nuclear program. Hata said Japan wants to seek a solution to the problem through negotiations. He declined to say what the Japanese Government would do if the IAEA meeting adopted a resolution referring the matter to the United Nations Security Council, saying it is too early to comment. If the IAEA meeting declares North Korea in breach of nuclear safeguard accords, the matter would be referred to the U.N. Security Council, which might impose economic sanctions on Pyongyang. A South Korean Foreign Ministry official said Thursday that the nuclear watchdog is likely to demand that North Korea grant complete inspections of its radiochemical laboratory instead of opting for sanctions.
