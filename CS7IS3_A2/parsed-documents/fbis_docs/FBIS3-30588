The Main Council is discussing the situation that has arisen in Poland after yesterday's resignation of Marek Borowski, the [deputy prime minister] and finance minister. [Unidentified correspondent] Kwasniewski added that the SdRP wanted to implement the joint economic program that was agreed upon with the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. The Left is waiting for a similar declaration on behalf of the Peasant Party members. In Kwasniewski's opinion, some of the prime minister's actions and those of members from his entourage allow one to think that the desire to retain the coalition is uneven. [Begin Kwasniewski recording] A lack of respect for coalition decisions, making decisions without the knowledge of the appropriate ministers, statements that are far from our jointly implemented economic and political concept, all these are pointers that make one want to ask out loud: What is going on? [end recording] [Correspondent] In their speeches, members of the council complained that the government lacked a cadre policy: State officials are being replaced by party colleagues of the Peasant Party. Of the eight SLD governors who have recently taken up their posts, only one is a member of the SdRP; the remainder are specialists, said Kwasniewski.
