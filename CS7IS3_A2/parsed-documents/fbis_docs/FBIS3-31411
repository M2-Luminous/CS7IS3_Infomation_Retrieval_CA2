FBIS3-31411 "dreeu033__a94037" FBIS-EEU-94-033-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 February 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Impact of Import Restrictions on Trade Balance AU1502203094 Prague CTK in English 1639 GMT 15 Feb 94 AU1502203094 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava, Feb 15 (CTK) -- The requirement that food products imported into Slovakia have a quality certificate, introduced unilaterally last week, has been interpreted wrongly, director of the Customs Union Council (RCU) Secretariat Rudolf Besik told CTK today. The measure is nothing new and not in conflict with legislation, Besik said. The problems that have resulted are due only to insufficient preparation. He said the measure could not influence Slovakia's trade balance. Food products make up only 8 or 9 percent of total Slovak-Czech trade. The share food products have in the Czech Republic's trade surplus in the mutual balance of payments only amounts to 2.5 billion Slovak crowns, Besik reported. An exceptional RCU meeting could, he said, decide on the recognition of the quality certificate which the Czech Agricultural and Food Inspectorate (CZPI) has been issuing. This could mean that Slovakia would drop its certificate requirement with regard to the Czech Republic, he said. Besik said he did not know the location or date of the RCU extraordinary meeting, when asked to confirm Government Spokesman Ondrej Hanka's statement that the economics minister had been requested to convene the meeting for February 16. Quality certification for the import of food products into Slovakia came into effect on February 11.
