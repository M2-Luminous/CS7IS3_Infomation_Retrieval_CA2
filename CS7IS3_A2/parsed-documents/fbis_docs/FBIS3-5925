For the prime minister, it was his first Japan-U.S. meeting following the failure of the summit meeting in February. The secretary of state complained strongly about the huge trade surplus and current-account surplus of Japan, but the meeting failed to bring out any clues on resolving the situation. The Japanese Government is said to be set to announce market liberalization measures, such as additional deregulations, by the end of this month, but it remains unclear whether Prime Minister Hosokawa can come up with market liberalization measures or surplus reduction measures that are bold enough. The recent Japan-U.S. meetings once again confirmed that Japan- U.S. relations are the "most important bilateral relations in the world" and that the Japan-U.S. security system is "indispensable for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region in the post-Cold War era." In spite of this, the trend of mutual distrust and discontent between the governments and the peoples of the two nations is only growing. This situation is undesirable for the future of Japan-U.S. relations. Both Japan and the United States urgently need to recognize that their relationship is such that each nation is becoming more dependent on the other, and that active efforts must be taken to prevent mistrust from growing and to expand mutual relations. Secretary Christopher compared Japan-U.S. relations to a three- legged stool. He said that two legs of the stool -- security cooperation and global-scale cooperation -- are very sturdy, but the remaining leg -- cooperation in economic and trade areas -- is very unstable. The irritation of the United States stems from the fact that while Japan's trade and current-account surpluses are not decreasing at all, the nation has not been able to produce any concrete measures toward market liberalization. Apparently, U.S. President Bill Clinton has settled on a policy of getting tough with Japan, in order to deal with the protectionist moves arising in Congress with by-elections coming in the fall. Public opinion polls in the United States are also said to show that there are growing numbers of people who think "Japan is unfair." On the other hand, Japan is irritated as well. This is a reaction to the unilateral revival of the Super 301 provision (which defines unfair trade practices and enables sanctions to be taken against nations engaged in such practices) of the U.S. Trade Act, as well as to a brutal policy which states that "only results matter." People in Japan complain, "Japan may be called an economic power, but we are not living a high-quality, abundant life." It is necessary that the leaders of Japan and the United States do all they can to resolve the economic frictions to prevent the disturbances among the two nations from developing into emotional confrontations. In particular, Japan, which is criticized by all of the industrialized nations as a country with an overly large current-account surplus, should come up with mid- and long-term endeavor targets for reduction of the surplus on its own without delay. In security and global-scale cooperation areas, there have been visible achievements. In the meeting of the Japan-U.S. Committee for Consultations on Security, which for the first time was held at the cabinet ministerial-level, there were agreements on cooperation with respect to the suspected nuclear arms program of the DPRK, and on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In fact, as regards global-scale cooperation, Japan's initiatives are highly appreciated. It is not so well known that at the Japan- U.S. summit in February, Japan promised to provide about $3 billion in funds for world population and AIDS control programs which are being undertaken jointly by Japan and the United States. What is needed is for Japan and the United States to think and act coolly. As for Japan, what is important for it to do is to say things which need to be said to the United States, but at the same time to go ahead on its own and do what it should do. That will certainly lead to a deepening of trust between the two countries.
