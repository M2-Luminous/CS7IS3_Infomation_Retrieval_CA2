The legal panel of the Preliminary Working Committee spent about five hours discussing relevant problems today and came to the conclusion that judging from the prospective of legal principles, there would be no such thing as a legislative vacuum in the future Special Administrative Region [SAR]. The British Side's Noncooperation Is at the Root of the Problem Before commenting the panel's opinion, we should first of all discuss the legal logic of the so-called "legislative vacuum." Some people said: If the Chinese and British sides failed to reach agreement on Hong Kong's elections, which would cause the "through train" to be derailed, and accordingly the three-tier councils had to be re-established after 1 July 1997, there would certainly be a period when there were no legislative bodies, and when legislation would thus be suspended, before the SAR legislative council was set up. Again, since the SAR Legislative Council would not be established on 1 July 1997 and confirm Hong Kong's existing legal procedures, the SAR government would not provide sufficient legal basis for its operations. We can discover loopholes in the above argument. First, the argument about a "legislative vacuum" is based on the hypothesis that there will certainly be no "through train." But this is unfounded according to legal principles, because the British side should replace its "three violations" bill with a "three conformities" one before the electoral law is passed or before elections are held according to the arrangements agreed. Therefore, the crux of the problem lies in whether the British side is willing to sincerely cooperate with the Chinese side, and not in whether there will be a "legislative vacuum." Failure To Set Up the SAR Legislative Council Immediately After 1 July 1997 Does Not Mean a "Legislative Vacuum" Second, even if the "through train" should finally be derailed and the final Legislative Council under British rule were not to become the first SAR Legislative Council, this would only mean something being wrong with the convergence of the legislatures. The failure of the SAR Legislative Council to operate immediately after the 1 July 1997 and a "legislative vacuum" are issues of different natures, so they should not be mentioned in the same breath. Judging from the perspective of legal principles, a "legislative vacuum" means three things: 1) no legislation; 2) no laws; and 3) no legislative bodies. According to legal principles in broad sense, a "legislative vacuum" refers to a legislative power vacuum of a government, which is exactly what the first content of a "legislative vacuum" refers to. But Article 2 of the Basic Law stipulates: "The National People's Congress [NPC] authorizes the Hong Kong SAR to exercise a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the provisions of this Law and to enjoy executive, legislative, and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication," therefore so long as the Basic Law still exists when Hong Kong reverts to China on 1 July 1997 and so long as the SAR government is established without a hitch and has power vested in it by the NPC, the SAR will certainly enjoy inviolable legislative power. So fundamentally speaking, there will be no "legislative vacuum." Third, Article 8 of the Basic Law provides: "The laws previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation, and customary law shall be maintained, except for those that contravene this Law or have been amended by the legislature of the Hong Kong SAR." Clearly, though the SAR Legislative Council cannot be set up immediately after 1 July 1997, laws that do not contravene the Basic Law will remain in force, and this has been guaranteed by the Chinese Government. Therefore, if it was not considered that the existing over 500 laws and ordinances all contravened the Basic Law and thus must be scrapped, there would be no such problem as a legislative vacuum; and even though many existing laws and ordinances were found to be against the Basic Law, we would at most face a problem of insufficient laws and ordinances. Let us now turn to the problem concerning the SAR Legislative Council. We are not now in a position to certify whether there will be a period when there will be no legislative bodies, because the method of setting up the first SAR Legislative Council has not been finalized. Nevertheless, if the SAR Legislative Council cannot be set up immediately after Hong Kong returns to Chinese sovereignty, it does not necessarily mean legislative work will be left undone. After all, the legislative body and legislative work are separate matters, and an equals sign should not be drawn between them. Therefore, with the existing articles and stipulations, a "legislative vacuum" is unlikely in Hong Kong. Actual Operations Will Eliminate the Likelihood of a "Legislative Vacuum" On the other hand, judging from the perspective of actual operations, even if the first SAR Legislative Council cannot be set up immediately after 1 July 1997, there will be only technicalities, and these technicalities will not develop into big problems. First, of the 10 functions of the SAR Legislative Council, only one is a legislative function, that is, "the SAR Legislative Council shall enact, repeal, or amend laws in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law and legal procedures," while the other nine functions are related to supervision and appointments and removals. Second, the SAR will introduce the "executive-led" political system. Under the system the chief executive enjoys the power and function of issuing administrative orders, and the SAR government the power and function of "drafting and introducing bills, motions, and subsidiary legislation." Therefore, if the SAR Legislative Council cannot be set up immediately after 1 July 1997, it will not produce a big substantive impact. Also, the Basic Law authorizes the SAR Preparatory Committee to make any decisions to facilitate the establishment of the SAR. Related foreign experience shows that the preparatory committee for the establishment of a new government can eliminate the possibility of a "legislative vacuum." To sum up, the best way to avoid a "legislative vacuum" is for the British side to withdraw the "three violations" bill and return to the course of cooperating with the Chinese side so that the two sides will jointly handle the problems related to the hand-over of political power. Even if things fail to turn out as expected, there will be no such problem as a "legislative vacuum" so long as the Basic Law exists. The biggest possible problem will only be that the SAR Legislative Council will not operate on the day political power changes hands. And experience in actual operations reveals that it is also not necessary for the SAR Legislative Council to do so.
