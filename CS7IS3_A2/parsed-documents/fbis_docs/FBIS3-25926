The project was sponsored in 1989 by the Chinese Communist Youth League, in a bid to help children nationwide who have dropped out of school for various reasons to resume their studies. In the past three years, the province's Hope Project Foundation has received some one million yuan in donations from about 260,000 home and overseas donors. With these funds, the province has also established seven new "Hope primary schools" in its poverty-stricken areas. Meanwhile, schools in such areas have received more than 300,000 yuan worth of teaching aids as well as articles for daily use. Located in the remote northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, the province is one of the most underdeveloped provinces in China.
