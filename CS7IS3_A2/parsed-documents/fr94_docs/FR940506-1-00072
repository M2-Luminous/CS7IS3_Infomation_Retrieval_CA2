FR940506-1-00072 FR940506-1-00014 (v) Delivery and payment terms ( e.g. , prompt payment discount terms). (vi) Name and address of contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice of assignment). (vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in event of a defective invoice. (viii) For payments described in subdivision (a)(1)(i) of this clause, substantiation of the amounts requested and certification in accordance with the requirements of the clause at 52.232&hyph;5, Payments under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts. (ix) Any other information or documentation required by the contract. (x) While not required, Contractors are strongly encouraged to assign an identification number to each invoice. (3) Interest penalty. An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in subdivisions (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(iii) of this clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day without incurring a late payment interest penalty. (i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office. (ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment was processed and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition, or requested progress payment amount. (iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for work or services performed, the amount was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor. (4) Computing penalty amount. The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty is prescribed by other governmental authority ( e.g. , tariffs). This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,'' and it is published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice payment amount approved by the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through the payment date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoice payment amount and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period. If the designated billing office failed to notify the Contractor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph (a)(2) of this clause, the due date on the corrected invoice will be adjusted by subtracting from such date the number of days taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest penalty owed the Contractor will be based on this adjusted due date. Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating interest penalties. (i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor for payments described in subdivision (a)(1)(ii) of this clause, Government acceptance or approval shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day after the Contractor has completed the work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. In the event that actual acceptance or approval occurs within the constructive acceptance or approval period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance or approval. Constructive acceptance or constructive approval requirements do not apply if there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. These requirements also do not compel Government officials to accept work or services, approve Contractor estimates, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities. (ii) The following periods of time will not be included in the determination of an interest penalty: (A) The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects in invoices submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed 7 days. (B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the corrected invoice by the Contractor. (C) The period between the date of an attempted electronic funds transfer and the date the Contractor furnishes correct electronic funds transfer data; provided, the Government notifies the Contractor of the defective data within 7 days after the Government receives notice that the transfer could not be completed because of defective data. (iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1 need not be paid. (iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to disagreement between the Government and Contractor over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable, will be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes. (5) Prompt payment discounts. An interest penalty shall also be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor, if a discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The interest penalty will be calculated on the amount of discount taken for the period beginning with the first day after the end of the discount period through the date when the Contractor is paid. (6) Additional interest penalty. (i) If this contract was awarded on or after October 1, 1989, a penalty amount, calculated in accordance with (a)(6)(iii) of this clause shall be paid in addition to the interest penalty amount if the Contractor_ (A) Is owed an interest penalty; (B) Is not paid the interest penalty within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and (C) Makes a written demand to the designated payment office for additional penalty payment, in accordance with (a)(6)(ii) of this clause, postmarked not later than 40 days after the invoice amount is paid. (ii) (A) Contractors shall support written demands for additional penalty payments with the following data. No additional data shall be required. Contractors shall_ ( 1 ) Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a specific invoice and request payment of all overdue late payment interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required; ( 2 ) Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment interest was due; and
