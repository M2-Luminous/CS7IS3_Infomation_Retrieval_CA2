To fund preliminary development, administration, and new investments through December 31, 1997 by using up to $34.1 million of their self generated funds (``Self Generated Funds''), TVC and the TVC Subsidiaries request authority for: (1) the TVC Subsidiaries to issue and sell to TVC shares of its common stock, and for TVC to acquire the shares; (2) the TVC Subsidiaries to issue and sell to TVC installment promissory notes (``Notes''), and for TVC to acquire these Notes; and/or (3) TVC to make short-term advances and/or capital contributions to the TVC Subsidiaries. The shares of the TVC Subsidiaries' common stock are valued at $25 par value per share, and TVC would acquire the shares at or above par value. Alternatively, the TVC Subsidiaries could issue and sell to TVC Notes bearing a fixed interest to be determined at the time of issuance. The interest rate would be based upon the preceding calendar quarter three-month average yield on newly issued ``A'' rated 25-30 year utility bonds as published in Salomon Brothers' weekly Bond Market Roundup or 2% per annum above the foregoing applicable rate if interest or principal payment on the Notes becomes past due. The Notes would be payable in installments over a period not to exceed 30 years and would be dated the date of their issue. TVC's short-term advances to the TVC Subsidiaries would be made on open account, would bear interest at a rate equivalent to the composite weighted effective cost of Columbia's short-term financing transactions, and would be repaid by the TVC Subsidiaries as funds are available but no later than April 30 of the following year. TVC and the TVC Subsidiaries request authority through December 31, 1997, for the payment of dividends out of capital surplus by the TVC Subsidiaries to permit TVC to recapture funds generated by the operations of its subsidiaries and excess to the needs of the subsidiaries. The proposed amount of dividends paid out of capital surplus would not exceed the following: TriStar Binghamton General Corporation, $1.2 million; TriState Binghamton Limited Corporation, $2.8 million; TriStar Vineland General Corporation, $350,000; and TriStar Vineland Limited Corporation, $3.15 million.
