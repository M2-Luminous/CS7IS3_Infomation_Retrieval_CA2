In a speech to an international forum, Owada said the major powers must have cooperative ties to maintain international order in the post-Cold War era. A good example, he said, is the cooperation of China in the standoff over North Korea's refusal to allow full international inspections of its nuclear facilities. Commenting on Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, Owada said the focus should be on how Japan can aid the United Nations in maintaining global order rather than on simply winning permanent membership of the Council as a symbol of its powerful status.
