In an interview for a WASHINGTON POST correspondent, Moldovan President Mircea Snegur expressed satisfaction with the elections. In his opinion, they were democratic in character. He cited foreign observers in this assessment. Snegur called the Agrarian Democratic Party, which polled the majority of the votes, a centrist party. Its opponents, he believes, have no evidence to suggest that the agrarians' success will lead to a change of political course. As for the bloc formed by the Socialist Path and the "Unity" movement, which came second to the Agrarians, Snegur noted that such is the reality and that deputies of this political orientation can conduct reforms. The president hopes that the emergence of a parliamentary majority will make it possible to resolve the problems of Moldova's eastern regions. The CSCE mission under Russian mediation will help to achieve that goal, he believes. However, Snegur explained that he has in mind a democratic Russia headed by President Yeltsin. If the nationalists try to encroach on Moldova's independence and sovereignty, he noted, the country will not be alone because it is a member of many international organizations, which will come to its aid. The president of Moldova firmly advocated the withdrawal of Russia's 14th Army. In these first few days after the elections, Snegur has stated that within a month Moldova will join NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program, which in his opinion, offers real solutions to avert the conflicts that threaten Europe. The losers in the elections are less optimistic in their assessment. For example, A. Arseni, chairman of the Democratic Labor Party, believes that the influence of state organs was evident during the elections and their results showed that the voters depend to a large extent on the leadership in the local organs. Furthermore, he believes, the population was disoriented by the idea of reunification with Romania. V. Puskasu, leader of the Republican Party and vice chairman of the former parliament, said that he does not regard the elections as a tragedy. In his opinion, it is bewildering that the majority of electors voted for the Agrarian Democratic Party while only 1 percent voted for the Republican Party, even though the two parties' have similar aims and programs. Puskasu believes it quite possible that the new parliament, like its predecessor, will be forced to resign before its term has expired. In view of this, the Republican Party intends to work for the future in the belief that the new election cycle has already begun. But V. Cheshuyev, representative of the defeated Social Democratic Party and director of the privatization department, who, during the election campaign, entered into a polemic with Premier A. Sangheli, his immediate superior, has resigned because he considers that he cannot remain in his post any longer. The final results are still not available, but there has been another statement from the Central Electoral Commission, which is protesting against the mass media, which are using the preliminary figures without citing specific sources. The Central Electoral Commission is critical of the Mayak Radio station and Ostankino TV company in particular, but a date for publishing the final results has still not been announced.
