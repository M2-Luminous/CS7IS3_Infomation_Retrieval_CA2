FR940429-1-00005 FR940429-1-00002 The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: De Havilland, Inc.: Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;46&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes, equipped with passenger service units have part numbers 10&hyph;1418&hyph;1/2 and 10&hyph;1081&hyph;3/&hyph;4/&hyph;5/&hyph;6; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent overheating of the passenger service unit (PSU) printed circuit board and power supply connectors, which could lead to a fire in the PSU, accomplish the following: (a) Within 300 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, or within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, or within 12 months after any previous inspection conducted prior to the effective date in accordance with this paragraph, whichever occurs later: Conduct a visual inspection of all PSU printed circuit boards and power supply connectors to detect corrosion and evidence of overheating, in accordance with paragraph III. of de Havilland Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A8&hyph;33&hyph;30, Revision `A', dated December 18, 1992. Note 1: The overheat condition referred to in this paragraph is the discoloration of the printed circuit board around the connector interfaces, and not the light conformal coating discoloration resulting from the normal operation of high current devices mounted on the printed circuit board. (1) If no corrosion or evidence of overheating is detected, repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 12 months. (2) If any corrosion or evidence of overheating of the PSU printed circuit board is detected as a result of any inspection, prior to further flight, either repair or replace the PSU printed circuit board in accordance with the service bulletin. Thereafter, repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 12 months. (3) If any corrosion or evidence of overheating of the power supply connectors is detected as a result of any inspection, prior to further flight, replace the affected power supply connector in accordance with the service bulletin. Thereafter, repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 12 months. (b) Within 10 days after accomplishing each inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD, notify de Havilland, Inc., of all findings of corrosion or overheating, in accordance with de Havilland Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A8&hyph;33&hyph;30, Revision `A', dated December 18, 1992. Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2120&hyph;0056. (c) Within 24 months after the effective date of this AD, install Modification 8/1950 in accordance with de Havilland Service Bulletin 8&hyph;33&hyph;34, dated August 10, 1993. Installation of this modification constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspections required by paragraph (a) of this AD. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, New York ACO. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the New York ACO. (e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on April 22, 1994. S.R. Miller, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
