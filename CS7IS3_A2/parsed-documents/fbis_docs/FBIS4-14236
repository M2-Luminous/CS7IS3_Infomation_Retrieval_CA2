[passage omitted] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman, attended the grand popular speech rally. He delivered an important national speech. [passage omitted] Addressing the large crowd in 70 Square, the brother chairman said: You should arm yourselves with awareness. I had wished that the rest of the political parties would participate in the democratic framework. Some of these parties had acquired more than their true size. However, they knew their place on 27 April and each political party knew its true size. The masses said their word and were above all parties, and above all those who seek to extend their hands abroad. The loyalty of the masses was for God, the homeland, the revolution, democracy, and unity. The masses spoke clearly: No to sectarianism, regionalism, and racism; no to the elements of sabotage and destruction. All those who seek to sabotage national unity and disunite national ranks will pay a heavy price. Each citizen of our people will turn into a judge, court president, and attorney general in the name of the Yemeni people to try all those who harm this homeland and this nation. Also, our Armed Forces today represent [words indistinct] the homeland and the shield of 22 May. They are also the protectors of unity and democracy. The brother chairman called on the masses of our Yemeni people to form committees in all the governorates, districts, and neighborhoods, to defend unity and democracy and oppose the elements of sabotage wherever they exist. The brother chairman cited a political statement by the spokesman of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] to the effect that the accord document cannot be accepted and that it is not possible to return to pre-22 May 1990 and after [date indistinct] 1993. He means by this canceling 22 May. However, there are people who have remained faithful to their pledge to God and who keep to unity and democracy. Unity and democracy are the property of the entire Yemeni people, who can protect them, since they are not the property of a political party or leader who claims guardianship over any governorate of the republic. The parties should be national parties and should extend over the entire Yemeni arena, from Sa'dah to al-Maharah and to Hadhdramaut, Aden, Ta'izz, and other governorates of the Yemeni republic. Our people reject, and will not accept, regional parties. These parties are rejected. The brother chairman called on the House of Representatives to assume its historic responsibilities. He added that there is apparent circumvention to abort the [Dialogue] Committee. We had wished that the Dialogue Committee would be fair and unbiased and that it would side with justice against falsehood. Regrettably, however, the Dialogue Committee ordered all members of the Presidential Council to get together and this did not happen, but it did not dare condemn the party that violated its decisions. He noted that the accord document stipulated two major points. First, arresting the subversive elements. However, the YSP is today allying with these elements and is supplying them with tools of sabotage. Second, moving the military units from the pre-unity positions to the center of Yemen in line with the document. However, this has not happened and we did not hear any voice from our brothers and colleagues in the Political Forces Dialogue Committee regarding this conduct. [passage omitted] The brother chairman added that 27 April shall remain the cultural plan of the Yemeni republic. It is an object of admiration and appreciation of the world. We assert to those who attempt to fragment our national unity that we, here, shall maintain our steadfastness and defend the revolution, the republic, and the unity. There can be no alternative to the revolution, the republic, unity and democracy, whatever the price. [passage omitted]
