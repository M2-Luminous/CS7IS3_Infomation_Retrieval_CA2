But, of course, the main matter of the day was the election for the lower house speaker. After the adoption at the evening session of three articles of the State Duma Interim Standing Orders pertaining to the chairman of the chamber and his powers, candidates were nominated for the post. There were 10 of them. [passage omitted] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy appeared first. It has to be said that his presence in the Russian parliament continues to attract frenzied interest from the press. If during a recess a hurricane of journalists tears down a corridor sweeping all before it and chasing after someone, you will soon find it was Vladimir Volfovich. The only person so sought-after by the press at the first Congress of RSFSR People's Deputies was Boris Nikolayevich [Yeltsin], who was then running for chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet. Times change, and journalists now have a new and odious "idol." Speaking as a candidate for speaker, Vladimir Volfovich put the chairman in his place: "Under the new Constitution and the statute on our Duma your task is to let people speak -- that is all. We have had enough lectures! The left wing, the right wing, who said what.... You yourself carry the burden of the old parliament. And you have the tanks and the Special Purpose Militia Detachment behind you. You are leading things in that direction, whereas the speaker's role is like a dispatcher -- he presses a button for the next item on the agenda, we discuss it, and that's it." He was supported by Deputy Mironov, who proposed psychiatric checks for deputies. "I agree. On the one hand, there are very many contenders for this role" and he promised to do this within two years "through our special services." But at the same time he voiced a grievance of his own: "Under all the laws of international practice nobody ever discusses the question of whom to appoint as head of government or parliament. The position throughout the world is the same -- the [leader of the] party that wins the most votes in the election is automatically invited by the head of state to form a government or automatically becomes the head of the parliament." Basically, recounting a speech by Vladimir Volfovich is a thankless task. It has to be seen -- it is a theatrical performance by a single actor. Admittedly, sometimes he pushes so hard that he generates furious hostility and indignation. And you again wonder -- just who are you, Mr. Zhirinovskiy? You get shameless bragging ("in just two days my visit to Europe stunned [postavilo na ushi] the planet, all diplomats, and all ministers"), self-confidence ("I have a different role, a different calling"), downright rudeness that does not become a member of parliament ("Don't interrupt! Shut up! Get out of the hall! All the candidates should be sent to mental hospitals!"), and peremptoriness ("Our time has come. Your time has passed. On 12 December Russia's voters said you, 'Russia's Choice,' are my main rival. You are 30 percent down on me. By this spring you will be 60 percent down, and by the fall 90 percent down, and your voice will finally be silenced in the entire Russian political firmament.") In short, Vladimir Volfovich has "temporarily withdrawn his candidacy" and is waiting for the Russian presidential elections. [passage omitted]
