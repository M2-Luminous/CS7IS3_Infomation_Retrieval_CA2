Chamorro Analyzes Strike Failure 94CA0079A Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 5 Feb 94 p 7 94CA0079A Managua BARRICADA Language: Spanish Article Type:CSO [Article by Carlos F. Chamorro B.] [Text] Because of that inclination from which we suffer for enthusiastically aggrandizing the people's struggles without engaging in any critical effort to review their blunders, the failure of the recent transport strike headed by the National Transport Council (CNT) went nearly unnoticed. Attempting to be constructive, I would like to share a number of reflections not unrelated to those now being debated by the Sandinist Front concerning our methods of struggle and their relationship to the people's struggles. The circumstances in which this strike took place were in total contrast with those that existed in September 1993, when the transport movement succeeded in representing the national consensus and heading up a vote of censure of the government's economic policy. That was a broader movement. This one was more focused, but influenced by other factors. In the case at hand, the National Workers Front (CNT) had differing opinions about the viability of gaining widespread support for the movement. This in turn had an undeniable effect on the CNT's decision to try to show its own capacity for leadership. Whatever the real reasons may have been--some allude to a background of competence for potential leadership of the CST [Sandinist Workers Federation]--these are matters deserving of serious review, given the results of the strike. One little-known fact--at least in terms of the public--is that by calling off the strike Tuesday night, the CNT obtained nothing more than what had already been obtained by the other federations that signed an agreement with the government Saturday morning. The strike was suspended in exchange for a promise of talks and negotiations which others had already obtained at a lower cost. The CNT leadership squandered the strike's peak of strength and political legitimacy last Friday, when negotiations were opened with the government as a result of pressure brought by the strike and with the participation of five other transport federations. At the precise moment that the CNT could have exerted the most influence by placing itself at the head of the negotiations, in order to put forward the just demands of the transport workers pitted against the government, it let itself get caught up in a hegemonic position. The result was an overestimation of its own forces, which led them to underestimate other natural allies. This in turn made the division of the movement which the government had sought from the very beginning a far easier task. The CNT subsequently went about maintaining its own strike without being able to control acts of violence targeting other transport workers. This objectively weakened the vitality and legitimacy of the program. An evaluation of this movement yields several troublesome conclusions, the most important of them being the need to take a new look at the conditions in which strikes are waged and the methods of struggle for promoting and effectively achieving their objectives, or at least part of them. The best alternative would never be to stand idly by and abandon the strike tactic and methods of popular pressure. Rather, we must rethink the conditions under which strikes can be staged victoriously. It is sad to admit it, but it would be even worse to stick our heads in the sand and refuse to recognize that this defeat has weakened an irrenounceable instrument of the people's struggle, which the strike is. Social and trade union movements that follow this transport strike will have to meditate long and hard on their future steps. They must gauge their strength, identify their allies, choose more flexible methods of struggle in order to achieve a consensus, and clearly define objectives. The Sandinist Front must take the same self-critical vision, reviewing its actions and political positions on the strike. Although this was indeed an autonomous movement of transport workers, we cannot deny that, having been defeated despite the support of Sandinists for its demands, the FSLN [Snadinist National Liberation Front] must share in the repercussions in order to draw lessons that will improve its leadership of coming contests.
