FBIS4-27506 "dreas106_c_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 North Korea Papers Denounce `Suppression' of ROK Students Papers Denounce `Suppression' of ROK Students SK0206053494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0459 GMT 2 Jun 94 SK0206053494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group made "a sweeping search" of the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) and launched a wholesale arrest of core leaders on charges of "open pro-North, pro-communist tendencies" and "violation of the National Security Law." Papers here today brand it as a premeditated fascist offensive to suppress and strangle Hanchongnyon, the patriotic vanguard organisation of the South Korean students. An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: The fascist clique is brandishing the sword at Hanchongnyon, labeling it as a "pro-communist, enemy-benefiting organisation". But this is an illegal fascist action which can never be justified. The criminal Kim Yong-sam group's suppression of the righteous- minded students who did praise-worthy things for the nation is a violence of fascist hooligans who have lost the last shred of national conscience and human reason. It is an unjustifiable anti-national crime for the puppets to invoke the "National Security Law" against South Korean students for the mere reason that they refuse obedience to the reactionary rule and advocate patriotism and justice. It is crystal clear that "democracy" and "civilian politics" advertised by the Kim Yong-sam group is a camouflage to conceal its true color as civilian fascists and the group is seeking a way out in crackdown on the just struggle of the students and people. A MINJU CHOSON analyst says: The Kim Yong-sam group must scrap the anti-democratic, anti- reunification "National Security Law" and immediately stop the suppression of Hanchongnyon and students.
