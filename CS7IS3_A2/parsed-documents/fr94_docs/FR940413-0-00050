FR940413-0-00050 FR940413-0-00016 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 16 [FRL&hyph;4860&hyph;9] Privacy Act of 1974; Exemptions AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: Pursuant to subsection (k) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k), EPA hereby amends its regulations at 40 CFR part 16 to exempt a system of records from compliance with certain subsections of the Act. The EPA&hyph;30 system of records, which was previously published in the Federal Register on August 12, 1992 (57 FR 36092), is called ``OIG Hotline Allegation System_EPA/OIG'' and is maintained by the EPA Office of Inspector General (OIG). This amendment is made to maintain the efficiency and integrity of OIG investigations, audits, or referrals that result from complaints concerning the possible existence of activities constituting a violation of law, rules, or regulations, mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to the public health or safety. EPA published the proposed rule in the Federal Register on November 22, 1993 (58 FR 61638) for a 30-day comment period. No comments were received from the public. This final rule is identical to the proposed rule. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John C. Jones, Assistant Inspector General for Management, Office of Inspector General (2441), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 260&hyph;4912. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 2, 1986, EPA's final rule exempting several systems of records from compliance with certain subsections of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, was published in the Federal Register (51 FR 24145). EPA claimed a specific exemption for four systems of records under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The exempted systems of records are identified at 51 FR 24146 and 24148 and are codified at 40 CFR 16.14(a)(1). EPA is adding a system of records to those systems of records for which a specific exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) has already been claimed. The EPA&hyph;30 system of records is called ``OIG Hotline Allegation System_EPA/OIG.'' A notice describing that system of records was published in the Federal Register on August 12, 1992 (57 FR 36092). Under the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, 5 U.S.C. app., EPA's Inspector General has the duty to recommend policies for and to conduct, supervise, and coordinate activities in EPA and between EPA and other Federal, State, and local governmental agencies with respect to: (1) The prevention and detection of fraud in programs and operations administered or financed by EPA, and (2) the identification and prosecution of participants in such fraud. In addition, whenever the Inspector General has reasonable grounds to believe there has been a violation of Federal criminal law, the Inspector General must report the matter expeditiously to the Attorney General. The OIG Hotline Allegation System, which is operated and maintained by the OIG, Office of Management, Program Management Division, contains complaints and allegations received from employees of EPA, employees of other Federal agencies, employees of State and local agencies, and private citizens concerning the possible existence of fraud relating to Agency programs and operations. The system has been created in major part to support the criminal law enforcement activities assigned by the Inspector General to the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations. In addition to its principal function pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws, the OIG Hotline Allegation System contains complaints and allegations received from various sources concerning the possible existence of activities constituting a noncriminal violation of law, rules, or regulations, mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to the public health or safety. Such complaints and allegations are referred to investigators or auditors in the OIG, to other components of EPA, or to other Federal, State, or local governmental agencies, as appropriate. Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the head of any agency may promulgate rules to exempt a system of records from certain subsections of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, if the system of records contains investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), subject to certain restrictions. Accordingly, EPA is promulgating this rule to exempt the EPA&hyph;30 system of records to the extent that the system of records contains investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), from the following subsections of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, as permitted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2): 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f). Reasons for exemptions: EPA is exempting this system of records from the above requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, to accomplish the law enforcement functions of the OIG ( e.g. , to prevent subjects of investigations from frustrating the investigatory process by discovering the scope and progress of an investigation; to prevent the disclosure of investigative techniques; to fulfill commitments made to protect confidentiality of sources; to maintain access to sources of information; and to avoid endangering these sources and law enforcement personnel). Additional reasons for exempting this system of records are set forth in EPA's final rule pertaining to Privacy Act exemptions published in the Federal Register of July 2, 1986 (51 FR 24145).
