FR941020-0-00024 FR941020-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Drug Enforcement Administration 21 CFR Part 1308 Exempt Chemical Preparations AGENCY: Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The interim rule (59 FR 15052, March 31, 1994) which identified certain products containing controlled substances as being exempt chemical preparations under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) is adopted without change. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Howard McClain, Jr., Chief, Drug and Chemical Evaluation Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC 20537, Telephone: (202) 307&hyph;7183. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), published as an interim rule, a list of products containing controlled substances which he finds to qualify as exempt chemical preparations (59 FR 15052, March 31, 1994). A 30 day comment period was provided. No comments were received, therefore, the interim rule is adopted without change. The listing of products as exempt chemical preparations in 21 CFR 1308.24 relieves persons who handle them from the registration, recordkeeping, security, and other requirements imposed by the CSA. The Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, certifies that these matters will have no significant impact upon small businesses to compete and he therefore determines that no regulatory flexibility analysis is required. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient federalism implications to require the preparation of Federalism Assessment. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has determined that listings of exempt chemical preparations are exempt from centralized review under Executive Order 12866. List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 1308 Administrative practice and procedure, Drug traffic control, Narcotics, Prescription drugs. Under the authority vested in the Attorney General by section 202(d) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 811(g)(3)(B) and delegated to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration by regulations of the Department of Justice (28 CFR 0.100), and redelegated to the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration, the Deputy Assistant Administrator hereby adopts as a final rule, without change, the interim rule amending 21 CFR 1308.24 which was published at 59 FR 15052 on March 31, 1994. Dated: September 16, 1994. Gene R. Haislip, Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration.
