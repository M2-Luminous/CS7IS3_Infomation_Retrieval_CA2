"Almost all" cabinet ministers agreed at an informal gathering after the morning cabinet meeting to review the system in the wake of Hata's move last week to freeze all public fee hikes for the rest of the year, said Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). Tuesday's gathering gave "the atmosphere" of an agreement, although nothing was decided officially, Terasawa told a regular news conference. But he said Hata immediately ruled out an idea floated by Land Agency chief Megumu Sato to consider using funds from the general account of the national budget to offset some highway toll costs. Terasawa corrected remarks he made earlier, attributing that idea to Farm Minister Mutsuki Kato. But Sato's proposed "project team" to review the public fee system is likely to be formed quickly, Terasawa said, citing more informal talks slated for later in the day. He said the team would fashion some kind of report by the end of June, when the government has pledged to flesh out its deregulation and market-opening plans. Kato, head of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, was one of the cabinet ministers who spoke in support of a fundamental review of the fee system, Terasawa said. Other vocal supporters, he said, were Construction Minister Koji Morimoto, Home Affairs Minister Keigo Ouchi, and Katsuyuki Hikasa, head of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, and Eijiro Hata, international trade and industry minister. But two of the most powerful ministers were silent, according to Terasawa. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Transport Minister Nobuaki Futami, did not comment, the EPA chief said. In supporting the review himself, Terasawa said he wants to EPA [as received] to focus less on "price stability" and more on "lowering prices." Japanese people must pay a proliferation of basic charges, and "for consumers, prices are too high," said Terasawa, who lived in the United States until recently as vice president of Nomura Securities Co. He said the move to revamp the fee system follows the logic that Prime Minister Hata expressed in abruptly deciding last week to freeze the public fee hikes -- the government must show the public it is undergoing the same "thorough restructuring" that the nation's businesses have tackled in the prolonged recession.
