Paek Nam-chi, the party's policy coordinator, said Friday. The party plans to meet with the government to discuss creating a special public fund, considering the enormous cost of providing the North Koreans with vocational training and housing. Some 170 escapees, out of an estimated 25,000 loggers at Pyongyang-run camps in Siberia whose human rights are allegedly violated on a routine basis, are said to be seeking asylum in the South. Seoul pledged on Wednesday to help them resettle either in the South or in a third country in accordance with international law. Paek said, "helping the North Koreans resettle here is better for them than only giving them financial support. And as it is difficult for the government alone to deal with their resettlement, the government needs to induce businesses or other private organizations to provide support." The most important thing, he added, is to avoid a split in national opinion on supporting the North Korean loggers from a humanitarian point of view. "As both the ruling and opposition parties empathize with each other on the issue, we are willing to study jointly with the opposition party some National Assembly measures if necessary." Paek said that the government needs to work out policies on a long-term basis to handle those who have escaped or will escape from North Korea. "We will collect detailed data about the West German policy toward East Germans who escaped from East Germany and study devising legal and institutional measures," he said.
