Why available information cannot be used or modified._Status of compliance with any special conditions on the use of grant funds. Audit Report Audit reports will be required in accordance with 7 CFR 3015 and 3016 to determine that grant funds have been utilized for approved purposes.

Applicants are initially requested to utilize a preapplication to provide detailed information for RDA to use in determining eligibility and priority for available funds.

Exhibit A_Agreement of Administrative Requirements for Rural Technology Development Grants This exhibit contains information regarding the responsibilities of the grantee for receipt of grant funds under the Rural Technology Development Grant program. The grantee must read, understand, and sign this agreement. Record Keeping Requirements Financial Records Grantees must maintain financial management systems and retain financial records in accordance with standards prescribed in 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016, as appropriate, in accordance with terms and conditions of the grant. Grantee records must include an accurate accounting and must document how these funds are used. Property Records Grantees must maintain property records in accordance with standards prescribed in 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016, as appropriate, in accordance with terms and conditions of the grant. 3. Use of improved technology._Improved information technology may be used by the grantee; however, each grantee may be relatively small and high technology information transfer is not considered economically justifiable by FmHA or the grantees. The collection of information required by this regulation is minimal and is more a synopsis of grantee activities than original data. 4. Efforts to identify duplication._The Agency has reviewed all grant programs it administers to determine which programs may be similar in intent and purpose. The Agency has several grant programs that are similar. It is doubtful that an applicant would apply for funding under the RTDG program at the same time and for the same purpose as an application under another program. However, if there were simultaneous participation in more than one grant program, the Agency would make every effort to accommodate the requests within the same set of applications and processing forms. This effort is presently facilitated by assignment of management of these programs to the same program area of responsibility. If a grantee is applying for, or receiving, a grant from another Federal agency, the forms and documents furnished to the other agency would be utilized to the extent possible. 5. Why available information cannot be used or modified._As stated in 4, if similar information is available within RDA or another agency, every effort would be made to utilize that information as is or in an appropriately modified form for this program. 6. Methods to minimize burden of small businesses or entities._The information to be collected is in a format designed to minimize the paperwork burden on small businesses and other small entities. The information collected is the minimum needed by the Agency to approve grants and monitor the grantee performance. 7. Consequence if information collection were less frequent._If the collection of information were conducted less frequently, it could have an adverse effect on the Agency's ability to administer the grant program. The Agency must determine that the grant funds are to be used by the eligible applicants for authorized purposes. 8. Inconsistency with guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6._There are no special circumstances that require the collection to be conducted in a manner inconsistent with the guidelines in 7 CFR 1320.6, except for SF&hyph;270. The SF&hyph;270 is submitted voluntarily during the disbursement period; requests are limited to one every 30 days.
