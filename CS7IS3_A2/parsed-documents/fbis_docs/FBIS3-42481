Kostevyat: "Radio Communications in a Motorized-Rifle Battalion"] [Text] Tactical conditions (the type of battle, the conditions for entry into it, and the nature of the conduct of combat operations), the role and place of the subunit in the combat formation, the combat mission, organization of coordination and the command and control system, enemy capabilities to destroy it, and also the terrain, time of year and time of day affect the organization and support of radio communications in a motorized-rifle battalion. Furthermore, communications in a battalion largely depend on the condition of the equipment and the experience of the specialists. Let's examine how today, in our view, it is most advisable to utilize radio communications to support continuous command and control of elements of the battalion's combat formation and of coordinating subunits. Let's assume that a motorized-rifle battalion is part of a motorized-rifle brigade and that it has to transition from one type of battle to another in a short period of time during the course of combat operations. For example, in defense -- to conduct an offensive against an enemy that has broken through, in an offensive -- to repel an enemy counterattack or, on the march -- to enter a meeting engagement. Both organic subunit radio communications systems and also radios that are in the armored vehicles of the battalion's companies and platoons will be used to support radio communications. In certain situations (specifically, while operating as a tactical air assault force, in the mountains, on swampy terrain, etc.), the motorized-rifle battalion can accomplish the combat mission without heavy weapons and equipment. Then they have to organize radio communications using only organic portable radios. Consequently, you need to plan radio communications beforehand so that it satisfies command and control requirements to the maximum extent possible and its diagram does not require major changes under any conditions of the combat situation. Experience shows that a radio net and a type of its operation -- open telephone communications using coded topographical maps, prearranged message codes and tables of call signs of ranking officers --is the primary method of organization. One of these variants is shown in the diagram. Organization of Radio Communications Let's assume that the motorized-rifle battalion commander's (an R-14 BM or a BMP-1KSh), the chief of staff's (BTR-80K or BMP-1K), and the reconnaissance platoon commander's (BRM-1K) command-staff vehicles and two of the signals platoon's BMP-1's (BTR-80's) are deployed at the battalion command-observation post. The command-staff vehicles of the commanders of the attached and supporting artillery, antiaircraft, tank, engineer and flame-thrower subunits can also be located here. It has not been excluded that the forward aircraft controller (FAC) will arrive here with R-853 (R-859, R-809) portable radios. Furthermore, communications personnel will set up the motorized-rifle battalion deputy commander for weapon's radios at the technical observation post which, as a rule, is located near the command-observation post. Radio Communications With the Commander and Staff at the Next Higher Level It is organized by motorized-rifle brigade headquarters communications instructions and it is best supported by brigade and battalion men and equipment. It is desirable to support the motorized-rifle battalion commander's communications with the motorized-rifle brigade commander on two radio nets on HF and ultrashort wave-band radios in the open and encrypted modes. In the event of the loss of communications, you need to provide for the entry of the battalion commander's HF radio into the headquarters' duty radio net through a higher echelon. It is advisable to include an ultrashort wave radio that is in a BMP-1K on the brigade staff radio net to maintain communications with motorized-rifle brigade headquarters during battalion operations in armored vehicles. If personnel are fighting on foot, you need to carry out communications with the commander and staff at the next higher level using a portable ultra-shortwave radio. When a motorized-rifle battalion is either the forward detachment, a tactical air assault force, or an antiair-assault reserve, you need to organize the battalion commander's communications with the corresponding commander or staff by connecting radios of various bands into their radio net. Furthermore, if the battalion is acting as a TVD [tactical air assault force], it would also be good to have communications with the commander at the next higher level via a separate ultrashort wave or HF radio net. We think that it is advisable for the motorized-rifle battalion reconnaissance commander to ensure he can operate on the motorized-rifle brigade reconnaissance chief's HF radio net to obtain the required information. And the commanders of the battalion's mortar battery, antitank platoon and attached artillery subunit operate in the ultrashort wave range on the brigade artillery chief's radio net. They can also receive information on the meteorological situation here. The air defense subunit commander's radio communications with the motorized-rifle brigade air defense chief should be organized on his ultrashort wave radio net. If the commanders of the reconnaissance platoon, mortar battery and air defense platoon are located directly at the motorized-rifle battalion command-observation post, the battalion commander has the opportunity to obtain an alternate communications channel with the brigade commander through the radio net to which these subunits are connected. Obviously the motorized-rifle battalion deputy commander for rear services and weapons needs to ensure that his radios operate on the ultra-shortwave radio nets of the appropriate higher-echelon authorities for effective resolution of issues. And one more thing. A brigade traffic control and regulating service radio net is created on ultra-shortwave band radios for command and control of battalion subunit movements forward to occupy defense areas, at the final coordination line and also while completing a march. The motorized-rifle battalion commander's radio should be linked to that net. Radio Communications With the Commanders of Subordinate, Attached or Supporting Subunits It is best of all to plan command and control of battalion subunits on three radio nets on R-111, R-123, R-159 and R-158 radios. The first radio net is a battalion commander radio net (R-111 and R-123 radios are utilized during operations in armored vehicles and R-158 and R-159 radios are used while on foot). The radios of the motorized-rifle battalion commander, chief of staff, and the commanders of the motorized-rifle companies, antitank platoon, air defense platoon and signals platoon should operate on it. Furthermore, the radios of the commanders of the mortar battery and reconnaissance platoon should be connected to it when their command and control posts are located apart from the motorized-rifle battalion command-observation post. A total of 7-10 subscribers can operate here. This composition of the radio net will permit the battalion commander to have stable command and control of all elements of the combat formation, while ensuring close coordination among themselves during the course of the battle. We need to note that when the enemy creates jamming and when it is impossible to maintain communications with radios installed in BMP's and BTR's, you need to shift to operations on a radio net using portable radios and, of course, to shift to another frequency. The second radio net -- is also a battalion commander radio net but one that is already linked to the radios of the motorized-rifle battalion commander and chief of staff, and the commanders of motorized-rifle companies, armored vehicle groups, and fire ambushes. The following may be a part of this net: The motorized-rifle battalion deputy commander for weapons, the reconnaissance (combat reconnaissance) patrol, combat security, and detachments for the elimination of the aftereffects of enemy use of weapons of mass destruction, traffic control, removal of obstacles and other temporary formations. Here we must provide for the operations of the commanders of the attached artillery, tank, antiaircraft, engineer and flame-thrower subunits. The total number of subscribers is high -- 20-22. But for the time being there is no other solution. And finally, communications with rear services and technical support subunits is organized on a special radio net. The chief of staff radio, located in the command-observation post, is the main one. It is advisable to include on the radio net the radios of the battalion deputy commander for weapons (at the technical observation post), the commanders of the VMO [logistical support platoon], VTO [technical support platoon] and MEDV [medical platoon] and also the armored vehicles designated for evacuation of damaged vehicles. Furthermore, the motorized-rifle battalion's combat subunit radios can be enlisted to resolve the issues of evacuating the wounded from the battlefield and delivering ammunition. The last radio net is not created during battalion operations without heavy weapons and equipment. In this case, the radios of the commanders of the logistical support platoon, technical support squad and medical platoon can be included on the motorized-rifle battalion commander's second radio net. As we can see, the organization of the data of the three radio nets in the battalion increases the stability of communications and provides the required information transmission capacity among all elements of its combat formation. It is also quite important that the issues of coordination can be efficiently resolved in the process. In cases when the number of radios in the motorized-rifle battalion is limited, the battalion commander's communications with all subunits will have to be maintained on one radio net on ultrashort wave-band radios. This variant is also acceptable while completing a march. It is also advisable to conduct the supervision of the attached tank company by including the battalion commander's and chief of staff's R-123 radios on this subunit commander's radio net. If an artillery battalion will support the motorized-rifle battalion, their commanders will communicate either personally (when the command posts are collocated) or through the artillery battalion and tank company commanders' radio nets. Communications with aircraft are provided through the FAC. The experience of conducting combat operations in Afghanistan showed that he usually arrived at the motorized-rifle battalion command-observation post with a portable radio and operated on aircraft and combat helicopter command and control and also target designation and guidance vectoring radio nets. Radio Communications for Coordination We know that precise organization of coordination is one of the main conditions for the successful execution of combat missions by the battalion. However, you won't manage to create special radio nets for its support in a motorized-rifle battalion because additional radios are needed to do that. And yet there is a solution: The exchange of information between the elements of the combat formation is carried out through reciprocal entry into the appropriate radio nets, for example, via the battalion commander's radio net but with the authorization of the main station. Moreover, this issue is also being resolved through personal contact. This is possible when the commanders of the motorized-rifle company and artillery battery are collocated at a single command and control post, etc. Thus, we must widely employ the method of reciprocal entry into the needed radio nets to ensure reliable coordination in the battalion and its subunits. Indeed, with one essential condition: The motorized-rifle battalion communications chief must think through this issue beforehand and disseminate the required radio operating data to the appropriate commanders. Radio Communications in Battalion Subunits The corresponding commanders' radio nets are organized to ensure command and control in motorized-rifle battalion companies, the mortar battery and independent platoons. The men and equipment of the signals platoon and also of the subunits are utilized here. In each motorized-rifle company, radio communications are ensured with the commanders of platoons, armored groups and the fire ambush on the radio net using R-158 and R-123 radios. This same radio net is also used to carry out command and control of the crews of the armored personnel vehicles that will provide fire support to disembarked motorized riflemen who are on foot. It is advisable to provide two radio nets on behalf of the mortar battery commander. The first radio net is for communications with the senior officer who is located at the fire positions and with the forward (flank) observation post. The mortar battery command and control platoon's R-159 portable radios are used here. The second radio net is designated for command and control of the mortar platoons. It consists of the senior officer's and mortar platoon commander's R-159 radios. From the diagram it is obvious that, when necessary, the mortar battery commander can directly command the fire platoons. Proceeding from the assumption that observation posts will be sent out from the reconnaissance platoon in the defense and while preparing for an offensive, its commander can be located at the motorized-rifle battalion command-observation post. Then you need to organize the reconnaissance platoon commander's radio net (on R-123 and R-158 radios) on which communications can be carried out with the observation posts. You need to provide for the creation of a special radio net for the antitank platoon commander through which he will be able to control the operations of the subordinate SPG-9 and ATGM [antitank guided missile] squads using R-123 and R-158 radios. Destruction of airborne targets in battle is the mission of the air defense subunit; by way of illustration, the SAM [surface-to-air missile] platoon. Therefore, here we need to have a radio net on R-123, R-147 or R-147P radios, through which its commander will maintain communications with the commanders of subordinate crews and air defense gunners-SAM operators. The latter have an R-147P radio receiver. Therefore, they will also be able to receive, in a timely manner, commands for the destruction of enemy helicopters and aircraft. The motorized-rifle battalion commander and chief of staff must have the capability to enter their radios into the appropriate radio nets in order to, for example, transmit an urgent order to some subunit or other. This task has been accomplished. However, the communications chief must prepare and issue them the needed radio operating data beforehand. Now, on the reception of warning signals on the airborne enemy or radioactive, chemical, or biological (bacteriological) contamination. They are being transmitted out of any sequence from brigade headquarters to all of its commander's active radio nets. You need to immediately disseminate received signals to the personnel of subordinate, attached and supporting subunits. In conclusion, we can say that reliable command and control of all elements of the battalion's combat formation using radio communications can be ensured through not only its skillful planning but also through proper protection from enemy jamming. The motorized-rifle battalion has all of the capabilities to do that. They only need to be fully utilized. COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 9 1993
