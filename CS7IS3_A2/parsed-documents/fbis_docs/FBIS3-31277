The session is chaired by Branko Peric of Knin, the oldest deputy. However, the session was interrupted and a recess announced due to serious disagreements over the adoption of the agenda and the verification of the deputies' mandates. The assembly became divided into two camps: deputies from the Serb Democratic Party of Krajina [SDS] and from the Serbian Radical Party in one, and deputies from all the other parties and citizens' groups in the other. This development dashed hopes that the first session of the new Krajina parliament would be held in a jubilant atmosphere and that the deputies would transcend party interests--something the Chairman Peric had called for at the beginning of the session. Drago Kovacevic, head of the SDS group of deputies, proposed that the assembly president and deputy presidents be elected first and that Milan Martic be sworn in as president afterward, while the agenda proposed the opposite.
