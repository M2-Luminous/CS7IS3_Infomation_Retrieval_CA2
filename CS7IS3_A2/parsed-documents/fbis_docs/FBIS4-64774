FBIS4-64774 "drweu089_b_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 BENELUX Netherlands D66 Leader: `Purple' Coalition Formation `Difficult' D66 Leader: `Purple' Coalition Formation `Difficult' BR0605133294 Amsterdam DE VOLKSKRANT in Dutch 6 May 94 p 3 BR0605133294 Amsterdam DE VOLKSKRANT Dutch BFN [Unattributed report: "Democrats Predicts Difficulty in Forming `Purple' Government"] [Text] D66 [Democrats 66] leader Van Mierlo predicted that the creation of a "purple" government comprising the D66, the PvdA [Labor Party], and the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] will be "an extremely delicate and difficult operation, full of difficulties." Van Mierlo said this Thursday [5 May] following the first meeting in Amsterdam of the new 24-member group. The D66 had already made it clear during the election campaign that it would try to put together a "purple" coalition. However, now that the party has become the fourth largest, behind the VVD, it is more difficult for the D66 to serve as a bridge between the PvdA and the VVD. "It is easier to build a bridge between the PvdA and the VVD if you are in between," Van Mierlo said. The D66 leader, who yesterday was provisionally elected floor leader, did not want to reveal anything about the way in which the D66 aims to achieve its goal. "The D66's scenario is to serve the achievement of the goal: A `purple' coalition. I am not holding anything back as far as that is concerned. However, if you want to know about strategy, how we are going to get where we want to go, then I would say this: That is rather delicate, and will have to remain secret for now."
