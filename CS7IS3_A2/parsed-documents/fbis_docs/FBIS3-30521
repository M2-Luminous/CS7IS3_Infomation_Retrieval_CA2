Lech Walesa's special envoy, who on Thursday [3 February] spoke in Vilnius with [Lithuanian President] Algirdas Brazauskas for the second time, said optimistically that it will be "the fifth, and probably last round." Andrzej Zakrzewski, secretary of state in the President's Office, suggests that the controversial issues which kept delaying negotiations on the treaty have in fact already been resolved. The bone of contention was first of all the evaluation of historical events, especially the so-called Zeligowski mutiny and its consequences. For over a year, the Lithuanians firmly rejected Polish suggestions that the evaluation of the past should be left to historians. On Thursday in Vilnius, it was established that part of this declaration pertaining to the evaluation of the past would constitute the treaty's preamble. Different parts of it will be included in the speeches of the Polish and Lithuanian presidents, who will deliver them when the treaty is signed. However, Andrzej Zakrzewski added that "this is what will probably happen." The final decisions will be made during the fifth round of negotiations, held in Warsaw. His statement suggests that the Polish side decided that the formulations proposed on 3 February in Vilnius, concerning the evaluation of the past, are acceptable.
