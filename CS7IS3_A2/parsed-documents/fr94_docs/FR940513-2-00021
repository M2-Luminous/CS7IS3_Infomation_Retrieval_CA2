FR940513-2-00021 FR940513-2-00014 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Financial Assistance Award Intent To Award Grant to the President and Fellows of Harvard College AGENCY: Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(H) to the President and Fellows of Harvard College, Office for Sponsored Research, Harvard University, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Air Cleaning Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts, under Grant Number DE&hyph;FG01&hyph;94EH89439. The DOE intends to make a noncompetitive financial assistance award. The purpose of the proposed grant is to support a conference entitled, ``23rd Department of Energy/Nuclear Regulatory Commission Nuclear Air Cleaning and Treatment Conference.'' This effort will be supported for a total estimated cost of $69,386 to be provided by the DOE. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Please write the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Placement and Administration, Attn: Jeffrey R. Dulberg, HR&hyph;531.24, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20585. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed grant will provide funding to Harvard to organize and conduct the ``23rd Department of Energy/Nuclear Regulatory Commission Nuclear Air Cleaning and Treatment Conference,'' to be held from July 25 through 28, 1994, in Buffalo, New York. It is planned that the conference will be a forum for direct and efficient information transfer, both within the domestic United States and internationally, among nuclear air cleaning experts, to industry, to the general public, and to governmental entities. The focus of this information exchange will be currently available technology and forecasted developments for air and gas cleaning wherever nuclear materials are present. This conference's proceedings will be incorporated with those of the previous conferences into a cumulatively indexed publication to aid information retrieval. The project is meritorious because of its relevance to the accomplishment of an important public purpose_providing an international forum for the dissemination of nuclear energy process and safety information related to nuclear air cleaning and treatment systems in a manner such that the safety of the public will be enhanced by implementation of operational and design improvements in these systems. The conference is planned to include individual presentations and panel discussions. Such formats have been proven by the previous events to be very conducive to direct and efficient information exchange in the state-of-the-art discipline of nuclear air, gas, and water cleaning and treatment. The conference and its subsequent proceedings may demonstrate once again that research and operating experiences to be reported from abroad can benefit workers in the United States in areas of research and operations not now conducted here. Revisions of Federal nuclear standards and regulations pertaining to air and gas cleaning technology are again expected to receive attention and discussion at the conference. Previous conference proceedings have been cumulatively indexed and published to aid information retrieval. These data represent the world's largest, most important, and most accessible information resource on nuclear air and gas cleaning technology. In addition to previously attained benefits to all sectors of the United States nuclear industry, the planned conference is again expected to expand the previous successes with prompt introduction of new technology from worldwide sources, candid exchanges of ways to handle operational difficulties experienced by many installations, stimulation to research in matters of current regulatory concern, and an international forum for unfettered evaluations of research results, design proposals for safety improvements, and the practical effects of implementing new regulations and standards. The DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such an activity. Based on the evaluation of relevance to the accomplishment of a public purpose, it is determined that the proposal represents a beneficial method and approach to disseminate to the public information on nuclear air and gas cleaning technology.
