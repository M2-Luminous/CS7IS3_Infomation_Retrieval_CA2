In the discussion, it was the majority's opinion that the present problems of the German economy cannot be overcome by an economic recovery alone. It is particularly important for him that it was no longer discussed "whether" deregulation, privatization, and the opening of the market are to be carried out "but how" this is to be done, Rexrodt said. In the opinion of Michael Glos, chairman of the Christian Social Union [CSU] land group, the business location forum has proven that Bonn's policy with its 30-point action program is correct. It is now the turn of both sides of industry to contribute their share to more flexibility and efficiency regarding working hours and wage costs. At the same time, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] sharply criticized the Bonn coalition. SPD Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine reproached it for its "complete failure" in economic and financial policies. A comprehensive growth and employment concept has to be immediately developed. In return, Friedrich Bohl (Christian Democratic Union), minister in the Chancellor's Office, called on the Saarland minister president "to put the economic policy of his land in order first before he hands out advice to the government." Bohl advocated the promotion of more part-time work. In the Netherlands, 34 percent of all jobs are part time and in the FRG, it is only 17 percent, he said.
