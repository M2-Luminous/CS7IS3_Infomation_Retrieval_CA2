FR940603-0-00024 FR940603-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 100 [CGD 09&hyph;94&hyph;006] Special Local Regulation; Thomas Graves Memorial Fireworks Display, Lake Ontario, Port Bay, NY AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: A special local regulation is being adopted for the Thomas Graves Memorial Fireworks Display. This event will be held on Lake Ontario, Port Bay, NY on July 3, 1994 with a rain date of July 9, 1994. This regulation will restrict general navigation on Lake Ontario, Port Bay, NY. Due to the large number of spectator vessels and the falling ash and debris from the fireworks display, this regulation is needed to provide for the safety of life, limb, and property on navigable waters during the event. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective from 9:30 p.m. (EDST) until 11 p.m. (EDST) on July 3, 1994 with a rain date of July 9, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William A. Thibodeau, Marine Science Technician Second Class, U.S. Coast Guard, Aids to Navigation and Waterways Management Branch, Ninth Coast Guard District, 1240 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44199&hyph;2060, (216) 522&hyph;3990. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth Coast Guard District, until May 2, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish a proposed rule in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date. Drafting Information The drafter of this regulation is Scott J. Smith, Lieutenant Junior Grade, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Officer, Aids to Navigation & Waterways Management Branch and Karen E. Lloyd, Lieutenant, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Attorney, Ninth Coast Guard District Legal Office. Discussion of Regulation The Thomas Graves Memorial Fireworks Display will be conducted on Lake Ontario, Port Bay, NY on July 3, 1994. This regulation will restrict general navigation on Lake Ontario, Port Bay Harbor, in a 500 foot zone surrounding a barge anchored at 47 ○17 ’46 ’ ’ North Latitude and 076 ○50 ’02 ’ ’ West Longitude. This event will have an unusually large concentration of spectator vessels and falling ash and debris, which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. This regulation is necessary to ensure the protection of life, limb, and property on navigable waters during this event. Any vessels desiring to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander (Commanding Officer, U.S. Coast Guard Station Sodus Point, NY). This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of part 165. Federalism Implications This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. Economic Assessment and Certification This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of these regulations to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary. Collection of Information This regulation will impose no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
