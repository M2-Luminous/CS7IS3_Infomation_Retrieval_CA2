This was revealed recently at a press conference held by the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Iceland, where during the period in question, 200 samples were tested; 19 contained traces of the drug and 171 showed an alcohol content below the legal limit of 0.5 percent. As the research team, headed by Professor Thorkell Johannesson and operating in close cooperation with the police forces with the Reykjavik conurbation and the Traffic Safety Council, was originally concerned only with alcohol levels, 17 of the first 171 drivers tested who later proved to have traces of cannabis in their blood will not now have to face prosecution. Since cannabis is a banned substance in Iceland and its possession and use punishable by law, no special provision is made in the road traffic laws regarding driving under the influence. Technically, therefore, anyone convicted of doing so does not run the risk of losing his license. Each year from 2,000 to 4,000 drivers are stopped by police on suspicion of drunk driving, and it is estimated that alcohol is involved in some 50 accidents every year, with drivers under the legal limit in 10 percent of those cases. This latter group has received particular attention from the team. Speaking to national media, Johannesson and Reykjavik Police Chief Bodvar Bragson said there was now an urgent need to investigate the presence of other drugs, particularly amphetamine, in blood samples taken from drivers.
