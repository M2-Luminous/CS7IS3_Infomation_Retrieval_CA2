Conversion of state enterprises into joint-stock companies is one of the prominent reform measures that have been taken in China to establish a modern enterprise system. Deputies point out that experiment in this regard has achieved marked progress in the past decade, which has proved that the share-holding system has injected vigor into state enterprises. According to He Guanghui, vice minister in charge of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring, economic restructuring in China has always been concentrated on the central task of reforming enterprises. "Establishment of a share-holding system has been at the core of the task of changing the operational mechanism of state enterprises. China has accumulated experience and achieved good results in this regard," he said. Reform of state enterprises has gone through a series of phases in the past 15 years, evolving from operational autonomy for enterprises, to contractual responsibility, and to transformation of their operational mechanism. But on the whole, state enterprises are yet to be invigorated. Deputies say that, since the government has decided to establish a modern enterprise system, the share-holding system, as a prominent form of organization that clearly defines ownership relations and operational mechanism, has become an important way of choice for invigorating state enterprises in a market economy. As state enterprises have different conditions, there should be many ways to invigorate them, deputies say. Their consensus is that a single formula will not do when it comes to enterprise reform. Zhang Shouye, an NPC deputy from Linyi, Shandong Province, says that different enterprises should adopt different ways of reform. They can choose from a share-holding system, a share-holding cooperative system, management by collectives or individuals, leasing, and auction. He said: "If an enterprise adopts a share-holding system, its workers will have a strengthened sense of being the owners of the enterprise involved, and that will enable them to do a better job and the enterprise to prosper." Economist Wang Jue says that the more share holders an enterprise has, the more there are people who care about its performance. Xiao Guojin, professor of Wuhan University, says that an important content of building a modern enterprise system is to organize an enterprise in the form of a company and raise funds by issuing shares. Large state enterprises should be transformed into limited liability companies, he says. According to Wang Jue, in a typical joint-stock company, one-third of its shares are sold to its employees, another one-third are sold to outside investors, and still another one-third are owned by the government, which can thus control the company. Today, according to official figures, there are over 11,500 enterprises in China that have adopted a corporate system. Among them, more than 3,000 are limited liability join-stock companies, with a total stock value of around 300 billion yuan. These companies are distributed in 30 provinces, autonomous regions and centrally-administered municipalities. And the number of their share holders has reached 25 million. Deputies stress that transformation of state enterprises into joint-stock companies must be carried out prudently. According to Wang Genyuan, director of the Dezhou Textile Mill in Shandong Province and an NPC deputy, before such transformation, a number of problems must be sorted out. These include: asset evaluation, ways to preserve and increase the value of state-owned assets, and relations between the share holders conference and the workers' congress. He Jiezhi, an NPC deputy and chairman of the Jincheng Paper Co. in Liaoning Province, says establishment of a corporate system requires certain conditions, among which are existence of a social security system, and freedom from debts and government interference. "If these problems are not solved, a corporate system cannot be established," he said. That is why, according to He Guanghui, the share-holding system is still at an experimental stage. "Most enterprises embracing the share-holding system will be limited liability companies," he said. "Only a few will be listed on stock exchanges." At present, the government still exercises controls over the number of listed companies and the amount of shares issued. To date, a total of 183 companies in China have their shares listed. And last year the government allowed five billion yuan worth of shares to be issued, and this year only a marginal increase is expected. According to government policy, share issues will be limited largely to companies in energy, transport and raw materials sectors. Inside sources say this year China will continue to encourage a number of enterprises to issue shares in Hong Kong and the United States.
