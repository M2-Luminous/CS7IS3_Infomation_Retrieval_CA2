He said that Nigeria remains committed to peace in the West African sub-region. The defence spokesman, who was commenting on Wednesday's visit by a Cameroonian Government delegation to Nigeria's military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha on the disputed Bakassi Peninsula, said Nigeria "was happy at this initiative." "Nigeria has no desire to go to war with Cameroon", he said adding: "With this visit, the Cameroonian Government has seen that the path of peace is preferable to that of war". Chijuka said Nigeria's military strength and preparedness should not be underestimated in spite of the fact that some 12,000 of its troops are currently serving in ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], the West African peace-keeping force in Liberia. A meeting between Gen. Abacha and President Paul Biya of Cameroon is in the pipeline, in an attempt to find a peaceful solution to the differences between the two countries. No date has been set for Biya's visit, seen as the highest level of diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the long-standing dispute over the oil rich Bakassi Peninsula in south-eastern part of Nigeria. Cameroon alleged last weekend that its troops were attacked by Nigerian troops in the disputed territory, a claim which Nigeria denied. Cameroon also claimed that Nigeria has been occupying parts of the disputed land illegally since 21 December. Nigeria alleged that 30 of its villages had been burnt, many villagers killed or maimed and women raped.
