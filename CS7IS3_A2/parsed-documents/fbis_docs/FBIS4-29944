U.S. autos already have introduced "low-priced cars" with a low list price, but in the case of European cars which are luxury class autos, it appears that, because of the necessity to maintain brand image, they have entered the "low price battlefront" by lowering loan interest rates which has little effect on the list price. With the bonus season drawing close, domestic car dealers have a heightened sense of wariness about intensification of price competition. BMW (BMW Japan, Chiba city), the import base for BMW cars, announced on 3 June that it would extend until the end of August the special 2.9-percent loans that it had implemented until the end of May. The whole series was considered subject to it up until the end of May, but the extension will narrow the car class to the middle-class "5 series." In the case of the "5201 Sedan" (4.95 million yen), the total price will be over 305,000 yen cheaper (60 payments) compared to the regular loan (6.5 percent). Moreover, Mercedes Benz Japan (Minato Ward, Tokyo), the import base for Benz cars, has introduced a 3.5-percent loan beginning this month until the end of July targeting its highest car class, "S class." In the case of borrowing 11 million yen, total payments will be 825,000 yen less than a regular loan (6.5 percent). In addition, it will set up special loans until the end of July for the Audi and through June for the Rover (Mini). Many of the European auto low-interest loans adopt the method of a maker-affiliated finance company paying the trade account receivable for the sales office at the time of the purchase contract and receiving repayment from the purchasing customer later. The import bases which are the Japanese subsidiaries of European makers consider that, "while bound by sales policy, they will set up low-interest loans for limited car classes and periods," (BMW Japan) and it is a so-called maker (import base) initiated "discount." As opposed to this, the sales offices of many domestic cars finance the purchasing customer. For this reason, even though the car price is discounted, there is the aspect of trying to improve profit by financing, and interest has become high.
