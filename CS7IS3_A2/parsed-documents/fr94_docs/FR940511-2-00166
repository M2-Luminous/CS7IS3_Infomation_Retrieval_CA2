FR940511-2-00166 FR940511-2-00108 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33984; File No. SR&hyph;GSCC&hyph;94&hyph;1] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Government Securities Clearing Corp.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Comparison and Netting of Members' Treasury Auction Purchases May 2, 1994. On January 26, 1994, Government Securities Clearing Corporation (``GSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). 1 On February 18, 1994, GSCC filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 2 The Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the Federal Register on March 10, 1994. 3 The Commission received one comment letter in response to this notice. 4 As discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b) (1988). 2 Letter from Jeffrey F. Ingber, General Counsel, GSCC to Jack Drogin, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (February 15, 1994). 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33703 (March 2, 1994), 59 FR 11345. 4 Letter from Gerald Murphy, Fiscal Assistant Secretary, U.S. Department of the Treasury to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission (April 5, 1994). I. Description The proposed rule change modifies GSCC's rules to allow GSCC to accept and report data on proprietary purchases of Treasury notes, bills, and bonds made at auction by members of GSCC's netting system; to net the purchases with when-issued trades of such members in the member securities; and to deliver purchased securities through GSCC's clearing mechanism (the ``auction takedown system''). GSCC has established links with the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Chicago, and San Francisco in order to provide the auction takedown system, and will establish links with other Federal Reserve Banks as needed. GSCC intends to implement the auction takedown system in the Spring of 1994. The proposed rule change also authorizes GSCC to establish a mechanism for accepting data on members' trades in eligible securities from sources such as exchanges and other clearing corporations on a ``locked-in'' basis. This means that GSCC members would be obligated to accept trades as reported by such sources and GSCC would treat such data, under its rules, as if they were the successful results of GSCC's comparison of trade data submissions from buying and selling members. 1. The Auction Takedown Service a. Eligible Securities Only auction purchases meeting two conditions are eligible for inclusion in GSCC's auction takedown system. First, the purchase must be of a security with an issue date one or more business days after the auction date. Second, only proprietary purchases are eligible. The auction bid submitted to the Federal Reserve Ban must not include a customer's or client's name on the tender form or on an attachment to the tender form. 5 5 Even if the client or customer is a GSCC netting member, the trade will still be ineligible.
