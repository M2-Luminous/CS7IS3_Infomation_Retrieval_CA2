We have virtually everything for this. We only need to discard the nuclear symbolism for the sake of the economy. I am quite certain of this. Analyzing our steps on the whole of the complex path to the resolution of the nuclear problem in Ukraine, we consider that this path has been consistent and on the whole right. This work was conducted under the leadership of the Supreme Council. All of the legislative acts which were adopted by the Supreme Council regarding the nuclear problem show that Ukraine has gradually been moving toward a non-nuclear status. I have already reported in detail on all of these steps and resolutions at a joint session of the relevant Supreme Council commissions. Taking all of this into account, and also the fact that strategic nuclear weapons located in Ukraine are not a factor deterring an attack by an aggressor on our state nor a guarantee of its security, we consider that the next step of the Supreme Council of ratifying the START I Treaty on 19 November 1993 was entirely proper and logical. Esteemed deputies, at the same time you know that the relevant reservations in the ratification of the START I Treaty by the Supreme Council of Ukraine unfortunately did not diminish international tension, but on the contrary complicated the problem of strategic nuclear weapons located in Ukraine even more, and especially where Russia was concerned. In such a situation it was necessary to act in a very considered way. We believed that, to the extent that we could convincingly show the world and our people the rightness of our legal and other actions regarding nuclear weapons, both the international prestige of Ukraine and the domestic situation in the state would depend on this, and so would the strategic prospect of our national security to a considerable extent. Therefore we at the Ministry of Defense believed that of the whole set of nuclear issues our main task was to define our stance above all on the technical state of the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine. In the implementation of the resolution on ratification of the START I Treaty and the instruction of the president of Ukraine by the Ministry of Defense and myself personally, the state of nuclear weapons of the 43d missile army and (?the) long-range air force was thoroughly analyzed. Together with leading specialists and scientists of Ukraine, I personally inspected the situation at all nuclear facilities. The work which was carried out allows me to report to you, esteemed deputies, the following conclusions, which from the point of view of military and technical reasons determine the necessity of a gradual withdrawal of nuclear warheads [yaderni boyeprypasy], which in accordance with their technical state have gone beyond the guarantee service period. I consider that the main thing is that the nuclear warheads, with which intercontinental ballistic missiles are equipped, constitute very complex technical apparatus, for the creation of which a lengthy and extremely expensive process of design, testing, and production is needed. To date Ukraine has not had the possibility of resolving these tasks. Nor will it have in the near future. There is no scientific and production base for creating nuclear weapons in our state. There are no ranges to test them on, nor specialists in recycling nuclear warheads. And the main thing, esteemed deputies, is the economic condition of our state. To continue, one should also take account of the fact that a tough and obligatory condition of the safe maintenance of nuclear weapons is the uninterrupted scientific and technical accompaniment to its operation, which consists of constant supervision [kontrol] and regular inspection of the state of nuclear warheads (?and of elaborated) scientifically grounded technical decisions regarding the possibility and conditions for further operation of nuclear warheads [yaderni boyevi bloky]. From the practical aspect, the design offices and plants, manufacturers of nuclear weapons located in Russia, are obliged to carry out such scientific and technical accompaniment. But today they are not carrying out these measures, and on the contrary are blocking them. It is also necessary to emphasize that the guaranteed service periods of a considerable number of nuclear warheads located in Ukraine are expiring or have already expired. It could happen that unsupervised [nekontrolyovanyy] physical processes which are occurring in nuclear warheads will be unforeseen, and the state of nuclear weapons will become critical. The impossibility of replacing gas reactors, whose guarantee service periods have already expired, in nuclear warheads causes especial concern. The said reactors are produced in Russia and are not arriving in Ukraine. To date more than 300 (?nuclear) reactors have accumulated in our state, which need urgent replacement. In addition, the storage of nuclear weapons in repositories remains a complex problem. Thus, when a large number of nuclear warheads are located in nuclear technical units, the level of their nuclear safety is lowered and leads to the loss of the guarantee of the chief designer. That which is in the repositories of the nuclear technical units of the 46th missile division consists, together with SS-24 missiles, (?of) 60 nuclear warheads, the investigation of three of which showed, which our president spoke about, that irreversible physical and chemical processes are occurring. The extent of the (?danger of explosion) of radioactive materials of the warheads is increasing drastically. The list of violations determining a critical state of nuclear and ecological safety could be continued. Taken all together, they could lead to an accident, the consequent scale of which could potentially exceed the Chernobyl disaster. Esteemed deputies, I pray to God not to let this happen. One cannot not emphasize that the state of nuclear safety is also affected by the condition of missiles, the servicing of which is also not fully carried out and with violations of the operational demands and normative documents, I (?do not) have in mind specialists from Russia. The conclusion is that proceeding from what has been set forth above, the further maintenance of nuclear warheads [yaderni boyeprypasy] on the territory of Ukraine presents a danger not just for Ukraine and Russia, but also for our other neighboring states in Europe and the Near East; in the event of an accident, they will find themselves in the zone of radioactive contamination. Thus because of the circumstances of the necessity of implementing the demands in the resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on ratification of the START I Treaty concerning conducting further talks, meetings, and accords -- as a result of this the trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, and the appendix to it, are a necessary and logical step in the matter of Ukraine acquiring a nonnuclear status, and on the whole resolve positively all military-technical issues of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. We believe that with the aim of guaranteed implementation of the demands of the trilateral statement and the appendix to it it is necessary during further talks with the Russian Federation to elaborate and sign a number of documents to determine the time periods, procedure, and conditions for the transfer of Russian nuclear warheads. The following should be included in these documents: a schedule for dispatching the first group of nuclear warheads over 10 months; an agreement regarding the procedure and conditions for supervision on the part of Ukraine over the dismantlement and recycling of nuclear warheads at enterprises of the industry of the Russian Federation; an agreement on compensation to Ukraine on the part of the Russian Federation for the value of the transferred warheads; an agreement on warranty inspection and servicing by the manufacturer of the state of nuclear warheads over the whole period of their being in Ukraine, including the process of transportation to Ukrainian facilities and to bases at plants of Russia's industrial enterprises; a protocol on the mutual obligations of Ukraine and the Russian Federation regarding the grouping of strategic nuclear forces in Ukraine and conditions of joint supervision over the state of nuclear missile weapons. (?As regards) equal relations over the period of the reduction of nuclear weapons with states of the nuclear club, including with the United States, and after the START I Treaty comes into force and Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty of 1 July 1968, they should be equivalent to those measures which are taken concerning supervision of the reduction of nuclear armaments by every state, and incidentally under the supervision of our specialists. I consider, esteemed deputies, that I should draw your attention to another aspect of the nuclear problem. This is about the fact that, notwithstanding the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons, we will have a very careful attitude to keeping the personnel and infrastructure of the 43d missile army. This is in general of great value, I mean both the specialists and the material base. All of this can in the very near future be successfully used, not just in the interests of the state's military security, but also for civilian needs. I believe that the accords achieved by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia in Moscow on 14 January of this year on the whole resolve positively virtually all military-technical issues of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which satisfies the conditions of nuclear disarmament determined in the resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 18 July [as heard] 1993. And I would ask you, esteemed deputies, to support the proposals of our president. Thank you for your attention.
