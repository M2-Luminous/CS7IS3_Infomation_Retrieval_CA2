The Benxi Steel and Iron Complex, one of the leading pollutant dischargers in this city in Liaoning Province, has recently equipped all seven huge boilers at its power plant with dust removal devices, thus reducing the local dust fall by one-third, local officials said. The dust-removal project has cost three years and 80 million yuan, contributed by the government and the complex. After it went into operation recently, local citizens, especially those living in the surroundings of the complex, said that they felt the air is obviously cleaner this winter, according to the officials. Song Jian, a State Councilor, sent his congratulations to the complex for its encouraging achievements in reducing pollution. The project is a part of "Operation Blue Sky," launched in the city five years ago to reduce serious air pollution. The "Operation Blue Sky" involves a total investment of 375 million yuan, part of which will be undertaken by the Benxi steel complex. Though suffering from a serious shortage of funds, the officials said the complex will invest another 300 million yuan to carry out five more projects to reduce pollution.
