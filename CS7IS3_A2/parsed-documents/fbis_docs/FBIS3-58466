This forecast does not share the skeptical view of the "Five Wise Men" that predicted a stagnation for 1994. Bonn's annual forecast is mainly based on a more optimistic evaluation of export demand. Due to higher excise taxes and higher social insurance contributions, as well as cuts in social benefits, private consumption is expected to decrease even further, with a 3-percent inflation rate. According to the report, the unemployment figure could go up by another 450,000, reaching 3.9 million by the end of 1994. In its draft 1994 Annual Economic Report, which should not deviate from the final version to any great extent, the government confirms its view that a "solid foundation" has been created for an economic upswing. Factors that were once major reasons for the recession look "distinctly different" right now. Apart from a clear improvement in the world economy, this includes a downward trend in wage cost increases, a price situation that is cooling, more stable exchange rates, and lower interest rates. This means that the starting point for further development is "considerably better" than it was a year ago. This is especially true for the eastern German economy, where housing is becoming the main growth factor. With an above-average increase in the new laender, Germany's 1994 housing investments could increase by up to 7 percent. In capital investments, Bonn expects a real growth of 3 to 4 percent. Due to the tight budget situation, however, it is feared that public investment will decline considerably. In spite of improved prospects for exports -- the report expects a real increase in exports of goods and services of 3 to 4 percent, with imports going up by 1 to 2 percent at the same time -- the government does not yet expect an upswing that would bring about an increase in utilization of production capacity and a stabilization of the demand for labor. Much will depend on consumers' reactions to drops in their real incomes, effective at the beginning of this year. There are, however, indications that private consumption will decrease by only 1 percent, with an inclination toward inhibiting further decline. The Annual Economic Report expects real wage increases of between 2.5 and 3 percent for individual employees; with a figure of 2 percent in western Germany, and 6.5 to 7.5 percent in the new laender. In spite of an increase in mineral oil tax, which will effect the inflation rate by 0.5 percent, annual average price increases in 1994 are expected to slow down to 3 percent, and increases spread out over the year, to 2.5 percent. Other domestic prices, especially those in the building industry, could also increase substantially less than before. Even in the new laender, where prices went up by over 9 percent in 1993, the government expects price increases of only 5 percent in 1994. Since the first stage of economic recovery is always linked to strong increases in productivity, "considerable cuts in employment" must again be expected in 1994, the report says. With a total of 3.9 million unemployed people at the end of 1993, an increase of 450,000 will mainly effect western Germany. In eastern Germany, on the other hand, the unemployment rate will remain around the current 1.2 million. For Germany as a whole, this would result in an increase in the unemployment rate from, currently, 8.9 to around 10 percent. Overcoming the recession in western Germany remains an absolute precondition for ensuring a lasting economic upswing in eastern Germany, the report says. This goes for both the dynamics of investments and for marketing prospects of eastern German companies, which are still far from having made up for their lower productivity.
