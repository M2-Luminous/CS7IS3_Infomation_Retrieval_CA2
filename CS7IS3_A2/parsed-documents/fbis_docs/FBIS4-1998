Sources from the zone authority said it had registered 332 enterprises by the end of last year. These enterprises involve a total capital of 560 million yuan, of which 220 million yuan is overseas investment. In 1993, these enterprises produced an industrial output value of 50 million yuan, of which 79 percent was by overseas-funded enterprises. The overseas-funded enterprises in the zone exported 2.17 million U.S. dollars worth of products in 1993. This amounted to 40 percent of the export value of all the overseas-funded ventures in the region in the same period. So far nearly 70 million yuan has been invested in the zone, developing 100 ha of land and office buildings totalling 120,000 square meters in floor space have been constructed. According to plan, by the year 2000, the zone will stretch 3.7 sq km, attracting 90 high-tech enterprises and producing an annual industrial output value of one billion yuan. The sources believe that Ningxia's rich resources in minerals and energy contributed greatly to the initial success of the Yinchuan High-Tech Development Zone.
