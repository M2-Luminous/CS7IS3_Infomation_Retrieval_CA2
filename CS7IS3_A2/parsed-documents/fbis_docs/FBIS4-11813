Today, brothers, we challenge the enemies from Wadi Dinar in Bani Walid, the Wadi where the blood of martyrs had flowed, the martyrs of Bani Walid who fought the Italian army which was stronger in number and equipment and material. The free voice, the voice of defiance rises from Bani Walid, from Wadi Dinar. Our voice rises, brothers, in defiance of the agents, the disreputed American intelligence, and we challenge America with its might. We are stronger than it because we have the right to our land and we have the right to live freely, proudly, under the sun and on the land of our fathers and ancestors, which was irrigated by their blood, brothers. Brothers, from this sacred valley, in which the blood of your martyr fathers and grandfathers of Bani Walid flowed, our voice rises with defiance, and we announce the destruction of the conspiracies of America, its hirelings, its intelligence service, its rumors, and its [word indistinct]. Brothers, we are destroying their rumors as we have destroyed their armies in this valley. Brothers, sons of Bani Walid, grandsons of the martyr (?Gulbar) hero of Afya battle, sons of Bani Walid, grandsons of the martyr al- Sadiq (?Buli), hero of (?Tagirbit) battle, you must remain faithful to the blood that flowed in Dinar valley to defend the freedom of Libya, to defend Pan-Arabism and to defend Islam, the religion of Pan-Arabism. You must remain faithful to the blood that flowed in [words indistinct] against Turkish colonialism. [passage omitted] Brothers, today Bani Walid's role has come to line up in the preparation battle, in the defiant battle against the international encroachment and haughtiness (?practised) by America and its allies. In this Wadi we did not fear Italy's legions and we smashed Italy's arrogance in Wadi Dinar. [passage omitted] Now, we declare that, once again, we are ready for confrontation and defiance in Wadi Dinar, in Zaytouna, and everywhere in our land, to face up to a new confrontation against new colonialism. We are the sons, the grandsons of those people whose blood flowed in this Wadi. Brothers, we will be faithful to this blood. Today, brothers, Bani Walid's voice is raised in the defiant battle as long as colonialism points its rifles against the chest of each son of our people, and as long as colonialism targets the freedom of every area of this homeland. Wirfallah [a tribe, members of which were accused of spying] cannot but line up in the battle of glory, pride, defiance, and independence. It is a battle of independence, a battle of awakening of the Arab nation from the Ocean to the Gulf. Your shouts at Wadi Dinar and Bani Walid will not go unheard and in vain; today the whole Arab nation, from the Atlantic to the Gulf, is hearing your shouts. These shouts represent a boost for the Palestinian militants and thousands of Palestinians kept inside the prisons of the Israeli forces of occupation. Your shouts raise the morale of Lebanese fighters, fighters of the Somali people, and all militants of the Arab nation to liberate the occupied territories that stretch from Ceuta and Melilla to the usurped Palestine. Brothers, this voice emanating from Wadi Dinar and Bani Walid is being heard by the whole Arab nation. From this position, from the sacred Wadi Dinar, we invite Warfalah to take a leading role and mobilize itself for confrontation, as we always expect it to do. It should lead the confrontation to defend the dignity, honor, and the whole nation. Brothers, we will never give up, and history will never be able to record that we have abdicated our duties. We are the sons of the district [word indistinct], the sons of the martyrs and heroes. History will never be able to write that we have not responded to the call for the preparation for confrontation. Bani Walid will never miss the opportunity and will answer the call of the holy war, the call for the confrontation against the United States and the allies of the United States. Cursed are those agents: the traitors, the cowards, those who gave up and bowed, those who sold their country to others. Cursed are the pitiful cowards. Glory and honor for these revolutionaries, these brave people, the sons of Bani Walid who march today in Wadi Dinar to announce their collective pledge. Bani Walid is a fortress of defiance, Bani Walid is a fortress of steadfastness, Bani Walid is a fortress of confrontation. The struggle continues, and victory is inevitable, brothers. Forward we march until the sun of liberty shines on the whole Arab world, from the Atlantic to the Gulf. Forward we go and may the struggle continue.
