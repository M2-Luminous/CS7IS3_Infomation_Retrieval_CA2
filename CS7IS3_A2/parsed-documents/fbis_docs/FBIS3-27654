Veteran legislator Elsie Tu, who had tabled a motion to delay the partial reform bill in the hope that the Sino-British talks might resume, said that the adoption of the bill means a total breakdown of the Sino-British talks. If the Sino-British talks remain stalled, Tu said, the years between now and 1997 will not be smooth for Hong Kong, because in a broken family there is inevitably a breakdown in communication and a lack of co-operation. "And in a broken family it is the innocent children who suffer most. The innocent children in this case are the ordinary people of Hong Kong, the silent majority, who seek nothing more than to get on with their lives," she added. Tu's adjourn motion was supported by 23 other legislators, who described Tu as "courageous," "responsible," "incurably optimistic" and with a "whole-hearted love for Hong Kong." The Liberal Party headed by its leader Allen Lee supported the move on the grounds that a one-month deadline be stipulated. But some others disagreed with the view. Philip Wong, who opposed the reform bill, told the Legislative Council that by tabling bill to the Legislative Council before any agreement is reached between the Governments of China and Britain, Chris Patten has placed the Legislative Council above the two sovereign states, indicating that the British side had no sincerity to cooperate with China. The reform bill would mislead local residents, he said. Another legislator Lau Wong-fat criticized the Hong Kong authorities for tabling the reform bill without consultation with the Chinese side. "This action does not tally with the interests of Hong Kong," he said. In fact, Lau added, the electoral arrangements, which are to last only two or three years, would undermine the basis for the Sino- British cooperation and cause confusion and instability in Hong Kong in the latter half of the transitional period. Peggy Lam MBE [member of the Order of the British Empire] stated that the political reform bill proposed by Governor Patten in October 1992 has caused the relations between the Chinese mainland, Britain and Hong Kong to deteriorate and made local residents feel hopeless. The Chinese side has time and again said that the arrangements on the 1994-95 election can be discussed so long as the British side shows its sincerity. But the Hong Kong Government unilaterally advanced a reform package in disregard of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and went on to submit it to the Legislative Council, thus ditching the last chance for China and Britain to resume their talks, she said. It is the Hong Kong authorities that have compelled the Chinese side to make its own preparations, she added.
