Twelve thousand workers have joined the strike so far. All production and support sections of the steelworks are at a standstill. The strike is supported by most of the trade unions operating at the steelworks. The strike committee, appointed by Sierpien-80 [August-80] trade union activists, is demanding pay increases of 2,000,000 zloty per month, a 30-percent bonus and a one-time payment of 3,000,000 zlotys to every striking worker. The damping down of the iron blast furnace number 1 has begun and is expected to be completed by 1500. A rally of all staff is planned for 1300. The steelworks' management is still of the opinion that it is impossible to meet the strikers' demands, as this would quickly lead to bankruptcy. The management has announced that it would rather resign than give in to the demands.
