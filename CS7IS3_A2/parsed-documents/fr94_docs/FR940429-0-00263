(a)(1) If, as a result of a Federal audit or an audit performed at the direction of an institution or third-party servicer, an expenditure made by the institution or servicer or the institution's or servicer's compliance with an applicable requirement (including the lack of proper documentation), is questioned, the Secretary notifies the institution or servicer of the questioned expenditure or compliance. (2) If the institution or servicer believes that the questioned expenditure or compliance was proper, the institution or servicer shall notify the Secretary in writing of the institution's or servicer's position and the reasons for that position. (3) The institution's or servicer's response must be based on performing an attestation engagement in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and must be received by the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the Secretary's notification to the institution or servicer. (b)(1) Based on the audit finding and the institution's or third-party servicer's response, the Secretary determines the amount of liability, if any, owed by the institution or servicer and instructs the institution or servicer as to the manner of repayment. (2) If the Secretary determines that a third-party servicer owes a liability for its administration of an institution's Title IV, HEA programs, the servicer shall notify each institution under whose contract the servicer owes a liability of the determination. The servicer shall also notify every institution that contracts with the servicer for the same service that the Secretary determined that a liability was owed. (c)(1) An institution or third-party servicer that must repay funds under the procedures in this section shall repay those funds at the direction of the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the Secretary's notification, unless_ (i) The institution or servicer files an appeal under the procedures established in subpart H of this part; or (ii) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period.

(3) If, under the proceedings in subpart H, liabilities asserted in the Secretary's notification, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to the institution or third-party servicer are upheld, the institution or third-party servicer shall repay those funds at the direction of the Secretary within 30 days of the final decision under subpart H of this part unless_ (i) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period; or (ii) The Secretary determines that earlier collection action is appropriate pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. (d) An institution is held responsible for any liability owed by the institution's third-party servicer for a violation incurred in servicing any aspect of that institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs and remains responsible for that amount until that amount is repaid in full.
