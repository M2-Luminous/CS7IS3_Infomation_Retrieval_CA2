FR940525-2-00107 FR940525-2-00064 GPU Nuclear Corporation, et al., Docket No. 50&hyph;219, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Ocean County, New Jersey Date of amendment request: April 15, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment requests the deletion of the audit program frequency requirements from Technical Specification (TS) 6.5.3 and to utilize the Operational Quality Assurance (OQA) Plan as the controlling document. This change will introduce more flexibility into audit scheduling to consider plant activities and performance. In addition, a minor editorial change has been incorporated correcting a reference in TS 6.5.1.14 in response to a finding in the Operational Safety Team Inspection report of December 23, 1993. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: GPU Nuclear has determined that this [Technical Specification change request] TSCR poses no significant hazard as defined by the NRC in 10 CFR 50.92. 1. These changes do not affect the function of any system or component. Therefore, they do not increase the probability of occurrence or consequence of an accident previously evaluated in the [Safety Analysis Report] SAR. 2. These changes do not involve a physical change to plant configuration and they do not affect the performance of any equipment. Therefore, they do not create the possibility of an accident or malfunction of a different type than previously identified. 3. The shifting of the audit frequency requirements from the Technical Specifications to the OQA Plan and the extension of the maximum interval between audits of certain areas do not change the activities to be audited nor the scope of individual audits. Furthermore, audit frequencies are not associated with the margin of safety in the bases of any Technical Specification. Therefore, the margin of safety is not affected by this change. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

GPU Nuclear Corporation, et al., Docket No. 50&hyph;219, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Ocean County, New Jersey Date of amendment request: April 19, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed change updates and clarifies Technical Specification 3.4.B.1 to be consistent with existing Specifications 1.39 and 4.3.D (ASME Code Section XI, Article 5000 requirements). The requested change would delete reference to the ASME Code Section XI, IS&hyph;5000 ten year hydrotest inspection interval and replace this with references to: (1) The Technical Specification 1.39 definition for Reactor Vessel Pressure Testing, and (2) the Technical Specification 3.3.A.(i) Reactor Vessel Pressure Testing limits (P/T and 250 ○F maximum test temperature). The requested change will clarify that the five electromatic relief valves' (EMRV) pressure relief function may be inoperable or bypassed during system pressure testing required by ASME Code Section XI, Article IWA&hyph;5000, including system leakage and hydrostatic test, with reactor vessel completely solid, core not critical and Technical Specification 3.2.A (Core Reactivity limits) satisfied. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The requested change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of any accident previously evaluated because this change: (a) Merely updates and clarifies Technical Specification 3.4.B.1 to be consistent with other existing Technical Specifications, (b) contains no adverse changes to any existing safety function necessary for the reactor vessel solid, core not critical condition, and (c) makes no modification or physical changes to plant equipment, performance or operation necessary to respond to accidents for the reactor vessel solid, core not critical condition. 2. The requested change does not create the possibility of a new or different accident from any accident previously evaluated because this change: (a) Merely updates and clarifies Technical Specification 3.4.B.1 to be consistent with other existing Technical Specifications, (b) contains no adverse changes to any existing safety function necessary for the reactor vessel solid, core not critical condition, and (c) over pressure protection would continue to be provided by the code safety valves when the EMRV pressure relief function is bypassed. 3. A significant reduction in margin of safety is not involved because even though the EMRV pressure relief function is bypassed, over pressure protection would continue to be provided by the code safety valves. Elimination of this relief function does not affect the reactor safety analysis, since credit was not taken for the EMRV pressure relief function .␣.␣. . The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
