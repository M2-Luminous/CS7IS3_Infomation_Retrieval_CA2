FBIS3-26189 "drchi024_b_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 United States & Canada XINHUA Reports Senate Confirmation of Defense Secretary OW0402033694 Beijing XINHUA in English 0240 GMT 4 Feb 94 OW0402033694 Beijing XINHUA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Washington, February 3 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Senate, acting with unusual speed, confirmed tonight William Perry as the new U.S. defense secretary, succeeding Les Aspin who announced his resignation last December 18. The vote of 97-0 this evening came slightly more than a week after President Clinton named Perry, the No. 2 man at the Pentagon. Shortly after the Senate vote, Perry was sworn in at the Pentagon. Perry was born in Vandergrift, Pa., on October 11, 1927. He interrupted his education to serve in the Army in 1946-1947, specializing in artillery. He graduated from Stanford with a degree in mathematics in 1949. He went on to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics from Pennsylvania State University in 1957 and taught at the school during the 1950s as a professor of engineering. Perry returned to California in 1964 to head ESL Inc., a military electronics company, which he left in 1977 to become the Pentagon's under secretary for research and development under President Carter. After Carter left office, Perry joined an investment banking firm in San Francisco and then served as chairman of Technology Strategies and Alliance, a consulting firm based in Menlo Park, California. In 1989, Perry became a director of the Center for International Security and Arms Control at Stanford, where he first worked with Russians seeking to convert from military to civilian production. He was a member of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and a member of a Technology Review Panel under the Senate Committee on Intelligence. Perry has kept a low profile on some of the social issues that have troubled the Pentagon in the past year, but when asked at his confirmation hearing about homosexuals in the military and women in combat roles, Perry said that "people ought to be allowed to do any military service they are capable of doing." Crises are still emerging despite the end of the Cold War, he said. Perry leaves Friday [4 February] for a conference in Munich on defense issues.
