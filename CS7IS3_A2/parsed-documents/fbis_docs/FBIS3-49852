On that occasion, our state delegation presented the stands established by the Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The three-hour talks last night between the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation and the delegation of the Serbian aggressor, which was headed by Slobodan Milosevic, ended without any major results. It was agreed for these talks to resume today at 1100. During the talks with the delegation of the Serbian aggressor, Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, made remarks about the map that was already discussed in the past. All attempts by our official to reach a solution for the eastern and western Bosnia, however, have hit a barrier of silence in Milosevic's camp. The only news during yesterday's meeting was Milosevic's statement that the Serbian aggressor's side agreed to Sarajevo's remaining under two-year UN administration. The basic problem in last night's talks was in the fact that the Serb aggressor's side refuses to meet our delegation's demand to give back the territories occupied by force on which Muslim Bosniaks constituted majority population before the aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina.
