The CIS is actually assuming a new quality, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated after the session. He said the ministers discussed the protection of the external borders of the CIS. According to Kozyrev, the discussion took place in a businesslike and constructive atmosphere which left Russia satisfied. In his opinion the adoption of a decision on the formation of a consultative commission for the peaceful settlement of differences within the CIS is an important step taking the Commonwealth forward. The convention on the protection of ethnic minorities was a more complicated matter, he said. "On the one hand, some countries are not sending their experts to working groups. As a result, their ministers find themselves in a difficult situation because are not in the know. On the other, this is an indication of the lack of readiness of several countries to discuss this complex and delicate matter," Kozyrev said. He said there are problems in this respect with Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. In Kozyrev's opinion, one should not attach political meaning to the fact that some countries were represented by ambassadors and other officials, instead of ministers at the Wednesday session. "After all anyone can fall ill or have important domestic matters to resolve. The absence of several ministers does not mean that they were not interested in the meeting," Kozyrev said. Only Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia were represented at the meeting by foreign ministers. Ukraine was represented by its ambassador in Moscow Vladimir Krzhanitskiy, Belarus by Deputy Foreign Minister Petr Belyayev, Kyrgyzstan by the Acting Foreign Minister Alibek Jekshenkulov, Armenia by Deputy Foreign Minister Armen Kirakosian, Moldova by Deputy Foreign Minister Ion Cebuk, Turkmenistan by Vice Premier Boris Shikhmuradov, Uzbekistan by the ambassador in Russia Yusuf Abdullayev. The meeting was also attended by Executive CIS Secretary Ivan Korotchenya and the Chief of Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation Colonel-General Victor Samsonov. After the session the foreign ministers were joined by the defence ministers of the CIS countries that signed the collective security treaty. They are expected to make a joint statement after the meeting.
