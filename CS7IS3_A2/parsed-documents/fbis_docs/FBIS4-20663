At this venue, Director General Eda said in his greeting that nuclear power played an important role within the country's energy policy, indicated the government's intention to maintain its policy on this matter, and sought the cooperation of the power company executives. Furthermore, regarding fuel recycling, along with emphasizing that he would like to maintain the policies passed down to him, he said that, with regard to making information public, while there are many difficult problems, including the protection of nuclear substances and proprietary rights, "we would like to release as much information to the public as possible, from the standpoint that the information possessed by the administration is the public's information." In response to this, Kohei Abe, chairman of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, stated that he felt strongly that the current administration was promoting a policy consistent with previous policy on nuclear power, and declared again the Federation's position to actively work for the promotion of the utilization of plutonium for electric power. Particularly, regarding plutonium which had returned from abroad, he said, "We plan to process MOX fuel abroad and transport it from overseas. We would like to make use of the transport experience that we obtained through the Akatsuki-maru'." Furthermore, the chairman indicated that, for progress in the development of nuclear power, it was extremely important to secure a new site [for a reactor]. He emphasized that, regarding the site problem, "We would like to grapple with this problem in the future with all of our might, while at the same time obtaining the understanding and cooperation of the people."
