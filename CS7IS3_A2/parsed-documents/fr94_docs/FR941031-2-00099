FR941031-2-00099 FR941031-2-00070 Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations; Amendment to the Charter AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, Labor. ACTION: Amendment to the Charter. Notice is hereby given that after consultation with the General Services Administration, it has been determined that the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations, whose charter will expire on November 23, 1994, is hereby extended for a duration of six months (May 23, 1995). This action is necessary and in the public interest. The Commission will report to both the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Commerce. The Commission is charged to address the following questions: (1) What (if any) new methods or institutions should be encouraged or required, to enhance productivity through labor-management cooperation and employee participation? (2) What (if any) changes should be made in the present legal framework and practice of collective bargaining to enhance cooperative behavior, improve productivity, and reduce conflict and delay? and (3) What (if anything) should be done to increase the extent to which workplace problems are directly resolved by the parties themselves, rather than through recourse to state and federal courts and regulatory bodies? The Commission will submit to the Secretaries a final report including recommendations based on its Fact Finding Report, submitted in May 1994, and subsequent hearings and related activities. After the final report has been completed time will be needed for consultation and appropriate follow-up with full respect for the timely conclusion of the work of the Commission. The Commission consists of approximately ten individuals drawn from the academic community, workers, management and the general public. The Commission functions solely as an advisory body and in compliance with the terms of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Its charter is being extended at this time in accordance with approval by the General Services Administration pursuant to 41 CFR 101&hyph;6.2015 (a)(2). Signed at Washington, D.C. this 26th day of October, 1994. Dated: October 26, 1994. Robert B. Reich, Secretary of Labor. Dated: October 26, 1994. Ronald H. Brown, Secretary of Commerce.
