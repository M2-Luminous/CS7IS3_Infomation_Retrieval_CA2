The former FDSN fighter's noms de guerre are: Alexis, Campeon, William, Osmar, Cain, Efrain, Luis, Venado, Conejo, Danto, and Tigre. In the communique, the commanders address Francisco Valdivia Chavarria, known as Commander Dimas: "Mr. Francisco Valdivia Chavarria (Dimas) and staff: Prepare yourselves. Do you people think you will be allowed to keep the haciendas and vehicles you were given? No, gentlemen. Time is up. No one will stay behind. All of the 5,000 FDSN demobilized will fight for our own interests, land, and homes." The commanders remind Dimas of his pledge to take up arms again if the agreements fail to be complied with, and they urge him to join them in the mountains, making it clear to him neither he nor the government will cheat them. The commanders blame Violeta's government, saying: "The government will be held responsible for any rebellion in the country's north, because the government made a pledge and failed." The commanders describe themselves as "men of peace" but warn they will not tolerate deception. Finally, they set a two-week deadline for the government to show signs of willingness to make good on its word.
