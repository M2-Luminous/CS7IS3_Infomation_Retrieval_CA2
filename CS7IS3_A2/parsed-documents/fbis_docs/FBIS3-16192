The Armenian Defense Ministry press service just reported that the relative calm was still prevailing at 1600. The relative calm established over the last few days is still being maintained on most of the Karabakh war fronts. However, Karabakh's positions are still coming under fire in a number of sectors. But no casualties are being reported. Thus, Karabakh forces' positions north of Martuninskiy came under shelling from various guns this morning. The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army headquarters said that there was no retaliatory fire. A concentration of Azerbaijani troops and equipment is being observed along most of the war front, in particular on the eastern and southeastern sectors.
