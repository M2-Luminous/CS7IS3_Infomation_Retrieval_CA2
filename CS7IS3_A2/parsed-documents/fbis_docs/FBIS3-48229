The proposals involve the economic development of northern Sumatera, northern Malaysia and southern Thailand, as well as intensifying private/public-sector cooperation. The council's meeting was in five workshops where delegates discussed opportunities for business collaboration, as well as issues requiring government attention to help the movement of goods, services, labour and capital into the three development sub-regions. The five workshops were as follows: 1. Agriculture; 2. Infrastructure 3. Tourism 4. Trade, Industry and Investment; and 5. Human Resource Development. Government Help The meeting identified the following issues and constraints relating to government administrative procedures and policies that could affect the efficient conduct of business and required immediate attention. Trade, Industry and Investment -- The current practice of 6 A.M.-6 P.M. opening hours of the Malaysia-Thailand border crossing could be restrictive. To help trade between northern peninsular Malaysia and southern Thailand, it was proposed that the opening hours of the border crossing should be extended to 24. -- Currently, there are only two open customs checkpoints between Malaysia and Thailand. To help free flow of trade between the two countries, it was proposed that all border points be opened. In addition, it was proposed that a single joint customs checkpoint between Malaysia and Thailand be established in place of the existing separate checkpoints on both sides. This would reduce waiting time and customs manpower requirements. -- To enable free movement of vehicles within the IMT-GT region, it was proposed that a co-vehicle insurance policy scheme be initiated. -- In the context of setting up new businesses under the IMT-GT collaborations and joint ventures, bureaucratic approval procedures could pose a serious constraints to the business sector. In this regard, it is proposed that these procedures, such as licensing and rules, be simplified and streamlined and that a one-stop agency be set up to serve as the reference point and central approving body to facilitate the business community in the IMT-GT. -- Differences in equity conditions and investment incentives between the three countries need to be reviewed to make the Growth Triangle more attractive to local and foreign investors. It was, therefore, proposed that a special task force be formed among the three private sectors of the IMT-GT to examine these existing conditions. The meeting hoped that the ministerial meeting would endorse the formation of this task force and that the relevant government agencies of the respective countries would extend the necessary cooperation and assistance to the task force, and ultimately give weight and consideration to the task force recommendations. Agriculture -- Currently, the Malaysian Government requires the use of only Malaysian-made plastic crates for transporting marine products. It was proposed to allow the utilisation of plastic crates made by other countries. It was also proposed that Malaysia should reduce the service charge of five cents to one cent per kg to help trade in marine products. -- The meeting proposed greater liberalisation of rubber trade within the region by eliminating current artificial restrictions. Infrastructure -- The meeting proposed the immediate reduction of international telephone charges within the IMT-GT region to promote investment, trade and tourism, as well as foster closer relationships between the three countries. Proposed Projects To Be Implemented under the IMT-GT Project For immediate action: -- Request for assistance from the governments of each of the three countries to organise joint tourism promotion. -- The use of Malaysia-Indonesia-Thailand Tourism Association (MITTA) as a channel for complaints and help tourists and tourism information in the region. -- Developing and marketing of industrial estates and southern Thailand to promote collaboration between the private sectors of Malaysia and Thailand. -- Promotion of manufacturing of wooden furniture, especially from rubber wood and rattan, by the three countries. -- Looking at the possibility of establishing an IMT skills development centre. -- Develop joint fishing in the three countries. -- Looking for the possibility of establishing fruit and vegetable common market in border areas. -- Liberalise rubber trading within the region. -- The development of a regional television broadcasting station, a land bridge interconnecting system, linking the west coast and east coast of the region and power generation facilities, requires from the government approval in principle and feasibility studies. These projects are to be private-sector-driven. -- Bandar Aceh-Penang-Thailand natural gas pipeline towards the development of energy resources within the IMT-GT region. -- Ban Gabang (Yala)-Sik (Kedah) road to improve land transport between the two areas. The distance could be reduced from 141 km to 60 km. -- Ban Bhuketa (Waeng, Narathiwat) Malay-Thai border bridge to improve land transport between Narathiwat and the three Malaysian states of Kedah, Perlis and Perak (East-West Highway). -- Satun-Perlis road to improve land transport. The present road link does not allow passage of heavy trucks. -- An air transport network project to accelerate multilateral aviation arrangement within the region. For long-term action: -- To look into the possibility of establishing cooperation and joint investment in electronics and electrical components. -- Satun-Penang-Medan-Bandar Aceh Sea Link to promote inter-regional trading and encourage tourism. Conclusion The Business Council wants to record its support and confidence in the IMT-GT project. It is pleased to make its small initial contribution to the attainment of IMT-GT project objectives by submitting the proceeding report of its inaugural meeting to the official meeting. The council believes that the proposals, issues and observations can lead to a more conducive environment for the pursuit of the objectives of the IMT-GT. Similarly, projects identified represent infrastructural upgrades, as well as business opportunities, for the private sector.
