The company specializes in setting up research and production centres for ceramics manufacturing. The new office is expected to position the firm for further expansion or a joint venture in the country, where it already has established a strong market presence. SITI production lines already account for 30 per cent of the equipment used by ceramics plants in the affluent Pearl River Delta region of South China's Guangdong Province, where the building materials industry is flourishing. "Setting up our Guangzhou office represents another significant milestone for SITI in China " said Klaus G. Fugmann, commercial director of SITI China Ltd. Last year, about half of SITI's business turnover was generated from China's huge market. Its sales volume in China reached about $100 million in 1993. "The new office will cope with the ever-growing business volume coming from Mainland China," said Fugmann. The international company provides manufacturing and research support in all fields of the ceramics industry, including wall and floor tiles, sanitary wares, pottery and mosaics. "Our equipment still does not meet the demand of the Chinese market. As the quality of housing and buildings in China is increasing, the industry has a promising future in the country," said Fugmann. Although the sales of the company's production lines to China decreased since last June when the central government tightened its grip on credit, he said, he is confident about a good future in the country.
