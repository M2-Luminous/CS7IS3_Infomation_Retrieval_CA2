FR941012-2-00102 FR941012-2-00071 Commonwealth Edison Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Proposed no Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;37, NPF&hyph;66, NPF&hyph;72, and NPF&hyph;77, issued to Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd, the licensee), for operation of the Byron Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Ogle County, Illinois and Braidwood Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Will County, Illinois. In a letter of August 13, 1993, and as supplemented on September 15, 1993, September 16, 1993, December 17, 1993, January 19, 1994, February 11, 1994, and February 24, 1994, ComEd submitted requests for amendments for steam generator (SG) tube sleeving in accordance with (1) Westinghouse and (2) Babcock & Wilcox processes. By letter dated March 4, 1994, the NRC granted the proposed sleeving methods contingent upon four conditions which the licensee accepted in their letter of February 24, 1994. Three of the four changes will be reflected in the plants' Technical Specifications (TS). By letter dated June 3, 1994, the licensee requested changes to TS 3.4.5 and 3.4.6.2 to include the three conditions, which are: 1. Amend the Byron and Braidwood licenses to reflect a primary-to-secondary leakage rate limit of 150 gallons per day (gpd) through any one SG. 2. Amend the Byron and Braidwood licenses to reflect an inservice inspection of a minimum of 20 percent of a random sample of the sleeves for axial and circumferential indication at the end-of-cycle. In the event that an imperfection of 40 percent or greater depth is detected, an additional 20 percent (minimum) of the unsampled sleeves should be inspected, and if an imperfection of 40 percent or greater depth is detected in the second sample, all remaining sleeves should be inspected. 3. Add a condition to the Byron and Braidwood licenses to conduct additional corrosion testing to establish the design life for the kinetically or laser welded sleeved tubes in the presence of a crevice. Collectively, these conditions will enable the licensee to have: 1. Further assurance that the integrity of the SGs will be maintained in the event of a main steam line break or under loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) conditions; 2. Increased monitoring of the SG tube sleeves for any degradation; and 3. Increased confidence that SG sleeve integrity will be maintained for extended operations. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The original amendment requested [approval] of tubesheet sleeves and tube support plate sleeves as an alternate tube repair method for Byron and Braidwood Units 1 and 2. The steam generator sleeves approved for installation use the Westinghouse process (laser welded joints) and the Babcock and Wilcox (B&W) process of kinetically welded joints. The sleeve configuration was designed and analyzed in accordance with the criteria of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.121 and the design requirements of Section III of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code. Fatigue and stress analyses of the sleeved tube assemblies for both processes produced acceptable results as documented in the Westinghouse and the B&W topical reports submitted in the original sleeving package. Mechanical testing has shown that the structural strength of the sleeves under normal, faulted, and upset conditions is within acceptable limits. Leakage rate testing for the tube sleeves has demonstrated that primary-to-secondary leakage is not expected during all plant conditions. Any leakage through the sleeved region of the tube is fully bounded by the leak-before-break considerations and, ultimately, the existing steam generator tube rupture analysis included in the Byron and Braidwood Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The reduction in TS leakage rate requirements from 500 gpd allowable per SG to 150 gpd further ensures that SG tube integrity is maintained in the event of a main steam line break (MSLB) or under Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA) conditions. The RG 1.121 criteria for establishing operational leakage rate limits require a plant shutdown based upon a leak-before-break consideration to detect a free span crack before a potential tube rupture. The 150 gpd limit will continue to allow for early leakage detection and require a plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected crack resulting in leakage that exceeds the revised Technical Specification limit.
