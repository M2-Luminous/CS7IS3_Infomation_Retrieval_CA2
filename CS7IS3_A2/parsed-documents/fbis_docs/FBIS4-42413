In an interview, he expressed confidence in the determination of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's embattled government to tackle corruption. But he warned that if it failed to take effective action "we will have to withdraw our support." Mr Pujol is the guarantor of the government's survival as Mr Gonzalez tries to overcome a serious crisis brought about by a succession of corruption scandals involving members of his administration, including a former central bank governor and a former head of the Civil Guard. Mr Pujol, who is president of Catalonia's regional government and of the Catalan nationalist party, Convergencea i Unio, took a calculated gamble last week by reaffirming his backing for Mr Gonzalez in the midst of the political crisis. As long as his party's 17 deputies vote with the socialists, Mr Gonzalez is assured of a narrow majority in the 350-member parliament. Mr Gonzalez also received a pledge of support from the Basque Nationalist party, which is similarly conservative in its economic views and has five seats. Mr Pujol set out four priorities: - Further measures to support industry and exports, through tax policies. This would include backing for research and development and special assistance for small- and medium-sized companies; - Labour deregulation. Mr Pujol left open the question of whether additional measures would be needed after the government's current package of labour reforms, due to be implemented shortly. "We have to see how it works in practice," he said. - Transfers to Catalonia. Mr Pujol said he did not want to renegotiate the agreement reached last year under which 15 per cent of the income tax normally raised by the central government in Catalonia is remitted directly to the Catalan regional government. But he had specific demands on arrangements for financing the region's health system and the building-up of its own police force. - Stemming corruption. Mr Pujol said he had demanded that the government "do everything to control corruption" and added: "I think it is doing it." He made clear that, despite his renewed support for the government, he would not consider joining a coalition. Mr Gonzalez said last week that a coalition -- such as he tried to form after last year's general election -- would provide more stability than a parliamentary pact. However, Mr Pujol said that being part of the government would leave his party with "no capacity for manoeuvre." "The truth is that we can be more useful outside the government than inside it," he said. He would not set any time-frame for his alliance with the socialists. The two parties will confront each other in municipal elections next spring and in elections for the Catalan regional government in 1996. "In two years we do not know what will happen," Mr Pujol said. Mr Gonzalez has, meanwhile, secured backing from his party to place one of his moderate allies, Mr Joaquin Almunia, as its new parliamentary leader, replacing the former economy minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga who resigned last week. Mr Almunia was labour and civil service minister in previous Socialist governments.
