The feelings of the millions of Russians who defended democracy in August 1991 and in October 1993 have been trampled on. In initiating the adoption of this decision the Communists and supporters of Zhirinovskiy displayed a total unity of aims of getting into power by a destabilization of the situation. This is said in a statement issued by Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary. There is no doubt that this decision will harm cooperation between the branches of power and the very idea of law and order because it elevates a resolution of the issue of the guilt of those involved in both coups from the legal to the political sphere. This decision is of a purely political nature -- it was adopted hastily, without taking the account of public opinion and without a preliminary research into the legal foundations for adopting and implementing such serious decisions. At the time when the Russian president is taking decisive steps to reaffirm Russia's prestige and dignity in the world, the State Duma is making decisions which will lead to destabilization, and consequently, to the weakening of Russia. This path is dangerous and it goes against national interests. All the responsibility for the consequences of the adopted decision lies with the State Duma, and with those who initiated and carried out this action, the statement of the Russian president's press secretary says.
