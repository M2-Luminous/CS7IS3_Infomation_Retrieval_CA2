FR940317-1-00198 FR940317-1-00017 On three previous occasions, the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 that would have required disclosure of mark-ups for riskless principal trades involving debt securities, including municipal securities. 14 Commentators argued against adoption of mark-up disclosure for riskless principal debt trades saying that: (1) The amount of a mark-up was not material to investors; (2) adoption of the proposal would have a detrimental, disproportionate effect on small broker-dealers; and (3) the amendment would present compliance and enforcement difficulties because of differences between the debt and equity markets. 15 The Commission withdrew the proposal in 1982, 16 and subsequently adopted amendments requiring that confirmations contain disclosures concerning the yield of debt securities. 17 14 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 15220 (Oct. 6, 1978), 43 FR 47538 (proposing mark-up disclosure for riskless principal trades in municipal securities) (``1978 Release''); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13661 (June 23, 1977), 42 FR 33348 (proposing mark-up disclosure by non-market makers in riskless principal transactions involving equity and debt securities, but not municipal securities); and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12806 (Sept. 16, 1976), 41 FR 41432 (proposing mark-up disclosure by non-market makers in riskless principal transactions involving equity and debt securities). 15 One commentator noted that determining whether a particular firm was a market maker in the debt context was difficult because the market maker definition contemplates an equity environment and does not account for the differences in the debt environment. See Letter from Sullivan & Cromwell, to George A. Fitzsimmons, Secretary, SEC, dated January 15, 1979. 16 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 18987 (Aug. 20, 1982), 47 FR 37919. 17 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 18988 (Aug. 20, 1982), 47 FR 37920, adopted in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19687 (Apr. 18, 1983), 48 FR 17583. In light of the increasing size of the debt market, 18 together with experience with mark-up disclosure in riskless principal trades for equities, the Commission believes that mark-up disclosure for riskless principal trades in debt securities should be revisited. 19 Confirmation disclosure of mark-ups in riskless principal transactions will aid investors by disclosing to them transaction costs. This will assist the client in monitoring brokerage expenses and detecting possible improper practices. For instance, the Commission understands that mark-ups charged in riskless principal trades in long-term securities are substantially greater than mark-ups charged in short-term securities, because the impact on disclosed yield is smaller in the long term trade. The Commission believes that customers should be given the ability to compare mark-ups in these trades. 18 The amount of outstanding debt in the U.S. is approximately $1.9 trillion in corporate debt, of which $298 billion is held by individual investors (households and mutual funds) in corporate and foreign debt securities ( See Flow of Fund Accounts, First Quarter, 1993), $4.9 trillion in U.S. government securities, and $1.2 trillion in municipal bonds. Securities Industry Fact Book, Securities Industry Association (1993), at 21. The municipal securities market comprises approximately 50,000 state and local issuers with an outstanding principal amount of securities in excess of $1.2 trillion. See SEC Report on the Municipal Securities Market (Sept. 1993), at 1. There are approximately 1.3 million classes of municipal securities spread across 150,000 different issuances. Public Securities Association. 19 Mark-up disclosure requirements are applicable at present to trades in debt securities convertible into equity securities. Section 3(a)(11), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(11), and Rule 3a11&hyph;1 of the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.3a11&hyph;1, define equity security to include any security convertible into an equity security. Debt security is defined to include a convertible security for purposes of certain paragraphs of Rule 10b&hyph;10, but not for purposes of mark-up disclosure in riskless principal trades.
