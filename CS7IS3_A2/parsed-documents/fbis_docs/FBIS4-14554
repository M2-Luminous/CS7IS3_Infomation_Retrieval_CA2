Among the journalists attending was our commentator Yuriy Simenov, who is now with us in the studio. What have you to tell us, Yuriy Aleksandrovich? [Simenov] [Passage omitted] We journalists were told that the president's work schedule for April was packed solid, which says much about his capacity for work, but the essence of this apparently is that April will be a kind of example of a tactical change in the political climate in Russia. [Announcer] What does that mean? [Simenov] In the main this means that the president and his administration will head toward cooperation with all constructive political forces -- including those of the opposition -- with all parties and parliamentary factions and the leaders of the chambers. Among other things, the latest meeting between the president and the speaker of the State Duma has taken place. Among other things, the president presented him with the draft agreement on civic peace and accord -- that very document being talked about so much today. [Announcer] As you know, an alternative draft agreement on civic peace and accord signed by our opposition figures has been published in the press. Lapshin, Glazev... [Simenov, interrupting] Questions were also put about this, too. They said that the opposition is effectively outstripping the situation, officially. You know, in so far as the degree of responsibility which the opposition bears is a lot less, the attitude was quietly negative, so to speak. At any rate, that draft, which was prepared by a large group of experts and representatives of various parties and political sections will clearly be at the base of public discussion. That draft document is about seven and a half pages long. It is being handed around now for all the main political forces and figures to familiarize themselves with it and, on the whole, it is already open for discussion. It is no secret that it may be published in the press in the next few days. As for signing it, if we take into account possible amendments, it is possible that this will be somewhere like the end of April. The draft document is aimed at being in operation for about two years -- until the next presidential elections, it seems. As to the monitoring of its implementation, there are plans to found a conciliation commission for the period. [Announcer] Who will be in the conciliation commission? [Simenov] The representatives who sign it. At the first stage, representatives of roughly 25 parties, factions, and all the political forces and others. [Announcer] And that quite obviously includes the hardline opposition? [Simenov] Whoever wants to sign it. It is an open document. Specialists on international law know what that means. Now for the second important point -- presidential elections. In the opinion of the press secretary, a number of newspapers have been in a hurry to forecast that Boris Yeltsin will decline to take part in the coming presidentials. Well, we were told that time and the course of events will show that they should not be in a hurry. If the opinion of society and the voters will be inclined toward the president putting his candidature forward again, then the possibility cannot be ruled out. It will be determined by his duty and responsibility to the voters. As to other candidates -- Rutskoy and Zhirinovskiy were asked about, among others... [pauses] there was a very sharp reaction on the part of the press secreatry. I wiil quote him without any commentary: He said that Russia deserved better than to have people voting for political hooligans and foul-mouths. That is how he put it. Tough talk. The next point is that I asked Vyacheslav Kostikov on the Russian president's attitude to Nazarbayev's proposal regarding the creation of a new Eurasian Union. The answer given was rather surprising. Yes, it had been talked about. This was confirmed, but Boris Yeltsin is for the time being showing a restrained interest in this. He will study it, taking into account the opinions of other CIS leaders. This will certainly be discussed on 15 April at the summit in Moscow. He is against hasty decisions in this matter. Perhaps the idea of a new Union and the idea at the basis of the CIS may be combined at some stage. The next important point is about the passions raging about the recent decision by the government on customs duties. The opinion of the president, as heard from the lips of his press secretary, is that in principle the pluses from taxing certain goods being imported into Russia were well balanced, but the possible minuses were badly thought out. We know about the minuses and about the views of the mayors of the big cities. This roughly means that the policy of some sort of balanced, moderate protectionism in relation to Russian entrepreneurs and industry will continue. The idea is correct, but specific measures will, clearly, be corrected. However, there is no friction whatsoever on this issue between the presidential administration and the government. Everything is being sorted out quietly. [passage omitted]
