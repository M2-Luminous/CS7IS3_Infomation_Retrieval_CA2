I. Birshteyn, by I. Koretskiy; place and date not given: "Boris Birshteyn: I Am an Absolutely Independent Person"] [Text] The name Boris Iosifovich Birshteyn is well known on one-sixth of the land mass. He is praised and cursed, presidents and journalists want to meet him, and everything from cock and bull stories to the unmitigated truth are told about the affairs of The Seabeco Group. Seabeco is not being ignored in our republic either. The firm is quite often spoken and written about mostly in a poor light. Essentially that involves a rehash of Russian events which have already set our teeth on edge. Having obtained an exclusive interview with Birshteyn, we were interested not in rumors and gossip swirling around this outstanding individual, but most of all in the personality of the creator of Seabeco, so to speak, in its undiluted form: his views of life, business, and contemporary Moldova. That was what our conversation with B. I. Birshteyn, who has visited our country more than once, was about. [Koretskiy] Welcome to Moldova Mister Birshteyn. These days the republic is leading an intensive political existence--elections and the sociological poll. Is your visit associated with these events? [Birshteyn] Absolutely not. This is a routine business trip connected with the practical realization of one of our projects involving investment in agriculture of Moldova. It is still too early to mention it to the press, I will merely say that the amount of investment involved is quite respectable even by western standards. I do not get involved in politics and it is not my habit to exert influence or, God forbid, alter anything in the political life of this country in which I am investing my capital. But if you are interested in my own personal viewpoint concerning recent events, then, naturally, for me as a businessman and for my western colleagues it is more advantageous to deal with an independent, sovereign state rather than with someone's province. [Koretskiy] Boris Iosifovich, this is your first interview with the republic press, therefore please acquaint our readers with what is called The Seabeco Group. The Russian as well as our own press, unfortunately, contains highly confusing and contradictory depictions. This is evidenced by the telephone calls and letters coming in to the editorial office. [Birshteyn] H'm! I have not been asked that question for a long time. It is considered that everything is known about Seabeco. Well, Seabeco is a group of private companies of different profiles which I own. Our sphere of activity includes trade, particularly trade in fertilizes and metals. It is a financial business and includes industrial projects. We are also engaged in the service sphere as evidenced by this hotel in Chisinau where we are having our conversation. [Editor] Boris Birshteyn was born in Lithuania in 1947 and is a graduate of Vilnius University. He reached the pinnacle of his career in the USSR as director of a textile plant. In 1979 he emigrated to Israel together with his wife, then moved to Canada. A year later he founded his "The Seabeco Group." To form that name he used the first names of his children--Semen and Alona Birshteyn. At present the Birshteyn family resides in Zurich, Switzerland. [Koretskiy] What links do you have with Moldova? [Birshteyn] A small human weakness which is called love for this remarkable nation and its hard-working people. Coming here many years ago I was charmed with Moldova and still feel that way to this day. Because of which I am attempting to make and do make my most serious investments in Moldova. [Editor] Boris Birshteyn made the first major investment of his capital in Moldova in 1990 deciding to remodel the old Oktyabrskaya Hotel into a four-star western style hotel. That was requested by the then leadership of the republic which became mired in debt reconstructing its prestigious hotel. These debts owed Vneshekonombank of the USSR subsequently transferred to the government of sovereign Moldova and when the question concerning their repayment became a pressing one, businessman Birshteyn proposed an original move as a result of which dollars from the repayment of the foreign currency credit debt in the amount of over three million dollars went into the budget of the republic. In that manner Seabeco is providing the government with interest-free credit. Our Moldovan leu was printed in Paris and modern communications, defense, and special equipment for the Ministry of Internal Affairs were paid for specifically by money from the firm. The Orgeyev Cannery is undergoing reconstruction and a zone of farms with a complete service complex is being created in Faleshtskiy Rayon on the basis of Seabeco designs and at its expense. The firm provides assistance through sponsorship of projects in the sphere of public health and culture as well as aid for those with low incomes and for victims of combat operations. Last year some 50,000 leus, over 2,000 dollars, and more than 4,000 FRG marks were allocated for that purpose. [Koretskiy] Mister Birshteyn, without revealing any trade secrets pertaining to your future projects, let us talk about where your investments will be going. [Birshteyn] I am proceeding from the fact that Moldova is basically an agrarian republic and, naturally, I intend investing capital in agriculture and, in particular, in the processing industry. Then, taking into account the geographical position of Moldova, its climate, and the existence of a diaspora both in the far and the near abroad, I believe that it is necessary to develop a tourism industry. [Koretskiy] Allow me to disagree with your viewpoint concerning the agricultural profile of Moldova and remind you of the first-class potential of the republic in the machine building and electronic industry. Unfortunately these capacities are now idle and the industry is in a decline. On the basis of your experience could you suggest a way out of this dead-end situation? [Birshteyn] I am not an electronics expert but I am quite familiar with the experience of Far Eastern countries which created such a powerful market in that branch. Therefore today it is extremely difficult to meet the demands of modern electronics, that is, to win the market. But not hopeless. How? Through the production of unique units and blocs calling for the efforts of highly skilled personnel. In the East as well as in the West everything is based on high-precision automatic equipment, flow lines. Moldova, however, would be able to interest producers with its highly skilled workers whose labor is relatively cheap. Here it is necessary to look for partners. I brought up that question with Muravskiy's government. [Koretskiy] Did you bring it up as a member of the Higher Economic Council of the President of the Republic of Moldova? [Birshteyn] Yes. Unfortunately, however, nothing happened. [Koretskiy] Tell me, Mr. Birshteyn, as chairman of the Higher Economic Council do you see a way out of the crisis in which Moldova has found itself? [Birshteyn] I would like you to take into account that this crisis has engulfed all countries of the so-called socialist camp and it is quite natural. Therefore there is no need to dramatize the situation. I personally believe that Moldova will get on its feet before other CIS countries providing there is a stable political situation, because of its geopolitical position, economic base, and the industriousness of the people. These are the powerful internal reserves which have not been mobilized until now. But help and investments are needed in any undertaking. That is the first factor which must come into play. Several days ago I helped to organize a meeting of a large group of western businessmen with the president of Moldova. The discussion concerned investments, big investment projects which open up extensive prospects. A frank business dialogue took place in the course of which the head of the republic expressed doubt in the current course toward acquisition of credits to the detriment of investments. If the policy of the government in that area should change, consider it to be my small contribution as chairman of the presidential council. After all the investor brings not only money into this country but also, what is most important, his expertise and knowledge, the ability to organize the undertaking so that it profits the investor and the country, and this means the people as well. In addition to that it allows entry into western sales markets which in turn means the reverse flow of foreign currency. Is that not advantageous for the country? Very many pilot projects were proposed at that meeting which will undoubtedly be followed by others. It is a good sign when major western firms manifest interest in investing in Moldova. [Koretskiy] Mr. Birshteyn, again, based on your experience of cooperation with Moldova what obstacles do you visualize in the way of these vivifying investments? [Birshteyn] I believe that the answer is clear to anyone with even a minimal involvement in business. Conditions for the development of business are needed. A legislative base is required which clearly differentiates the rights and duties of the businessman. The domestic and foreign businessman. In order to avoid groundless accusations of nation pilfering. How can I be pilfering the nation when I am investing my capital in it and building? After all Birshteyn, for instance, cannot take this hotel or plant, or a processing line with him to Canada. It was and will remain the property of this country. My task is that of any investor which is to ensure that the property is viable, earns profits and provides employment for people. We also touched on another one of these obstacles--the tax policy. When taxes exceed a reasonable limit they discourage any interest among investors to inject their capital into this country. It is possible to understand the young state which is attempting to satisfy its needs through the tax system. But not at any price. "At any price" is not always the correct policy. Life is already suggesting to the politicians where they made an incorrect step in that sphere and everything, one must think, will return to a normal, civilized path. After all they were able to establish some benefits for agriculture and the processing industry. That means not everything is lost. [Koretskiy] Let us return to the search of ways to resolve the economic crisis. For some of our politicians the creation of free economic zones appears as a panacea against all economic ills. What do you think about that idea? [Birshteyn] I will not hide the fact that it appeals to me and I was one of those who voiced this repeatedly. Except that it was not about the economic zone but about the offshore business zone. Similar to Liechtenstein and Monaco. It means that for local and foreign capital special preferential conditions are created for development. These conditions, which are covered in international law, allow the state to develop necessary branches to its advantage and receive profits for the servicing of investments, while building and growing richer, without investing its own funds. [Koretskiy] Boris Iosifovich, you stated that you are making your main investments in agriculture of Moldova. Great transformations are now taking place in the countryside. The reform is destroying kolkhozes and allows joint-stock companies to develop, along with peasant farms, and farmers. In your business dealings who do you prefer working with--kolkhozes or individual farms? [Birshteyn] This question, I see, is a loaded one. I will answer frankly--I prefer to work with the state. Always. All those projects which I mentioned will be carried out together with the government on an equal footing. The government will get its share and our firm will get its share. All this will take place on a contractual basis and the results can be checked through documents at any time. [Koretskiy] Excuse me, but here is another "loaded" question. You worked on the basis of the same principle, i.e. directly both in Russia and Kyrgyzstan, which is what gave rise to accusations against the Seabeco Firm. [Birshteyn] These accusations, however, burst like a soap bubble once documents and facts were presented. Also I find it difficult to understand how it is possible to level groundless accusations from a high tribune without troubling to acquire information from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. After all every figure is reflected in it. Since these documents made their appearance my stern critics fell silent. For those reasons I released an official statement that I am terminating my activity in Russia and Kyrgyzia. [Koretskiy] Here, in Moldova, criticism was also leveled against Seabeco regarding accuracy of information. [Birshteyn] You know, I pay no attention to that ballyhoo either here or over there. There is no time. The accusations themselves are so confused and stereotyped that one begins to wonder. Is it not absurd to say that Birshteyn, using his private aircraft (Ha-Ha) brought over nuclear waste in order to bury it in Krikov mines or somewhere in Siberia. Someone wants to put the blame for all the troubles on Seabeco or on any foreigner in order to appear patriotic. Time usually provides the best evaluation of such phenomena. Even the "great sinner" Rutskoy is now free and criminal proceedings were initiated against his "righteous" accusers. [Editor] NEZAVISIMAYA MOLDOVA has a packet of documents and official papers compiled by various monitoring organizations of the republic at different times. They provide a most thorough analysis of all activities of the Seabeco-Moldova firm, citing figures and balances and reflecting the legislative base underlying operation of the firm as well as audits of the mutual settlement of accounts with the co-founder. The only violation that the auditors were able to reveal was a delay in deduction of funds into the Social Fund of the republic, for which a fine was levied in the amount of 17,392 Moldovan rubles. [Koretskiy] By the way, about Rutskoy. Your well-known flight from Moscow to Chisinau on your personal aircraft was viewed in the republic in a highly varied manner. Could you shed more light on this unusual visit now, sometime after the fact? [Birshteyn] As commonly known there was a war going on at that time and it is the most loathsome thing I have ever known in my life. My soul rebelled against blood being spilled on the land I love, against the suffering and grief of the refugees and the overall depression in society. I was informed that the figure of Rutskoy was the spark that ignited that war. His presence in Tiraspol was viewed as approval of their course, as a carte blanche. Knowing him personally I considered it my moral duty to ask Rutskoy to come here and help resolve the conflict. To my great delight I succeeded. [Koretskiy] Mr. Birshteyn, your faith in male friendship is impressive. You have never renounced your friends who worked in the CPSU Central Committee after this seemingly invincible party disintegrated. You did not disavow Rutskoy either when he was put in jail or any of the others who found themselves in disfavor. What is that--a pose, self-confidence, a character trait? [Birshteyn] In Moldova, inasmuch as I know, that is called "Cei sapte ani de acasa" (seven years of home upbringing). I was raised in a cultured family where the concept of friendship, keeping one's word, and decency were placed above all. My attitude toward a person whether he is a minister, the president, or a driver never comes from the desire for personal gain. Many of my friends, as they say, had their ups and downs, but that did not alter my attitude toward them because am an absolutely independent person and treat my attachments as I deem necessary, without caring for the opinion of others or proceeding from the political situation. I value true friendship and know how to prize it. [Koretskiy] Without beating around the bush, tell me how compatible are the concepts of morality and business. [Birshteyn] I know that education using the classics of Marxism-Leninism as an example, has imbued people with a certain stereotypical way thinking in this regard. I would like to note that in the business world, real business, decency and keeping one's word are valued above all else. That kind of reputation is highly valued. In my business dealings I have always tried to take the honest path, engage in good business, and attain a certain level so that my firm logo would be associated in people's minds with good quality work. A few days ago I met a gentleman who thanked me for the high quality of my sports outfits. But, good heavens, I was in sports outfits some ten years ago. This means that the buyer remembered and appreciated it. This is very important and dear to me. To earn money just for the sake of money is a boring undertaking. I have always wanted for my capital to bring good to people. That is why I have built and will continue to build, I am initiating new projects that will remain after I am gone. That, after all, is also morality. The fact that such a style of work does not appeal to some and they attempt to blacken everything is also a peculiar form of morality. Fortunately time puts everything in its place. Passions will calm and they will be forgotten, while this hotel and much else will remain and serve the people and Moldova. [Editor] Boris Birshteyn does not like being over-cautious. He is not prone to sentimentality and reflection which are so peculiar to the intelligentsia, or apprehension which is characteristic of entrepreneurs of Soviet origin. His trusting nature is combined with a narrowly utilitarian outlook and pragmatism. Mr. Birshteyn cannot "stop and glance back" to show off before a mirror, to brag, let us say, about his wealth, and rest on his laurels. He sincerely believes himself to be a gentleman who has never harmed anyone. Birshteyn has so little time for thinking about himself that he hesitated answering questions about what color his eyes are or how many languages he speaks., Boris Birshteyn speaks Russian, German, English, Yiddish, and Ivrit and uses them all in his work. [Koretskiy] A new strata of business people is now forming in Moldova. What errors would you warn them against? [Birshteyn] Against "grab and rest." That is unpromising. It is important to think and act in a broader fashion. Here I see one of my own omissions which I am hoping to rectify. The thing is that Moldova has no good schools for business training. I managed to establish something like that in Kyrgyzia. It is staffed by highly qualified foreign professors who teach the ABC's of modern business life. Graduates receive not only an international class diploma, but also good knowledge which helps them start their own businesses. I hope that such a business school will appear in Moldova as well. [Editor] We, however, are hoping that not just a business school as such will make its appearance in Moldova, but a school of Moldovan business in the broadest sense of the word, i.e. our own class of business people who will build business on the basis of principles propounded by B. I. Birshteyn.
