The discovery was made by two Huancayo provincial prosecutors accompanied by a detachment of policemen and soldiers. The prosecutors conducted the search at the request of congressman Roger Caceres Velasquez, president of the Democratic Constituent Congress Human Rights Committee, who received a report on the massacre from relatives of the missing persons. The officials made the morbid find at the Paccha annex, in the heights of El Tambo District, Huancayo Province, some 75 km west of the city of Huancayo. The massacre allegedly was carried out by more than 100 peasant patrol members from the Suitucancha and Rangra annexes using the breech-loading shotguns supplied by President Alberto Fujimori a few years ago to defend their communities from terrorist attacks. The victims were Paccha annex inhabitants with whom the alleged killers had constant disputes over the ownership of grasslands and agricultural lots located between the two communities, which allegedly was the cause of the crime. According to the testimony of the missing peasants' relatives, Suitucancha and Rangra peasant patrols on the night of 27 February 1992 launched a surprise attack against Paccha peasants, shooting and killing 10 of them. The killers then threw the bodies of the dead peasants inside an abandoned mine located high up a hill in the Paccha area. On 25 August 1993, a commission named by the Attorney General's Office guarded by a group of military and police agents, heeding a complaint by relatives of the dead peasants, went to the mine to verify the existence of the remains, but they were attacked by a mob of 150 Suitucancha peasant patrol members. Commission members, however, were able to enter the mine and locate three graves containing the remains of the murdered peasants, but they could not take anything out because the peasant patrols attacking them at the time forced them to leave empty-handed. On 4 February, Huancayo provincial prosecutors Jean Diaz Alvarado and Juan Lezama, following a request to finish the proceeding from congressman Roger Caceres Velasquez, travelled to the Paccha annex to excavate the remains of the slain peasants. The prosecutors, accompanied by 15 Huancayo Criminal Investigation Commission agents, led by PNP [Peruvian National Police] Lieutenant Daniel Berrocal, plus 15 soldiers, entered the mine. Inside the mine, the officials were surprised to find that the places where the first commission had located the three graves were covered by metric tons of rock and soil from the mine's roof, presumably loosened with dynamite by the murderers in an attempt to hide the evidence of their crime. However, thanks to a careful inspection of the mine's entrance, the officials found the remains of the bones of a total of 15 people buried there.
