Previously, only the tile industry and other large industrial users were considered targets, but since business has gotten on track, it is also expanding to home use. For the time being, Tokyo Gas will proceed experimentally in order to consolidate know-how, but it is planning to extend it to the capital of Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding area, with 50,000 homes a year as the goal in 1997 and thereafter. Tokyo Gas established Gas Malaysia in 1992 in a joint venture with Petronas, Mitsui & Co., and two local firms, and has been developing the gas business for industrial users in Kuala Lumpur, Kelang, and Johor Baharu. The Tokyo Gas investment ratio is 20 percent. The amount of gas sold in 1993 exceeded 100 million cubic meters, and the outlook has become that it will be in the black in terms of profit and loss by 1997. For this reason, it is expanding to the home market with the aim of stable expansion of business in the future. As the first shot, it will supply 100 company residences at an auto plant in Sharam, a new industrial city on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. In Malaysia, 90 percent of home fuel is liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), but it is anticipated that LNG [liquefied natural gas] will be cheaper in fuel cost and will be fully competitive. It will expand to 1,000 homes in the Sharam area by the end of 1996, and consolidate know-how on supply safety and fee collection. In 1997 and thereafter, the policy is to widen the supply area, with places where there are existing industrial users as the nucleus, and the plan is to expand to 600,000 homes by 2011. It is the first time for city gas for general home use in Malaysia, and since there is no experience related to plumbing, maintenance inspection, and gas appliances, Tokyo Gas will accept and train trainees at the rate of some tens of people a year. The general home-use city gas business is said to be generally poorer in profitability than large users. In the case of Gas Malaysia, the Malaysian Government is backing up city gas energy conversion in the nation, and it appears that profitability will be easy since the laying of conduits and piping will be borne by Petronas. Since the average temperature in Malaysia is 5 to 10 degrees higher than in Japan, there is little demand for city gas for hot water supply or hot baths, but the view of Tokyo Gas is that "there is a latent demand for gas air conditioning, and there is a great possibility that the home market will be growing.
