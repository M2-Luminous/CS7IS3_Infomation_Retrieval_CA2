The foreign exchange bureaus will be closed down and finance houses will lose their licenses, he claimed. He was referring to finance houses that were dealing without permits. About 80 of the almost 200 finance houses are operating without licenses. The prosecution service is supposed to intervene, but in the absence of any sound, stable administration and police apparatus it is difficult to implement penal sanctions, Vulchev claimed. Of the 1,253 companies that have registered currency exchange bureaus, only 646 have supplied figures on the scale of their foreign exchange operations completed in 1993, as required by the BNB. If the others fail to present the information by 15 April, we will take away their licenses, Vulchev told the journalists. Vulchev said that a major violation of the foreign exchange controls had been established in a large state bank. No documents were available for 50 percent of its forex operations. The head of the bank's legal department claimed that he had not heard of Council of Ministers Decree No. 15 that controls forex operations in Bulgaria. The bank in question had transferred a considerable amount of money abroad for a client who had sold real estate. The fine for violations of this kind is up to 500,000 leva. Experts point out that the Finance Ministry can impose such a fine by ministerial decree.
