FR941202-1-00055 FR941202-1-00010 (d) Settlement agreements. Any agreement that provides for the dismissal of a protest and involves a direct or indirect expenditure of appropriated funds shall be submitted to the Board and shall be made a part of the public record (subject to any protective order considered appropriate by the Board) before dismissal of the protest. If a Federal agency is a party to a settlement agreement, the submission of the agreement to the Board shall include a memorandum, signed by the contracting officer concerned, that describes in detail the procurement, the grounds for protest, the Federal Government's position regarding the grounds for protest, the terms of the settlement, and the agency's position regarding the propriety of the award or proposed award of the contract at issue in the protest. 10. Section 6101.29 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: 6101.29 Decisions [Rule 29]. * * * * * (b) Timing of protest decisions. (1) A decision on the merits of a protest will be issued within 65 calendar days after the filing of the protest, unless the chairman of the Board determines that the specific and unique circumstances of the protest require a longer period. In that event, the Board shall issue a decision within the longer period determined by the chairman of the Board. (2) In a protest, the Board ordinarily will, within the 65-calendar-day period applicable to the original protest, decide all issues, including those raised by amendment or intervention, that are necessary to the resolution of the case. The Board will whenever possible notify the parties prior to the originally scheduled hearing date, or date for record submission, if it believes that because of a new ground of protest raised by an amendment or by an intervention, the protest might not be decided within the original 65-calendar-day period. 11.
