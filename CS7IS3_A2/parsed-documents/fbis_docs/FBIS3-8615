Their arrival marks the first time the United Nations has had a presence in this Moslem enclave, which has been besieged by Bosnian Serb forces since last June, said spokesman Major Rob Annink. The spokesman did not provide further details. UN officials have been unable to confirm reports of the latest round of fighting in Maglaj as there have been no international observers there. In addition, UN humanitarian aid has been blocked from Maglaj since October. Western concern has grown about Maglaj as Serb attacks are continuing there despite ceasefires in Sarajevo and central and southern Bosnia. A UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) convoy was refused passage into Maglaj last week by Serb troops. UNHCR officials have said the situation in Maglaj is desperate, with attacks mounting on the 16,000 people in the town since Serbs and Moslems reached a ceasefire in Sarajevo February 11 and since a Moslem-Croat ceasefire in central and southern Bosnia came into effect on February 28. Radio Sarajevo reported that Serb forces began as of 5:30 A.M. Sunday (0430 GMT) artillery and mortar attacks on the enclave that lasted for two hours. There was then sporadic mortar fire. Two people were wounded, it said.
