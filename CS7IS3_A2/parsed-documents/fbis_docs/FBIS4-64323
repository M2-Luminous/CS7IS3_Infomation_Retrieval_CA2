But the economic development observers in Brussels are not so sure about this, and claim that what little improvement occurs will have little bearing on the labor market. Unemployment in the EU will almost certainly rise from its current 11 percent to 11.25 percent next year, before it "generally falls again." The optimistic forecasts come from Germany because German exports have unexpectedly improved. But the European Commission does not see such an improvement in the rest of the EU. "The economy," says the European Commission in its annual economic report," could develop more unfavorably than expected if investor confidence decreases." The continuing restrictive monetary policy in most member countries, the absence of competitiveness in third markets, and the "continuing low degree of confidence on the part of consumers" are still preventing economic growth, say the people in Brussels. They hasten to add that a "faster decrease in credit interest rates might be required" in order to improve the economic climate. However, this is already happening to a pleasing degree. Long-term interest rates gradually fell from an average of 11 percent in 1990, their high point, to 6.5 percent in January, and have fallen even further since. Therefore, on an EU average, they are lower than in the United States. The economic development researchers in Brussels place particular emphasis on competitiveness on world markets, saying that "this has remained relatively weak in relation to costs and other determinants," so that exporters are "not always in a position to profit from the consolidation of world-wide economic activity." The EU reports a trade deficit of the equivalent of 137 billion German marks [DM] in 1992 (the 1993 figures are not available yet), compared to DM62 billion in 1989, the final almost complete year before the turnabout in the East. Therefore, the EU deficit is higher than that of the United States. The European Commission considers the domestic budgets of the EU member countries to be one of the factors restricting economic growth. Instead of backing up the still shaky economic improvement by means of a stable policy, virtually all the EU member countries are compelled to resort to consolidation programs because the budget deficit is increasing almost in every EU country. Whatever the case, the EU will remain the weakest economic area at least until next year. In 1995, the men in Brussels predict a real growth of 2.6 percent in the United States, a 2.8 percent growth in Japan, a 2.9 percent growth in European Free Trade Association, and a mere 3.1 percent growth on a world level.
