FR940713-0-00008 FR940713-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 9 CFR Part 78 [Docket No. 93&hyph;024&hyph;3] Brucellosis Surveillance; MCI Reactor Prevalence Rates AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: We are amending the brucellosis regulations to eliminate the requirement that States maintain specified Market Cattle Identification (MCI) reactor prevalence rates to maintain their official classifications. We are instead requiring the States to successfully close (epidemiologically investigate and resolve) certain percentages of cases detected through the MCI program. We believe these amendments will better serve Federal and State animal health officials in their efforts to prevent the interstate spread of brucellosis. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. M.J. Gilsdorf, National Brucellosis Epidemiologist, Cattle Diseases and Surveillance Staff, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 731, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;4918. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Brucellosis is an infectious disease of certain animals and humans. In its principal animal hosts, it is characterized by abortion and impaired fertility. Through a cooperative Federal-State effort, the United States is now approaching total eradication of the field strain Brucella abortus in domestic cattle and bison herds. As of June 1994, there were only 235 known infected cattle and bison herds, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had declared 33 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands free of the disease. Fewer than 400 new infected herds were identified last year. The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the interstate movement of cattle, bison, and swine to prevent the spread of brucellosis. On January 14, 1994, we published in the Federal Register (59 FR 2312&hyph;2316, Docket No. 93&hyph;024&hyph;1) a proposal to eliminate the requirement in the regulations that States meet specific MCI reactor prevalence rates to maintain their official classifications. We also proposed to require that to maintain their official classifications, States must successfully close a specified percentage of MCI reactor cases. We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment period ending February 14, 1994. On February 11, 1994, we published in the Federal Register a notice extending the comment period to March 14, 1994 (59 FR 6593, Docket No. 93&hyph;024&hyph;2). We received four comments by that date, three from Federal veterinarians and one from the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). We carefully considered all of the comments we received. They are discussed below:
