FR941004-2-00019 FR941004-2-00008 United States Price Because AST's U.S. sales of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings were made to an unrelated distributor in the United States prior to importation, and the exporter's sales price methodology was not indicated by other circumstances, we based USP on the purchase price (``PP'') sales methodology in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act. We calculated PP based on packed, c.i.f. port of import prices to an unrelated customer in the United States. We made deductions to the U.S. price for foreign brokerage, foreign inland freight, ocean freight and marine insurance. We made an adjustment to U.S. price for the consumption tax paid on the comparison sales in Thailand, in accordance with our practice, pursuant to the Court of International Trade (CIT) decision in Federal-Mogul, et al v. United States, 834 F. Supp. 1291. See Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination and Postponement of Final Determination; Color Negative Photographic Paper and Chemical Components Thereof from Japan, 59 FR 16177, 16179, April 6, 1994, for an explanation of this tax methodology. Foreign Market Value In order to determine whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. On this basis, we determined that the home market was viable. For purposes of calculating FMV, we used AST's sales to its home market customers and CV, as described below. Cost of Production In order to determine whether home market prices were below the COP within the meaning of section 773(b) of the Act, we calculated COP based on the sum of AST's cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses and home market packing costs. We compared individual home market prices net of inland freight and commission with model-specific COPs. We performed a product-specific COP test, in which we examined whether each home market sale was priced below that product's COP. The Department defines COP as the sum of direct material, direct labor, variable and fixed factory overhead, general expenses, and packing. For each product, we compared this sum to the home market unit price, net of movement expenses and commission. In accordance with section 733(b) of the Act, we also examined whether the home market sales of each product were made at prices below their COP in substantial quantities over an extended period of time, and whether such sales were made at prices that would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade. For each product where less than ten percent, by quantity, of the home market sales during the POI were made at prices below the COP, we included all sales of that model for the computation of FMV. For each product where ten percent of more, but less than 90 percent, of the home market sales during the POI were prices below the COP, we excluded from the calculation of FMV those home market sales which were prices below the COP, provided that the below-cost sales of that product were made over an extended period of time. Where we found that more than 90 percent of respondent's sales were at prices below the COP, and such sales were over an extended period of time, we disregarded all sales of that product and calculated FMV based on CV, in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act. In order to determine whether below-cost sales had been made over an extended period of time, we compared the number of months in which below-cost sales occurred for each product to the number of months in the POI in which that product was sold. If a product was sold in fewer than three months during the POI, we did not exclude sales unless there were below cost sales in each month of sale. If a product was sold in three or more months, we did not exclude the below-cost sales unless there were below-cost sales in at least three months during the POI. If sales below cost occurred in three or more months of the POI, they are considered to be made over an extended period of time. When items are sold in just two or three months of the POI, we would consider below cost sales of these items to be over an extended period of time, if they occurred in at least two months of the three months. When items are sold in just one month of the POI, we would consider any below cost sales of these items to be over an extended period of time.
