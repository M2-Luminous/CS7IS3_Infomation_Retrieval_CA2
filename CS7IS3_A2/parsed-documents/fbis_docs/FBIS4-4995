[Yamagishi] The policy study forum was first said to provide a basis for a parliamentary union of coalition party members in the House of Representatives. However, when we think of the next lower house election, there will be a good possibility that the policy study forum will develop into the so-called coalition-wide "new new party [shin shinto]" in the end. Parties in the ruling coalition should first complete the process toward forming a single parliamentary group in the House of Councilors by dispelling the ill feeling among them, by deepening mutual confidence, and by overcoming their fundamental policy differences. It was reported that participation in the policy study forum would become a precondition for candidate selection that would be jointly supported by all coalition parties in the next lower house election. It was also said that the prime minister and the promoters of the study forum plan had a secret meeting to discuss who would take up which post in the coalition-wide "new new party." If this is true, I strongly object to these moves. I have to confess, I never expected such developments in the political realignment talks. [Saito] Shinseito and Komeito are maneuvering quickly. [Yamagishi] I want them to put off such a move until the fiscal 1994 budget clears the Diet. Coalition members should not give the impression that they are engrossed in an interlocking puzzle to find a new combination of parties and paying no attention to the most important and urgent matter, which is the implementation of measures to stimulate the sluggish economy. If they do not go all-out to win passage of the fiscal 1994 budget, I am afraid that the fate of the coalition government might become uncertain. If the coalition government were to collapse, coalition members would suffer a total loss. As such there is no point in discussing the "new new party" plan right now. [Saito] What exactly is the "social-democratic/liberal" alliance? [Yamagishi] Since Japanese people have various political values, there should be a tendency to wish for a political force that fights for the interests of workers, like the Labor Party under the European type of two-party system. However, a movement to create this sort of political force has not taken shape so far. People with such an idea are still groping in the dark. Hopefully, a neoliberal party should have the following selling points: It should promote a nonmilitary role in global security efforts, emphasize the interests of workers, and secure clean and open politics. [Saito] What kind of role do you expect Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi to play in the next phase of the unfolding political realignment drama? [Yamagishi] The governing coalition is now supported by two forces. One is the Shinseito-Komeito axis, which is already very steady. Unfortunately, the other one has not taken shape yet. However, there are indications that it is coming into existence. The movement toward the creation of a neoliberal party is a sign. I want Hokkaido Governor Yokomichi to play a certain role in promoting this movement, in cooperation with other leaders. One point is that his comeback to the central stage should be well timed. We are going to see another climactic scene in the unfolding political realignment drama, from the end of the current regular Diet session until early autumn. At that event, Mr. Yokomichi should not give the impression that he has been prevailed upon to become the new leader of the liberal force. Like Prime Minister Hosokawa did when he created his party, Mr. Yokomichi will have to demonstrate that he is firmly determined to create a new party, even if he is left alone. [Saito] You have announced that Rengo will establish a political forum in June. Don't you think that the forum will become a means for selecting political parties with which Rengo will cooperate in the next elections? [Yamagishi] Before the inauguration of the political forum, a preparatory panel will be set up in early April. Electoral cooperation will necessarily be brought up for discussion. However, participation in the political forum should absolutely not become a precondition to get Rengo's support or endorsement in the next elections. At this moment, the most delicate issue for the preparatory panel is which parties should be invited to join the political forum. [Saito] Some Rengo-affiliated local industrial unions, such as the All-Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union, have announced that the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] will no longer enjoy a monopoly on their support. What do you think of the change in their policy? [Yamagishi] Candidates backed by all coalition members will automatically receive Rengo's support; this is quite natural. The recent gubernatorial election in Ishikawa Prefecture showed the coalition parties will not be able to defeat the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] if they fight individually. Rengo has traditionally backed the SDPJ and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. However, in the next lower house election to be held under the new single-seat electoral system, many members who belong to neither the SDPJ nor the DSP will be selected as candidates to be jointly supported by the coalition parties. Therefore, these labor unions cannot but change their policy of supporting only one party. [Saito] What future do you foresee for the governing coalition? [Yamagishi] There are now two different tendencies among the ruling coalition. However, all members are of the same opinion that they will have to cooperate in fielding candidates in the next general elections. They should present an effective united front against the LDP by making utmost efforts to jointly support a single candidate in each district. [TOKYO SHIMBUN editorial note] Yamagishi is a senior member of the SDPJ who joined the party in 1954 and has been affiliated with it ever since. During the interview, we strongly felt his anxiety about the future of his party. It seemed as if he was saying: "Whether it stays with the ruling coalition or whether it secedes from it, the SDPJ should remain united. Otherwise other parties will try to take its electoral power base by assault, bringing about a breakup of the SDPJ. As a party member, I am anxious about it." At the same time, we also realize he has a strong sense of duty as a "cheerleader" for the governing coalition. In an effort to maintain unity within the coalition, he seemed to be ambitious to play a role as a mediator between the Shinseito-Komeito forces and the rest of the coalition members.
