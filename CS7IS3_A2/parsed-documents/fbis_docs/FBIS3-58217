Teams have been established to work at the Winter Operations Headquarters to maintain effective coordination between the military and civilian units around the clock. State of Emergency Governor Unal Erkan, Deputy State of Emergency Governor Ahmet Erturk, and other high-ranking officials closely studied the preparations during the past three days. Special Teams Based in the Region Special security measures are being taken against the PKK's urban activities in Diyarbakir, Batman, and Sirnak, which have been declared sensitive towns. It has been reported that the towns are being patrolled by trained teams of two or four security personnel armed with automatic Kalashnikov firearms. The patrol units wear civilian clothes and carry field radios. Meanwhile, some 500 civilian police have been transferred to the region to maintain security at public establishments and installations used by the media and the private sector. It has been reported that the first special Army teams in the region have been based at the installations used by the Turkish Coal Mining Works Company, which are 10 km from Sirnak. The teams reportedly are prepared to render ineffective the Botan branch of the PKK in Sirnak, Idil, and Cizre. It has also been reported that they clashed with the PKK militants between Ikiztepe and Toptepe Villages the night before last, and that special teams will be deployed to predetermined areas in that region.
