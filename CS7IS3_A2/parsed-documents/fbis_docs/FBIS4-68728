The biggest worries were crime, inflation, and insecurity (these were named by 40-60 percent of the 2,000 Muscovites we polled). What worries them least are the political maneuvers "at the top," including those connected with the treaty on public accord (around nine percent of the respondents mentioned these). This might seem paradoxical: After all, the accord of various political forces should give citizens a stronger sense of security, promising perhaps not a bright future, but at least a less dismal one. There is no paradox here, however. We asked: "Do you believe that the different parties, social movements, Duma factions, and branches of government can reach an accord and work together constructively?" Only 7.5 percent said they did believe this, 54.5 percent said they did not, another 25.5 percent did not say no, but did express doubts, and the rest had no response. Our fellow citizens have no doubt at all that the ceremonial signing of this kind of paper could take place, but they have strong doubts about the authenticity and significance of this protocol of good intentions and, in general, are not inclined to believe that the main participants in this undertaking represent the public interest rather than personal and private interests. This is shocking in view of the fact that it has been only 100 days since the election. When we asked the respondents whether they knew the names of their deputies in the State Duma, only seven percent answered that they did, and only five percent said they still expected the deputies to live up to their expectations. If Yeltsin's persistent attempts to conclude a supra-constitutional agreement with his opponents have not aroused any public enthusiasm and clearly do not have the same meaning as last April's referendum, what is their real purpose? The sociological data suggested two interrelated hypotheses. The society has reached a definite impasse. Today 65 percent of the people in Moscow are living below the poverty line, and around 10 percent do not have enough to eat. Hidden unemployment in Moscow, judging by an extremely accurate indicator--the abnormally high ratings of daytime television programs--has already reached 15-20 percent and could take the form of clear and obvious unemployment at any time. The people have endured even worse problems in the past, of course, but not when they have had to watch others race by in a Mercedes or have had to see the advertisements for the Harlequin Night Club, for example, offering businessmen erotic floor shows, roulette, and a dinner menu including lobster and baby alligator ragout. There are extremely strong feelings of nostalgia in the society--no, not for the actual past, but for a lost social ideal. The ratings for old movies of the socialist realism genre provide a more precise indication of this than our ambiguous surveys. In reality, however, the ideological vacuum is being filled more and more by Orthodoxy, which is being inculcated as the state religion, and by a brand of nationalism with an emphasis on anti-Semitism, which one out of every four Muscovites feels no need to conceal today. The changes are irreversible, of course: Only 15 percent of the inhabitants of the capital (half of them retired) believe that Russia should get back on the socialist track. In other words, people seem to be "in favor of reform." Only 14 percent of the Muscovites, however, said that they had the necessary qualities to succeed in life and that they feel like outsiders in the society. The society seems to be stuck: It does not want to go back, but it cannot move forward because it has not found a suitable course to follow. The only thing that unites the vast majority of people today is their total ignorance of current developments. In the past the public was told that the reforms were being obstructed by the conflict between the branches of the government. What is obstructing them today? Evidently, just one thing: their own fundamental infeasibility. If members of the president's team have not realized this yet, the purpose of the document on civil accord is to provoke discord and find a scapegoat. If they have realized this, then the agreement has another purpose: a radical adjustment of the reforms, probably in the social democratic spirit, to prevent social upheavals, and a consequent change in political points of reference. It is the president's job to achieve this change in a relatively peaceful manner by sacrificing a few secondary officials who can easily be accused of corruption and can then fill the vacuum in Lefortovo Prison. There is one important fact, however, that raises questions about the value of this hypothesis. We asked the 2,000 Muscovites whether B.N. Yeltsin had a chance of being re-elected for a second term--15.5 percent said yes, 52.5 percent said no, 24.5 percent were not certain, and 11.5 percent had no response. The president's staff probably has comparable data. They could be obtained from the counterintelligence service, which managed to come within 1-2 percent of the outcome of the December election in its predictions. If this is true, then the declaration of accord is certainly an ultimatum, as G. Zyuganov said, but an extraordinary ultimatum, stipulating the terms and nature of payment for the opposition's signature--direct access to public opinion, signifying the start of the election campaign. Because the text of the agreement says nothing about any specific anti-crisis measures, which would warrant agreement, the accord is essentially nothing more than a moratorium on impeachment. Incidentally, this is also a noble goal: The institution of a precedent in Russian history for a democratic change of government.
