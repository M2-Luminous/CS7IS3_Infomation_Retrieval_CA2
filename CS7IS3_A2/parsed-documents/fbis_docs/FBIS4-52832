FBIS4-52832 "dreas094__a94005" FBIS-EAS-94-094-A Daily Report 14 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo To `Drastically' Revise Trade Policy Tokyo To `Drastically' Revise Trade Policy OW1505122894 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 May 94 Morning Edition p 13--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1505122894 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said on 13 May it plans to drastically revise postwar Japan's trade policy, now that the World Trade Organization (WTO) is due to set sail in January 1995. The ministry will do self-criticism on the past practice of addressing issues as they occur instantaneously, using managed trade techniques and holding bilateral talks--mostly with the United States. It will come up with a policy that gives weight to a free trade system and emphasis to multinational talks. Later this month, a WTO Division (headed by Professor Mitsuo Matsushita of Seikei University) will be set up under the Industrial Structure Council which is an advisory panel to the MITI minister. Guidelines for new policy will be prepared by next spring and Japan's change of its trade policy will be formally reported to all countries in the first miniterial meeting of the WTO. The ministry plans to revise its policy because the scope of the WTO operations -- being different from that of the GATT of the past -- not only applies to trade of commodities, but also extends to international economic rules, such as services, intellectural property rights, and trade-related investments. The WTO also bans gray measures like those seen in self-controls on export. Rules on the arbitration of disputes change from the current consensus system of requiring unanimous approval by the Arbitration Board to a negative consensus system wherein a judgment cannot be overturned unless everyone on the board votes for disagreement. As such, it has become easy for a judgment by the Grievance Panel to be upheld. All this has prompted the ministry to decide toward making the revision. The ministry now is doing self-criticism, admitting the practices it has indulged in--of taking actions instantaneously when pressed by countries like the United States in trade talks--are "things that lead to managed trade." The ministry will clearly state in its policy that Japan will abide by the WTO rules and will file complaints with the WTO even against the United States when infractions of the rules occur. Also regarding the Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement which is due to expire in the summer of 1996, Japan will negotiate with the United States toward removing the controversial part which can be interpreted as having made a commitment on market shares of the foreign-made semiconductors. In the new policy, the subjects to be discussed in the WTO in the future--such as the impact of labor, environment, competitive policy, and investments on trade issues--will be taken up. It will explain discussions need to take into account the concerns of Asian nations lest these matters be linked to protectionism. The abolition of export cartels in principle and the problem of intra-keiretsu dealings in trade will be also dealt with.
