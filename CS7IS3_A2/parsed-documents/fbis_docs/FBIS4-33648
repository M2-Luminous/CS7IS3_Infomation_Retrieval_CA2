According to today's issue of LUZERNER NEUSTEN NACHRICHTEN, Cotti said he understands the indignation of Chileans living in Switzerland. Cotti regretted there is no longer the juridical possibility of preventing Pinochet from entering the country. Pinochet's stay in Lucerne on 7 June caused protests by the Green Alliance, the Swiss Socialist Youth, the Swiss Council for Peace, and the Work Group for Arms Control and the Prohibition of Arms Exports because, according to some information, the Chilean Army is reportedly interested in buying weapons. Green Alliance Deputy Cecile Buhlmann said Gen. Pinochet should be considered an "undesirable person in Switzerland" and that she would questioned the Lucerne Legislature about his visa permit.
