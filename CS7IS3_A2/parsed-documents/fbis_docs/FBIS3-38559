Addressing the Lower House foreign affairs commission ahead of a working lunch with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, Andreatta said his talks with Granic would focus on the "worrying reports of direct intervention by Zagreb in central Bosnia." "From my talks with Granic," he told the commission, "I expect convincing elements as regards the groundlessness of rumours -- which are however being firmed up by worrying details -- concerning a build-up of Croatian forces." Many countries have been pressing for an extension of the embargo against the rump Yugoslav federation of Serbia-Montenegro, to include Croatia. Andreatta added that "a development of this kind" would risk weakening the position of those such as Italy who have resisted calls for the military embargo to be lifted to allow Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves properly. On peace plans for Bosnia, Andreatta criticised "a certain idealism that does not look at costs," calling for "concrete positions." In particular, he said that "if the condition for reaching peace is the separation of ethnic groups, this must be recognised, within the context of a European peace plan which is, in any case, perfectible." (Andreatta will have talks here tomorrow with international mediators David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.) He defended the European peace plan for a three-way land split, saying that while it "does not respect the principles of morality and justice which the international community seeks to use as inspiration for its actions, it nonetheless appears necessary as a way of achieving the primary goal of stopping the fighting." Despite the mutual refusals to budge from territorial claims, Andreatta underlined the importance of "keeping the negotiation process open" while re-affirming the possible use of NATO air strikes against Serb positions, in support of UN troops hold up at Srebrenica and Tuzla. He said that while action against Srebrenica appeared "less probable" for the moment, "there remains the possibility of action at Tuzla, unless Serbs supply the necessary co-operation to re-open the airport there." But in any case, he reminded the commission, any air action will be "limited and targeted", and there should be "no illusions" that their use might play any decisive role in resolving a conflict that will ultimately be solved at the negotiating table. Andreatta reiterated the need for greater involvement on the part of the United States, Russia, and moderate Islamic states in the stalled peace process. He said that a perceived lack of support from the United States might encourage the Bosnian Muslims to "confirm their present tendency of preferring military options." As for Russia, it must be called on to wield greater pressure on Serbia and "adopt an attitude of maximum openness towards Muslim requests." He said Italy means to keep up all forms of pressure to ensure that aid convoys are allowed to continue consigning their precious deliveries, and reiterated that the presence of the UN troops is "indispensable" for protecting these convoys and acting as buffer between the warring factions and civilian populations.
