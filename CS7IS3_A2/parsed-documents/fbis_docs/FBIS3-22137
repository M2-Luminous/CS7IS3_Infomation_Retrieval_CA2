Speaking at the London launch of "Climate Change: The Challenge and the Opportunities", the 1994 Energy Efficiency Roadshows, a series of high profile regional conferences and exhibitions featuring top speakers from all sectors of industry and commerce, Mr Gummer said: "Although the UK economy has grown by a quarter since 1979, we are still using the same amount of energy. With cost effective improvements, some 20 per cent of current energy demand can be cut, therefore cutting CO2 emissions and helping to reduce the threat of climate change.'' "Everyone - from local and central Government, households, businesses and the public sector - has a part to play. Businesses, which account for nearly half of all UK CO2 emissions, should aim to implement a four-point plan of action:'' "First - board level commitment must be made to energy management. The 'Making a Corporate Commitment' campaign is the ideal vehicle. It calls for the development of energy and fuel efficient strategies, and asks organisations to set performance improvement targets and ensure that plans are considered regularly at board level;'' "Secondly - energy management must be integrated with other environmental initiatives and with environmental reporting;'' "Thirdly - combined heat and power [CHP] schemes produce more energy than by conventional electricity generation. CHP produces fewer greenhouse gases and fuel bills are in many cases up to 40 per cent lower; and'' "Finally - we need to encourage good habits at home which will be carried over to the work-place - and vice versa. The need to change attitudes and habits is just as great as making buildings, products and technologies more energy efficient." Mr Gummer Continued: "With this plan, the Government can look confidently at a partnership with business to save 2.5 million tonnes of carbon by the year 2000. And I am pleased to announce the launch next week of Energy Advice Week, which will be encouraging householders to become energy efficient and save money on fuel bills. This emphasises the Government's commitment to energy efficiency in all sectors of the community - indeed, we are encouraging the domestic sector to cut its carbon emissions by 4 million tonnes by the end of the century.'' "The Week, which runs from 12 to 20 February, aims to make the public aware of the simple energy efficiency measures they can take every day, and will provide advice and information on how to make savings of up 100 pounds annually on fuel bills."
