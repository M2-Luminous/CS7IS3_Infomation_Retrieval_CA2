Addressing a Ramadhan fast-breaking dinner for journalists, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that the support to the cause of Kashmiris is included in the 1947 principles of our independence, and we are continuing the support to Muslims of Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Palestine under the same spirit. The prime minister said that for us, the Kashmir cause is a part of our faith in God, and we have made intensive efforts and taken practical steps in this regard; and instead of remaining silent as in the past decade, we have fully highlighted the Kashmir issue. The prime minister said that one of our goals is to do away with Pakistan's international isolation. She said that Pakistan was on the verge of being declared a terrorist state during the past regime. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that her government has decided to present the Jammu and Kashmir issue in its correct perspective. Pakistan values freedom, for which the Muslims of the subcontinent launched a struggle under our great leader Jinnah. She said that her government's political will and determination have helped in taking the Kashmir issue from one capital to the other and from one city to the other, thereby apprising the world leaders of the miserable condition in Kashmir. She said that the opposition should have cooperated with us in this regard, but it disappointed us. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that she visited Cyprus within a few hours after assuming the office to apprise the Commonwealth leaders of Indian atrocities in Kashmir. Eventually, the government decided to present the issue before the the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. This is the first time since the 1950's that this has happened. Referring to internal issues, the prime minister said that she has directed the authorities to ensure fiscal discipline to contain the budgetary deficit that presently stands at about 60 billion rupees. The federal and provincial governments will have to cut their nondevelopmental expenditures at all levels.
