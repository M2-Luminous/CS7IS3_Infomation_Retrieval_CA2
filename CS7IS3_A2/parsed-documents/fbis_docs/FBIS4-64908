At least that, once again, is the conclusion drawn by the Bank for Reconstruction (KfW) from the cases of development aid that it oversees. A good two years ago this state-owned bank, based in Frankfurt, presented its first profit and loss report. Now it has presented its second, to again verify "with facts" what "has actually been achieved" with the aid. According to the report: 76 percent of the KfW projects are "successful in terms of development policy"; 24 percent are not. Sixty-seven percent of the financial aid is distributed among the successful projects, and 33 percent is spent on the unsuccessful projects. The rate of success is virtually the same as in the first evaluation report. At that time 74 percent of the projects examined were classified as successful. Around four-fifths of distributed funds were used on these projects. In this respect, the funds were used more effectively at that time. All cases involve so-called financial development aid: used to finance projects in the Third World that are contracted by the Federal Government. For its report the bank evaluated 112 projects. Bank sponsorship of all of these projects was completed in 1990 and 1991. Around 3 billion German marks [DM] were spent on these projects. The money came from the budget of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation (BMZ). The geographic area of emphasis for the projects is Africa, and functional areas of emphasis include transportation, communications, electricity and water supply, and health care. The projects are evaluated both by employees of the KfW and by the economic evaluation firm, Treuarbeit (under contract by the ministry). The bank would like the fact that 27 projects (24 percent) are unsuccessful to be seen in relative terms: The classification "unsuccessful" does not mean that the project has been completely useless for the developing countries involved. Fifteen projects definitely showed important advantages. These were not sufficient, however, to classify the project, measured in terms of the efficient use of funds, as successful. Six projects were considered "clearly insufficient" in terms of their developmental policy effectiveness, and only the remaining five were considered a "complete failure." As an example of a project that is unsuccessful on the whole but is not completely useless, the bank mentions the expansion of a street in Malawi: The street is now passable even during the rainy season, it improves the sales prospects for agricultural products raised by small farmers from a rural district of the capital city, the transportation costs have dropped, and durable consumer goods from the capital city have become less expensive for the rural inhabitants of the African countryside. But the government's inadequate economic policy and the civil war have destroyed regional development, in contrast to assumptions made when the project was evaluated, and as a result the increase in traffic on the street has turned out to be less dramatic than was necessary for the minimum payment of interest on the funds employed. One example of a total failure is the project of a lead-silver smelting works in Bolivia. It was intended to be used to smelt the ores, which up to that point had been exported, domestically, thereby bringing in additional foreign currency and creating jobs. But the ores were not sufficiently available and the prices on the world market for lead and silver dropped, so that the smelting works became uneconomical and it did not even start up production. Another failure was a planting of rubber trees in Indonesia. The ministry responsible was not conscientious enough; the trees were stricken with mycosis, thus their yield was low; and the small farmers lost interest. The project was broken off prematurely. How are successes or failures measured? Evaluation standards include: Was the goal of the project (Example: drinking water for 20,000 people) achieved? Does the assisted investment earn the funds necessary to maintain it (catch phrase: operating efficiency)? Does it benefit the country's whole economy (Catch phrase: cost-benefit analysis)? Does the project improve the living conditions, above all, of the poorer groups of the population; does it fit in with a traditional life and a traditional mode of behavior? Could it possibly be harmful to human health or to the ecosystem (catch phrase: environmental effects)? Does it display sustained effectiveness; will it remain durable over the long term? This evaluation covers only the benefits that the aid provides in developing countries; it does not account for benefits the financial aid might have for the German donor country (example: additional purchases in Germany). The message the bank is hoping to convey with its report is: Development aid is far better than its poor public image would suggest.
