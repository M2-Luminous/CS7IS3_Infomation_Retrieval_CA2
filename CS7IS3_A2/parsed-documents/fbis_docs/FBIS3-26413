Company president Yin Wenlong said yesterday that the new planes would bring the Beijing-based airline's fleet to 66. Eight freighters were delivered last year. Mr Yin said recent investment had put Air China in a position to repay leasing obligations worth 1.4 billion yuan (about HK$1.24 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) a year. The first jet, a Boeing 747-400, is scheduled to be delivered by the end of this month. The 12-year lease financing agreement, worth U.S.$145 million, was signed yesterday. The Export-Import Bank of Japan is providing 60 percent of the loan, while a group of banks including Mitsubishi Bank, Diamond Lease Co and Sanwa Bank is providing the rest. Interest on the 60 per cent slice of the loan has been set at 90 basis points above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and on the remainder at 120 basis points above LIBOR. Mr Yin said the company, which deals with one-third of mainland air traffic, planned to expand to cope with the expected 20 percent annual growth in the market. "We have ordered five Boeing jets for delivery this year. One Boeing 767 will be delivered in March, and one Boeing-737 will be delivered in each of April, July and October," he said. Five other Boeing jets would be bought for delivery next year. Air China is one of the mainland's three largest airlines. The other two, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines, have become shareholding companies and have received approval to list abroad. Mr Yin said Air China would do likewise, but would carry out the necessary restructuring first. He said Air China, one of 55 enterprises chosen by Beijing to take part in modernisation experiments had set up a holding company in December last year. Air China would now be one of 27 enterprises in the Air China Group. It is now operating on 58 domestic and 29 international routes. Last year, its revenue totalled six billion yuan and flew 1.5 billion tonne-kilometres -- the measure used by the industry. Taxed profit was more than 200 million yuan and gross profit 700 million yuan. Mr Yin forecasts revenue of nine billion yuan on traffic of 1.8 billion tonne-kilometres this year. Taxed profits are expected to be about 300 million yuan.
