The investment will mainly go to projects in transportation, telecommunications, energy, power and other urban projects, a senior city official announced yesterday at a press conference in Beijing. Xie Ruxuan, mayor of Nanning, said the city will invest over 3 billion yuan ($344 million) this year into the projects, a 40 per cent increase over last year. He promised that infrastructure funding will continue to rise in the coming years to further improve its investment climate and build the city into a transportation hub linking Southwest and South China with Southeast Asia. Nanning, with a population of 2.6 million, is located at the centre of the autonomous region and serves as an important venue for Southwest and Central China. At present, the Nanning-Kunming Railway, a trunkline connecting both ends of Southwest China, is under construction and will be completed in 1997. A number of highways and expressways are also being built or planned. The State Council in 1992 granted Nanning the same policies given to coastal cities in the early 1980s, providing a good chance for Nanning to catch up with the coast. In the past two years, the city has approved nearly 400 foreign- funded enterprises with a promised investment of about $1 billion. The joint ventures and investments include projects in transportation, energy, agriculture, commerce, real estate development and industry. Xie said about 60 per cent of the city's total $34.46 million in exports were produced by joint ventures. Last year, the industrial output value topped 10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion) for the first time, an increase of 18.7 per cent over the previous year. In a sign of its robust economy, the city has no industrial stockpile, as 99.7 per cent of its products are sold on the market, Xie noted. The city plans to invest 16 billion yuan ($1.84 billion) in the next six years to start 31 major industrial projects, but the mayor did not go into detail on the projects. The capacity of its digital telephone system exceeded 88,500 lines last year, compared with 15,000 lines in 1990. This year, the city will invest 500 million yuan ($57 million).
