The republic has already received the first $20 million. According to the agreement reached by the sides, 10.5 million "greenbacks" from this sum will go into the conversion of three major Belarusian defense enterprises -- BelOMO, the "Integral" Plant, and the Minsk "Computer Technology" Production Association. The remaining funds will be used to build housing for servicemen and to equip the republic center for retraining servicemen transferred to the reserve and placing them in jobs. In the past few days, a consignment of equipment for computer classes worth $187,000 was supplied from the United States to the center's branch in Lida. Equipment for setting up a network of service stations will arrive there mid-January -- it is specifically for these stations that the Lida branch will be training specialists.
