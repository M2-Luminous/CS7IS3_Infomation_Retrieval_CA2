Dissolved in 1970 following the implication of several of its officers in a coup attempt against the late President Marien Ngouabi, the gendarmerie was reestablished in 1992 with France's assistance and has about 2,000 men. It falls under the Ministry of Defense. The disagreement between the two ministries stems from Interior Minister Martin Mberi's wish to have the unit under his control, the same sources added. This disagreement could compromise the French Government's support for the training of the gendarmerie units which will be strengthened with the future recruitment of more than 200 24-year-olds, according to the same sources. For his part, the French ambassador in Brazzaville, Raymond Cesaire, who was received yesterday by Mr. Mberi, reaffirmed on the official radio his country's willingness to contribute to the lasting restoration of security in Congo, in particular, through a support to the gendarmerie. "We want people to forget the difficult period the country has just passed through in order to achieve national reconciliation," Mr. Cesaire stated in a reference to the 1993 clashes between opposition and pro-government militiamen which left hundreds of people dead in Brazzaville. The diplomat also stressed that France supported recent bills on decentralization and general reorganization of the police force.
