FBIS3-28612 "dreas027_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 North Korea KCNA Carries Denouncement SK0902101794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1009 GMT 9 Feb 94 SK0902101794 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN ["Papers Rap at Han Sung-chu's Sophism on `Nuclear Issue'" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppet foreign minister, Han Sung-chu, at a recent "meeting of heads of embassies and legations abroad" blared that it is the stand of the "government" to take "a stern measure" in case the "nuclear issue of the North" is not solved. And the South Korean Christian Broadcasting System (CBS) reported that Han Sung-chu would meet with U.S. masters to "readjust" the stand of both sides and discuss the socalled "follow-up measures" pursuant to the "resolution" of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Commenting on this, papers here today say this suggests that the South Korean puppets will seek international "pressure" and "sanctions" against the fellow countrymen in the North in league with outside forces at whatever costs. An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: The South Korean puppets have neither qualification nor face to run about with the "nuclear issue" of the North. It is imprudent, ridiculous and shameless that the very ones creating nuclear threats on the Korean peninsula are crying over the "nuclear issue" of the North. This reminds people of a thief crying "stop thief". It is clear that the South Korean puppets are trying to put a spoke in the wheel of the third round of the DPRK-USA talks aimed at solving the nuclear issue and do harm to the fellow countrymen in the North in league with the outside forces. Such malicious act can be committed only by traitors who are dyed to the marrow with flunkeyism and treachery. The reality proves that with traitors such as Kim Yong-sam and Han Sung-chu left alone, neither reunification nor peace of the country can be achieved. If the puppets, together with the outside forces, seek to slay fellow countrymen in defiance of the desire of the nation, it will result in precipitating their self-destruction.
