Mikhaylov; place and date not given: "Are the Elders Leaning More to the Right?" -- first paragraph is STRAZH BALTIKI introduction] [Text] After Maris Grinblats was elected a deputy to the Saeima [parliament], his powers as chairman of the Latvian Congress of Citizens were suspended. However, the leader of the now parliamentary opposition has not been left without work, of course. Today, he is not only the leader of the radical right-wing Fatherland and Freedom faction, but also head of the "Union of 18 November." This party, as known, is a leading force on the path toward the unification of Latvia's nationalist forces. Thus, there is every reason to call this philosopher from Madona a leader of the entire national radical wing of the Latvian Republic. Excluding, of course, the Movement for National Independence of Latvia [LNNK]. By the way, our interview began with a question about the differences between the LNNK faction and Fatherland and Freedom. After all, it is beyond the comprehension of mere mortals. [Grinblats] There are certain differences. For instance, there were two different draft laws on citizenship. The LNNK wanted to begin naturalization before the withdrawal of occupation troops, whereas we opposed such an approach. True, by now, after two months of mutual discussions, we have arrived at a single compromise draft. [Mikhaylov] How is it so that the positions are similar, but the numbers of seats in the legislature are so different? [Grinblats] The LNNK is more familiar to the people, while our union was created only a year ago, literally on the eve of legislative elections. Thus, the results of the elections were not surprising. [Mikhaylov] You are in opposition to the governing coalition. Does this mean that all your ideas are being swept aside by "wayfarers" and "peasants?" [Grinblats] No, some of our ideas regarding the restoration of laws adopted in the Latvian Republic in the 1920's and 1930's are being accepted by Saeima. These are the laws on state control and a referendum, both of which are being adopted according to our conception. With regard to laws on land reform and denationalization of housing, we have managed to make only certain alterations here. The psychology of the ruling coalition is as follows: The process has been activated, and no special changes are needed. [Mikhaylov] You have your own draft law on foreigners and stateless people. The draft divides these people into four groups. What are they? [Grinblats] In the first place, the question concerns people who are not allowed residence permits. These are people who entered Latvia illegally, even from the point of view of Soviet laws, and are not registered. They include criminal elements and servicemen from the Russian Army. The second group of people, who are allowed residence permits for one year, includes pensioned servicemen and their families. The third group includes the main bulk of civilians who have the right to reside in Latvia for five years. In addition, both the second and third categories can extend residence permits for one year and five years respectively, if they are not acting in any way against Latvia's independence. The fourth group, which has the right of permanent residence, includes all Latvians and Livonians who do not currently have Latvian citizenship; foreigners and their families, who came to Latvia before 1940 and have residence permits dating from that time; spouses of Latvian citizens who live in Latvia for a definite period of time; and, possibly, former citizens of Latvia and Estonia. [Mikhaylov] What about the system of quotas? [Grinblats] We think that such a system is necessary, regardless of what we might call it. Yet the extent of a quota should be determined not by the government, but by a legal norm. Within these quotas, naturalization can be applied only to Latvians who have yet not been granted Latvian citizenships for some other reason. [Mikhaylov] How would you evaluate Latvia's participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program? [Grinblats] It is a positive step. The West, as it is becoming clear by now, does not intend to interfere in our problems too much. They are not very interested in them. Latvia, in the end, is not oil-rich Kuwait. Thus, the "Partnership" is an option that could not be rejected. Though, I am more hopeful to strengthen the close ties in security matters with Lithuania and Estonia with the support of such countries as Denmark and Sweden. These countries are very concerned with the illegal transit of immigrants through Baltic states. It is a matter of vital interest for them whether our "sieve" has holes or not. [Mikhaylov] One last question: If your version of the law on citizenship is not adopted and these 70,000 pensioned servicemen with their families stay in Latvia, what will you do? Will you accept the situation? [Grinblats] We will seek another means to achieve our goal. [Mikhaylov] Thank you for the interview.
