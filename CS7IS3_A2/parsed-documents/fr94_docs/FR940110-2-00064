ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a final guideline entitled ``Guideline for the Manufacture of In Vitro Diagnostic Products'' that contains production practices which are acceptable to FDA for assuring the safety and effectiveness of in vitro diagnostic products. Manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic products may find the information in the guideline useful in developing procedures that comply with the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for these products. A draft document was previously made available for public comment. DATES: Comments by March 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written requests for single copies of the final guideline to the Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance (HFZ&hyph;220), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;443&hyph;6597 (toll free outside MD 800&hyph;638&hyph;2041). Send two self-addressed adhesive labels to assist that office in processing your requests. Submit written comments on the final guideline to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. Requests and comments should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The final guideline and received comments are available for public examination in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Z. Frank Twardochleb, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ&hyph;300), Food and Drug Administration, 2098 Gaither Rd., Rockville, MD 20850, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1128. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FDA first announced the availability for public comment of the draft guideline in the Federal Register of April 7, 1988 (53 FR 11561). In that same issue of the Federal Register (53 FR 11561), FDA announced the forthcoming meeting of the agency's Device Good Manufacturing Practice Advisory Committee (the committee). As a result of the notice and the open public meeting, FDA received 17 letters providing comments_14 from manufacturers, 2 from trade associations, and 1 from an attorney representing a manufacturer. Presentations before the committee by industry and FDA resulted in committee recommendations that the agency: (1) Continue to handle the document as a guideline; (2) change the title and/or scope of the document to clarify which products are subject to the guideline; and (3) extend the comment period from June 6, 1988 to July 15, 1988. FDA extended the comment period as recommended by the committee and revised the guideline based on the comments received. A notice of availability of the second draft was published in the Federal Register of April 19, 1990 (55 FR 14863). Since release of the second draft, four letters of comment have been received from two trade associations, one manufacturer, and one user association. Meetings have also been held with the two trade associations_the Association of Microbiological Diagnostic Manufacturers and the Health Industry Manufacturers Association. A total of 21 letters of comment were received in response to all notices. These comments are on file with the Dockets Management Branch under Docket No. 88D&hyph;0087. The notice of availability of the draft guideline stated that it would be issued under ยง10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)), which provides for the use of guidelines to establish procedures or standards of general applicability that are not legal requirements but that are acceptable to the agency. The agency is now in the process of considering whether to revise ยง10.90(b). Although that decision has not been made, the agency has decided to publish this guideline. However, this notice and the final guideline are not being issued under the authority of ยง10.90(b), and the final guideline, although called a guideline, does not operate to bind FDA or any other person in any way. The agency advises that this final guideline represents its current position on the requirements of the CGMP regulations for in vitro diagnostic products. The guideline may be useful to manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic products. A person may also choose to use alternate procedures even though they are not provided for in the guideline. If a person chooses to depart from the practices and procedures set forth in the final guideline, that person may wish to discuss the matter further with the agency to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable by FDA. This guideline does not bind the agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person. On November 23, 1993 (58 FR 61952), FDA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the medical device CGMP regulations. Any revisions to the CGMP regulations may result in the need for changes to this guideline. Therefore, on issuing a final rule to revise the CGMP regulations, FDA will review the guideline and make any necessary changes. Copies of this final guideline, along with previous drafts and submitted comments, are available for public examination in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Interested persons may submit written comments on the final guideline to the Dockets Management Branch. Additional comments will be considered in determining the future need for amending the final guideline. Two copies of comments should be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Dated: January 4, 1994. Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy.
