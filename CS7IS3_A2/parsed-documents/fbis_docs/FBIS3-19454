This was emphasized by the federal government in its report on the result of the EU negotiations, which was adopted by the Cabinet and passed on to parliament on Wednesday [16 March]. With a special Cabinet meeting in parliament, the federal government has set the course for a referendum on Austrian EU membership. Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Foreign Minister Alois Mock presented the results of the Brussels negotiations to the Cabinet in the form of a report. Moreover, agreement was reached in the coalition on the text of the short constitutional amendment on accession, which will form the basis of the referendum to be held after the relevant resolution is adopted by parliament. As a result of the extra Cabinet meeting, these bills could be tabled in yesterday's parliamentary session, and can, thus, be passed on to the responsible committees. The government report notes that "European integration is and always has primarily been a basis for security policy." This has proved its worth over more than 40 years. Now "Austria also has the chance to join this area of stability and peace and to participate in its shaping." Since the end of the Cold War, the European Community, apart from its traditional economic leadership, has assumed a key role for securing stability in all of Europe. The necessity for efficient foreign and security policy at the level of the Union is becoming more and more obvious. The following is a quote from the introductory paragraph of the government report: "However, the crisis-like developments of the recent period, particularly the nationalist conflicts in East and southeast Europe, and the problems resulting from the change of system in the new democracies also indicate the difficulties regarding the development of a stable European peace system and the enormous dangers for Europe that would result from a failure of these efforts. As a result of its location at the fringe of the European `area of turbulence,' Austria has a vital interest that the EU effectively meets its responsibility for the stability of all of Europe. Membership in the EU would offer Austria the opportunity to voice its specific concerns in the Union's joint policymaking, and, on the basis of equality, to have a say in those decisions that will determine Europe's, and thus also Austria's, future." The federal government emphasizes that only full integration of Austria into the process of European integration can ensure "Austria's comprehensive participation in the economic developments of Europe." The effects of European recession, which have also been felt in Austria, show "the limited possibilities a medium-sized European country has if its wants to fight economic crisis phenomena by itself." Just as economic setbacks, structural disadvantages of competition, and mass unemployment are European phenomena in an era of interdependency, "the countermeasures" must also "be coordinated at this level." In 29 chapters spread over some 80 pages, the government report offers a detailed representation of the results achieved by Austria in the negotiations in Brussels. The draft amendment on accession comprises 16 pages. It is based on the assumption that the membership agreement must be seen as an amendment to the federal Constitution. The amendment should "expressly authorize the conclusion of this treaty, which is why it has to be subject to a referendum under Article 44, Section 3 of the federal Constitutional after it was adopted by parliament." The joint Cabinet statement by the federal chancellor and the foreign minister points out that, "with the exception of Chapters 23 (economic and monetary policy) and 28 (institutions), the EU negotiations have been concluded. These two areas, which primarily deal with overcoming antagonisms within the EU, should be concluded in the very near future. For technical reasons, the editing work for the conclusion of the membership agreement will take some more time." It was expressly stated that the comprehensive report on the membership negotiations was released early, on the one hand to provide detailed information quickly and, on the other, to give parliament the opportunity for detailed discussions against the background of the result achieved in the negotiations. Without yesterday's Cabinet meeting, legislation could not have been introduced in parliament before 6 April. As far as the referendum is concerned there are still two possible days -- 12 or 19 June. After the Cabinet meeting, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said that the day would be determined depending on the preparatory work and the decision by the European Parliament. As an additional document, the Austrian parliament will also receive the report of the European Council of Ministers to the European Parliament. [passage omitted]
