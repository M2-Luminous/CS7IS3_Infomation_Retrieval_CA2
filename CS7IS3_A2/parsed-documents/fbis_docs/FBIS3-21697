More than a kilogram of opium and 800 grams of marijuana were found on them. These traffickers are supposed to have arrived in Lithuania from Kyrgyzstan. [passage omitted] First of all, the police tried to discover the addressee of this shipment in Lithuania. Unfortunately, they managed to learn very little from the detained persons. The latter pretended immediately that they hardly understood Russian. They did not have any personal documents. Currently, the detainees are kept at the Vilnius reception and distribution center where the police are trying to establish their identity. The next day after the detention of the people from the south, employees from the Interior Ministry Division for the Prevention of Illegal Drug Production and Sale carried out several actions in cooperation with the Vilnius police. Another person was detained, and the officials discovered around 600 grams of marijuana and several grams of opium while searching his apartment. Incidentally, according to specialists, the opium found in the man's apartment was definitely produced outside Lithuania--its quality was too high. A policeman's uniform and several masks were also discovered during the search. The man is supposed to be a member of a well-organized gang in Lithuania which engages in drug production and trafficking. The police refused to provide any details until the investigation is completed. While inspecting trains in Kybartai (Vilkaviskis region) last Thursday, customs officers confiscated almost five kilograms of ground poppy heads found on Russian residents V. Gavrilov, O. Popov, and I. Osipova. [passage omitted]
