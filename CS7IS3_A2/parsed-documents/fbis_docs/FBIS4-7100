He is the 80th prime minister, and the 51st person to serve as prime minister. We hope newly appointed Prime Minister Hata will take over the intent of "reform government" pursued by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and will go forward with courage toward fundamental reform of the nation's political, economic, and administrative systems. Upon the launching of the new government, we would like to ask the following two points of Prime Minister Hata. The first is his basic stand on political reform. Mr. Hata is regarded as a relatively clean politician who has pursued the tasks of political reform with passion since he was with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], thus winning himself the nickname of "Mr. Political Reform." We completely agree with his purpose, declaring that if plutocratic corruption cannot be removed, there will be no future for the politics of Japan. We also respect his determination shown in leaving the LDP after concluding that the LDP has no will to carry out political reform, and in deciding to head newly formed Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] to make it a front-runner in the first stage of reorganization of the political world. But there is a problem with what happened after that. What has been done in political reform? To be sure, political reform-related bills have been passed, but they are political reform bills in name only, with loopholes everywhere. While the song of political reform was being sung, huge election campaign funds were spent by political parties in the general election to get new faces elected. Later, the general contractor scandal involving Shinseito General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa surfaced and the suspicion of Prime Minister Hosokawa having used Sagawa Kyubin money was raised, but there has been no leadership mobilized to delve into the facts of these matters. The four characters "sei-ji-rin-ri" [political ethics] in new policy guidelines which the ruling coalition parties had agreed on in establishing the coalition government have disappeared completely. The political history of Mr. Hata, who belonged to the Tanaka faction and then the Takeshita faction, is one that tells he was right in the middle of the LDP's plutocratic politics. He has not yet cleared himself in this regard. When asked about his possible links to plutocratic corruption, Mr. Hata's set answer is "That is why we need to carry out political reform." But what we want to ask politicians is not about what they said in words but what they did in deeds. At least, he is the head of Shinseito, the banner of which is political reform. It is difficult to say he has fulfilled his reponsibilities in all phases of political reform. The second point is his relationship with Mr. Ozawa. Mr. Hata was a key man supporting the Hosokawa government as deputy prime minister and foreign minister. There was the inevitable division of labor between Mr. Ozawa and Mr. Hata--the former being in charge of party affairs and the latter performing official functions. But during the eight months of the Hosokawa administration, there have been so many out-of-the-blue incidents like the proposals on the national welfare tax, the cabinet reshuffle, and formation of an alliance excluding the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger]. In each case, Mr. Hosokawa took the form of being the initiator of action, but actually it was a product of Mr. Ozawa's attempt to manipulate government operations. There is no denying that such high-handed political techniques coming from a dual power structure only speeded up the demise of the Hosokawa government. Even in the new government, Mr. Hata's position is very weak as the party head who should be able to check Mr. Ozawa's operations. Mr. Hata, who himself says "what matters for me is to function as a coordinator," will not be able to function as a controller over his friend and political game player, Mr. Ozawa. And this presents a question on his qualifications as a political leader. It is very likely that the Hata government will turn out to be a Ozawa-run government. In a dual power system, there are many problems because it is unclear who is politically responsible, and it is difficult for the public to understand such a system. Prime Minister Hata should do all he can not to repeat what his predecessor did, and to run the government in a transparant manner, while mainintaing his independence and moderation as the top government executive. It will be only a matter of time before the public decides to abandon him if Prime Minister Hata acts only as an actor in scenarios written by Mr. Ozawa.
