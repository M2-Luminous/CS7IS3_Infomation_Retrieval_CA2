"Washington's stance on the Islamic Republic of Iran is childish, immature, and unripe," Rowhani said in an interview published by the periodical "MAJLES AND RESEARCH". He said "the U.S. is hostile to Iran and it does not make its hostility a secret...our people have always suffered blows and seen violence on the part of the U.S." "The task of determining the basic policies of the country and the system initially rests with the leader (Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i) and he has explicitly reaffirmed that we have no interest in relations with the U.S. and that such relations are detrimental to us," he said. "Not all countries of the world are friends of the U.S. but their tones may differ from ours. They may speak in a diplomatic tone or hide their real intentions. But the Islamic Republic's positions are clear and obvious," the vice-speaker said. He added that despite attempts of enemies to misportray Iran as a country wishing to launch aggression on or intervene in the internal affairs of other countries what has happened over the past few years proved that such rumors were nothing but unfounded and baseless propaganda. The parliamentarian maintained that the Islamic Republic has managed to show its Islamic and human face to the world particularly during the past few years. But, he added, it is natural for a country like Iran which intends to live independently in the Third World and in such a sensitive region as the Middle East to be threatened by its enemies. "Whether wanted or not, the Islamic Republic of Iran is shouldering the leadership of many communities of the world. But Iran's leadership is different from America's domineering leadership... Iran governs hearts of millions of people throughout the world," Rowhani reiterated. Iran has been identified as a powerful and independent country, as a country whose religion and politics, its people and officials are in harmony, a country opposed to aggression, a peace-loving country and a country which is truly loyal to its slogans and causes, he said. The Majles vice-speaker also blasted the U.S.-sponsored new world order and said not only the number of conflicts between countries has increased but also a country is occupied by another country under the so-called new world order.
