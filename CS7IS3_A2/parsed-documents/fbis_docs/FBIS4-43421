Here is Willy Claes: [Begin Claes recording] The question of personalities has never interested us. What interests us most -- and here we have not moved by one millimeter from the line we have been respecting for several years -- is that we should be faced with a government which, first, is ready to respect human rights, and second, has the means to conduct a monetary, budgetary, and economic policy, independent of absolutely everyone, enabling the economic reconstruction of the country to take place, having as its first aim to improve the lot of the Zairean people.
