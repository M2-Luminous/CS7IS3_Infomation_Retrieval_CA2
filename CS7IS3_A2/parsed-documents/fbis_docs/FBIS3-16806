Each of the different panels under the work group has to present by March 31 a report on the predicted changes that may take place in connection with the country's joining the EU, a representative at the Foreign Ministry press office said. The meetings are to estimate whether the predicted changes will be in line with Estonia's current principles and directions of development. Also to be assessed is the volume of work to be done in preparing for the membership, its costs, and how to get experts from different fields involved in the project.
