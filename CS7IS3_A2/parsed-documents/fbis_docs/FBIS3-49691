In the independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY Adam Cerny comments on Clinton's meeting with the presidents of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, saying that "it is a subtle game, in which a most significant question is asked: whether or not a new curtain will be put up in Europe and where if the answer is in the affirmative. NATO is most cautious to avoid anything that could be interpreted so that it is the Alliance which erects and rings it down." In the independent MLADA FRONTA DNES Viliam Buchert writes that one possible interpretation of the problem of NATO membership can be as follows: "After it lost its enemy from `the empire of the evil,' the Alliance is changing substantially and striving to cooperate with Russia rather than to contain it. With regard to Moscow's nuclear potential this is understandable. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe do not often share this view and are thus backing the old NATO. He who will be quicker to comprehend this will have more chances to see his wishes met more quickly. NATO just as its Partnership for Peace is only for partners, not for competitors and rivals," Buchert writes. The farmers' daily ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY says that Clinton's visit has been the most complex venture of Czech diplomacy thus far. "The importance of the visit resides in the fact that it practically ruled out any further speculation about the attitude of the United States and NATO to Central Europe with reference to this or another separate negotiation, opinion or interpretation.... But now the ball is on Visegrad's side of the playground after all." In the right-orientated daily CESKY DENIK Josef Landergott says that "only the Moscow talks of the president will be interesting for the superpower, America. Seen from this point of view his Prague stay is but a visit to the `U Tygra' pub." The trade union daily PRACE says that "Bill Clinton's stay of 24 hours in Prague has revealed that overseas we are still considered a suspected jungle," which is at variance with "the endlessly repeated words that for the West we are the best of all post-communist countries in all aspects." "But if this were so, it is good that Clinton did not visit a capital situated more eastwards," the paper writes and adds that there the security services' agents "would probably take off the domestic journalists' slips."
