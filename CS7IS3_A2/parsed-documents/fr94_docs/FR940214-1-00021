FR940214-1-00021 FR940214-1-00004 (c) Survey and outturn reports. (1) Unless the Program Agreement provides otherwise, CCC shall arrange for an independent cargo surveyor to attend the discharge of the cargo and to report on the quantity and condition of the commodities discharged and the probable cause of any damage. All cargoes provided under an agreement shall be surveyed. If practicable, the examination of the cargo shall be conducted jointly by the surveyor, the consignee, and the ocean carrier, and the survey report shall be signed by all parties. (2) (i) If the Cooperating Sponsor arranges for an independent cargo surveyor, the Cooperating Sponsor shall obtain a certification by a public health official or similar competent authority as to the condition of the commodity in any case where a damaged commodity appears to be unfit for the use authorized in the Program Agreement; and a certificate of disposition in the event the commodity is determined to be unfit for its intended use. Such certificates shall be obtained as soon as possible after discharge of the cargo. The Cooperating Sponsor shall forward any narrative chronology or other commentary it can provide to assist in the adjudication of ocean transportation claims and shall prepare such a narrative in any case where the loss is estimated to be in excess of $5,000.00. The Cooperating Sponsor may, at its option, also engage the independent surveyor to supervise clearance and delivery of the cargo from customs or port areas to the Cooperating Sponsor or its agent and to issue delivery survey reports thereon. (ii) In the event of cargo loss and damage, the Cooperating Sponsor shall provide the names and addresses of individuals who were present at the time of discharge and during survey and who can verify the quantity lost or damaged. For bulk grain shipments, in those cases where the Cooperating Sponsor is responsible for survey and outturn reports, the Cooperating Sponsor shall obtain the services of an independent surveyor to: (A) Observe the discharge of the cargo and report on discharging methods including scale type, calibrations and any other factor which may affect the accuracy of scale weights, and if scales are not used, the reason should be stated and the method of weight determination fully described; (B) Estimate the quantity of cargo, if any, lost during discharge through carrier negligence; (C) Advise on the quality of sweepings; (D) Obtain copies of port or vessel records, if possible, showing quantity discharged; and (E) Provide immediate notification to the Cooperating Sponsor if additional services are necessary to protect cargo interests of if surveyor has reason to believe that the correct quantity was not discharged. In the case of shipments arriving in container vans, Cooperating Sponsors shall require the independent surveyor to list the container van numbers and seal numbers shown on the container vans, and indicate whether the seals were intact at the time the container vans were opened, and whether the container vans were in any way damaged. To the extent possible, the independent surveyor should observe discharge of container vans from the vessel to ascertain whether any damage to the container van occurred and arrange for surveying the contents as soon as possible after opening. (iii) Cooperating Sponsors shall send copies to KCFMO, Chief, Debt Management Office of all reports and documents pertaining to the discharge of commodities. (iv) CCC will reimburse the Cooperating Sponsor for incurred costs upon receipt of the survey report and the surveyor's invoice or other documents that establish the survey cost. CCC shall not reimburse a Cooperating Sponsor for the costs of only a delivery survey, in the absence of a discharge survey, or for any other survey not taken contemporaneously with the discharge of the vessel, unless such deviation is justified to the satisfaction of CCC. (3) Survey contracts shall be let on a competitive bid basis unless CCC determines that the use of competitive bids would not be practicable. CCC may preclude the use of certain surveyors because of conflicts of interest or lack of demonstrated capability to properly carry out surveying responsibilities. (d) Ocean carrier loss and damage. (1) Notwithstanding transfer of title to the Cooperating Sponsor, the CCC shall have the right to file, pursue, and retain the proceeds of collection from claims arising from ocean transportation cargo loss and damage, including loss and damage occurring between the time of transfer of title and loading aboard a vessel. CCC assumes general average contributions and all valid general average incidents which may arise from the movement of commodity to the destination ports. CCC shall receive and retain all allowances in general average. Where the Cooperating Sponsor pays the ocean freight or a portion thereof, it shall be entitled to pro rata reimbursement received from any claims related to ocean freight charged. (2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall: File notice with the ocean carrier immediately upon discovery of any cargo loss or damage, promptly initiate claims against the ocean carriers for such loss and damage, take all necessary action to obtain restitution for losses, and provide CCC copies of all such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cooperating Sponsors need not file a claim when the cargo loss is less than $100, or in any case when the loss is between $100 and $300 and the Cooperating Sponsors determine that the cost of filing and collecting the claim will exceed the amount of the claim. Cooperating Sponsors shall transmit to KCFMO, Chief, Debt Management Office information and documentation on such lost or damaged shipments when no claim is to be filed. When General Average has been declared, Cooperating Sponsors need not file or collect claims for loss of, or damage to, commodities. (3) Amounts collected by Cooperating Sponsors on claims against ocean carriers which are less than $200 may be retained by the Cooperating Sponsor. On claims involving loss of damage of $200 or more the Cooperating Sponsors may retain from collections received by them, either $200 plus 10 percent of the difference between $200 and the total amount collected on the claim, up to a maximum of $500; or the actual administrative expenses incurred in collection of the claim, provided retention of such administrative expenses is approved by CCC. Allowable collection costs shall not to include attorneys fees, fees of collection agencies, and similar costs. In no event will CCC pay collection costs in excess of the amount collected on the claim. (4) The Cooperating Sponsors also may retain from claim recoveries remaining after allowable deductions for administrative expenses of collection, the amount of any special charges, such as handling and packing costs, which the Cooperating Sponsor has incurred on the lost or damaged commodity and which are included in the claims and paid by the liable party.
