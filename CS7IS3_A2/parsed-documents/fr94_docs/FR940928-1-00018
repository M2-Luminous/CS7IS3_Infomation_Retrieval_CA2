FR940928-1-00018 FR940928-1-00003 On April 13, 1994, EPA found the 1990 base year inventory submission incomplete for lack of adequate public notice and adoption. Instead of adopting the November 12, 1992 and November 18, 1993 base year inventories as submitted by CARB, the BAAQMD held a public hearing on a revised 1990 base year inventory on July 29, 1994 which was the attainment inventory submitted as part of the maintenance plan. The State requested parallel processing of this revised emissions inventory to fulfill section 182(a)(1). Based on the State's parallel processing request and submission of associated documentation, EPA rescinded the finding of incompleteness in an EPA letter dated August 25, 1994 to CARB (Howekamp, EPA to Boyd, CARB). Following is a table of the revised average peak ozone season weekday VOC and NO x emissions for the biogenic and major anthropogenic source categories for 1990 (the attainment year inventory, 1995, 2000, and 2005.
