Whether the Free Democrats will take part in the next government, should they be invited to do so, will be decided by a delegates' assembly behind closed doors on Sunday [5 June], he said. In the parliamentary elections which ended May 29, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) won 54.15 percent of the mandates and the runner-up SZDSZ 18.14 percent. The Free Democrats conceive the operation of a coalition cabinet in such a way that the parties supporting the government have veto power regarding the choice of ministers and other politicial office-holders whose appointment falls under the prime minister's competence, Peto said. The Free Democrats press for changes in the mechanism of legislation. In their view, the government should involve all parliamentary parties, including the opposition, in the drafting of bills. The SZDSZ seeks to specify strict incompatibility rules for deputies, and reduce the extra allowances due to members of government, the chairman said. The Free Democrats have repeatedly declared that the coalition government should be balanced rather than reflect the parties' power relations in parliament, Peto said, adding that the key ministerial posts should be distributed between the coalition parties accordingly. Personal guarantees are also required for the implementation of the coalition's common program, Peto said. "This is not yet a coalition offer, only a piece of `fiction'," he added. Peto also said that this week he would hold an informal consultation with MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn, the date of which has not yet been set.
