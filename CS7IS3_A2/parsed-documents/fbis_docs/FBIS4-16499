The picketers -- who came armed with the slogans "Serbian brothers, our hearts are with you," "Yankee go home; Serbian soil will burn under your feet," and "Belarusians demand punishment for killing our brothers in Yugoslavia" -- burned a symbolic U.S. flag and passed a statement to embassy officials addressed to the U.S. President and American people, which reads: "We are filled with indignation over the barbaric U.S. bombardment of civilian targets in Yugoslavia. With great anxiety over the fate of the world, we protest against this inhuman policy. All attempts on the part of Belarusian society to prevent this insane step have been left unanswered by the U.S. administration, which does not want to listen to the voice of reason. The Slavic world will not leave this act of vandalism unanswered. ``The war in Yugoslavia has testified to the entire world that the freedom-loving Serbian people are unvanquished, and that military intervention will only lead to the outbreak of a new world war... Stop before it is too late!'' "This quite unlawful action," Nikolay Sergeyev, cochairman of the Slav Assembly Duma, told a VECHERNIY MINSK correspondent, "testifies to the fact that the United States is assuming more and more the role of the world's gendarme with the right to intervene in the affairs of sovereign states and people, if, from the [U.S.] point of view, the behavior of those people does not comply with the [U.S.] aspirations to introduce `a new world order.' Unfortunately, the United Nations is turning into an assistant of these hegemonic aspirations of the United States. "Furthermore, we believe that the Republic of Belarus should establish diplomatic relations with the Federative Republic of Yugoslavia in the near future, and render feasible assistance to the Serbian people in their just fight against the so-called forces of the world community. "We draw the attention of the Supreme Soviet and Belarusian Government to the ever growing NATO threat to the national interests of our country, and we believe that Belarus should by no means join the NATO-projected Partnership for Peace..." The Belarusian Committee of Solidarity with Serbs and Montenegrins has also condemned the pillage of the U.S. military in Yugoslavia.
