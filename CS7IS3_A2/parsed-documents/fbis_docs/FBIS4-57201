This new trend will also create a real possibility for Bolivia to obtain a sea outlet through dialogue. This is the opinion of International Relations Secretary General Jaime Aparicio, in referring to the proposal made by Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, on the need to solve border problems in the region. During a speech at the U.S. Congress on 5 May, Watson announced that one of his goals will be "to seek opportunities for dialogue to allow the United States to contribute to the solution of border problems in Latin America." According to Jorge Crespo, former ambassador to the United States, the situation could be used by the Foreign Ministry to draw up a new strategy, for presentation at the next OAS meeting, for recovering Bolivia's sea outlet.
