The Zorraquin group, centered in the petrochemical industry, is unable to escape the effects of the free fall of international prices and the invasion by imported products. In order to stay afloat, it has put Saiar, the leader in the production of heating tanks, and the jewel of its holding operations, up for sale. Philco, the enterprise headed by Jorge Blanco Villegas, the president of the UIA [Argentine Industrial Union], represents the other side of this coin. It is enjoying the delights of a purchasing rate of electrical domestic appliances that continues to rise. And it has just bought Peabody in order to enter the freezer market, an area from which it had been absent. The Garovaglio-Zorraquin [G & Z] business group, which owns the Ipako and Polisur petrochemical firms, is looking for ways to eliminate ballast in order to stay afloat in the financial crisis threatening to submerge it. The most effective method it has found has been to eliminate some of its assets. It has left some fields and ceased its participation in various undertakings. What it has not yet succeeded in doing is to gain control of a debt that totals about $150 million. Now it has tacked the "For Sale" sign on the door of another of the firms it controls--the Saiar metallurgical company. This firm is the leader in the thermotank and heating-system market. It holds the license for the U.S. Rheem brand, and as a result it invoiced a total of more than 60 million pesos in 1992. Its production activities are distributed between two plants. The first is located in Quilmes, in Greater Buenos Aires. Although it is called the Iguazu plant, the other is in San Luis, where it was built in the heat of the industrial upsurge. Although Saiar was only put up for sale a very short time ago, there has already been one principal interested party--the owners of the Rheem trademark. But the talks with the North Americans soon reached an impasse. The other buyer negotiating at the present time is the Chilean Compania Tecno Industrial [Technoindustrial Company], the leader in the electrical domestic appliance market on the other side of the mountain range. It has been learned that this company wants to establish itself in Argentina, using Saiar as its base for MERCOSUR [Common Market of the South] operations. The Chileans are talking with Associated Merchant Bankers (MBA), the firm managed by the Reynal brothers, which represents Salomon Brothers in Argentina. It happened that MBA, which provides financial advice to G & Z, planned the entire Saiar sales operation. It is managing the negotiations with the Bank Club with a view to its financing of the debts of the group. Changes Planned Ipako, the leading G & Z firm, has for several months been undergoing a drastic adaptation plan. Federico Zorraquin, Jr., remained to head the internal reorganization after the entire top management of the firm was removed. Strictly speaking, the reorganization of this group began earlier. One of the first decisions made was to sell for $8 million its share (50 percent) of Aluplata, a joint undertaking with the Crown firm in the United States for the manufacture of lightweight aluminum beverage containers. Other steps in the same direction included the sale of four floors of the main building to the Perez Company, deactivation of the operations of the Cerro Castillo [Castle Hill] mining company, and the sale of some rural properties. Zorraquin's hope of preventing the enterprise from sinking hinges on the negotiations with the Bank Club. According to spokesmen for the enterprise, an agreement is very close to being reached. They do not exclude the possibility that this may happen before the end of this month. They say that this agreement would be possible if a contract for supplying ethylene to the petrochemical plants could be agreed upon first. The Zorraquin people want a price lower than Bahia Blanca Petrochemicals (PBB), a mixed enterprise, is obtaining for this raw material at present. "It would mean our doom if the agreement were to fall through," a spokesman for the group said. If this were to happen, according to the enterprise, the group would suffer from another drain in addition to that resulting from the financial suit against them that was won recently by the PBB requiring that Ipako pay off a debt of $30 million. The directors of Ipako are confident. They believe they will be able to survive based on the plan for further adjustment and refinancing of their debts. However, they immediately add that they have no control over the development of international prices (now at their lowest point) or the harsh competition provided by the petrochemical firms in Brazil, which have invaded Argentine territory with the lowest prices in history.
