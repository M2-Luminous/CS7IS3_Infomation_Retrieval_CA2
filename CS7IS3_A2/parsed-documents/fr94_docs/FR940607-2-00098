FR940607-2-00098 FR940607-2-00065 [Release No. 34&hyph;34135; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;17] Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change To Amend Exchange Rule 96 to Permit Floor Professionals Who Have a Listed Option Position in a Stock To Initiate an On-Floor Proprietary Trade in That Stock May 31, 1994. On March 15, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (''SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend Exchange Rule 96 to permit NYSE Floor professionals who have a listed option position in a stock to initiate an on-Floor proprietary trade in that stock. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33642 (February 18, 1994), 59 FR 9506 (February 28, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change. Exchange Rule 96 currently prohibits a member registered as a Competitive Trader 3 or Registered Competitive Market Maker (``RCMM'') 4 from initiating, while on the Floor of the Exchange, the purchase or sale, for his own account or his member organization's account, of any stock in which he has an option position or in which he knows that his member organization has an option position. Competitive Traders and RCMMs are not subject to any direct limitation on their trading of options; however, once an NYSE Floor professional acquires an option position, he must effect subsequent proprietary transactions in the underlying stock pursuant to an off-Floor order. 5 At present, Rule 96 applies to all options, including those traded on a national securities exchange (``listed options'') and those traded over-the-counter (``OTC options''). 6 3 A Competitive Trader is an NYSE member who is authorized to initiate proprietary transactions on the Floor of the Exchange but who is not registered as a specialist, odd-lot dealer or Registered Competitive Market Maker. See NYSE rules 111 & 112(e). Competitive Traders exist pursuant to, and must comply with the requirements of, Section 11(a)(1)(G) of the Act. See also SEC Rule 11a1&hyph;1(T). In addition, the NYSE requires that 75 percent of a Competitive Trader's monthly transactions must be stabilizing transactions under the tick-test. See NYSE Rule 112(d). 4 A RCMM is an NYSE member who is authorized to initiate proprietary transactions on the Floor of the Exchange. See NYSE Rule 107. See also SEC Rule 11a1&hyph;5. RCMMs are not subject to the same tick-test as Competitive Traders; however, they must comply with a complex series of rules about the price at which they can trade and the size of those trades. See NYSE Rule 107. Unlike Competitive Traders, RCMMs have an affirmative obligation to maintain a fair and orderly market. See NYSE Rule 107(B)(4). 5 The terms ``on-Floor'' and ``off-Floor'' are defined in NYSE Rule 112.20. 6 As used herein, the term ``OTC option'' means ``conventional option.'' Art. III, Rule 33(gg) of the National Association of Securities Dealers' Rules of Fair Practice defines a conventional option as any option contract not issued, or subject to issuance, by the Options Clearing Corporation. The NYSE proposes to remove the prohibition in Rule 96 as to listed options. As a result, a Competitive Trader or RCMM with a listed option position in a stock will be permitted to initiate an on-Floor proprietary trade in that stock. In contrast, an NYSE Floor professional with an OTC option position in the same stock will continue to be subject to Rule 96's restrictions. The Exchange states that the statutory bases for the proposed rule change are Sections 6(b)(5), 6(b)(8) and 11A(a)(1)(c)(ii) of the Act. According to the NYSE, by removing the prohibition on Competitive Traders and RCMMs initiating proprietary transactions on the Floor in a stock where they have a listed option position in such stock, and thereby permitting such members to add to the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market in situations where they may not currently do so, the proposed rule change will have the effect of ``facilitating transactions in securities'' and will ``perfect the mechanism of a free and open market,'' as called for in Section 6(b)(5).
