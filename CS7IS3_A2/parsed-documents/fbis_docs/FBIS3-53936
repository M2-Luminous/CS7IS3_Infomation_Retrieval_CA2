Mir, Afghan charge d'affaires in Paris and minister counsellor: "The Battle for Kabul"] [Text] The battle for Kabul which is now being fought is no longer a simple manifestation of struggles among ethnic groups or factions: Instead it is an attempt to seize power by Babrak Karmal's former Communists and Golboddin Hekmatyar's extremists openly supported by Iran, Arab terrorists, and extreme nationalist circles in Moscow opposed to President Yeltsin. Why this alliance of extremes and against whom is it really directed? The coalition which wants to overthrow President Rabbani brings together the losers of the end of the Cold War, former Communists and fanatics who have taken up the torch of the "anti-imperialist" struggle. This coalition is in step with the alliance of extreme nationalists and Communists which is developing in Russia. Today these extremists, convinced of the insurmountable opposition among cultures, tend to smile on Islamic radicalism in the Muslim world. What is also new is Iran's direct intervention in Afghan affairs. Util now it was Pakistan, supported by private Saudi networks, which had tried to impose its favorite in Kabul and we condemned it for that. But Pakistani policy has now changed; similarly, the Saudi Government has made a clear break with the extremists. Unfortunately, these positive gestures did not mark the end of foreign interference: Iran openly supports General Dostam, former head of the Communist militia, and Golboddin Hekmatyar, head of Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], who have been shelling Kabul for 18 months, and Babrak Karmal who was placed in power by the 1979 Soviet invasion. Why? But why are the Iranians and the former Communists interested in Afghanistan? Do they want to turn it into a base for action against the moderate Muslim countries and Western interests in the world? The armed extremists of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], who are perpetrating one outrage after another in Algeria, were trained in Hekmatyar's camps; it is from these same camps that the armed groups now active in Azerbaijan come. It was immediately after President Rabbani's visit to Egypt that the decision to attempt a coup d'etat against him was made. The president was launching a rapprochement with the moderate Muslim countries and trying to build a stable, neutral, and moderate Afghanistan. After 15 years of jihad against the Communists, we do not need to prove our Muslim loyalty and we think that dialogue can be established between the Muslim world and the West: We are being made to pay for it. Today, the defense forces under the command of Ahmad Shah Masud are the last bastion of peace in a tolerant Afghanistan. Many commanders from different ethnic groups have mobilized their troops to defend the state. So far the Wahdat Shi'ites have refused to bow to Iran's orders urging them to join the conflict. A victory by the Communist-Islamic coalition would make Afghanistan an inviolable base for world terrorism, because who would envisage action against Kabul? That would enable Iran to pursue its policy of destabilization using others as intermediaries. The United States, which supported Hekmatyar until the last minute, is now losing interest in Afghanistan. But the specter of the Cold War is still there with its procession of dead and injured, and its destruction amid the snow and cold. We urge the European countries to condemn the attempted coup d'etat in Kabul before it is too late.
