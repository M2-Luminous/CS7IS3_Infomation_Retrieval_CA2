Viktor Stepanovich himself allegedly agrees with this formulation. And that is obviously what explains Chernomyrdin's unexpected departure to Germany, where he underwent investigation and a course of treatment for a kidney stone illness. According to unofficial reports, last Monday Boris Yeltsin had already had a meeting with Yuriy Skokov as a result of which only Boris Yeltsin's signature is lacking to the necessary draft presidential edicts. Yuriy Skokov is now public chairman of the federation of Russian commodity producers and entrepreneurs and before that he held the post of Security Council secretary, and since October 1992 has engaged in earnest in the affairs of the regions, where he has acquired considerable popularity. Yuriy Skokov tries not to expatiate on his political activity, calling himself a "politically homeless person." His recent contacts have included those with people from the entourage of Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and leaders of the "New Regional Policy" deputies' group. In addition, Yuriy Skokov did not sign the "Social Accord Treaty," which put him on a par with Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov and Agrarian Party leader Mikhail Lapshin. So far we can only guess whether Boris Yeltsin will appoint Skokov as acting head of the cabinet or will try to submit his candidacy to the Federal Assembly for approval as a full prime minister. In the opinion of a number of experts, the decision to appoint Yuriy Skokov was prompted by the fact that the Russian parliament is ceasing to be controlled by the president. A parliamentary majority has not been successfully formed on the basis of the democratic parties in the State Duma. The Federation Council has also proved disobedient. That was shown by the situation involving the approval of Aleksandr Ilyushenko for the post of general prosecutor. Therefore, experts believe, it is most likely that Yuriy Skokov, in exchange for his appointment as head of government, has promised Boris Yeltsin to ensure the passage of presidential draft edicts in the State Duma. If you consider that Skokov recently signed an agreement on cooperation with the State Duma "New Regional Policy" deputies' group, which includes 65 deputies, he will obviously be able to fulfill that promise.
