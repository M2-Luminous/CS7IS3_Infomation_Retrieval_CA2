While half of the group was listening to Mrs. Ciller inside, the other half was nervously smoking outside in the lobby, as if they were trying to get rid of the blues in a prison yard. The reason for the blues is obvious: The intraparty opposition is proving incapable of getting rid of Ciller, and no solution is coming from Cankaya, the presidential mansion which has been turned into a wailing wall. Recently, scenarios on the establishment of a new government became prevalent once again as the news spread that Papa [Demirel] had "pulled out all the stops" to get rid of Ciller. At yesterday's group meeting, however, Mrs. Ciller challenged the opposition within the party by criticizing the 49th government and praising the success of the 50th. She finished her speech amid applause. This put off the expectation of a coalition without Ciller until after the Bayram holiday. In fact, why do those who sweat up and down the road to Cankaya not opt for an easier way? Would it not be better if Papa came down instead of them going up? Since Demirel is complaining that the country is not being run well, he can, in an Ozal-like move, leave the Cankaya mansion and assume the TPP leadership. In this way, the deputies who stealthily go to Cankaya at night to get rid of Ciller will relax, and Demirel will be able to resume running the country from where he left off. We do not know if Tansu Ciller is also thinking of such solutions, but it was noteworthy that in a defiant tone, the prime minister listed the victories of the 50th government in every field -- from banking to terrorism, from foreign policy to the economy -- and blamed the previous governments, including the 49th, for not having done what had to be done. She also tried to push Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz to the wall by recalling his preelection promise that in a TPP-ANAP coalition, the leader of the second party would withdraw. It is obvious that the TPP is drawing up plans to cause cracks within the ANAP. There is no doubt, however, that divisions within the TPP are also being planned. Various wings within the party expect that motions for an investigation with regard to the banks will put the Ciller family in a difficult position. (When the deputies criticized Ozer Ciller for the first time at the group meeting yesterday, the prime minister was forced to defend her husband. Deputies who complained that Mr. Ciller was interfering suggested that the prime minister make him a minister.) On the other hand, it is being suggested that promises of ministerial posts will reduce the speed at which dissent is spreading within the group. The same assessment can be made with regard to the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP]. The lionhearted Social Democrats are continuing to receive blow after blow. Ankara Security Director Orhan Tasanlar, who was suspended after Ankara Deputy Salman Kaya was horribly beaten up by the police on May Day, has been allowed to return to his post. On the same day, the SDPP received another unexpected blow from its partner, the TPP: Neither of the two SDPP candidates were elected for membership on the Radio and Television Council. The Left was left out. What is as interesting as the TPP's moves is the attitude of the SDPP and the Republican People's Party -- an attitude far removed from solidarity. These parties cannot even unite on candidates representing the same views at a vote in the Assembly. How can they cooperate in municipal elections that have been canceled and will be held again? Forget it! The SDPP carries less weight within the coalition with each passing day, and it cannot even establish coordination among the party group, cabinet, and party headquarters because of certain people who are expecting ministerial posts. For example, Fikri Saglar, who was made SDPP secretary general, insists on the Culture Ministry (he was offered a state ministry). This insistence is making artists in various fields nervous. Ministry officials allege that Saglar's family members are running it. The fact that Karayalcin has not been using his "initiative" in the cabinet since he became party leader and his repeated postponement of an expected reshuffle are escalating tension within the SDPP group. It is being said that Saglar has started preparing for the leadership at the next party congress. Everything will become clear on 5 July, three months after the economic package was presented in early April; including the future of the SDPP.
