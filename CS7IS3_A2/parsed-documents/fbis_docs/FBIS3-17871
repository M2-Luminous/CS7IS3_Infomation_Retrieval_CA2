Association President G. Babravicius explained his claims to the government and requested the lawmakers' intercession. Leaders of radio and television stations are not content with the fact that the Seimas has deprived the electronic mass media of the right to privatize the facilities they have leased thus far. They also stated that the government resolution on licensing telecommunication activities runs counter to the law on enterprises. "The government's actions violate the Constitution which states that the mass media cannot be monopolized," said Radio Center leader R. Pleikys. Independent radio and television stations are also dissatisfied with the ban on air commercials on holidays and memorial days -- such a flaw is incorporated in the draft law on the mass media. "The conflict between independent radio and television stations and the government is almost free of a political tinge," claimed Association President G. Babravicius. However, the representatives of the opposition firmly diverted the conversation to political issues. According to G. Vagnorius, chairman of the Homeland Union Executive Council, "one must often look for political motives behind economic difficulties as well." Seimas deputies proposed that a decision should be adopted on whether to apply political or technical measures. Journalists maintained, however, that the press, which is seeking the status of a fourth power, will never find a common language with the first two. "We have no illusions that a change in the parties in power will entail a change in their attitude toward the mass media. First of all, we need a compilation of rules," stated the representatives of radio and television looking for an intercession.
