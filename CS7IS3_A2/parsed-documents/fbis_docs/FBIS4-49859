We should further deepen rural reform according to the general objectives of establishing a socialist market economic structure. Since the experimental areas for rural reform were designated in 1987, tremendous achievements have been made in institutionalizing and standardizing the results of rural reform and in exploring some major issues in this regard. Wen Jiabao said: After the Third Plenary Session of the party's 11th Central Committee, rural areas took the lead in carrying out reform, scoring achievements attracting world attention. Reform effectively promoted the development of agriculture and the rural economy, bringing about historic changes in the countryside. At the same time, this also laid a foundation for the reform of the national economy as a whole. As the national economy is making the transition to a socialist market economy, new requirements are set for deepening rural reform. This calls for us to continue our arduous exploration in this regard. Compared with the past, the rural reform at the present stage has the following new features: 1) Rural reform touches more and more on deep-seated problems; 2) rural reform interweaves more and more with urban reform. This requires us to be more careful in making plans, choosing times, and determining the pace of reform. In deepening rural reform, we should not only define our objectives and tasks but also pay close attention to methods. We have gained a lot of experiences in rural reform over the past decade and more, which we should carry forward and develop. Wen Jiabao pointed out: Our rural areas are in a transforming stage from the current level of sufficient food and clothing to a better-off level of moderate prosperity and from traditional to modern agriculture. The development of agriculture and the rural economy is now faced with two extremely arduous tasks: 1) It is necessary to ensure the adequate supply of farm products; and 2) it is necessary to ensure the steady increase of peasants' incomes. To achieve these two objectives, we must uphold and deepen rural reform according to the general plan and requirements for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. The current major tasks in deepening rural reform are: First, while stabilizing the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, we should promote the rational flow of production factors and the optimum distribution of rural economic resources. Second, we should vigorously develop professional market intermediate organizations and connect rural household production and management with the market in various ways. Third, we should strengthen the government's macroeconomic regulation and control over agriculture and effectively support and protect agriculture. Wen Jiabao stressed: In the course of developing a socialist market economy in the countryside, we should strengthen the building of basic-level rural organizations and the development of a spiritual civilization and the legal system. We should "grasp two links at the same time and pay equal attention to both" and develop a material and a spiritual civilization simultaneously. This is something we should not overlook in doing research on rural reform and development. He called on comrades who are engaged in rural work and research on rural policy to strengthen their spirit and confidence and to make a fresh contribution to rural reform and development.
