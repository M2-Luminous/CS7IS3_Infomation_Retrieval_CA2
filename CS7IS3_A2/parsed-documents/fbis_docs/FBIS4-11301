Garcia] [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- Most of the emigrants invited to the Nation and the Emigrants Conference that begins here tomorrow agree on the need not only to normalize ties with their country of origin, but also to systematize them. For journalist Nicolas Rios, director of the Miami-based CONTRAPUNTO magazine, this meeting attended exclusively by Cubans "must contribute to helping us overcome the artificial separation originated years ago between those who left and those who stayed." According to Rios, at this moment there are conditions for a "reunion" because, among other things, there is the intention on both sides to institutionalize this relationship and make it last. The historical confrontation between Cuba and the United States has always affected Cuba's relations with its emigrants, but we must overcome this factor, because by doing so, in the long run, we ourselves will influence those ties, Rios added in an interview with PRENSA LATINA. Amalio Fiallo, president of the Venezuela-based Center for the Promotion of Man, commented the single fact of being able to talk and to talk without intermediaries represents a step forward. He added, however, that within a timeframe of just three days (the duration of the conference), it will be difficult to discuss everything as we should. According to Fiallo, the meeting is also possible because the Cuban community abroad has changed. He added that today "we are not all alike, nor do we think the same, although there is a minority who controls the media and continues to work for the government in Washington." Fiallo contended that the meeting is only the beginning of a process to normalize ties, and it must not be left incomplete because "as part of a single people" we must think about what all Cubans are doing today to strengthen the nation. Fiallo, who said he is attending the meeting on his own behalf and not representing any group, stressed that any topic is open to discussion because, despite differences of opinions, there is on both sides an atmosphere of respect and a lack of hostility. Fiallo, who has recently come to Cuba to explain his plan for participative democracy, stated the government knows what he thinks and has never asked or suggested that he "burn what you have written, renounce your past, or kneel down at the Plaza de la Revolucion and proclaim that you were wrong." Meanwhile, Francisco Aruca, director of Miami-based Progreso Alternativa radio station, also told PRENSA LATINA that the conference is the first step toward preparing a coherent policy with regard to Cubans living abroad, and particularly those living in the United States. Aruca said an important achievement of this meeting could be the creation of a department responsible for dealing with the affairs of the community. According to Aruca, Cuban residents in other countries have a wide variety of aspirations, including the possibility of investing on equal footing as foreigners. Nevertheless, such goals, as well as others, cannot be achieved because of restrictions of the North American blockade. Juan Manuel Rodriguez, a participant in the 1978 dialogue and a former member of the Revolutionary Army, said he will attend the meeting to address the needs of emigrants in the areas of economics and culture, but not to discuss Cuba's domestic problems because "these must be resolved by those who are here." More than 200 Cubans personally invited by the government of the island will participate in the Nation and the Emigrants Conference that begins tomorrow and runs until Sunday. The participants have expressed their differences with the social system that exists in the Caribbean nation, but at the same time they agree in their opposition to the blockade that has been imposed for more than 30 years against Cuba.
