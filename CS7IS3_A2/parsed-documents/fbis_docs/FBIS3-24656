According to Thoma, Germany's high labor costs combined with its short working hours and production times increase prices for German goods and create a "serious handicap" in international competition. Although some other industrial countries have higher wage rates, generous benefits make Germany's overall labor compensation the highest in the world at 42 German marks (DM) per hour in 1992. The corresponding figures for Japan and the United States are DM30 and DM24.80, respectively. At the same time, Thoma points out, working hours in Germany have been shortened more rapidly in recent years than in other countries. Between 1980 and 1992, he notes, manufacturing working hours in Germany dropped by 11.9 percent. In Japan, they decreased by 7.1 percent and in the United States they actually increased by 2.6 percent. Germany also finished last among industrial countries in machine running times, with machines operating for just 53 hours per week, compared to 77 hours in Belgium, the European leader in this category. This is in turn reflected in Germany's lagging productivity, which grew just 38 percent from 1980 to 1992, compared with 53 percent in the U.S. and 60 percent in Japan. Thoma also cites lagging innovation as a factor in Germany's loss of competitiveness. Companies, he argues, have failed to develop new products and improve old ones to help compensate for increasing costs. In the field of information technology, for example, German companies have had some success in producing individual products but have failed to respond to the demand for entire systems. In biotechnology, the situation is even more stark: as of late 1993, just six licensed biotechnology production facilities were operating in Germany, compared to 120 in Japan and 300 in the United States. Thoma also cites statistics from the German Patent Office showing Germany trailing both Japan and the United States in patent applications in the fields of vehicle technology, medicine, main frame computers, entertainment electronics, microelectronics, biotechnology, office technology, lasers, and aerospace. Information on the bureaucratic barriers to German competitiveness could "fill volumes," writes Thoma. In 1987, for example, the Bayer company decided to launch production of a new blood-clotting agent in the United States rather than in Germany, because of the difference in the time required for government approval of the new product. U.S. authorities approved production after less than 10 months; approval time in Germany could not even be predicted. Similarly, BMW had to wait five years for approval to construct a building in Munich, while an 11-story building in an earthquake-prone area of Tokyo was approved in just six weeks. Thoma cites high taxes as yet another hindrance to German competitiveness, remarking that the country's 44.06 percent tax rate was among the highest in the world and that experts expected the rate to climb further to 48.69 percent by 1996. The figures for the United States and Japan are expected to reach 30.7 percent and 29.3 percent, respectively, by that date. Thoma concludes that, while the problems he has described are the most important obstacles to Germany's competitiveness as an industrial location, there are other, less tangible "atmospheric" or psychological" weaknesses. These, he argues, include a negative attitude toward technology and a work ethic which is "no longer as positive" as it was during the early postwar years. (RoH) (Munich SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG in German 25 Jan 94 p 8) France: Interest Rate Debate Heats Up Laurence Ville, chief economic editor for the Paris financial biweekly L'EXPANSION, contends that the debate over French interest rate levels is heating up despite the fact that there "seems to be the notion" that expressing opposition to current government monetary policy is "taboo." Ville claims that although the French Government policy of setting interest rates on a par with Germany's to maintain the value of the franc--called a "strong franc" policy- -is well entrenched, the circumstances that justified it have changed with business activity stagnating, recovery not yet in sight, and the growing fear of real deflation. Among those who have spoken out against continuing this policy is former National Institute for Statistics and Economic Research (INSEE) Director Edmond Malinvaud, who has published a paper called "Ambition for a European Initiative" in which he recommends lowering interest rates in face of mounting unemployment. Malinvaud counsels French authorities unilaterally to lower French interest rates if the Bundesbank continues to be "obstinate" and refuses to lower German rates. The document is signed by several prestigious European economists, including France's current INSEE Director Paul Champsau, French Observatory for Economic Conditions (OFCE) President Jean- Paul Fitoussi, and National Bank of Paris (BNP) Economic Research Director Jean-Michel Charpin. Ville predicts the government's monetary policy will become increasingly controversial. He cites as evidence the Bank of France calling on Patrick Artus, director of the economic studies at the Caisse des Depots, to "explain himself" after publishing an article in the Paris daily LE FIGARO which was judged by unnamed top government officials as "a bit ambiguous" about the advantages and risks of changing monetary policy. Additionally, Ville claims, the debate will likely "take a new turn" since the Bank of France (BOF) recently acquired independence and has replaced the government in setting monetary policy. Although BOF Governor Jean-Claude Trichet is a partisan of the strong franc policy, a growing number of economists do not support his position and are now arguing that: * A deep recession and a strong increase in unemployment call for a change of monetary policy priorities. French authorities should take advantage of more flexible fluctuation bands within the European Monetary System (EMS). * European Monetary Union (EMU) would not necessarily be threatened by allowing the franc to float more freely. Exchange rate stability is not an obligatory condition during the second phase of EMU. According to Institute of International Relations (IRI) economist Pierre Jacquet, it is "unlikely that the EU will return to narrow fluctuation bands before the final phase of EMU. Floating the franc or other currencies until then does not imply we reject the objective of a single currency." * Maintaining the current level of real interest rates represents a considerable obstacle to recovery. "The problem is not so much the date of the recovery...as its strength," according to Anton Brender, the director of economic studies at the Parisian Rediscount Company. He adds, "A lowering of the interest rates is indispensable if one wants to achieve sustained growth sufficient to create jobs." * Gradually reducing interest rates as the French Government advocates is "insufficient." A "clear signal" is needed for household and business spending to increase. Philippe Sigogne, director of analysis for OFCE, concludes market expectations must be reversed to persuade consumers that rates have bottomed out, which can only be done by lowering short-term rates "significantly and in one blow" so that they are sharply below long-term rates. Ville adds that for a good number of economists, this is indispensable for recovery. * The risks of lowering interest rates are limited. Jacquet notes that while he wants to keep a strong currency, he believes current policy is based on a "mistaken definition" of how a strong currency is maintained. In Jacquet's view, a strong currency is based on the domestic stability of prices and of buying power and not on a reference to an exchange rate. * With a marked reduction in short-term interest rates, any depreciation in the franc would be limited and temporary. The market would welcome such an initiative if it is "timely." Additionally, the German mark will be affected adversely by its own economic problems. * The risk is greater in doing nothing because of the deep recession. Brender contends, "The market knows that an interest rate reduction is vital if France wants to improve unemployment but also reduce the public debt." * France may have to accept temporary depreciation to assure long term currency strength and economic health. Ville concludes that if the status quo is maintained, a new wave of currency speculation and financial upheavals are possible in the next few months." He reasons that it is better to take the step now rather than to be compelled to do so later by financial crisis.

Acknowledging Germany's complaints about being the largest contributor to the EU budget and its desire to end EU rebates to Britain, Lamassoure pointed out that Germany is the country which has benefited the most from membership in the EU, both commercially and politically. He observed, "France pays for 27 percent of the (British) rebate when it only represents 20 percent of the Community wealth, while Germany only pays 22.5 percent of the rebate while having 30 percent of Community wealth."

The study attributed the decline in part to the Japanese recession but also noted that the EU had "generally become much too expensive" for most Japanese companies. The DIHKJ also pointed out that the EU's share of Japan's foreign investments had declined relative to the U.S. and Asian shares, and now represented barely one fifth of the $34.14 billion total. (RoH) (Munich SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG in German 18 Jan 94 p 21) FINLAND UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HITS NEW REC0RD HIGH--The Labor Ministry reported that the jobless rate rose to another high in December, 21.8 percent. According to an article in the 18 January edition of HELSINGIN SAN0MAT, this meant that 537,000 Finns were without jobs at the end of December, up from around 500,000 at the end of November. While traditional temporary furloughs between Christmas and New Year's account for part of this rise, Labor Minister Ilka Kanerva admitted surprise at the steepness of the increase. Since the report for the preceding month had showed a slight decline, and because GDP growth surged to 8 percent for most of 1993, most economists had predicted a further decline in unemployment for December. Especially troublesome was the worsening unemployment situation for youth (ages 16-25). In December over 100,000 persons in this age group were jobless and the situation for the 25- to 30- year old group was not much better. These latest figures on youth unemployment were the subject of an editorial in HELSINGIN SANOMAT on 22 January. The editorial expressed concern that so many graduates of colleges and vocational schools were finding it impossible to enter their chosen fields and that a recent survey had found that over a third of the unemployed youth were so discouraged that they had stopped job hunting and were not interested in further education or training. Those in the 25- to 30-year old group with degrees or diplomas in such diverse fields as business, engineering, waiting tables, and teaching "were even more discouraged than the 16-25 year olds." In addition, the proportion of the long-term unemployed continued to increase. Those without jobs for over 12 months amounted to a little over 50,000 in December 1992; by December 1993 the number had more than doubled to over 120,000. Geographically, the worst off county was Kainuu, where the forest industry suffered from falling exports, according to an article in the 22 January HELSINGIN SANOMAT. It had a registered unemployment of 29 percent, followed by Lappland with 28 percent. As throughout Finland's three-year slump, women had a lower jobless rate than men: 20 percent compared to 24 percent. This is largely explained by the fact that such male-dominated sectors as forestry, metals, and chemicals suffered more job losses than government and services.

FRANCE PRIVATIZATIONS COST STATE FR5 BILLION--Renaud de la Baume, writing in LIBERATION, claims the French Government will have lost Fr5.13 billion on its privatizations of BNP, Rhone-Poulenc, and Elf- Aquitaine because of its failure to set better offering prices for their shares. In failing to receive the "correct" price for the public offerings, the government has "made a gift" for investors of the stock price gain, thereby losing money for government coffers. The amount of this "gift," based on de la Baume's research, was calculated by determining net stock price gains--adjusted to compensate for the general stock market rise during this period--for each investor category, some of which bought in at different offering prices. Below are the results of de la Baume's research: * BNP: The total investor net gain was Fr1.77 billion. The gain included a Fr20 per share net gain for small shareholders with 46.9 million shares bought; Fr20 per share net gain for institutional investors with 27.7 million shares bought; an average net gain of Fr30 per share for BNP employees with 8 million shares bought; and a net gain of Fr8.30 per share for Stable Shareholders Group (GAS) investors with 5.7 million shares bought. * Rhone-Poulenc: The total investor net gain was Fr0.25 billion. This included a Fr6.50 per share net gain for small shareholders who bought 52.3 million shares; a net gain of Fr10 per share for GAS investors who bought 15.1 million shares; net gain of Fr23 per share for Rhone Poulenc employees who bought 8.8 million shares; and net gain of Fr5 per share for institutional investors who bought 26.9 million shares. * Elf-Aquitaine: Not yet privatized, future total investor net gain was estimated to be Fr3.11 billion. The research assumed a per share public offering price of Fr35 for some 89 million shares, assuming also the same percentage of stock market gains as occurred under the above privatizations. De la Baume claims institutional investors were "very unhappy" with the lower gains they garnered in the Rhone-Poulenc privatization when the government offered an initial Fr135 per share compared to Fr240 per share for BNP. Consequently, the government has "clearly decided" to avoid irritating this crucial pool of investors and will offer a better deal to invest in Elf. (DiI) (Paris LIBERATION in French 5, 6 Feb 94 p 10) TOUBON, CARIGNON DIFFER ON AUDIOVISUAL POLICY--Communication Minister Alain Carignon and Culture Minister Jacques Toubon "profoundly" disagree over the conduct of audiovisual policy, according to Emmanuel Schwartzenberg writing in LE FIGARO. Schwartzenberg cites unnamed Toubon staffers as saying Toubon was "astonished" by Carignon's establishment of a government working group on EU audiovisual policy. Toubon himself openly reproached Carignon, who is also the mayor of Grenoble, in that city's daily DAUPHINE LIBERE of 28 January for having opened discussions on the EU directive on audiovisual policy "alone and without coordination." He stated, "An issue such as the Television Without Borders directive is by nature interministerial. The Foreign Affairs Ministry itself says that the Communication Ministry cannot make Community policy for France. Community policy can only be the result of governmental action." Moreover, Toubon warned, "Since there have been several episodes like this, I think there must be a call to order." He added that he will "question" the separation between these two ministries, noting that ministers must act as a "solid team." Schwartzenberg concludes that Toubon's accusations are "serious" and demand to be quickly attended to or France's position in international negotiations will be weakened. Carignon refused to make any official comment on Toubon's statements. However, based on Toubon's statements over the last several weeks, Schwartzenberg contends that Toubon views his role as one of provoking debate, initiating discussions, then participating in interministerial coordination. Such coordination should follow the debate and not come from closed-door negotiations where lawyers and technicians leave the public out.

Aerospatiale has had a difficult year marked by low civilian and military sales. Despite a 5-percent decrease in sales for 1993, the company was able to reduce its debt by 9 percent last year. However, its balance sheet remains burdened by a "colossal" debt of Fr15 billion, or two times more than shareholders' equity (Fr6 billion). "The state has done its shareholder duty," according to Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery. He argues that the EU Commission cannot criticize the Fr2 billion capital infusion because Aerospatiale, unlike Bull, is not in difficulty. The company has an austerity program in place and should break even by 1995. In the meantime, however, privatization is not "the order of the day." Additionally, Alphandery confirmed that the Fr2 billion will come from the Fr21 billion budgeted by the government to support state-owned companies. (DiI) (Paris LIBERATION in French 3 Feb 94 p 13) GOVERNMENT'S RECOVERY PLANS CALLED 'AMBIGUOUS'--According to LIBERATION'S Chief Economic Editor Laurent Mauduit, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is sending mixed economic signals. On the one hand Balladur is trying to stimulate consumer spending; on the other, he is trying to attract savings and investment. Because of the depressed state of consumer spending, the government has chosen to try to convince the French to spend more. Mauduit argues, for example, that the new "prudent" Social Security plan which increased employer social benefit payments, was intended to stimulate savings without impacting consumer spending through new taxes. Government remains ambiguous, however. It is continuing to stimulate long-term savings, as it did last spring when it issued government bonds for the French to subscribe to, but is simultaneously continuing a privatization process, which is obviously designed to stimulate investment rather than consumption, Mauduit concludes. (RM) (Paris LIBERATION in French 31 Jan 94 p 3) GERMANY COMMENTATOR SAYS FARMERS GROWING 'WRONG' PRODUCTS--Government and academic proposals for reforming German agriculture overlook the fact that German farmers are growing the "wrong" products, according to a commentary by Klaus Kemper in the 22 January Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. According to Kemper, the suggestions offered by government officials and agricultural economists to improve the competitiveness and income of German farmers are the same ones which have failed over the past 40 years. These proposals include: combining many small farms into fewer larger ones, increasing set-aside subsidies for letting land lie fallow, developing new sources of income such as offering travel packages for "vacations on the farm," and decreasing the number of farmers per unit of land. All of these proposals are valid, Kemper argues, if one assumes that German farmers should continue to produce relatively cheap crops, as they have in the past. In Kemper's view, however, this assumption is false. He maintains that, since German farmers have a large number of high income consumers at their doorstep, they should farm more "intensively" by growing products like fresh vegetables, fruits, and flowers, which are more difficult to transport and which yield more money per unit of land. By continuing to produce low-income, easily transportable crops like wheat, barley, oilseed, and sugar beets, he argues, German farmers are surrendering their natural advantage in the high end of the domestic agricultural market to overseas producers. Kemper concludes that farmers cannot manage the required shift in agricultural production without assistance and notes that German agricultural leaders and officials will need more imagination than they have shown thus far to implement the necessary changes. (RoH) (Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE in German 22 Jan 94 p 11) DISAGREEMENT AMONG MINISTRIES SLOWS ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP--The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Environment are debating the anticipated expenditure of DM6 billion for the cleanup of former GDR industrial sites. To date, some 20 major cleanup projects, each costing at least DM100 million, have been identified. At issue is the application of the "Agreement Regulating Financing of Residual Ecological Burdens," which obligates the Finance Ministry's Trust Agency to underwrite 60 percent of general cleanup costs and 75 percent of the costs incurred in designated major projects. The Environment Ministry view is that cleanup must include preparing the sites for continued industrial use, thus averting continued industrial expansion into open land. The Trust Agency preference is to limit cleanups to what is needed to avert present dangers, without pursuing further environmental goals. (CW) (Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT in German 13 Jan 94 p 3) TRUST AGENCY PR0MOTES RUSSIAN INVESTMENT--The Moscow office of the Trust Agency's East European Consulting Group has set up an April investor workshop for representatives of small and medium- sized German businesses interested in the privatization of Russian companies. The areas targeted are wholesale and retail trade, food service, and transport operations. Since 1992, the Trust Agency group has had some 30 specialists in 17 cities of the Moscow oblast assisting in privatization and restructuring, and it reports that about 80 percent of the 10,000 businesses in the pilot areas have been privatized. In this case, "privatized" means that 51 percent of the shares in each company are held by the firm's employees, and investors are being sought for the remaining shares. Additional consulting services are in the works for St. Petersburg, Vladimir, Irkutsk and Krasnojarsk, and the group has also been advising the Ministry for Privatization and the Russian Government's antimonopoly commission. (CW) (Frankfurt/Main BLICK DURCH DIE WIRTSCHAFT in German 27 Jan 94 p 2) KINKEL ENCOURAGES INVESTMENT IN ASIA--Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, addressing a three-day conference of the German ambassadors to Asia, called on the German political and economic sectors to focus on "the most dynamic region of the world" and not "leave it to the United States." He had already instructed the embassies to provide German firms with all the help possible in their dealings in Asia. The goal is not just to increase German exports to the region but to invest there as well. According to Kinkel, an earlier German involvement in Asia could have created 400,000 additional jobs in Germany. Kinkel also promised that, in order to fully integrate Asia into the world market, Germany would work for Chinese and Taiwanese participation in GATT and would encourage democratic reforms in China, India, and Vietnam. The German Government is planning to use its EU presidency, which begins in July 1994, to promote its Asia policy on the European level. Kinkel was cautious on human rights issues, acknowledging the abuses should be clearly addressed but warning against a policy of "pointing fingers." (WS) (Frankfurt FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU in German 27 Jan 94 p 4) GREECE ECONOMIC COURSE DISCUSSED--According to an article in VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS, the good news on the Greek economy which surfaced in 1994 included: * Reduced Deficit--The huge "black hole" of the 2.5-trillion- drachmas deficit inherited by the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government from the previous New Democracy (ND) administration has been "decisively plugged." * Lower Interest Rates--Businessmen, workers, and industrialists reacted favorably to National Economy Minister Yiorgos Yennimatas's efforts to lower interest rates 3 percent, which will foster investment by both small and large companies. * Booming Stock Market--The stock market recently broke the 1,000-point mark, reaching the same level it did in February 1992, when investors still hoped that the ND government's economic policy would have positive results. However, the good news was mitigated by the January announcement that four large textile mills are closing and the fact that the value of the dollar is constantly rising. This adds a significant burden to the servicing of the foreign debt, the size of which demands heavy taxation and continued austerity. EU Commission President Jacques Delors and Economics and Financial Affairs Commissioner Henning Christophersen have already met with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Yennimatas to ask them to pursue such an austerity policy, the article reports. While EU officials "showed understanding," they expressed doubts that the 1994 budget, which promises to lower the deficit, can be adhered to if austerity is not followed. EU doubts are shared by Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, Commerce Minister Kostas Simitis, and alternate National Economy Minister Ioannis Papandoniou, who also advocate austerity measures. They argue that of the three elections scheduled during the government's term--European Parliament, municipal, and legislative elections--the most critical one is the last, allowing the government time to enact politically costly austerity measures. While Papandreou shares his ministers' concern, he rejects tighter economic policies at this time, fearing that austerity will plunge the economy into an unprecedented recession from which it would be difficult to dig out. He is thus advocating Yennimatas's policy of only tightening tax collection. According to the article, this "formidable" task cannot be carried out by Yennimatas, who is ill with cancer, alone and Deputy Minister of Finance Alexandros Papadhopoulos may soon have his responsibilities expanded to help out.

The selection of Greece for the bank is a significant challenge for Greece, as well as a "window of opportunity" for the country to promote Greek entrepreneurship and economic leadership in the Balkans and the Black Sea region. The bank is scheduled to open in 1994. However, it may be delayed because of its members' different levels of development and national political and economic goals. The bank presidency will rotate among its members. The first governor will be Turkish and his deputy Bulgarian. Greece will be responsible for the bank's organization and operation. Each country will contribute to the financing of the institution with alternative funding to come from the "plethora" of EU, European Reconstruction and Development Bank (EBRD), European Investment Bank (EIB), and World Bank programs.

Following is a summary of the positions the advocate: * Mario Baldassari, Pact for Italy --Guarantee a tax ceiling, reducing tax rate from 43 to 40 percent. Broaden the tax base through agreements with the self- employed. Reduce the number of taxes from 200 to no more than 10, since 80 percent of revenues come from six taxes. --Modify public assistance regulations. Intervene to save the pension system by raising minimum pension age, establishing compulsory contributions, and creating private pension funds. --Increase the pace of privatization and include municipal companies and local savings banks. Create a network of merchant banks for small- and medium-sized companies. * Giancarlo Pagliarini, Northern League --Establish a tax ceiling, with a rate which has a "fair" percentage share of GDP. --Pay for health care and pensions through the EU's budget. Change to a contribution-defined system rather than a benefit- defined system. Those outside the system who do not contribute should receive state benefits. Contributions should be managed by pension funds in competition with each other rather than by the National Agency for Social Security (INPS). --Extend privatization to everything because "it makes no sense for the state to manage the economy." * Roberto Pinza, Italian Popular Party --Do not impose a tax ceiling before country's finances are in order. Meanwhile, follow the policy established by the current legislature for the next few years. Simplify and return tax refunds as quickly as possible. --Seek and maintain a balance between efficiency and state benefits, especially health-related benefits. Give public assistance to those who really need it and require those less needy to pay for it. --Privatize but keep strategic industries under state control. Additionally, Pinza is "worried" about privatizing savings banks. He would recommend not allowing local governments to control all the savings banks. * Antonio Martino, Forza Italia --Establish a tax ceiling to control spending. --Find more efficient methods of parcelling out state aid. Provide non-negotiable vouchers to purchase health insurance plans, allowing personal choice of which one. Martino claims this would produce more efficient health care for everyone at half the present health care cost --Extend privatization to many industries which are currently under political and bureaucratic control. Martino views the linkage of economic and political interests as the principal cause of corruption in Italy. * Maurizio Gasparri, National Alliance --Limit spending, either through a constitutional mandate or through law. Reduce tax rates to fight tax evasion. --Give more administrative autonomy to individual benefit categories. For example, social security and health care could be self-managed by groups such as company employees or by larger classes such as public employees or steelworkers. The state must guarantee a minimum of assistance to the neediest and public assistance must no longer be a political bargaining chip. --Remove obstacles to privatization but maintain state control over certain strategic companies and over a part of the banking system to avoid being "colonized by the multinationals." Diversify ownership of companies. Remove the tax from reinvested company profits because such reinvestment stimulates the economy, increases production, and increases government revenues. (AB) (Rome IL MESSAGGERO in Italian 26 Jan 94 p 2) MAJOR UNIONS TO UNITE IN 'SECOND REPUBLIC'--On 20 January the national secretaries of three major unions--the Italian General Confederation of Labor (CGIL), the Italian Confederation of Trade Unions (CISL), and the Italian Federation of Trade Unions (UIL)- -announced that they will unite during the upcoming political and constitutional changeover to a "Second Republic" which will occur during 1994-95. The new union will not be a merger of the three federations but a totally new entity that will have to identify its new functions and rationalize its activities. According to Giorgio Lonardi writing in LA REPUBBLICA, the union will heavily affect the present unions' bureaucracy, and CGIL Secretary Bruno Trentin said that the number of full-time officials will be "drastically" reduced. CISL Secretary Sergio D'Antoni agreed that the new union management will be slimmer and recognized that there will be a problem in redistributing its human resources. The new union will be a "revolutionary order with precise definitions for the role and participation of the workers," according to D'Antoni. Both Trentin and D'Antoni agreed that the new union will be apolitical. It's institutions will be stronger this way, D'Antoni said, and the union's major role will be to represent the workers before whatever government may be in power. This does not mean that the union cannot have its own positions or that individual leaders cannot make political choices, D'Antoni noted. Trentin added, however, that the union's contribution to a discussion between political forces "is something else." (AB) (Rome LA REPUBBLICA in Italian 21 Jan 94 P 40) PORTUGAL FARMERS RECEIVE SMALL SHARE OF EU AID--According to a statement by the Farmers' Confederation of Portugal (CAP), Portuguese farmers received less than a third of EU farm subsidies granted to the country. A CAP-commissioned study showed that farmers received public funds from both national and EU sources of about 263 million contos between 1986 and 1992, a "far cry" from the 900 million contos touted as the total by the government. Another study conducted by agronomist Sevinate Pinto and Francisco Avillez, professor at the Higher Institute of Agronomy, contends that the income of Portuguese farmers fell by almost half in the last three years. The study showed that in the eight years since Portugal entered the EU, farmers received 346 million contos from EU subsidies and from the General State Budget (OGE). In comparison, the country made interest payments of 412 million contos to financial institutions during this time. The study contends that consumers, taxpayers, and the state have benefited from the sizable drop in national assistance to the agricultural sector and the significant drop in farm prices. The authors also maintain that only 60 percent of the funds provided by the European Farm Orientation and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA) went to producers, with the remaining 40 percent shared in almost equal parts by exporters, consumers, and the state.

He revealed that Volvo will return to being only a manufacturing company, shedding the diverse service businesses it was involved in previously. Gyll saw a favorable economic climate for this streamlining, noting that "the positive factors in the market outweigh the negative ones." Volvo's earnings are expected to total 5 billion kronor this year and 10 billion next year. According to Gyll, the company's passenger car division has captured new market shares in Sweden, Germany, and Great Britain. Gyll also said that the Volvo-Renault partnership is being reviewed to see how common operations such as purchasing, quality control, and production planning can be divided. The two firms are also examining which previously planned projects remain worthwhile. Mutual purchasing agreements will remain in effect.

According to the study, Switzerland's annual growth rate would accelerate from 1.2 to 1.5 percent by the year 2000 if it joined the EU. Becoming part of the Union would also make overall employment prospects in Switzerland "less negative": as an EU member, Switzerland could expect to lose about 13,000 jobs by the year 2000; if it remained outside the Union, however, it would face the prospect of losing 30,000 jobs in the same period. The study found that those industries which are already internationally oriented would profit most if Switzerland joined the EU. The service sector, for example, would register 25.5 billion Swiss francs (SFr) in annual growth in the EU, versus SFr22 billion outside. Similarly, the Swiss chemical industry would grow by SFr4.4 billion inside the EU, but by only SFR3.1 billion outside. Other industries more oriented toward domestic consumption, however, would suffer in the event of Swiss EU entry. The food and luxury goods industry, for example, could expect "slight" growth of SFr40 million outside the EU but would shrink by SFr700 million if Switzerland joined the Union. EU membership would also mean losses for the agriculture and clothing industries.
