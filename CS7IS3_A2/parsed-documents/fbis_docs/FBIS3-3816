Foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin also reiterated pledges that Beijing would not discriminate against British companies because of a dispute over Hong Kong's electoral reform -- while hinting that the government could not eliminate all the row's "adverse effects" on business. Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., which has been the target of Beijing's wrath because of its support for Governor Chris Patten's democratic reform package, announced Wednesday it would leave the exchange from December 31, 1994 -- exactly 2-1/2 years before the British colony reverts to China. "It is a matter for Jardines to decide whether it will end its listing on the Hong Kong market," Wu told a weekly news briefing. "As for the future of Hong Kong and the stability and prosperity of Hong kong, not only the Chinese side but the large number of investors abroad are confident in this regard," he said. "That's why so many investors have entered the Hong Kong market." Jardines chairman Henry Keswick said in a statement Wednesday the move was not related to concerns about Hong Kong's future but to the Bermuda-registered group's failure to get exemption from the local takeover code. Wu reiterated Premier Li Peng's recent pledges not to block British companies from the booming Chinese market but added that Britain's "non-cooperative attitude" on political issues had taken its toll on Sino-British cooperation. "The Chinese side wishes to reduce as far as possible the adverse affects of this issue on the conduct of business activities by British companies," he said. China attracted widespread criticism last month after it warned that British interests would suffer as a result of the Hong Kong legislature's adoption of the first part of Patten's reform package. Legislators are expected to adopt the second and final stage of the reforms by mid-year, despite Beijing's vow to scrap the changes and stage fresh elections in 1997 in accordance with its own, as yet unspecified, criteria.
