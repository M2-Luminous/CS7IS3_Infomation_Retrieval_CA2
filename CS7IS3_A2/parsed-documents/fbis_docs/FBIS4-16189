He said that among the most essential amendments was the integration of the National Bank of Belarus with Russia's Central Bank. This circumstance gives hope for a better regulation of Russian-Belarusian monetary relations and is expected to enhance the efficiency of this document, said Gaydar. However, the agreement does not specify during what period the National Bank of Belarus will become a branch of the Central Bank, he continued. He expressed deep concern about the decision on exchanging the Belarusian citizens' deposits and cash. According to the agreement, every Belarusian citizen is to exchange 200,000 Belarusian coupons at the 1:1 rate, so the total sum to be exchanged at such a rate will amount to two trillion rubles. As the worth of the Belarusian coupon will be artificially increased, and given the difference between the worth of the cash and non-cash Belarusian coupon, large-scale manipulations of cash in both countries are likely to take place, said Gaydar. Before the agreement goes into force and is ratified by the Russian and Belarusian parliaments, fantastic opportunities will emerge for financial machinations involving sums worth billions of dollars, he went on to say. He pointed out that the agreement makes the economy hostage to political games, especially on the eve of parliamentary elections in Belarus.
