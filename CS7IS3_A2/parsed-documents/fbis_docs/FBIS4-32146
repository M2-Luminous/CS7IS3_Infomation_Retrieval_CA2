Commentaries and statements repudiating the surprisingly "resigned" and "isolationist" drift of U.S. foreign policy began to appear. At the same time, Tarnoff had only conceded something that was as plain "as the nose on his face." Perhaps he came up with his formulations a little soon. However, with the passing of a year, we can only acknowledge his good intentions. The number-three in the U.S. Department of State underlined his view of future U.S. international policy yesterday and the day before yesterday in Prague. The stabilizing Czech economic situation suits the U.S. side. Tarnoff referred with satisfaction to the higher U.S. investment in the Czech Republic (roughly 30 percent of the overall volume of foreign imports). Viewed through Washington's eyes, the Czech basin [ceska kotlina] is a region that it does not have to take care of systematically because its inhabitants, within the framework of their potential, are taking care of it themselves. Unfortunately, the issues that affect the fate of countries like the Czech Republic, issues that these countries cannot deal with on their own, will not wither away in this fashion. The security vacuum in which the Central European countries have found themselves following the collapse of the Soviet empire can only be filled under the given circumstances by membership in NATO. If, however, Moscow decides to put off the moment when its former satellites are accepted into NATO, no one in today's world other than Washington can influence its willfulness. Will it do so? Tarnoff left this question, which must have come up in his talks with Czech politicians, only half answered. Yet he spoke extensively and optimistically, as was to be expected, about the Partnership for Peace, project and, in an interview with journalists, he rejected tactfully but decisively the criticism that has recently been leveled at this unbinding program in the United States. The Czech Republic is far from being a state that would not let the key officials in the U.S. Department of State sleep peacefully. Visiting it, therefore, is not something that would "get hot" for U.S. diplomats. Tarnoff himself called off at the last moment in the spring his announced and carefully planned visit to Prague. It is impossible to be surprised at the calm unconcern with which Washington dubs us self-supporting. Other countries, threatening to explode, merit U.S. attention more. North Korea is the most noticeable example. Even here, however, Washington is limiting itself only to what it can manage--and it seems that it can manage little. Peter Tarnoff, who held talks in Asian countries last week, in reply to a question from LIDOVE NOVINY on whether Washington will be willing and able to prevent Pyongyang from producing more nuclear bombs, was quick to recall the success of the conciliatory mission by former President Carter. In return for Kim Il-song's allowing two international inspectors to remain in the DPRK, the United States will suspend its attempt to introduce sanctions. A meager victory--but in the spirit of the sobriety formulated by Tarnoff. Rather than dispatching the Army to force Kim into obedience, it is worthwhile for Washington to send Jimmy Carter to Pyongyang. The fact that the North Korean regime cannot be trusted and that the two inspectors will not prevent the production of further nuclear bombs in the DPRK has somehow been left aside.
