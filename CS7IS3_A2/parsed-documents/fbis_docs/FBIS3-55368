Slezevicius and his Latvian counterpart V. Birkavs signed a protocol of intentions on the construction of an oil terminal and an oil pipeline in Liepaja, and on the delivery of oil products to the refinery in Mazeikiai, which has already evoked a reaction. The positive implementation of these intentions, most probably, does not satisfy the opposition. This project was criticized on the radio by A. Vaisnoras, member of the Seimas [parliament] Environmental Protection Committee. TIESA's correspondent Terese Smaroviene has spoken with Energy Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas about a new turn in the story of the oil terminal. [Smaroviene] Mister Minister, will we really discard the Butinge option if we reach an agreement with the Latvians on the construction of a joint oil terminal at the former military port of Liepaja? [Stasiukynas] This will probably be the case. If we reach a final agreement on the construction of the terminal in Liepaja, it would be unwise to build an identical object in Butinge. We do not need two terminals. [Smaroviene] When will the community be able to learn which option has been chosen? [Stasiukynas] By 15 January of next year. The protocol of intentions states that Lithuania and Latvia agree to consider the issue of the construction of a joint export-import enterprise. The responsible executor of the project in Lithuania is the Energy Ministry, and its responsible manager -- B. Vainora, deputy energy minister and managing director of the "Nafta" refinery in Mazeikiai. In Latvia, this project will be reviewed by its Energy Ministry and the government. The latter will have to assign to the joint enterprise port facilities situated in the area of the Liepaja port, and the land necessary for the construction of the terminal and the pipeline to Mazeikiai. As I have mentioned, everything must be coordinated by 15 January. If the preliminary documents are not ready, or if we fail to reach an agreement by that date, the work in Butinge will continue. [Smaroviene] Suppose, we choose the Liepaja option -- the conditions satisfy Lithuania, and the guarantees are firm. How will the stock holding be divided? [Stasiukynas] This issue is included in the protocol of intentions. Lithuania would have a 51-percent share, while Latvia would have 49 percent. [Smaroviene] Which option -- Butinge or Liepaja -- is cheaper? [Stasiukynas] Undoubtedly, the construction of the terminal in Liepaja is less expensive for us. It would cost $50 million less than the Butinge terminal, because we would not have to build facilities in the sea -- they already exist. Thus, the terminal itself would be installed much faster. We must build a floating platform nine kilometers off the coast in Butinge, while in Liepaja everything is ready. The only thing that remains there is to clean the port area that has been neglected for many years. That would cost about $1 million. [Smaroviene] How would you comment on current talks that a terminal in Liepaja will allegedly tie us to Russia? [Stasiukynas] Liepaja is at the Baltic Sea rather than on the border with Russia. Tankers can sail to the port from any country. By the way, Latvia's proposal is assessed quite differently abroad. Recently, I met with the representatives of the EC and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London, who think that the bank's financing for this Lithuanian-Latvian project is guaranteed. In their opinion, this will be the first European object in the Baltic states. [Smaroviene] In your opinion, why did the Latvians propose the Liepaja port as the site for the terminal so unexpectedly? Why were there no such proposals before the beginning of the work in Butinge? [Stasiukynas] Our neighbors must have thought that we would not build this terminal. There probably would not have been any proposal, if the competition for the Butinge project had not begun. When it became clear that Lithuania is determined to have its own oil terminal, the Latvians proposed their option which we are considering very cautiously and thoroughly. [Smaroviene] We, the Lithuanians, do not seem very serious. At one time, we discuss the issue of Ventspils, while later we become tempted by our neighbors' new proposal, despite having begun a project of our own facility.... [Stasiukynas] Ventspils is a past stage that had many negative points, while Liepaja is a new and clean port. Why should we not take advantage of it if this is beneficial? [Smaroviene] You have mentioned the guarantees that the Latvian Government is granting to our state in the construction of the oil terminal and the maintenance of the Liepaja port. [Stasiukynas] The construction of such an important joint venture requires the guarantees that the tax system and other conditions will not change. A country in which that enterprise is located can invent various obstacles. However, these issues are solvable. There is an international legal practice. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has pledged to send its consultants who will draft such an international agreement. [Smaroviene] Thank you for the interview. We will be looking forward to 15 January 1994.
