The president was speaking at a meeting with the heads of Russia's leading mass media, members of the Moscow editors-in-chief club. Speaking of the situation in the Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet, Kravchuk emphasized that "it would be absurd for the Crimea to completely distance itself from Ukraine, since the peninsula is inseparably connected to Ukraine and depends on it. Of course," Kravchuk noted, "there are questions which must be jointly resolved. One of them is the division of the Black Sea Fleet and the decision where to establish the bases for the Russian fleet and the Ukrainian navy. But here, too, everybody must demonstrate patience, common sense, and mutual respect." Asked whether he was sure the conflict with the Crimea could be resolved in exclusively peaceful ways, Kravchuk announced, "Not under any circumstances will we resort to the use of armed force, and we appeal to the Crimean leadership to adhere to the same principle." Concerning the future of land and federalism in Ukraine, the president noted that, "this is not a subject for casual conversation, it cannot be examined on the everyday, non-professional level." In that connection, he stressed that he supports economic federalism, "if one may use such a category," and favors handing over some power to the regions. But, Kravchuk noted, "as world experience shows, real federations were created over long periods. One must not forget about that." The Russian mass media heads expressed their concern over the Ukrainian president's attitude toward foreign journalists working in his country. Naturally, they had in mind the recent Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's decision to refuse to accredit three "Ostankino" correspondents. Kravchuk replied, "I do not share (the Foreign Ministry's) position. That was also unexpected for me. Those questions should be resolved in a different way than they were." He agreed to discuss the proposal to create a single informational space with the rest of the CIS heads of state, and announced his readiness to take the initiative in sponsoring such a document. The mediamen also asked the president about his personal ambitions: what would he like? The answer was: "For the Ukraine to make some progress in the economic sphere; for friendly relations to be developed between neighbors, not de jure, but de facto, in particular, between Russia and Ukraine, since there are no alternatives in this respect. I want Russians to look at Ukraine as an equal partner." Speaking about his relations with the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and its chairman Alexander Moroz, Kravchuk called the former business-like, and the latter, were termed "normal." "Time will tell how they will be in the future. After all, as it is, the deputies have only looked at, besides the situation in the Crimea, the internal questions of their work." As far as the upcoming presidential elections are concerned, Kravchuk said, "the elections will be held. The main battle, in my opinion, will take place in the second round. Who will enter it? I think that Kuchma will. I am almost sure of that. Who else? I might," the president commented.
