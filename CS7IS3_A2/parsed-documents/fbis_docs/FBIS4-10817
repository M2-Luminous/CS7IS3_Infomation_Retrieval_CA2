FBIS4-10817 "drlat075__a94004" FBIS-LAT-93-075-A Daily Report 10 Apr 1994 ANNEX Brazil `Suspicion' About Rio de Janeiro Governor Viewed `Suspicion' About Rio de Janeiro Governor Viewed PY1204221194 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 10 Apr 94 p 10--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY1204221194 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese BFN [Editorial: "Under the Shade of Suspicion"] [Text] When he was informed about what was happening in Rome regarding his wife, Cesar ignored the rumors and did what the law allowed him to: He publicly repudiated her under the allegation that "Cesar's wife" could not even appear as a suspect in conjugal infidelity. No evidence was required: Mere suspicion called for a public justification. The episode about Cesar repudiating his wife, which remains an example, is always recalled whenever the border between the law and ethics seems undefined. In the case of Governor Nilo Batista, however, the fact that his name appeared on the numbers game list does not embarrass him. He insists on not feeling morally prevented from commanding the investigation that seeks to dismantle the illegal game network in Rio de Janeiro. And, crowning his attitude, he confirms that he will not leave his position. Society expected the governor to consider himself a suspect after Castor de Andrade's list was released. The law does contemplate this sort of situation, but one's morals should not compromise matters of principles. Government authorities must set the example recommended by ethics even if the law does not call for it. All subterfuges converge in the same direction: those involved feel uncomfortable in the company of celebrated numbers game kingpins and deny the fact, just for the sake of denying it, because they count on the law's formalities that make it difficult to identify and punish organized crime, particularly crime hidden behind the facade of simple infractions. Drug trafficking; arms smuggling; holdups of banks, armored vehicles, and homes; kidnappings; and moving large amounts of money are behind the numbers game facade. Society has been surprised only at how few names are included on the numbers lottery kingpins' list. It was common knowledge that most of the other names on the list had links with the illegal game. Society was aware of everything, including that several members of the Military Police and the civil police had associations with organized crime. All that was missing was the link between the different criminal activities. The mafia organization's unity was destroyed as a result of charges pressed by the accountant for the numbers game's highest capo. The situation was inverted: The district attorney acted in an explosive manner and, in a surprise operation, seized material that involves many of those who made common cause with organized crime. The investigation has started and foretells a lot more ammunition. The crime universe that controls Rio de Janeiro's life, under the protection of some policemen and the involvement of some politicians, has begun to crumble. It makes no difference whether the numbers game donations were made to candidates: Those who have been elected also have been contaminated. Money allegedly from numbers game bets is also the money from kidnappings, drug trafficking, and bank holdups. It is morally unacceptable, although the evidence found so far still does not comply with the formal inflexibility of the laws from the legal point of view. The Federal Police's own involvement shows the ramifications of organized crime in Brazilian life. Wherever the numbers game operates -- it functions countrywide -- politicians accept bribes because the electoral law does not force them to report where these donations come from. Despite all that, those who accept dirty money cannot claim they did it in goodwill. The first step into illegality is to accept money for which no receipt can be issued. It is not a donation, it is tax evasion, and it is therefore a crime. Public people cannot commit tax evasion crimes. The amount of money, the extent of crime that is destroying Rio de Janeiro inside, the widespread sense of insecurity, and corruption -- which involves even the civil police, the Military Police, the Legislative Assembly, and national Congress representatives -- cannot be fought with rhetorical antidotes. To say that what has been revealed is staging a political coup is to disrespect public opinion and the people's right to information and to judge those involved in these crimes. Society wants action and not subterfuges. Society wants real guarantees and not fictitious ones. Something will have to be done in addition to investigating names and the amounts received. The citizens want an initiative to dismantle organized crime in Rio de Janeiro and are waiting for a sign from above. If the order is not given by the local administration, let Brasilia order action against crime and against all of its central commands, not only against the sources that supply the money. Crime is being morally condemned but no firm measure has been adopted to end crime, disarm the criminal groups, and dismantle the organizations in charge of holdups and kidnappings. It is not important to know the name of the legal operation for which Rio de Janeiro has been waiting. It is not important to know where the order to fight crime comes from. The people expect that the authorities detect the signs of general insecurity and translate them into direct action against crime. The people will see in a good light any initiative President Itamar Franco might adopt to eliminate organized crime in a state that does not deserve to suffer what it has been suffering.
