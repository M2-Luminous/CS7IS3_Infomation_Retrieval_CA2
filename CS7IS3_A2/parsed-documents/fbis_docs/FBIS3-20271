There had been fears that the pro-federal Belgians would consider the deal on offer to Britain too favourable, but the current EU [European Union] Greek presidency announced in Brussels that assent had been received. As the formal backing of the other member states was awaited, arrangement were going on for a formal enlargement ceremony in Brussels tomorrow between the 12 existing governments and the four newcomers--Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who has commuted between Brussels and London for weeks battling to avoid giving ground on voting rights, will not be returning to Brussels for the final act: the Government will be represented by its ambassador to the EU Sir John Kerr, the man responsible for overseeing the Government's European policy. The ceremony will be carried out amid relief, particularly in the four accession countries, that enlargement is still on course for the start of next year. But two more crucial hurdles remain. The European Parliament must now endorse the accession terms in the first week of May if the timetable is to be maintained. And finally, all four applicant countries will be holding national referendums--and the outcome of Norway's at least, is in serious doubt. A majority of Norwegians are opposed to EU membership, and the British-led row over voting has not improved the mood.
