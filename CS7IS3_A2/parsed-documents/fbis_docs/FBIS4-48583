The only child of Josephine (born Van Zyl) and Jan Johannes Coetsee, a printer, he matriculated in 1948 at Ladybrand school, where he was a prefect and a Dux scholar. He completed his BA LLB in 1954 at the University of the Orange Free State which, eventually in 1991, was to honour him as "former kovsie of the year". While at university he served on the students' council for extra- mural students and was chairman of the youth branch of the NP [National Party]. He was a part-time lecturer in law while qualifying as an attorney and practised at the side-bar for 17 years before being admitted to the bar in Bloemfontein as an advocate in 1972. He was not balloted for military service, but served as a volunteer in the President Steyn Regiment's armoured car section from 1964-68. Mr Coetsee first went to Parliament in 1968 when he won the by- election for the Bloemfontein West seat. In 1985 he became leader of the Orange Free State NP at a time when the debate was raging on whether measures preventing Asians from entering and living in the Free State should be repealed. These measures were repealed in September that year after an overwhelming affirmative vote at the party's congress. Mr Coetsee served on various parliamentary committees and commissions, including the Schlebusch Commission of inquiry into certain organisations and the Select Committee on the Constitution in 1983. He became chairman of the defence group of the NP caucus in 1978, and when Mr P W Botha became prime minister he was given the position of deputy minister of defence and national intelligence. During his two-year term in this position, Mr Coetsee restructured the National Intelligence Service and tailored national service requirements to protect people suffering financial loss while doing their service. On October 12, 1980 he was appointed minister of justice and set about instituting reforms in the legal system. These included the introduction of the small claims courts, the Matrimonial Property Bill in 1984, which had major repercussions on the status of married women, and introduced the accrual system of property sharing between spouses. From October 1980 to July 1991 the portfolio included prisons and the mid-1980's produced the lowest incidence of prison complaints for years. It was in that role that he liaised between President Nelson Mandela and his two predecessors, Mr P W Botha and Deputy President F W de Klerk in the years preceding Mr mandela's release. He was instrumental, in 1991, in sending top prisons officials to the United States on a fact-finding mission about community service as a viable alternative sentence to imprisonment. A white paper on the subject was released in May of that year. The Sharpeville six case rose to prominence in 1987 when six people were sentenced to death for the murder of the deputy mayor of Lekoa. They were granted various stays of execution until, on July 12, 1988, Mr Coetsee deferred their execution indefinitely as he wanted to enable the defence lawyers to exhaust all legal avenues open to save their clients. The death sentence was eventually converted to life imprisonment. In August 1987 President Botha asked Mr Coetsee to look into the possible release of Rivonia trialist Mr Govan Mbeki, who was serving a life sentence. Mr Mbeki was released later in the year. After the African National Congress was unbanned in 1990 and Mr Nelson Mandela released, Mr Coetsee was part of the government's delegation which held talks in May at Groote Schuur. He also put the indemnity bill -- containing provisions for conditional and unconditional permanent indemnity -- through Parliament which granted temporary immunity to those who might serve in negotiation delegations. He married Helena Elizabeth Malan on October 6 1956. They have three daughters and two sons.
