FBIS3-46886 "dreas004_d_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-004 Document Type:Daily Report 6 Jan 1994 South Korea * Reporters Evaluate National Assemblymen 942C0048A Seoul SIN TONG-A in Korean Dec 93 pp 250-264 942C0048A Seoul SIN TONG-A Language: Korean Article Type:CSO [Report on a SIN TONG-A poll of 72 political reporters on the performances of the 14th National Assembly and its members, by the SIN TONG-A Editorial Department] [Text] A year and a half has elapsed since the 14th National Assembly was sworn in. How is the public viewing it? SIN TONG-A has conducted a survey to evaluate its performance and performances of individual assemblymen. Analyses and evaluations of parliamentary activities and of individual lawmakers should, in principle, be carried out by directly polling voters. Realistically, however, data on parliamentary activities are not readily available for the public. Of late, Kyongsilnyon and a few other groups and scholars have begun monitoring, analyzing, and evaluating assemblymen's parliamentary activities, but their work is still in its initial stage and unable to offer information to the public in general. Considering these facts, the survey was carried out by polling political reporters of newspapers, radios and press agencies assigned to the coverage of the National Assembly, political parties and individual lawmakers. The reason was that the public is inevitably influenced by mass media in their impressions of the National Assembly and its members, and that the evaluations by reporters watching political developments can provide important data. At the same time, SIN TONG-A's judgement was that they can speak accurately for the public on their feelings toward the National Assembly and its members. Our purpose was to verify if the assemblymen elected are performing as the voters want them to. It was not our purpose to make any journalistic approach to parliamentary politics or to show the likes or dislikes about any individual lawmakers. The poll was conducted by distributing the prepared questionnaire sheets--listing 14 questions about activities of the National Assembly and its members--directly to reporters at the reporters rooms in the National Assembly and the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] and Democratic Party [DP] headquarters, and retrieving after they filled them out. A hundred-odd questionnaire sheets were distributed and 72 reporters responded. The retrieved sheets showed traces of great pains they took with their responses. The 14th National Assembly--the result of the general election held on 24 March--opened on a squeaking note. The ruling and opposition parties, in a confrontation over the issue of the legally overdue mayoral and gubernatorial elections, had already clashed in the bargaining over the procedures of the opening. The assembly barely managed to open on 29 June, recessing without doing anything but electing the speaker (Pak Chun-kyu) and vice speakers (Hwang Nak-chu and Ho Kyong-man). Thus, it idled away its 30-day first session. Then, the DLP decided to unilaterally convene the National Assembly to railroad a revision of the local autonomy law (for holding the mayoral and gubernatorial elections in 1995). The assembly was convened on 1 August but the limping continued. Meanwhile, the regular plenary session opened on 14 September but, under the pressure of the upcoming presidential election, had to recess in less than 50 days or half of its legal length. Although it barely completed its formation in early October, the 14th National Assembly remained unable to concentrate on its primary duty because of the imminent presidential election. Then came the forceful reform drive of President Kim Yong-sam early this year, flustering the National Assembly. Assemblymen do not dare to conceive institutionalization of reform, or checking government policies, or presenting alternative policies. They only dithered about trying to read the president's mind. The upheavals brought on by the administration's audit-and-inspection and the public disclosure of property programs plunged the National Assembly into an unprecedented crisis, forcing a former speaker and the current speaker to resign their assembly seats. Even the opposition, not to mention the government party, could not properly respond to the reform wind. Assemblymen exposed themselves as a bunch of weaklings who would only sit back and watch the president's "one-man race." Also, in the parliamentary inquiries into the Yulgok defense buildup program, the 12.12 [12 December 1979] incident and the Peace Dam scandal, the 14th National Assembly indeed made its efforts to bring out the truth but, to the eyes of the public, its performance fell short of their expectations. The public also assessed as inadequate its performance in the regular parliamentary inspection of the administration this year. Furthermore, it even wasted a whole week because of the squabble over the liquidation-of-the-past issue, demonstrating that as far as the National Assembly is concerned, nothing has changed. Such being its performance, the appraisals of the 14th National Assembly could be anything but high. Of the respondents, 66.7 percent (48 persons) saw no particular difference in it from its predecessors, while 8.3 percent gave it negative ratings--6.9 percent viewed its level of parliamentary activity as "relatively low" and 1.4 percent as "low." On the other hand, a quarter of the respondents (18 persons, 25.0 percent) gave it positive ratings, viewing the 14th National Assembly as performing more constructively than any of its predecessors. Compared with a similar survey conducted by SIN TONG-A in 1991, the numbers indicate that the 14th National Assembly are rated more favorably than the 13th. In the 1991 survey, only 12.9 percent gave the 13th National Assembly positive ratings while 38.6 percent voted in the negative and 48.6 percent said that it was a mediocre assembly. The survey this time found a decrease in the negative responses and a gain in the positive. Nevertheless, two-thirds of the respondents could find nothing new of the present National Assembly. This seems to reaffirm the fact that in contrast to developments in other realms, nothing has changed in the political world, and that the public sees the way the National Assembly is in the negative light. In the questionnaire, the reporters were asked what they saw as the most distinguishing feature of the 14th National Assembly. Nearly one-half (33 persons, 45.8 percent) cited the presentation of alternative policies while only 6.9 percent and 2.8 percent respectively picked legislative activities and activities to check the administration, both the primary functions of the National Assembly, in what seems to unveil a legislature overwhelmed by the government's reform drive. Some respondents noted that even in the presentation of alternative policies, the 14th National Assembly does not measure up to expectations. Their point is that thanks to efforts by some assemblymen who breathed fresh air into the assembly, parliamentary activities showed some signs of productiveness but nevertheless failed to be positive in showing alternative policies. In this connection, two reporters commented that the legislature is in a "state of lethargy." Noteworthy is the fact that 41.7 percent of the respondents (30 persons) picked "improvement in ethical consciousness" as the distinguishing feature of the 14th National Assembly. It seems to be a natural aftermath of the audit-and-inspection and public disclosure of property upheavals; however, it can be said that the rise in ethical consciousness has its limitations because it represented not the result of a voluntary resolution or movement of the National Assembly but a passive response to the president's "high-handed" drive. No matter what led to it, the fact that assemblymen made a public disclosure of their wealth for the first time is recognized as an extraordinary change, not only because it will undoubtedly help end irregularities and corruption in elections that have been frowned upon by the public, but also because it will go a long way toward shutting off from politics those who accumulated their wealth by dishonest means. In this connection, it is noteworthy that 75.0 percent of the respondents found assemblymen "wealthier than I thought." A look at the disclosed property of grade-one or higher officials in the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, the Constitutional Court, and the Central Election Committee--disclosed to the public on 7 September in accordance with the Public Office Holders Ethics Law--will explain the reason for the high percentage. While the public disclosure involved a total of 1,167 officials, as many as 64 assemblymen were among the top 100 "men of wealth." Especially, the top 15 were all assemblymen. Conspicuously, however, none of those picked by the reporters as "assemblyman of outstanding legislative activity" or "promising assemblyman" or "assemblyman of high credibility among colleagues" was included among them. The average wealth of assemblymen was reported at 2.61 billion won, somewhat close to the average worth of the entire public office holders subjected to the disclosure action, which was 1.42 billion won. In particular, the average worth of DLP lawmakers was 3.25 billion won, compared with 1.26 billion won of opposition assemblymen, or the executive branch's 860 million won, or the judicial branch's 1.19 billion won. Meanwhile, 9.7 percent of the respondents saw the disclosed wealth of assemblymen as an "appropriate size" and 12.5 percent as "smaller than I thought." Two persons said that they have no answer. The next question was about the pay for the assemblymen. At a glance, the responses appeared to contradict those concerning the wealth of assemblymen, for 30.6 percent saw the need for a large pay raise and 44.4 percent a small raise. In other words, 75.0 percent were of the opinion that they should be given a raise. Meanwhile, 22.2 percent said that the present pay scale is appropriate. One reporter said that their pay should be cut. (Another had no answer.) One of the respondents explained that "the responses that the amount of their wealth is unexpectedly large are average of the legislative branch. As for those young and new assemblymen, we feel that the present pay scale is not enough to assure satisfactory parliamentary activities." What he means is that assemblymen need political funds for satisfactory parliamentary activities, and because it is difficult to raise the necessary funds from supporters alone, the government should help them. Ex-Activists Leading in Legislative Activities The reporters were then asked about the "necessary conditions for satisfactory legislative activities." They were asked to consider four elements--assemblyman's political insight, political fund, party support, and activity for constituency--and indicate the order of precedence. The result: 69 persons or 95.8 percent picked "assemblyman's political insight" as the most important element. Only 4.2 percent (3 persons) voted for "political fund" as the most important. None picked "party support" or "activity for constituency" for the top place. For the second important factor, 31.9 percent picked "political fund" while 29.1 percent voted for "party support." And 16.6 percent picked "activity for constituency" as the next important factor. Then, what are the levels of the members of the 14th National Assembly to the eyes of the reporters who see "political insight" as the most important qualification of assemblyman? How many do they think have the capabilities and dignity befitting assemblymen? Fifty percent of the respondents said that only one-half of the assemblymen meets that qualification. More specifically, none picked "90 percent or more" as the proportion of assemblymen meeting that qualification; 15.3 percent picked "60 to 70 percent"; 34.7 percent picked "approximately 50 percent"; 31.9 percent "about 30 percent," and 18.1 percent answered "less than 30 percent." Next, the reporters were asked to grade individual assemblymen whom they know through their work. They were asked to pick five assemblymen in four categories--"assemblyman whose legislative activity is considered most vigorous," "assemblyman who is demonstrating qualities of a rational and democratic politician and is very likely to grow to be a superb politician," "assemblyman who seems to have the highest credibility among colleagues," and "assemblyman who engaged in parliamentary activity giving a negative impression (e.g., persons who made illogical, slanderous, irresponsible or stupid remarks)." It is assumed that their grading of individual assemblymen were influenced by their experiences in official and unofficial coverage activities and by their personal likings. However, the tally showed a clear-cut trend in the choice of the respondents, in particular with the ten lawmakers who received most votes. The top ten assemblymen picked by the 72 political reporters for most contributions to legislative activities are: (1) Yi Hae-chan (41, DP; Kwanak-B, Seoul; 34 votes); (2) Yi Sok-hyon (43, DP; Anyang-B, Kyonggi; 32 votes); (3) Kim Won-kil (51, DP; Tobong-B, Seoul; 27 votes); (4) Kim Won-ung (49, DP; Taedok, Taejon; 22 votes); (5) Kang Chang-song (65, DP; national constituency; 16 votes); (6) Yim Pok-chin (50, DP; West-B, Kwangju; 14 votes); (7) Sin Kye-ryun (39, DP; Songbuk-B, Seoul; 14 votes); (8) Pak Sok-mu (50, DP; Muan, North Cholla; 13 votes); (9) Pak Myong-hwan (55, DLP; Mapo-B, Seoul; 12 votes); (10) Son Hak-kyu (47, DLP; Kwangmyong, Kyonggi; 11 votes) Yi Hae-chan, who won the most votes in the previous survey, retained his top place, followed by Yi Sok-hyon, a freshman assemblyman. Conspicuous is the rise of Son Hak-kyu who made the top ten only seven months after his election in an April by-election. The fact that the list includes as many as four former activists seems to point to the successful performances of the ex-activists since their move into the chedokwon [conservative camp]. It is noteworthy that those who had been active participants in the democratization movements until they were elected to the National Assembly are being favorably viewed as assemblymen, too. Needless to say, some object to this observation. They contend that such ratings by reporters are more a propensity analysis than a political analysis. Their point is that the preconceived notions of reporters--who are hoping for an end to outdated political styles--would prompt them to take the side of those reformists who are in the same age bracket and share similar values with them. A reporter said: "For instance, dominant in 'Assembly Sketch'-type articles these days are comments by party executives and crusaders for clean politics. They carry no stories about the middle group." Young assemblymen's public relations strategy, he observed, appears to be working as a factor attracting young reporters. Anyway, the top ten list seems to indicate that the former activists impressed the reporters with their image of diligence, while assemblymen like Kang Chang-song and Yim Pok-chin, both defense and foreign policy experts, and Kim Won-ung, who is a rare ex-businessman among opposition assemblymen, earned their high ratings by distinguishing themselves in their respective fields. Kim Won-kil, Pak Myong-hwan and Pak Sok-mun are also known for "diligence" in their parliamentary activities. One thing to be noted is that except Yi Hae-chan and Pak Sok-mu, they are all freshman assemblymen. Of the top ten picked in the same category in the previous survey of the 13th National Assembly, six were reelected to the 14th National Assembly--Yi He-chan, Yi Chol, Pak Sok-mu, Cho Se-hyong, Kim Yong-chin, and Kim Won-ki. Of the six, only two made it this time. The fact that the ratings on ruling party assemblymen are relatively low seems to have something to do with structural matters. Undoubtedly, it comes in part from the fundamental nature of the ruling party which is basically the government party. In addition, before proceedings begin in the National Assembly, ruling party assemblymen are already required to comply with decisions made in the party-government consultation processes; as a result, they naturally cannot be as offensive as opposition assemblymen. Nowadays, some ruling party assemblymen criticize the government and present alternative policies like opposition assemblymen do. But the survey found that their activities are not forceful enough to impress the reporters. With all these things taken into consideration, the fact that only two DLP assemblymen are ranked among the top ten still seems to point to the need for redoubled efforts on the part of ruling party assemblymen. From the national constituency, which is of the nature of professional representation in that it gives specialists in specific fields an opportunity to be elected to the National Assembly, only Kang Chang-song made the top ten, a fact indicative of how active national constituency assemblymen are in their legislative activities. The tally also included the following results: 10 votes: Che Chong-ku (DP); 9 votes: Kim Yong-chin (DP), Pak Sang-chon (DP); 8 votes: Pak Kye-tong (DP), Pak Chong-ung (DLP); 5 votes: Kang Sam-chae (DLP), Kang Su-rim (DP), Kim Hyong-o (DLP), Na Pyong-son (DP), Yim Chae-chong (DP), Chang Chun-ik (DP), Han Hwa-kap (DP); 4 votes: Kang Kyong-sik (DLP), Kim Pyong-o (DP), Pak Pom-chin (DLP), Song Tu-ho (DLP), Chong Kyun-hwan (DP); 3 votes: Kim Chung-wi (DLP), Pak Chu-chon (DLP), Yi Pu-yong (DP); 2 votes: Kang Chae-sop (DLP), Kim Yong-il (DLP), Kim Chung-cho (DP), Na O-yon (DLP), Pak Chi-won (DP), Pak Hon-ki (DLP), Paek Nam-chi (DLP), Song Chon-yong (DLP), Won Hye-yong (DP), Yu In-tae (DP), Yi Kyu-taek (DP), Yi Yun-su (DP), Chong Sang-yong (DP) The number of assemblymen who received two or more votes was 44 or 14.7 percent of the 299 total number of assemblymen. Meanwhile, 24 assemblymen got one vote each. This means that 68 assemblymen--22.7 percent of the total number of assemblymen--impressed the reporters with their legislative activities. Assemblymen who received a single vote are: Kim Yong-kwang, Kim Yong-ku, Kim Pyong-il, Kim Un-hwan, Kim In-yong, Kim Hae-sok, No Sung-u, Mun Chong-su, Mun Hui-sang, Pak Kwang-tae, Pak Il, Pak Tae-yong, So Sang-mok, Sin Ki-ha, Sin Sun-pom, Yi Kon-yong, Yi Ho- chong, Yi Hwan-ui, Chong Tae-chol, Cho Se-hyong, Cho Sun-hyong, Cho Il- hyon, Cha Su-myong, Choe Yong-han. Yi Pu-yong Picked as Most Promising The second question was about the future of individual assemblymen. While the first question was about the "accomplishments" to date, this one was about the "potential." Yi Pu-yong was found leading overwhelmingly in this category. The top ten are: (1) Yi Pu-yong (51, DP; Kangdong-A, Seoul; 51 votes); (2) Yi Hae-chan (41, DP; Kwanak-B, Seoul; 26 votes); (3) Son Hak-kyu (47, DLP; Kwangmyong, Seoul; 19 votes); (4) Kang Chae-sop (46, DLP; West-B, Taegu; 13 votes); (5) Che Chong-ku (49, DP; Kwangmyong, Sihung, Kyonggi; 15 votes); (6) Kang Sam-chae (41, DLP; Hoewon,, Masan; 13 votes); (6) Kim Tok-yong (52, DLP; Socho-B, Seoul; 13 votes); (8) Yi Hyop (52, DP; Iri, North Cholla; 9 votes); (9) Chong Tae-chol (49, DP; Chung, Seoul; 8 votes); (9) Han Hwa-kap (56, DP; Sinan, South Cholla; 8 votes) It is recalled here that Yi Pu-yong, pressing for new politics as a leader of the reformist group in the DP, received only three votes in the category of "accomplishments." Equally noteworthy is the fact that Kim Tok-yong, who received not a single vote in that category, and Chong Tae-chol, who received only one vote in the same, were respectively ranked in the 6th and 9th spot in this category about how promising individual assemblymen are. The landslide for Yi Pu-yong can be attributed to the fact that the assemblyman whose name was already a synonym for reform has successfully adapted himself to real politics, and that he is one of the reform leaders in the National Assembly. It seems that reporters gave Yi Hae-chan, Son Hak-kyu, Che Chong-ku and Yi Hyop high points for their potential as reformists. As for DLP spokesman Kang Chae-sop, ranked in the fourth place, he and reporters find congeniality in each other for the age factor. Moreover, he is one of the most clear-headed and brilliant. These things and his successful move to the YS [Kim Yong-sam] group apparently brought him high ratings in this category. Kim Tok-yong, first minister of state, and Chong Tae-chol are respectively viewed as the ruling and opposition party champion of the new generation. Kang Sam-chae is deeply involved in the reform program of the DP as a real power of the RDP [former Reunification Democratic Party] faction; in addition, his age seems to make him a promising assemblyman. These factors must have been taken into account. As for Han Hwa-kap, reporters apparently considered the fact that he is seen as the next representative of the Tonggyo-tong faction "vacated by Kim Tae-chung." People say that the way Han Hwa-kap is acting these days makes them think of Kim Tae-chung, stirring nostalgia among them. The following is the tally on other assemblymen in this category: 7 votes: Sin Kye-ryun (DP), Yi Chol (DP), Hong Sa-tok (DP); 6 votes: Kim Won-kil (DP), So Sang-mok (DLP); 5 votes: Pak Sok-mu (DP), Cho Se-hyong (DP); 4 votes: Kim Won-ki (DP), Paek Nam-chi (DLP), Yu Chun-sang (DP), Yi Ki-taek (DP), Yi Sok-hyon (DP), Han Kwang-ok (DP); 3 votes: Kim Yun-hwan (DLP), Kim Yong-o (DLP), Mun Hui-sang (DP), Pak Kye-tong (DP), Pak Sang-chon (DP), Pak Chong-ung (DLP), Pak Chi-won (DP), Pak Hon-ki (DLP), Yi In-che (DLP); 2 votes: Kang Chang-hui (independent), Kim Won-ung (DP), Kim Yong-il (DLP), Kim Chung-wi (DLP), Kim Chung-cho (DP), Na Ung-pae (DLP), Pak Myong-hwan (DLP), Pak Pom-chin (DLP), Won Hye-yong (DP), Yim Chae-chong (DP), Chong Kyun-hwan (DP), Chong Sang-yong (DP), Choe Chae-uk (DLP) Altogether, 45 assemblymen or 15 percent of the entire assemblymen received two or more votes. Meanwhile 33 received one vote each and they were: Kang Su-rim, Kang In-sop, Kim Sang-hyon, Kim Yong-ku, Kim Chong-ho, Na O-yon, No Chae-pong, Pak Kyong-su, Pak Sil, Pak Un-tae, Pak Chong-hun, Pak Chu- chon, Pak Chan-chong, So Hun, Son Se-il, Song Chon-yong, Sin Ki-ha, Sin Sang-u, O Chong-sop, Yi Kil-chae, Yi Man-sop, Yi Sun-chae, Yi Yong-sam, Chang Sok-hwa, Chang Chae-sik, Chong Mong-chun, Cho Pu-yong, Cho Sun- hyong, Cho Yong-chang, Choe Pyong-yol, Choe Hyong-u, Ho Kyong-man, Hwang Nak-chu. The third question was about credibility among colleagues. Yi Pu-yong topped the list in this category, too. Unlike in other categories, more senior party leaders made the top ten. Another characteristic point was that votes were more scattered. The following are the top ten and ties (13 in total): (1) Yi Pu-yong (51, DP; Kangdong-A, Seoul; 22 votes); (2) Kim Yun-hwan (61, DLP; Sinsan, Kunwi, Kyonggi; 16 votes); (3) Yi Man-sop (61, DLP; national constituency; 11 votes); (3) Yi Hyop (52, DP; Iri, North Cholla; 11 votes); (5) Che Chong-ku (49, DP; Kwangmyong, Sihung, Kyonggi; 10 votes); (6) Cho Se-hyong (62, DP; Songdong-B, Seoul; 9 votes); (6) Kim Won-ki (56, DP; Chongju, Chongup, North Cholla; 9 votes); (8) Kang Chae-sop (46, DLP; West-B, Taegu; 7 votes); (9) Yi Hae-chan (41, DP; Kwanak-B, Seoul; 6 votes); (9) Chong Tae-chol (49, DP; Chung, Seoul; 6 votes) (9) Cho Sun-sung (64, DP; Sungju, South Cholla; 6 votes); (9) Choe Hyong-u (58, DLP; Tongnae-B, Pusan; 6 votes); (9) Kan Kwang-ok (52, DP; Kwanak-A, Seoul; 6 votes) That an assemblyman enjoys high credibility among colleagues can be interpreted in a variety of ways. First, it suggests that he is sociable and is respected. It could also mean that he is practicing politics on the basis of debate and compromise. Those listed among the top ten are mostly known for their relatively modest and reasonable lines. In this sense, the fact that assemblymen like Yi Pu-yong, Yi Hyop, Che Chong-ku and Yi Hae-chan are ranked high in this category disproves, in effect, the common knowledge that ex-activists who are "making important contributions to legislative activities and considered promising assemblymen" are usually not rated as high in the "credibility among assemblymen" category. At the same time, it carries a lesson to assemblymen who are the subjects of criticism that their excessive elitism and radical style are alienating themselves from colleagues. Kim Yun-hwan of the DLP, ranked second in the top ten, is reportedly in an ill mood these days because of Yu Song-hwan of the RDP faction in the same party, who attempted to make an issue of his past record. He has continued to move up the ladder since the Yusin era [under President Pak Chong-hui] and is currently expected to play a "godfather" role for the DJP [former Democratic Justice Party] faction which is under the pressure of the RDP faction. The high ratings of his popularity among assemblymen seem to reflect the perceived "hopes" of the DJP faction as well as the affability of Kim Yun-hwan himself. Speaker Yi Man-sop came, conspicuously, in the third place. The ratings for him seem to reflect sentiments of assemblymen pinning their hopes on his declaration that "a speaker of the National Assembly should never allow himself to be influenced by Chongwadae" and that "while I am the speaker, there will be no railroading by surprise." As for Kang Chae-sop, DLP spokesman, it is observed that his deft handling of personal relationships led to the ratings. Ratings for other assemblymen: 5 votes: Kim Tok-kyu, Yi Han-tong; 4 votes: Kim Pyong-o, Pak Chol-on, Sin Sun-pom, Yu In-tae, Yi Chol, Cho Sun-hyong, Hwang Nak-chu; 3 votes: Kang Sam-chae, Kim Chong-ho, Kim Chung-wi, Kim Chin-chae, Kim Tae-sik, Na Ung-pae, Pak Sok-mu, Pak Hon-ki, Sin Kyong-sik, Sin Sang-u, Choe Chae-uk, Han Hwa-kap; 2 votes: Kang Chang-song, Kang Chang-hui, Kim Tok-yong, Kim Pyong-o, Kim Yong-ku, Kim Won-kil, Kim Won-ung, Kim Chung-cho, Pak Kyong-su, Pak Sang-chon, Pak Hui-tae, Paek Nam-chi, Son Hak-kyu, O Se-ung, Yi Sang- tuk, Yi Song-ho, Yi Chun-ku, Yim Pok-chin, Chang Chun-ik, Chang Chae- sik, Chong Pil-kun, Hwang Nak-chu. Altogether, 57 assemblymen received two or more votes, while 48 received one vote each. In the above three categories, Yi Hae-chan is the only assemblyman who made the top ten in all of them. He topped the list in the "legislative activity" category, in the second place in the "promising assemblyman" category, and in the ninth in the "credibility" category. Meanwhile, in Yi Pu-yong's case, he emerged at the top in two categories but fell way behind in the "legislative activity." Other assemblymen who made the top ten in two categories are: Son Hak-kyu ("promising" and "legislative activity"), Kang Chae-sop, Yi Hyop, Che Chong-ku, and Chong Tae-chol ( "promising" and "credibility"). The fourth question was who the reporters think are misfits as assemblyman. In this category, 101 assemblymen received one or more votes. (The number of them who received two votes or more was 57.) Of the top ten, seven were DLP assemblymen, two DP, and one UPP [United People's Party]. The first place went to Rep. "B" of North Kyongsang (DLP, 27 votes), followed by Rep. "B" of South Chungchong (DLP, 18 votes), Rep. "Y" of the national constituency (DLP, 18 votes), Rep. "J" of North Chungchong (DP, 14 votes), Rep. "J" of Kyonggi (UPP, 13 votes), Rep. "K" of North Kyongsang (DLP, 12 votes), Rep. "Y" of the national constituency (DLP, 9 votes), Rep. "K" of North Kyongsang (DLP, 8 votes), Rep. "P" of Seoul (DP, 8 votes), and Rep. "J" of Taegu (DLP, 7 votes). Such being their ratings of the 14th National Assembly, what do the reporters see as its problems? The survey found 48.6 percent (35 persons) citing "the lack of vision in leading the civilian government era" as the biggest problem, followed by 22.2 percent (16 persons) picking "the National Assembly Law and the way it is being steered," 18.1 percent (13 persons) accusing the legislature of being swayed too much by the party interests, and 11.1 percent (8 persons) charging that assemblymen are preoccupied with the interests of their constituencies and of themselves. In the previous survey, 58.6 percent of the respondents saw "political activities swayed by the party interests" as the biggest problem of the 13th National Assembly. The lower percentage this time is interpreted as the public demand for a legislature worthy of the civilian government era has been overwhelming. Both at the time of its launching and during the recent regular session, it demonstrated the lingering old practices. Reporters are of the opinion that they will very likely be compelled to highlight the same unresolved problems again. The reporters were also asked what they felt while watching assemblymen's parliamentary activities. To this question, 34.7 percent (25 persons) pointed out that "the levels of individual assemblymen should improve," while 29.2 percent (21 persons) noted that "political parties should be democratized" and 8.3 percent (6 persons) cited the need for amendments to the National Assembly Law and for reasonable management of parliament. Those who cited the need for solution to the political fund issue were only 2 persons (2.8 percent). This indicates that as far as reporters are concerned, they had drawn the conclusion that in order for the National Assembly and its members to act as they should, assemblymen and political parties have to change, and that there are no other ways after all. To the question concerning influences affecting parliamentary activities of the 14th National Assembly, 32 persons (44.4 percent) picked media, followed by 22 persons (30.6 percent) citing party leadership, and 13 persons (18.1 percent) naming the administration. It was confirmed that of the respondents who named the administration, many included Chongwadae. In the previous survey, 54.3 percent cited party leadership and 27.8 percent media. As politicians exposed to public scrutiny, it is quite natural that assemblymen are sensitive to media. Hence, the joke that "assemblymen and reporters are the kings in the assembly hall." Only two reporters picked constituents and public organizations as the major influence on the National Assembly. (One reporter made no response.) The survey found that there are virtually no other major influences affecting assemblymen. This is viewed as meaning that the authority and status of the assemblyman is that high. Currently, political parties represented in the National Assembly are the DLP, DP, UPP, the New Korea Party and the Sinjong Party. The reporters were asked which party they think has been most effective in the bargaining in the 14th National Assembly. The result: 72.2 percent (52 persons) picked the DP and 20.8 percent (15 persons) the DLP, while two cited the independents but not a single reporter paid attention to the UPP, the Sinjong Party or the New Korea Party. Meanwhile, three reporters wrote in a separate pick, "I see no party befitting this category." To evaluate the National Assembly and individual assemblymen is not an easy task. It requires comprehensive analyses of all remarks in the parliament by the assemblyman, his legislative and social activities, as well as the role he plays inside his party. Needless to say, the work requires fairly high levels of professional knowledge. Also, for the fairest possible ratings, it is necessary to consider evaluations by related people, too. Before this type of full-scale evaluations are attempted, we have shown you the appraisals by the reporters assigned to the coverage of the National Assembly, political parties and individual assemblymen. Needless to say, their evaluations are of undeniable importance. As we said earlier, they cover political developments live and therefore are considered fit for the task. Therein lies the significance of this survey, we believe. Anyhow, it is expected that the full-scale evaluations of the 14th National Assembly will be carried out in late 1995 in advance of the 1996 general election for the 15th National Assembly. What we have presented are a kind of interim evaluations. The results so far seem to point to a mixture of potential hopes and disappointments. Our parliament and its members undoubtedly have their problems but it is also true that there is an effort under way for a rebirth and that we have fine assemblymen with gifts, capabilities and excellent political records. For all this, we feel that we can pin our hopes on the 14th National Assembly. Moreover, along with the foregone conclusion that to have a National Assembly is better than having none, there is the national consensus that our legislature should develop further in the future. For this fact, too, we can attach our hopes to the future of the 14th National Assembly.
