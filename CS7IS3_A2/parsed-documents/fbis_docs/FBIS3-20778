It was stated that the committee had reliable information that Dzakula had been brought before the district court in Glina [republic of Serbian Krajina] only yesterday and that criminal proceedings had been instituted against him. According to the same information, signs of torture were visible on Dzakula, and he had not been provided with medical or legal aid. The committee believes that this news should be confirmed officially and that the Government of Serbia should explain why Dzakula has been deprived of freedom, on whose orders he was arrested, and to which ministry in Serbia he was handed over. In the continuation of the news conference, it was stated that the committee had also turned to the official bodies and institutions of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but that there had been no response. Also, it was proposed that the case be handed over to the authorities of the civilian sector of the United Nations in charge of the republic of Serbian Krajina zones. It is important, as regards the Dzakula case, to hear from the service that several days ago issued a communique stating that Dzakula had been brought to Glina, because, as the committee claims, this was not true, since Dzakula was brought before the district court in Glina only the day before yesterday. The committee believes that there is a pressing need to provide legal protection to all citizens at this moment. The country has entered a phase of unrestrained terror, it was concluded at yesterday's news conference on the Dzakula case.
