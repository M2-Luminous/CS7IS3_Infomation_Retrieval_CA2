Jose Miguel Alfaro has a live report from La Moneda Palace: [Alfaro] Good afternoon, in an unusual event in our history President Frei began his administration by meeting with business people from 20 countries as a demonstration of the new government's intention to continue the process of introducing Chile to the international market. Let us look at the report we prepared: [Begin recording] [Alfaro] The president began the first day of his administration early this morning in La Moneda Palace. He then went to Carreras Hotel to open a meeting with the business people. He reiterated that it is a moral responsibility and an important economic objective for his government to eradicate extreme poverty. To do that he said it is necessary that Chile double its income during the next decade. [Frei, in progress] ...of what I said, I do not want to fail to mention that in Chile we are not willing to sacrifice our culture or our national identity or the values of equity or solidarity or deteriorate the qualify of our standard of living and environment or put our political and social stability at stake for the sole purpose of achieving economic growth. [Alfaro] President Frei concluded his speech by inviting the business people to do business in the country, and in this manner cooperate with the progress of Chile. He said the larger private investment is, the larger the public investment to overcome poverty will be. After President Frei finished his speech, the speakers were Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat, Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia, and Public Works Minister Ricardo Lagos. The following is a report from Arturo Harlen. [Harlen] More than 100 of the most important world business people are meeting in Carreras Hotel this morning. They are getting familiar with the Chilean conditions for foreign investment. This meeting gave an opportunity to the new ministers from the economic area to disclose their policies. Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat pointed out the private sector's participation in the country's development and explained the benefits offered by Chile to foreign investors. He noted that the new economic officials have made a commitment to maintain clear rules and the country's stability, especially for investors. [Aninat] The stability of the rules, the continuity of growth, and the importance of investment and savings to create more and better jobs are basic commitments for this government. The Finance Ministry I head and the economic team in general will not fail to maintain the stability that was achieved with so much effort in the country. [Harlen] Public Works Minister Ricardo Lagos said this government has the challenge of providing the country with an infrastructure compatible with a growth with social justice. He noted that ports, airports, and highways must be modernized. He said he has identified about 1,600 projects that are essential to achieve development. He said a large part of these projects will be given to private companies for their construction, which means a great opportunity for new business deals. Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat indicated that growth close to 4.5 percent is expected this year and that with this growth Chile will be completing 11 years of continuous economic growth. [end recording] [Alfaro] I would like to note that President Frei will hold a luncheon for the participants of the meeting with world business people in the next few minutes. This is all the information I have from La Moneda Palace. Back to the studio.
