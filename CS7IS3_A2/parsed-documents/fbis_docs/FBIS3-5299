The advisory committee for energy, a panel of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said the existing projection, worked out in June 1990, will be replaced in May by new forecasts for 2000 and 2010. The group said energy consumption has been expanding at a faster pace than it projected while supply growth is expected to remain slow. The panel said the prospect for energy supply is dim because the development of alternate energy sources has become stagnant and the construction of new nuclear power plants has been hampered due to difficulty in finding construction sites. The current outlook puts an annual average increase of Japan's energy consumption at 1.6 percent toward the year 2000. The panel said domestic consumption, which bloated during the "bubble economy," continued to rise at an average rate of over 3 percent despite the recession. It also noted that Japan's dependence on crude oil has not declined as expected because of low oil prices. The committee said the new outlook will incorporate a plan to promote the use of alternate energy sources which discharge lower levels of carbon dioxide than fossil fuels to meet the government-set goal for per-capita CO2 emissions.
