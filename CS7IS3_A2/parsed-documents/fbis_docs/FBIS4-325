CNN's Brent Sadler interviewed King Goodwill Zwelithini and asked him about his expectations ahead of the summit. [Begin recording] [Sadler] Your Majesty, what do you expect to happen during these talks? [Zwelithini] Actually, if they can just show if the outcome could be a recognition of the sovereign kingdom of the Zulu nation, if the acceptance should take place, I would be very much grateful to see that. It means that the Zulu kingdom, it's not threatened in the new government. Nobody will touch it. I pray to the almighty God that it must be the time where maybe the turning point should take place and everybody be made to understand each other and to listen to each other's problems. [Sadler] Do you fear that a new ANC-led government would wish to crush Zulu independence? [Zwelithini] If there is any wish of that from any political party that will win in ... that will win elections, thinking of crushing KwaZulu, that would be a very big mistake because within the ANC there is some of my people who are members of the ANC, and then in each and every party that will take over, that might win the elections, there is some of my people that are members of that party so it will be a disgrace if the government that might win elections will think of crushing KwaZulu because KwaZulu is there. It has been there before the white man set his foot here. I am not supportive to anyone being killed, especially as the king of the people. I don't like to lead the dead. I want to lead the living. It's a very dramatic thing that my people today find themselves fighting against each other and killing against each other when they need to get together and face a new future with a bright things that might happen for the Zulu people and the whole of South Africa. [Sadler] Do you expect your people to vote or not in the elections? [Zwelithini] I won't advise my people to vote. I have never said that they mustn't go to vote, but the only thing that has made me to take an initiative of not advising my people to vote is because I didn't know what my position and the position of my people is going to be in a new South Africa. [Sadler] Do you think your intervention on the political scene, by calling for sovereignty, was something of a gamble? [Zwelithini] I was not gambling. I just wanted to make the negotiators to understand the importance of any other race group in this country. All political parties should just get their minds together and look at the issue as it is. I am not expecting to see that there are too many bloodshed that is going to take place because I'm not....[pauses] I was born not to be a man who must create bloodshed. I know that my hands are clean. I'm not the one who has created ... who has made this country to be what it is at the moment and I'm not the one who have sent the people to be killed. I have never instructed anybody to kill anyone because I believe that through negotiations, on peaceful structures, peace will be created.
