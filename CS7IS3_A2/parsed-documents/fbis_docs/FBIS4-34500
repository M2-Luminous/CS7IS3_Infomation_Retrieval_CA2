The association is calling on the Christian people of Haiti to resist, and reminds them that, like the people of Israel, the defense of the homeland against the attack of invaders, is sacred. According to the Association of Committed Protestant Pastors and Leaders, the embargo that the association calls unfair and criminal, imposed on Haiti by the international community, constitutes an attack on human rights, and the various UN resolutions are an open invitation for an invasion of the Haitian national territory and violates the spirit of the organization. The association notes that several political and socioprofessional organizations have made proposals for a solution to the crisis, and that the international community has faced failure after failure in its attempt to restore a fictitious democracy in Haiti. Therefore, the Association of Committed Protestant Pastors and Leaders calls on the Christian people to organize a resistance and reminds them that like the people of Israel, the defense of the homeland against invaders is sacred. This press release was signed by Dr. Jacques Jovin, president of the Association of Committed Protestant Pastors and Leaders.
