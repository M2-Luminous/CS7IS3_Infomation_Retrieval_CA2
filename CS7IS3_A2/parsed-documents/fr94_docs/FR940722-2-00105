The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. The Company is a mutual life insurance company organized under the laws of Minnesota. It is licensed to do business in all States except New York (where it is an authorized reinsurer), the District of Columbia, Canada and Puerto Rico. 2. The Separate Account, registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act, is a segregated investment account of the Company that funds the Contracts and other variable annuities contracts. The Separate Account is divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests solely in the shares of one of the following management investment companies: The Index 500 and Money Market Portfolios of MIMLIC Series Fund, Inc., Vanguard Wellington Fund, the Vanguard Long Term Corporation Bond Portfolio of Vanguard Fixed Income Securities Fund, Inc., Scudder International Fund, Inc., Fidelity Contrafund, Inc., and Janus Twenty Fund. 3. The Contracts are group deferred variable annuity contracts designed to provide benefits under deferred compensation plans of State and local governments and other tax-exempt organizations as provided in section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In a typical plan, the sponsor or eligible governmental unit is the owner of the Contract and will designate individuals eligible to become participants in the Contracts. The Contracts and all interests under them are subject to the general interests of creditors of the owners of the Contracts. 4. MIMLIC Sales Corporation, registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, is the principal underwriter of the Contracts. 5. There is an annual Contract administration charge of 0.15 that is deducted in reliance on Rule 26a&hyph;1. This charge may be increased to 0.40% provided the charge could continue to be deducted in reliance on Rule 26a&hyph;1. 6. The Contracts do not provide for a front-end sales charge to be deducted from purchase payments. Instead, a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') of up to 6% of the amount withdrawn or surrendered is charged. Applicants represent that the sum of the CDSC charges deducted will not exceed 9% of purchase payments made by or on behalf of a participant. The following table shows the applicable percentage for withdrawals or surrenders in the first month of each of the first seven participation years: ‚ê£ 1During participation month 1Deferred sales charge (percent) 1 6 13 5 25 4 37 3 49 2 61 1 73 and thereafter 0 7. The Company will deduct a mortality and expense risk charge that is equal, on an annual basis, to 1.25% of the average daily net asset value of the Separate Account: approximately .60% for mortality risks and .85% for expense risks. The current level of the proposed charge is 0.85%, of which 0.40% is for mortality risks and 0.45% is for expense risks. The mortality risks assumed by the Company arise from its guarantees to make annuity payments as provided in the Contracts regardless of how long a participant lives and regardless of any improvement in life expectancy of participants as a class. Also, the Company bears mortality risks associated with the Contract's death benefit provision. The expense risk assumed by the Company arise in connection with the Company's guarantees to make annuity payments in accordance with annuity tables provided in the Contracts regardless of whether the Company's estimates of expenses is correct over the life of the Contracts.
