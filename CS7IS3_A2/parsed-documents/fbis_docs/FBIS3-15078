The problematic situation on the occupied Palestinian territories, the result of the barbaric crime of an Israeli extremist in Hebron, encourages Russia to make further active moves in order to overcome the present crisis phase in the peace process in the Middle East -- which appear under threat, the statement says. The document also points out that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev maintains permanent contact with the Palestinian and Israeli leadership to look for optimal forms of Russian assistance for the sake of returning to a peaceful settlement. Russia's first deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov was sent to the Middle East on the private instruction of the Russian president to meet with the PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli leadership. Moscow believes that the idea of sending international supervisors to the West Bank of the Jordan River and Gaza Strip "deserves serious attention." "This would facilitate bringing about Palestinian self-management there," says the statement. The new "obstacle" in the Middle Eastern talks demonstrates that there is a need for "a new international impulse" to reconcile the Arabs and Israelis. Another plenary meeting of the Madrid conference on the Middle East, on the level of Foreign Ministers, could become such an impetus, believes Moscow. Speaking about the nearest prospects, the statement says that Russia advocates continuation of bilateral negotiations to be conducted in places convenient for their participants.
