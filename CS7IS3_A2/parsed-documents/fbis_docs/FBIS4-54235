The report notes that the positive financial and economic changes of the past few years have been sustained, which brought about rather comprehensive progress in the fields of economic production, goods circulation, finance-monetary and foreign trade with a higher growth rate compared with the corresponding period in the past few years. `The winter-spring crop is expected to achieve the highest output so far, up one million tonnes compared with last year (or an increase of 10 per cent), the agricultural economic structure has initially reformed to the direction of increasing the rates of industrial crops especially trees, animal breeding, particularly aquaculture and non-farming occupations. `The industrial production in the period under review is expected to increase 12 per cent compared with the same period last year (the target put forth for the whole year is 11 per cent), with the synchronous development of all economic sectors, of cities and industrial zones'... ...`The export value is estimated at an increase of 27 percent (seven per cent higher than the yearly target), import value is expected to increase 23.4 percent. The foreign Official Development Aid (ODA) sources signed in the first quarter of this year has doubled the 1993 amount. The direct foreign investment projects licensed in the first half of 1994 had a total legal capital of USD 2 billion, or two-thirds of last year's figure... `The total value of retail sales is expected up by 37.6 per cent, meeting the diversified demands of the population with higher incomes and consumption power. Goods and passengers transportation, domestic and international tourism, and other services have broadened rapidly. Price indexes of retail sale and service in the first fourth months of this year increased 5.4 per cent, mainly for food and foodstuffs during Tet holidays. But since March the prices have returned stability'. The report also notes that `with economic growth and the income increase of a major part of the population, socio-cultural activities have been improved remarkably'. `The external relations of the country continue to be broadened and strengthened in the direction of multi-lateralization and diversification. The exchange of visits made by high-ranking leaders of Vietnam and other countries, especially those in the region has contributed to the promotion of mutual understanding, and enhancement of multisided cooperation. After the resumption of relations of international monetary and financial organizations with Vietnam, the lifting of the US trade embargo against Vietnam in early this year has created new, favourable conditions for the process of normalization of relations between Vietnam and the US, thereby pushing up the cooperative relations between Vietnam and other countries as well as international organizations. `Vietnam's international relations have been developing rather quickly in a positive trend, thus making contributions to the environment of peace, stability and cooperation for national defence and construction. However, there have been complicated developments in our border areas, the most outstanding of which are recent violations of our country's exclusive economic zones and continental shelf, and the developments in Cambodia include many worrysome factors. On major issues to be settled in the second half of this year, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said that great efforts should be made to continue to make the country's finance and monetary system healthy and stable, to keep the state budget balance, to control the inflation rate at single digit increase, to ensure the construction progress of major projects and create more conditions to promote investment of all economic sectors. On the broadening of external relations and economy, Vice P.M. Khai said that `complicated and sensitive external relations require us to be more vigilant, dynamic and creative in the implementation of a foreign policy of independence and sovereignty to bring into full play the strength of the entire nation in combination with international strength in order to cope with current challenges, and take advances to opportunities to step up industrialization and modernization of the country'. [sentence as received] Mr. Khai went on: `We are actively settling outstanding issues and disputes with some countries through peaceful negotiation. We are ready to proceed to normalization with the united states, to join ASEAN and enter into multi-sided cooperation in the Pacific region, and at the same time to continue consolidating and expanding cooperative ties with all countries and international organizations. `Together with the enhancement of state-level relations it is necessary to develop cooperative ties in the economic, scientific and technical, cultural fields, expand cooperation with non-governmental organizations, and people to people contacts and enhance foreign information service'. Mr. Khai said that the government is preparing an overall project for developing external economy in the new situation, and he pointed out some tasks to be done from now to the end of the year. These tasks include guiding the implementation of new regulations on managing and distributing the Official Development Assistance (ODA) from foreign countries, improving the environment and attracting direct foreign investment, actively implementing the National Assembly's resolution on practice thrift, fighting against corruption and smuggling, effectively expanding and raising the quality of scientific, educational, cultural and social welfare activities, and pushing up economic reforms in combination with administrative reforms.
