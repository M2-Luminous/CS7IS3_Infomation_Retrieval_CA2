ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: The Agency published two Appendices to a final regulation at 52 FR 13378 (April 22, 1987). This document corrects errors in Appendices A and B to 40 CFR Part 355. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Ferris, Chemical Engineer, Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office, 5101, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW, Washington, DC 20460. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Information Hotline can also be contacted at 1&hyph;800&hyph;535&hyph;0202. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Agency has identified the following typographical and other technical errors in the Federal Register of April 22, 1987. The listing of ``paraquat'' in appendices A and B of Part 355 should read ``paraquat dichloride.'' This change is to be consistent with the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number identified on the extremely hazardous substances (EHS) list. Paraquat dichloride is the only commercially available paraquat salt in the United States. ``Phenylthiourma'' in 40 CFR Part 355, Appendix A should read ``phenylthiourea'' (typographical error). The listing of hydrogen chloride in 40 CFR part 355, Appendix B should read ``hydrogen chloride (gas only)'' (typographical error). ``Quabain'' in 40 CFR Part 355, Appendix B should read ``ouabain'' (typographical error).

Appendix B to Part 355_The List of Extremely Hazardous Substances and Their Threshold Planning Quantities 3. In Appendix B, for CAS # 1910&hyph;42&hyph;5, the chemical name is revised to read ``paraquat dichloride''; for CAS # 7647&hyph;01&hyph;0, the entry ``hydrogen chloride'' is revised to read ``hydrogen chloride (gas only)''; and for CAS # 630&hyph;60&hyph;4, the entry ``quabain'' is revised to read ``ouabain''.
