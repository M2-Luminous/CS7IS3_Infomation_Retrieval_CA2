Unlike many of our compatriots who have been taken prisoner of the populist criticism of Russia's fuel and energy complex, supposedly guilty of all the defects of the transition period, J. Guardino knows the subject of his research thoroughly. And we ourselves know it. But to be sure one wants very much to find a specific culprit for all misfortunes among those at the helm. Let's recall how many indignant attacks were made against just the miners alone, that it cost them to demand that the government settle up with them regarding debts... Let's recall that as regards energy-bearing resources, Russia is in a natural preeminent position in comparison with all the rest of the world. For example, we have more than 40 percent of the world's reserves of natural gas and coal and 20 percent of the oil. And what is more, the exportation of energy-bearing resources is a natural very important source of Russia's hard currency revenues. We export about 40 percent of the energy products produced, which constitutes almost half of all currency earnings. It would seem that given such a situation the fuel and energy complex should be the most prosperous sector of the Russian economy. In fact it is the sector with the most problems. The production of oil and coal is dropping every year. According to the forecasts of the specialists of the Russian Federation Ministry of Fuel and Energy, if such a trend is maintained then the country may turn into an importer of oil by 1995. It is difficult today to even imagine the consequences of such a situation. One can assume with a large share of probability that it will be simply impossible to carry out any reforms whatsoever under such conditions. At a pre-New Year meeting of the leaders of the most important enterprises of the fuel and energy complex the incorrect system of price formation was named as the chief cause of the sector's decline. Let's recall that the central government of Russia set the prices for almost 90 percent of all goods and services free in January 1992. However, it retained control of the prices for energy products. In fact fuel and energy rose in price more than 80 times that year by "administrative order." However, in spite of that the prices for coal, oil, and other domestic energy products remain far lower than the normal market level. They come to approximately 40 percent in comparison with international prices. Partially this is related to the sharp fall in the value of the ruble when the rubles in circulation were used for the payment of compensations when the prices for energy products in Russia increased. However, regardless of how much they have grown, administratively increased prices cannot be comparable with free market prices. Although it is clear that properly free prices, or the opportunity to set them, naturally will lead to an increase in the price of energy products on the domestic market. Terrible? Of course. However, as Yuriy Shafranik, Minister of Fuel and Energy, has cleverly observed concerning debtors "the one who pays is the one who is for reform. And the one who doesn't pay--although he shouts, he is not for reform. And no litmus papers whatever in the form of the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], PDP [not further identified] and any PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] are needed here." Of course, control over prices has substantially reduced the cost of energy for the Russians. But as a result we are using it carelessly and not at all as efficiently as the majority of the world's population. And here you can't do without strong economic levers. And, finally, a last consideration. An economy, all of whose sectors have been switched to market rails while power engineering, that locomotive of the entire economy, remains in administrative rods of iron, cannot in fact develop normally. There is no choice here. The rules of the game must be the same for all. Otherwise misfortune. This is only a small portion of the problems which were discussed at the meeting of the leaders of the fuel and energy complex. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA intends to watch the course of the reform in this leading branch of the country's economy very carefully. And already in the next few issues we will grant the floor to the most authoritative specialists and experts in this field.
