The forum was organized in connection with a third conference by economy, industry, and trade ministers of the seven most industrialized countries of the world (G-7) and of 10 countries undergoing reforms (E-10) [E-10: Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, Hungary], which begins on 6 May. "We are eager to see the participation of foreign capital not just in bilateral joint venture-type measures but also in multilateral ties. We are counting on capital involvement in the amount of over $1 billion per year. There cannot be a good economy without a stable economic policy, and this is exactly the kind of policy that the current government intends to implement, while creating the right climate for conducting profitable business," stated Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko, who is participating in the forum. According to Kolodko, Poland has already achieved significant economic results while the economy has good prospects for development. During a discussion, the entrepreneurs were wondering what must be done to make $200 billion worth of capital flow from the G-7 countries to the E-10 countries by the year 2000. By that time, the private sector in the countries undergoing reforms should produce 70 percent of the national product while the participation of these countries in trade exchange with G-7 should reach the level of 17-20 percent (right now, it is just 6-7 percent). High customs duties, lack of stability of legal systems, and weak promotion all make trade difficult, and they are not conducive to investments which are required, among others, in telecommunications, transportation, and road construction -- the businessmen stressed. NOWA EUROPA asked the U.S. Trade Secretary Ronald H. Brown what he expects from the conference, which is to begin Friday. "I expect," he said, "that this third conference on East-West cooperation will concentrate primarily on working out strategies within which the private sector will be able to contribute to the region's development to a larger extent than now, and also will contribute to the process of establishing new jobs. I would like to emphasize that Central and East Europe remains a very important and strategic region to us, particularly from the standpoint of the transformations taking place in the postcommunist countries. We think that the region also has a huge economic potential which the countries of East and Central Europe are trying to utilize in their striving for a market economy. The United States and all highly industrialized countries that are members of G-7 can help in this economic transformation."
