"If any sector in Mexico opposes the expeditious elimination of tariffs, this will not occur," Serra Puche emphasized within the framework of a revision that will be carried out by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiation teams. These teams will analyze a possible modification of the timetable for various production sectors. The official warned: "None of the NAFTA members are duty bound to modify the timetable for the elimination of tariffs," so "they will only carry out changes that are advisable for the Mexican production sector and economy." During a brief interview upon the conclusion of his participation in the Conference on North American Business Outlook, the commerce secretary said there is also enough time to carry out the necessary consultations to determine the approval or rejection of the nation's industrial community. He said if there is any objection from the production groups concerning the elimination of specific tariffs, the Mexican team will not bring those products to the negotiations. Jaime Serra emphasized the importance of conveying to the nation's production sector the guarantee that, although NAFTA considers the possibility of expediting the previously agreed upon elimination of tariffs, provided the involved parties previously agree to this, the measure will only be implemented in the areas that request it. The authorities will impose no advance measures to abate the tariffs, the commerce secretary insisted after his speech at the event, which was organized by the Conference Board and the private sector's Center for Economic Studies (CEESP). After various Mexican industry sector representatives rejected the expeditious elimination of the tariffs on their products, Serra urged production sector representatives to participate in the consultation process and determine in which areas a change should be requested. The goal was to guarantee -- as it was done throughout the NAFTA negotiation process -- agreements with the full support of those directly involved. He said the necessary consultations are being carried out through the Coordinator for Foreign Trade Business Organizations (COECE) to detect support for an expeditious elimination of tariffs, or the denial to renegotiate the deadline for trade opportunities in each sector.
