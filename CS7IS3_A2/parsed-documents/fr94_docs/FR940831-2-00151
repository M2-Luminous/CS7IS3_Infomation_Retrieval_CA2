FR940831-2-00151 FR940831-2-00106 3.3.1‚ê£Exchange and Commissary Expenditure Research Runzheimer used the same marketbasket items to price commissaries and exchanges as were used for the local pricings. We obtained one price quote for each marketbasket item surveyed in these facilities. Runzheimer did not assume that people with access to military facilities made all purchases in these facilities. Instead, we used OPM's 1980 Living Pattern Survey of federal employees to determine the percentage of purchases that families typically make in military facilities versus local outlets. These percentages were used to aggregate the local and commissary/exchange prices into one set of appropriate, blended prices. (The blended prices were compared to the local prices in the Washington, D.C., area just as each allowance area's local prices were.)
