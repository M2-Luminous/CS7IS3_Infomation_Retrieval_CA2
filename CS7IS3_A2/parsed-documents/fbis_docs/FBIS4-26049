On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, I extend warm congratulations and sincere greetings to all Huangpu alumni who are present today and through you, to all the academy's teachers and cadets at home and abroad. Seven decades ago, Dr. Sun Yat-sen -- the great patriot and pioneer of the democratic revolution in China -- summarized bitter the experience of repeated setbacks in the pursuit of national independence, freedom and democracy, and the people's happiness; resolutely reshuffled the Kuomintang [KMT]; and, with the support and assistance of the Comintern and the CPC, put forward the three major policies on "alliance with Russia and the Communists, and assistance to peasants and workers," thereby effecting the first cooperation between the KMT and the CPC. In order to set up a revolutionary army and use armed revolutionary forces to fight against armed counterrevolutionary forces, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, together with the Chinese Communists, represented by Zhou Enlai, jointly founded the Huangpu Military Academy. Imbued with the aspiration of serving the country, ardent young people from various parts of the country congregated at "revolutionary Huangpu," and one after another groups of revolutionary soldiers grew to maturity at the academy, becoming the backbone of the Northern Expedition. Noble-minded Huangpu cadets from both KMT and CPC waged a bloodbath battle side by side to "topple imperialist powers and eliminate warlords," thereby defeating the northern reactionary warlords. After the Japanese imperialists launched an all-out war of aggression against China, which put the Chinese nation at a critical juncture between life or death, the KMT and the CPC -- under the CPC-sponsored great banner of national united front against Japan -- cooperated once again and fought against Japan, thereby winning the great victory over foreign aggression. We shall forever cherish the memory of those Huangpu martyrs who made important contributions to repelling aggressors and safeguarding national independence. Seventy years have passed. The CPC and Comrade Mao Zedong led the Chinese people in accomplishing the democratic revolution, which Dr. Sun Yat-sen did not accomplish; and developed it into a socialist revolution. Earthshaking changes have taken place on the great earth of the motherland. The Chinese nation now stands erect in the east of the world and enjoys high esteem in the international community. Today China sees vigorous development in all fields of endeavor, and enjoys economic prosperity, political stability, national unity, and social progress. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and led by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, the Chinese people are seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, and opening up wider; and the magnificent ideal of building a prosperous, democratic, civilized modern socialist power is being gradually transformed into a reality through the great efforts of the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation working hard in a pioneering spirit. Achieving the motherland's peaceful reunification accords with the aspirations of the people and the demand of the nation; and it is the sacred mission of the Chinese people of all nationalities, including the compatriots in Taiwan. We shall continue to promote the cause of peaceful reunification under the concept of "one country, two systems." We have time and again stated our view that endorsing reunification means loving the country; and that differences existing between the two sides of the strait can be gradually resolved through increasing contacts and consultations under the principle of one China. Our stand has been praised and endorsed by farsighted people everywhere. We hope that the Taiwan authorities will weigh national interests above anything else and take practical measures to join us in accomplishing the great cause of motherland reunification. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said: "In reunification lies the hope of all countrymen who will enjoy happiness when reunification is realized. Failure to accomplish reunification will bring us suffering." The late Marshals Xu Xiangqign and Nie Rongzhen said in January 1990: "As the motherland has yet to be reunified, the alumni need to continue to exert themselves." The Huangpu Alumni Association has done tremendous work in promoting exchanges and contacts between the two sides of the strait in the last 10 years since its founding. We hope that you will redouble efforts to score even greater successes in the work. May Huangpu alumni on both sides of the strait unite and contribute more to the reunification of the motherland and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
