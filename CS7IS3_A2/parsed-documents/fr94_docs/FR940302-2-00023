United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;79 (CIT May 25, 1993), and Federal-Mogul Corporation v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, (CIT May 25, 1993). These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during the review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and sections 353.22 and 353.25(c) of the Department's regulations. Dated: February 23, 1994. Joseph A. Spectrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4774 Filed 3&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
