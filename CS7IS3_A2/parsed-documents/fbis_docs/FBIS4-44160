The British veto against [Belgian Prime Minister] Jean-Luc Dehaene is so categoric and seems so irrevocable that it has placed Mr. Major in a situation from which there is no escape: He must either climb down over Europe, which would split his Conservative Party that little bit more, or enter into open conflict with his European partners at a time when Germany and France are getting ready to take over, the one after the other, the European Union's presidency. John Major, who adopted a very Thatcher-like position in Corfu, chose his camp, alone against all the rest, and unable to rally to the consensus that formed around Jean-Luc Dehaene. This inflexibility would be to his credit if Major was defending a worthwhile cause. But it rather seems like a political move designed to win support at home at Europe's expense. Several British newspapers applauded his "courage" in their Sunday [26 June] editions. The aim has been achieved. Nobody can dispute Great Britain's right to demonstrate its difference and its insular nature. The problem today, with the lame compromise of the Maastricht Treaty, is that Great Britain is playing a double game. It is sufficiently involved in Europe to stop it moving forward, and sufficiently distanced to do what it likes. Jean-Luc Dehaene was right on Sunday to stress that the Corfu veto threatens to fuel the arguments of those who are arguing for a multispeed Europe. How can we not conclude from the British attitude that only a variable-geometry Europe can both accommodate the British and absorb an increasing pace of enlargement? A hard core would serve as a test and as an example. [sentence as published] And you can bet that London would very quickly be seeking to join it.
