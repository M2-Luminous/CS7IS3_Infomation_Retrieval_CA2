The delegation will be headed by Knesset Member [MK] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah. Darawshah says Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa personally intervened to make the historic visit possible. Here in Israel, a senior official in the Prime Minister's Office called the news of the Syrian decision encouraging. David Ze'ev reports: On Tuesday [15 February], Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said a positive reply to MK Darawshah's request would mark some kind of change in the Syrian attitude toward Israel. At the Prime Minister's Office last night, a senior source reacted by saying the fact that President al-Asad has given the Israeli Arab delegation permission to make the trip contains in it something encouraging. The source went on to say that there could be a connection between the positive Syrian reply and the recent statements coming out of Israel that Damascus is not showing any openness toward Israel. Both Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres have spoken out strongly on the issue during the past week. [Begin recording] [Darawshah] As I know, it's the first time that the Syrian Government is allowing any Israeli Arab citizen to enter Syria. [Ze'ev] When will you be going? [Darawshah] I suppose in the coming few days. We got the permission through the Egyptian ambassador in Israel, in which he informed me that the Syrians are welcoming the coming of the delegation. [Ze'ev] Did the Egyptians act as mediators? [Darawshah] They made their good efforts to convey our message to Mr. President Hafiz al-Asad, to pass the message, and also to mediate as brothers -- especially the foreign minister, Mr. 'Amr Musa, who intervened in this issue. [Ze'ev] Will you take the opportunity to promote Syrian-Israeli peace efforts or the release of missing Israeli servicemen, any issue like that? [Darawshah] We are going to pay our condolences as a human issue, and we do not think that we are going for political reasons. Mr. Rabin did not ask me to pass any messages, and he knows very well that I'm going on a human basis. [end recording] MK Darawshah says his delegation will number 30 or 31 people: mayors, poets, writers, religious and other leading personalities among the Arab population in Israel. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 18 February adds that upon learning from the Egyptian ambassador that he had been granted permission to visit Syria, MK Darawshah "contacted Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in his capacity as defense minister and asked his permission. The prime minister immediately gave his consent. Moreover, Rabin emphasized he would take all the necessary steps to facilitate the visit. The prime minister informed Darawshah that he has authorized Eytan Haber, the director of his bureau, to be in constant contact with Darawshah in order to pave the way for the departure of the delegation."]
