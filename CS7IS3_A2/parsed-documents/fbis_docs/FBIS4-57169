If at the end of the investigation, formal proceedings under this charge are begun, Chaviano might be sentenced to between seven and 15 years in prison. His wife, Ana Aguililla, who was able to visit him today at the State Security offices, said "he has never worked with state secrets," emphasizing that "his work on behalf of human rights has always been public." She also said today that she sent a letter to President Fidel Castro to tell him she was not permitted to leave any books for Chaviano to read and that "that is unconstitutional." Francisco Chaviano, president of the illegal National Council for Civil Rights in Cuba [Consejo Nacional de Derechos Civiles de Cuba], was arrested after a police search in which documents and part of the files of that organization were seized. The organization is mainly involved in investigating cases of "rafters" lost at sea. Dissident sources contend that shortly before the arrest, an unidentified individual arrived at Chaviano's house and gave him a document, "which he did not even have time to read because the police stormed into the house and searched it." Francisco Chaviano, 40, was a natural science professor at a secondary school when he tried to illegally leave the country aboard a vessel in 1989 and was given a one-year sentence.
