Razuvayev, doctor of political science: "Ukraine: Three Scenarios on the Eve of Elections Neither One of Which Augurs Well for Russia"] [Text] The independence of Ukraine constituted a challenge to Moscow, a challenge not so much to Russian national interests, as to the wisdom and intellectual capacity of the new ruling elite of the Russian Federation. After the disintegration of the USSR Moscow chose to play up to Ukrainian leadership, which is tactically interested in intensifying tensions between the two new independent states. Problems with the Black Sea Fleet, Crimea, and ownership of nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian territory grew practically out of nothing. Problems, in our opinion, of a tactical nature and undoubtedly of secondary importance by comparison with the principal task. Russian strategic interests consist not of depriving Kiev of the right to own nuclear weapons located on Ukrainian territory or of taking possession of the Black Sea Fleet. The principal foreign policy task of Moscow consists of establishing relations based on partnership, friendship, and alliance with its Slavic neighbor. In that light problems of such apparent urgency today concerning the fleet, nuclear weapons, and Crimea are undoubtedly diminished. The forthcoming parliamentary and then the June presidential elections in Ukraine theoretically create the possibility for a partial replacement of the ruling elite and a warming in Russo-Ukrainian relations. At the same time Moscow is presently confronting a crisis which was not even thought of by Russian presidential and government analysts at the end of 1991: the principal threats to the security of Russia emanate from Ukraine. They are mainly of a social character and cannot be avoided through diplomatic maneuvering or intergovernmental agreements. The threats we are speaking of certainly do not stem from the hostility of Ukrainians toward "Moskali" nor are they of a military nature. The real problem for Moscow consists not of the number of nuclear missiles located on Ukrainian territory, but of the fact that the situation in Ukraine is gradually becoming more aggravated. The government has lost control of the economy. National currency was devaluated. There has been a significant rise in social unrest, particularly in the eastern and southern regions of the country. The possibility arises of the coming to power in Kiev of a "strong individual," with whom the central bureaucracy can hope to restore control over the country. The social base of the regime is practically non-existent. That caused a certain slackening of the recently highly acute struggle between the executive and legislative powers. Nevertheless a truce between the president and parliament in the next several months, is practically impossible, even with consideration of the forthcoming parliamentary elections, which lessens the chances of the central authorities to achieve a certain restoration of control over the situation within the country. Economic disintegration sharply diminished the significance of central power in its dialogue-contest with the regions. A number of oblasts are clearly gravitating toward separation from central authority. That process cannot be halted given the current conditions even with the declaration of a state of emergency. Discipline and combat readiness of the Ukrainian army are at a low level and personnel are demoralized. The situation in Ukraine in effect precludes the possibility for a substantive improvement during 1994. The ruling elite has indicated that it is incapable of effectively managing the government. The social position of the population deteriorated so much that the use of shock therapy methods is impossible. It is most likely that after the elections at the end of March parliament shall preserve its current ambivalent character and probably will be unable to carry out an effective reorganization of the state and economic system. The following scenarios are most likely in 1994 in the development of Ukraine. Civil war and social disturbances. That scenario is based on the assumption that living standards of the population and the social situation will continue deteriorating on the whole leading to the occurrence of social unrest in individual regions of the country. It is possible that the initial clashes actually will be provoked by the actions of extremist nationalist organizations of a paramilitary type. Recent measures by Ukrainian authorities to limit their activities proved ineffective. It is most probable that the centers of the disturbances will be local while flare-ups of social protest themselves will be episodic. At the same time the possibility exists that political forces will be found in the country which will lead the social disturbances. The latter will thereby gain an opportunity to extend beyond the local framework, particularly if they are "fed" with provocations by the extremist organizations. At present the sole political force in Ukraine, which, at any rate theoretically, could lead social demonstrations, consists of local structures of the communist ilk. The competition in this scenario is actually between Ukrainian nationalists of the extremist type and the communists. The principal danger for Russia in the immediate future in this case will, in part, be posed by: A massive influx of refugees into the border regions and their subsequent dispersal throughout the territory of the Russian Federation depending on familial and other ties of the refugees; The possibility of a sharp weakening in the control exercised by authorities over nuclear weapons located on the territory of Ukraine; Highly problematic prospects for an effective dialogue between the current Russian authorities and the opposing forces; An extremely high probability of participation of Russian volunteers and representatives of Russia communist and nationalist organizations in armed clashes or in a civil war in Ukraine and inevitability of a resulting Russian involvement in the Ukrainian crisis; Possibility of the spreading of armed conflicts and political and social disturbances to Russian territory; An illegal influx of weapons into Russian territory from Ukraine; A sharp rise in the possibility of ecological catastrophes in Ukraine; Practically total liquidation of communication with Europe through the territory of Ukraine, impossibility of utilizing gas pipelines, oil pipelines, and ports located on the territory of Ukraine. It is quite evident that political and financial losses for Russia in this scenario exceed the boundaries of the permissible. The break-up of Ukraine into several parts. The given scenario proceeds from the assumption that the social, economic, and political crisis in Ukraine will lead to a change in the relative equilibrium of forces between central authorities and the regional elite in favor of the latter. In this case the local political elite will favor disintegration of the country in order to halt the break-up of the state even if at the regional level. The given variant presupposes a relatively peaceful break-up of Ukraine. The initial opposition will be between regional authorities and the center, and subsequently it will divide the semi-independent state formations themselves. Some Kiev analysts believe that there is a very strong possibility that in the next few months a Donetsk-Krivorozhsk republic will be created in the eastern part of the country. In the face of the insularity of the east and south (Crimea) similar measures may be initiated by Galichina especially since representatives of specifically that region were the initiators of separatist tendencies in present-day Ukraine. After differentiation of these three regions the process of a further break-up of the republic will become inevitable. The next stage will consist of a gradual rise in tension between the given state formations, a rise which will be restrained only by territorial demarcations. The immediate principal danger to Russia in a peaceful break-up of Ukraine will consist, in part, of the following: Impossibility of predicting the situation with nuclear weapons in Ukraine, impossibility of ensuring total control over nuclear weapons by the new authorities, a need for difficult and, in certain cases, almost completely fruitless dialogue with new "owners" of nuclear weapons; Significant increase in difficulties connected with trade contacts between Russia and Europe through the territory of Ukraine; Certain growth in the possibility of ecological catastrophes in Ukraine; A gradual rise in the volume of drugs smuggled from Ukraine; Semilegal and illegal export of Ukrainian weapons, including the newest models, to regions of conflict located within the boundaries of the post-Soviet space. It is highly probable, however, that the break-up of Ukraine will become possible as a result of social disturbances or civil war. The winning regional elite in that case will be identifying itself with the liberators of the population from consequences of terrorism and military actions. The appearance of dictatorships and partialdictatorships, including those of a pro-communist type, is highly likely. Principal political opposition in Ukraine in that case will again take place between regional regimes. In this case the danger to Russia will on the whole corresponding to that which characterizes the scenario involving civil war and social disturbances. The political damage to Russia in the short term caused by realization of the scenario involving break-up of Ukraine under certain circumstances may prove to be within the realm of the permissible. At the same time the direct and indirect financial damage, in part as a result of the interruption in the continuous export of gas to Western Europe, will apparently be excessively high. The progressive degradation of state and society in Ukraine. That scenario, in my opinion, is the most likely of the three listed. It is based on the assumption that the current crisis in the country will not lead to social cataclysms, but the regional elite will find themselves insufficiently strong in order to assume full responsibility for the political and economic space partly controlled by it at the present time. The gradual break-up of political, economic, and social ties in the country will continue, the transportation system and the informational space will be subjected to further disintegration, the migration of the population to relatively developed neighboring countries and especially to Russia will acquire a massive character, and there will be a gradual rise in the possibility of a dictatorship of the nationalist or communist type coming to power. The scenario with gradual degradation of the state and society in Ukraine poses, in part, the following dangers for Russia: Gradual increase in the migration of able-bodied population to Russia, and, as a consequence, the aggravation of a number of well- known social problems here, particularly unemployment; A sharp increase in smuggling in Russia, particularly of narcotics; Decomposition of the Ukrainian army will create the probability of the sale of Ukrainian weapons to Russian criminal elements and extremist political organizations, as well as illegal sale of Ukrainian armament, including, possibly that of the newest type, in "hot spots" of the post-Soviet space; Impossibility of conducting an effective dialogue with Ukrainian authorities, as well as loss of their significance by a number of previous agreements due to the inability of the Ukrainian side to fulfill them; A rise in the possibility of ecological catastrophes in Ukraine; A weakening of control by central authorities of nuclear weapons deployed on the territory of Ukraine. The political losses of Russia in the short range in case this scenario comes about, at first glance, appear to be indirect rather than direct. The financial damage on the whole will apparently be tolerable, although there is a stable prospect of its sharp increase in 1995. The social consequences of a mass-scale labor migration and smuggling will possibly become the main negative consequence for Russia resulting from the gradual degradation of the state and society in Ukraine in 1994. In principle all three scenarios indicate that for the immediate future Russia is a hostage to the situation in Ukraine. In one way or another Russian citizens will feel, if only by the state of their pocketbook, the dimensions of the socioeconomic crisis in the neighboring independent state. Forthcoming parliamentary elections in Ukraine therefore acquire special significance for the population of not only Ukraine but of Russia as well. Appearance of prospects for a resolution of the crisis requires the preliminary replacement of a significant part of the ruling elite. It is quite clear that renovation of the legislative corps is only part of what is required. A change in the composition of executive power is possible only after the presidential elections. Regardless of the decision made by Ukrainian voters on 27 March 1994, the appearance of that most long awaited prospect for something better is objectively postponed at least until the end of June.
