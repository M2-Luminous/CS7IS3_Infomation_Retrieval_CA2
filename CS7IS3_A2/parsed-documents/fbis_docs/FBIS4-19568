He said those measures provided real benefits to both communities, not least of which was that they could form the base for the two sides to resume discussions on an overall Cyprus settlement. This was stressed in President Clinton's report on progress towards a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem, to the American House of Representatives and the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, released yesterday. The current report covers the remainder of November 1993, when the previous report was submitted, through March 1, 1994. Referring to the efforts of his administration towards this end, President Clinton said U.S. Special Cyprus Coordinator Robert Lamb arrived in Cyprus the first day of his appointment, underlining the U.S. Government's resolve to achieve progress on the island. President Clinton added Lamb had conveyed the message that the CBM's were "a balanced, workable package for both communities" and that the United States was prepared to work with both communities to ensure that their concerns were addressed satisfactorily. He also said U.S. Assistant Secretary Stephen Oxman and the director of the State Department Office for southern Europe, Marshall Adair, met in Ankara with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and other Turkish officials to emphasize the importance of moving forward on the CBM's package. According to President Clinton, the Turkish side "pointed out that Turkey had spoken out in support of the secretary general's efforts for the CBM's package, and assured Mr. Oxman of Turkey's continued cooperation." Clinton referred to the latest developments on the Cyprus problem, such as the extension of the mandate of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for another six months, and the release of two studies by UN experts on the CBM's, concluding that the implementation of the package would offer significant benefits for the two communities. The report reveals that during President Clinton's European tour, he met in Brussels on January 9-11 Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Mrs. Ciller and told them that "we must move forward with a fair and permanent settlement. Both leaders assured me of their interest in finding a solution on Cyprus and promised to work diligently toward this goal." The report finally refers to the proximity talks opened on February by UN Special Negotiator and former Canadian Premier Joe Clark on the CBM's and the consultations Lamb had with Russian and British officials in Moscow and London respectively. Regarding Lamb's consultations in London and Britain, it said "these meetings with two representatives of the permanent members of the security council once again demonstrated the international resolve to find a fair solution to the Cyprus problem." Bill Clinton's report concluded pointing out that "there is currently a window of opportunity that should not be allowed to close without an agreement being reached on the CBM's. ``They provide real benefits to both communities, not least of which is that they can form the base from which the two parties could resume discussions on an overall settlement.'' Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied 37 percent of its territory.
