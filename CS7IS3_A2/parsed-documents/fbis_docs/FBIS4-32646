Being invited to hold our weekly news conference at the headquarters of the Constanta branch of PRM, we travelled there by airplane. Upon our arrival at Kogalniceanu Airport, we were met by the Constanta County prefect, Mr. Anghel Constantinescu, who reassured us that in spite of the fact that there were certain brawling groups of people, the situation was under control. Being invited by the prefect and a number of county council members to pay a protocol visit to the Prefect's Office headquarters, we found that there were approximately 1,000 agitators there, who were blocking the entrance gate and maintained an atmosphere of terror. We used the backstairs to enter the prefect's office building, but after only a few minutes the prefect's office was stormed by a few dozen hooligans, stinking of alcohol, who tried to force their way in through the doors and who were threatening to kill us. Answering our question inquiring about how it was possible that such aggressors could penetrate the prefect's office building, despite the presence of the riot police, several local officials told us that they had been encouraged and helped to fraudulently enter the building by Cornel Neagoe, the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] mayor of Constanta Municipality, Stelian Dutu, the chairman of the Constanta branch of the FSN [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front], who is also deputy chairman of the Constanta County Council, Alexandru Mihalcea, the local correspondent of daily ROMANIA LIBERA, and Ion Hasoti, an ultra-monarchist attorney. As a matter of fact, the four aforementioned prominent agitators of the opposition stood all along in the window of the mayor's office, encouraging and directing the insane mob in the street, who, their eyes blurred with beastly fury and brandishing chains, crowbars, and knives, were shouting as loud as they could: "Death for death!," "Blood for blood!," and "Get that hangman!" As the situation was desperate and the county prefect seemed to be overwhelmed by the events, the PRM chairman [Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor] telephoned Bucharest, where he spoke with Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, Senate Speaker Oliviu Gherman, and with Interior Minister Doru Ioan Taracila. Within a short time the police forces were strengthened. Eventually the gang of hooligans, who had been occupying the hallways, left the prefect's office building. About 700 PRM sympathizers, who had gathered at the Culture Palace and were waiting for our news conference to begin, could hardly be restrained from heading for the prefect's office building, where -- in their rage at what was happening -- they would have pulverized that scum within a few minutes. Owing to those regrettable incidents in Constanta, under the circumstances of a nearly three-hour siege, Professor Mircea Musat suffered a heart attack and was unable to attend the news conference. We would like to mention that among the mob 50 rogues were spotted who had been brought there from Bucharest by bus, to act as a Hitler-type assault brigade. Under such circumstances the PRM demands that the Government and the General Prosecution should depose and prosecute, in emergency proceedings, the peasant-party mayor of Constanta, Cornel Neagoe, a paranoid individual who has publicly stated that if he had more authority, he would literally bulldoze all communists. It is obvious that owing to certain characters who cannot adapt to society, such as Mayor Cornel Neagoe, and [PNTCD] parliamentarians Vasile Vetisanu, Serban Sandulescu, or [PNTCD Chairman] Corneliu Coposu, PNTCD is actually an anti- national, anti-peasant, anti-Christian, and anti-democratic party. We also demand that all hooligans who, having occupied the supreme state institution of the county, threatened to kill the senators and deputies of our party, should be identified and placed under arrest. It is alarming and regrettable that, owing to the inexplicably passive stance of the police and the justice ministry, gangs of insane people are able to block and hold in terror the fundamental institutions of the state: The Government, the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies, the Ministry of Interior, and the county prefect's offices. For the last time we publicly warn everyone that if there is no return to legality and Romanian society is not protected against such aggressive rottenness, our party, together with other healthy forces of the nation, will see themselves compelled to set up their own defense structures, as the lives of our parliamentarians, counselors, journalists, and ordinary party members are being threatened. As far as concerns the recent communique of the FSN leadership, which they published a number of times and on radio and television [rejecting Tudor's earlier accusations that FSN leader Petre Roman was involved in a coup attempt against President Iliescu allegedly to take place on 17 June], the PRM has to point out the following: We believe that the FSN is not entitled to issue any more communiques, because in any country of the world, parties that have destroyed the country, parties that are swarming with all kinds of crooks and rowdies, would have been dissolved and each of its members would have been prosecuted long ago. Thus, with the same hand with which they wrote false declarations and forged public documents, with which they squandered our national patrimony, with which they sent abroad huge amounts in hard currency and made their relatives rich, some of the deputies of that drifting party are now requesting that the parliamentary immunity should be lifted of the PRM chairman whose sole fault is that of having revealed their crimes. The recent escalation of tension was caused by the disclosures of an authentic revolutionary, who was gravely wounded in the blaze of the December 1989 events, made to us, the members of the PRM Steering Committee, who sign this document. Those disclosures were made on the morning of Friday, 3 June, in the VIP foyer of Baneasa Airport, upon her own initiative, by Mrs. Maria Schiht, a member of a revolutionary organization, who before her recent retirement used to work at Romania's Senate. Here is what she stated to us: "I have come to warn you that an attempt upon Senator Vadim Tudor is being plotted. Furthermore, Dorin Maxim, one of the leaders of the revolutionaries' organizations, recently disclosed to me that before 17 June, together with [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front leader] Petre Roman, they will assassinate President Ion Iliescu and will reinstall [King] Mihai de Hohenzollern as the head of the country." Considering the exceptional gravity of those assertions, we advised Maria Schiht, together with Flori Stoichitescu, her former colleague at the Senate, who was accompanying her, to request an audience at Cotroceni Palace with [presidential counselor for military issues] Colonel General Vasile Ionel and brief him on that potential violence. We know that their meeting took place. We invite the General Prosecution to commence serious investigations ex officio, as stipulated by law. Under the aforementioned circumstances we request that Dorin Maxim should be immediately interrogated and that Petre Roman's parliamentary immunity should be lifted, as that is the sole way in which justice could precisely establish the nature of his relations with terrorist-extremist groupings planning to overturn state order by force. One cannot ignore the fact that some of the leaders of his party have forced their way through the lines of the law- enforcement bodies at the Alba Iulia Great Popular Assembly of 1 December 1993, which proves their anti-social habits. At the same time the PRM firmly requests that the General Prosecution should finance the completion and deal with the penal cases based on the thorough reports of the Prime Minister's Control Corps, cases referring to the infractions perpetrated by Petre Roman, Rada Istrate, Bogdan Niculescu-Duvaz, Traian Basescu, Bogdan Bujor Teodoroiu, Aristide Dragomir, Adrian Severin, Vasile Bran, and other FSN [National Salvation Front] leaders, who by their incompetence, amateurishness, greed, irresponsibility, and Mafia-type dealings have pushed the country to the bottom of the abyss. Once more, we sound the alarm so that public opinion at home and abroad should be entirely aware that the sole extremism currently practiced in Romania is the one perpetrated by the monarchist opposition and the FSN, who -- if we wish to prevent them from poisoning this nation -- should be outlawed as soon as possible.
