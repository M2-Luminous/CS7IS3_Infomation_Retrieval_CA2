Rural Centrist leader Ivar Raig at a press conference Friday [21 January] said the president's parliament relations officer should attend the plenary meetings of the State Assembly and stay well informed of the work done by the parliamentary commissions so that no information blackout would again occur between the president and the parliament. Raig, whose comments were about the recent dispute over Cabinet nominations between the president and the prime minister, said the ruling coalition and the government had been right to seek the replacement of Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae. He said Sildmae was sacked because of his ministry's failure to work out laws. "The Economics Ministry during the past year didn't submit to the parliament even one single original bill drawn up in ministry itself. The ministry paid more attention to industrial development and seeking contacts in other countries than to working out an economic policy," Raig said. He also said that the practice when interest groups in the economy turned their requests to the president rather than the government or the parliament was contradicting the principles of a parliamentary state. Raig was referrng to statements in support of Sildmae delivered to the president by a number of business associations and influence groups when the government revealed its plans for Sildmae's replacement.
