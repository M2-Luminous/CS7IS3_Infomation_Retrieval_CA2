FR940328-1-00030 FR940328-1-00012 48 CFR Part 15 [FAR Case 92&hyph;2] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Subcontract Proposal Audits AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing amendments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to add two additional examples of when field pricing support audits of subcontract proposals may be appropriate. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before May 27, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4035, Attn: Ms. Beverly Fayson, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;2 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeremy F. Olson at (202) 501&hyph;3221 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4035, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;2. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The DOD Inspector General's final report of December 11, 1991, Review of Actions Taken on 42 Contractor Estimating System Cited as Inadequate by the General Accounting Office (Report No. AFU 92&hyph;1), found that estimating system deficiencies warrant additional management attention. Expanded regulatory guidance governing contracting officer's requests for assist audits of subcontractor cost proposals was recommended. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and certified cost or pricing data and field pricing support are not required. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , FAR case 92&hyph;2, in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 15 Government procurement. Albert A. Vicchiolla, Director, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy. Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR part 15 be amended as set forth below: PART 15_CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION 1. The authority citation for 48 CFR part 15 continues to read as follows: Authority: 40 U.S.C. 486(c); 10 U.S.C. chapter 137; and 42 U.S.C. 2473(c). 2. Section 15.806&hyph;3 is amended in paragraph (a)(3) by removing the word ``or''; in paragraph (a)(4) by removing the period and inserting a semicolon in its place; and adding paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) to read as follows: §15.806&hyph;3 Field pricing reports. (a) *␣*␣* (5) The contractor or higher tier subcontractor has been cited for having significant estimating system deficiencies in the area of subcontract pricing, especially the failure to perform adequate cost analyses of proposed subcontract costs or to perform subcontract analyses prior to negotiation of the prime contract with the Government; or (6) A lower tier subcontractor has been cited as having significant estimating system deficiencies. * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6901 Filed 3&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;34&hyph;M
