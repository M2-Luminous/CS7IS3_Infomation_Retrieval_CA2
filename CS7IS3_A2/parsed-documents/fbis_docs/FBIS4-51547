The premier made the remarks after the U.S. currency plunged against the yen to the record low of 100 yen at one stage in New York on Friday. "The yen's drastic movements are undesirable. Foreign exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals," he said. Responding to a question about the reasons for the strong yen, Hata said, "market players are speculative ahead of a series of holidays in Japan. Higher long-term interest rates in the United States are also behind the current gain in the value of the yen." At their emergency gathering, Hata's cabinet colleagues in charge of economic issues earlier agreed on the need to enhance dollar- supporting intervention to help the economy continue its steady recovery from a long recession.
