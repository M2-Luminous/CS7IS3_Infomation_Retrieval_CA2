Pandit: "Congress Party's Internal Dissatisfaction"] [Text] The administrative style of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, president of the Congress (I) Party, has sent forth a wave of dissatisfaction in the inner camp of the party. Some Congress leaders say that the party president has formed the policy according to the suggestions of his favorite people who have their own vested interests. They get the approval of the party president for whatever they want and use it for controlling state politics. This has resulted in mutual differences between all states from north to south and from east to west. In states where a party president must be elected, the reports presented by the committees and observation teams will get attention depending on the politics of the party president's favorite people who have the permission to stand around him. It would not be inappropriate to say that getting the favorable interest of these favored people is in the minds of all state party leaders and workers. It is said that if anyone takes the courage to say anything about these favored people, the party president without any investigation puts such a stamp on the campaigner that that person has no alternative but to remain silent in the future. However, the request made by 50 prominent Congress leaders in Bihar to the party president on 20 April to reorganize Bihar state's Congress Party structure and veteran Congress Leader Dr Jagan Nath Mishra's supporters's opposition to it illustrates the situation that has arisen in the inner camp of the party. The deputation of eight veteran leaders from Bihar that met with the prime minister reminded us of the forgotten fact that between 1990 and 1994 the state Congress (I) neither held a rally in Patna's Gandhi Maidan nor did the state party president travel at the district level to strengthen the party. Now that the committees' terms have ended on 14 April, many obstructions are seen in the path to obstruct those committees preparing for the next vidhan sabha elections. Now they are waiting for the prime minister's visit to Bihar on 30 April. According to sources close to the prime minister, Mr. Rao will be successful in controlling the situation there by making some important announcements during his visit. It is also possible that the prime minister will announce the establishment of Jharkhand independent federation and be successful in changing the image of his party. He has controlled the controversial situation in Bihar to an extent by inviting Dr. Jagannath Misra for talks in Delhi and also by including Ram Lakhan Yadav in the central cabinet. We cannot say how much wMr. Rao's quiet politics will be successful in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh] because the party position in U.P. is a lot worse than it is in Bihar. The result of this situation is seen in the recent vidhan sabha election. To control the situation, four powerful members of the Congress Party's central committee--Mr. Jaffar Sharif, Mr. Beant Singh, Mr. Venkataraman Swami, and Navalkishore Sharma--have been sent there to interview former legislators. Will all this information be presented to the party president accurately? There is also the fear that in any situation Mr. Rao will pay more attention to his favorite political advisors. Will the Congress workers from western U.P. and from other parts of the state have the freedom to express their feelings to the prime minister so that they can be brave like those eight members from Bihar were? The hardworking U.P. leaders who are spending the last part of their life in the capital say that the U.P. leaders have the tendency to bow down to the high command from the beginning. Traditionally, U.P. leaders have done whatever the high command had ordered them. The high command decision will be the same as his closer associates desire, because the central cabinet members who represent the U.P. Congress have developed the habit of not opposing any decision. According to political observers, the height of those who represent U.P. at the Center has diminished in the eyes of the prime minister. The remaining leaders from the state have either been expelled or have been silenced by awarding them with minor positions or have promised them such positions. They are all waiting to see who will be the president and whose luck will shine by getting one of the other vacant positions. Whatever the close associates of the party high command decide will be implemented. The politicians in the capital are expressing doubts about Congress Party (I) getting a new life in Bihar and U.P. because those who have damaged the party image do no seem to be interested in the future of the party. Why has work that was needed to be done in U.P. and Bihar been ignored for the last two years? The three powerful members--Madhavrao Scindia, K.C. Lekha, and Party General Secretary Scinde--who were sent to Himachal Pradesh, said that Chief Minister Virbhadar Singh should continue on in his two positions. It will depend on the high command whether or not the committee members will present their reports. The teams sent to Andhra Pradesh under the leadership of Chief Minister Vijay Bhaskar Reddy and composed of Ahmed Patel, Jagdish Titler, and Mrs. Kailashpati recommended that a president of the state Congress Party must be appointed, because former president Madren has been appointed the leader of the legislative group. The decision on a state party president should be made according to the report of this committee and the results of inquiry that is being made now. Who will that person be? The prime minister will have to decide that. A similar answer was given by the four members of the visiting team--Ramlakhan Singh Yadav, Sushil Kumar Scinde, Mohsina Kidwai and R.K. Dhawan--on return from Bhopal. They said, they have to go back again. Madhya Pradesh has a lot of support for such leaders as Madhav Rao Scindia, Vidhyacharan Shukla, Shyamcharan Shukla, Arjun Singh, and Digvijay Singh. It is very difficult to make a decision about this state, because the director of Madhya Pradesh leadership is in Delhi and whatever he wishes will probably will be approved by the high command. This is the situation in the Hindi-speaking states or the so-called Hindi Heartland. One can glimpse in Delhi what is happening to the party in southern states. The two factions of the party from Tamil Nadu are fighting with each other. The main reason for this dissension according to veteran party leaders is the policies adopted at the Center. The two groups are so lost in their fight that even Moopnar, the party leader, has failed to straighten out the situation. It is said that one Congress group supports Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister Jayalalitha and the other group opposes her. At present, they cannot decide whether to remove or keep Rama Murthy, the president of the Tamil Nadu Congress.
