The Defense Ministry has inspected the munitions supply system by regularly examining related papers so far, however, it is exceptionally conducting actual inspections on it because of the seriousness in the situation on the Korean peninsula. Inspection teams dispatched by the ministry to major munitions bases throughout the country are now conducting a comprehensive inspection of the munitions supply system by surveying the thickness of protection walls of warehouses of explosive materials, such as ammunition and oil, and the state of secured defensive facilities and supply lines. The Defense Ministry will complete the inspection before the end of June and will take supplementary measures after finding out problems in coping with North Korea's possible intensive artillery firing, air raids, and special troop infiltration in a war. The ministry will reflect the supplementary measures in the operations training for protecting munitions supply facilities during the planned Ulchi-Focus Lens exercise in August. A Defense Ministry official said on 12 June: "It is expected that, if an all-out war takes place on the Korean peninsula, both South and North Korea will strike a serious blow to each other in an early stage by mobilizing all their firepower. Accordingly, it is necessary for sufficient munitions to be supplied." He also said: "According to the result of the inspection conducted so far, we have secured enough major munitions -- weapons, ammunition, oil, and food -- to carry out a war until we have support from outside." Our country is supposed to have major munitions support, including weapons and ammunition, from the United States and other countries in case of war. It is anticipated that it will take at least 45 days for a transport ship carrying military supplies from the United States to the ROK. It is learned that the ROK keeps reserve war materiel to stand for at least three months. (endall) 13 Jun mp/Austin/KMP26136.02/KA611306.07/kw 13/0321z Jun BT #2443 NNNN
