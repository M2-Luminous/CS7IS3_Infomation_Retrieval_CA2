Magnuson Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Building 10, Room 1N208, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, 301&hyph;496&hyph;2292. The numbers listed above are not toll free. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposes to establish a new system of records: 09&hyph;25&hyph;0169, ``Medical Staff Credentials Files, HHS/NIH/CC.'' This system of records will be used by NIH staff to: (1) Maintain information used in the credentialing and privileging of active medical staff members at the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center; (2) document patient care privileges for active members of the medical staff; (3) provide information about active and non-active members of the medical staff to authorized individuals; and (4) report to the National Practitioner Data Bank as required by the provisions of Title IV of Public Law 99&hyph;660, as amended. The system will comprise records that contain medical staff names, date of birth, home address and telephone number, office address and telephone number, citizenship, visa information, appointment date, hospital-wide computer access privileges, Institute/Center/Division designation, branch/lab, type of medical staff membership, privilege delineation, professional degree(s) including school of attendance and graduation dates, foreign medical examinations, specialty board certifications, licensing information (including state of licensure and license number), record or disciplinary actions, documentation of training, and admitting privileges. The amount of information recorded on each individual will be only that which is necessary to accomplish the purposes of the system. Records are established from forms and documentation submitted by individual medical staff members to the Medical Record Department. The records in this system will be maintained in a secure manner compatible with their content and use. NIH and Contractor staff will be required to adhere to the provisions of the Privacy Act and the HHS Privacy Act regulations. The System Manager will control access to the data. Only authorized users whose official duties require the use of such information will have regular access to the records in this system. Authorized users are HHS employees and Contractor staff responsible for implementing the medical staff credentials data system. Records will be stored on paper forms in file folders and on computer disk. Manual and computerized records will be maintained in accordance with the standards of Chapter 45&hyph;13 of the HHS General Administration Manual, ``Safeguarding Records Contained in Systems of Records,'' supplementary Chapter PHS hf: 45&hyph;13, the Department's Automated Information System Security Program Handbook, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS Pub. 41 and FIPS Pub. 31). Data stored in computers is accessed through a network system by use of a password known only to authorized users. Rooms where records are stored are locked when not in use. During regular business hours, rooms are unlocked by entry is controlled by on-site personnel. The routine uses proposed for this system are compatible with the stated purposes of the system. The first routine use permitting disclosure to a congressional office is proposed to allow subject individuals to obtain assistance from their representatives in Congress, should they so desire. Such disclosure would be made only pursuant to a request of the individual. The second routine use of this system allows disclosure to the Department of Justice to defend the Federal Government, the Department, or employees of the Department in the event of litigation. The third routine use allows referral to the appropriate agency in the event that a system of records maintained by this agency to carry out its functions indicates a violation or potential violation of law. The fourth routine use allows disclosure of records to contractors for the purpose of processing or refining records in the system. The fifth routine use permits disclosure to representatives of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations for the purpose of conducting quality assurance reviews and inspections of the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center credentialing policies and procedures. The sixth routine use permits disclosure to State medical boards for purposes of professional quality assurance activities. The seventh routine use allows disclosure to health care facilities for the purpose of verifying that an individual to whom they intend to grant medical staff or patient care privileges has or previously held such privileges at the Warren G. Magnuson Clincial Center.
