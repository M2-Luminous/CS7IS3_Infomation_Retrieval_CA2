FR941013-2-00013 FR941013-2-00011 CHAMPUS is adopting the HCFA outlier thresholds for FY95. The long-stay threshold shall equal the lesser of 3.0 standard deviations or 22 days above the DRG's geometric LOS. Long-stay outliers will be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus 49 percent of the per diem rate for the DRG for each covered day of care beyond the long-stay outlier threshold. The cost outlier will be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus 80 percent of the standardized costs exceeding the threshold. The cost outlier threshold shall be the DRG payment (wage-adjusted but prior to adjustment for indirect medical education) plus a flat rate of $18,800. E. Hospitals Excluded from the Prospective Payment System CHAMPUS will continue to follow the limitations of exclusions for hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system. As HCFA clarified in its final rule of September 2, 1994, ``long-term care units'' of general hospitals are not exempt nor were they intended to be exempt from the prospective payment system. CHAMPUS shares HCFA's concern that excluding such units could inadvertently encourage hospitals to divert long-stay cases to the excluded unit, leaving only the shorter, less costly cases to be paid under the prospective payment system, circumventing the intent of Congress to use the DRG system to control hospital charges. Designation by Medicare as an exempt hospital will result in automatic exemption under CHAMPUS. A hospital which has been denied exemption status by Medicare cannot be exempt under CHAMPUS. G. Medicare Changes Which Are Not Being Adopted by CHAMPUS Transfer cases will be paid as in previous years based on a per diem rate for each day of the patient's stay in that hospital not to exceed the DRG-based payment amount (including outlier payments). The per diem rate is determined by dividing the appropriate wage-adjusted prospective payment rate, including adjustment for indirect medical education, by the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG into which the case falls. CHAMPUS is not adopting the graduated per diem methodology discussed by HCFA at this time. Outlier cases will be paid as in previous years, applying HCFA's outlier thresholds as described above. Capital costs will continue to be handled as a pass-through cost under CHAMPUS. Only those hospitals not exempt from the prospective payment system are entitled to payment consideration for capital costs. III. Cost-to-Charge Ratio
