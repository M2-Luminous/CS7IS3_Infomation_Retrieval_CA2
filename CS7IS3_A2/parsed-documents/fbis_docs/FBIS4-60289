FBIS4-60289 "drnes100_j_94008" FBIS-NES-94-100 Daily Report 22 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Saudi Arabia King Fahd, Prince 'Abdallah Address Pilgrims King Fahd, Prince 'Abdallah Address Pilgrims LD2205203594 Riyadh SPA in Arabic 1505 GMT 22 May 94 LD2205203594 Riyadh SPA Arabic BFN [Excerpts] 22 May, SPA [dateline as received] -- King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, the custodian of the two holy mosques, and His Royal Highness Prince 'Abdallah Bin-'Abd al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, crown prince, deputy prime minister, and commander of the National Guard, sent an exhaustive address to the pilgrims on the occasion of the pilgrimage season of 1414 AH corresponding to 1994. Here now follows the text of this address. In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. We thank Almighty God for having bestowed on us the religion of Islam, and for having guided us on the right path and made us the best nation on earth that preaches good and avoids evil. [passage omitted] Brothers, delegations to the holy house of God, brother Muslims everywhere! The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is pained by the tense situation in most of the Islamic land nowadays. The bloody situation in Afghanistan, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and elsewhere causes regret, pain, and also worry. We have made considerable and consistent efforts at all levels, through all channels, and by all means to bring an end to the current tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We pinned hope on the recent move provided for in the agreement signed on 1 March 1994, concerning the establishment of a unified state between the brother Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina and their Bosnian Croat friends and compatriots, which would end in the setting up of a confederation with the neighboring Republic of Croatia. This was thought to be a practical step acceptable to the parties to the conflict, which would bring about security, peace, and concord. [passage omitted] However, this optimism did not last long because the Serbs continued their aggression, defied the international community, stood up in front of the successive UN Security Council resolutions to halt the aggression and protect Bosnian safe zones, and refused and continue to refuse to heed international legality. This high-handedness and messing about can be deterred only by a decisive international determination that will move the efforts of the United Nations from the stage of caution and courtesy to other states, and from hesitation over the risk of an extension of the war zones into an energetic and decisive military measure against all those who practice high-handedness and injustice and challenge the international will. Just as it has affirmed what is right and refuted injustice and aggression, such a will can do away with the arrogance and defiance of the Serbs, entrench equitable rights, and impose peace that will ensure security and stability for all. As an Islamic nation with more than 1 billion Muslims, we must bear our responsibilities and apply pressure to impose peace and stability in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and we must strive to secure the safety of its people and come to the help of the latter. [passage omitted] Brothers, Muslims in all corners of the world. With hearts filled with sadness and pain, we are following the gradual deteriorating situation in Afghanistan. This is unacceptable by any Muslim who is aware that shedding the blood of another Muslim is prohibited by God. What is more, shedding the blood of a Muslim by his brother is not only prohibited, but is also a human tragedy and a historic precedent that is taking place in an era of knowledge, education, understanding, and the promotion of the values of mankind. Despite all the justifications that are provided for the continuation of the bloody situation there, fighting among the sons of one people is an unacceptable tragedy. The destruction of the country and the exhaustion of the Afghan achievements is an irresponsible act by any material, ethical, and human standards. Above all, it is unacceptable by the standards of the pure Muslims jurisdiction that is against the squandering of peoples capabilities and the violation of their rights to live in security and stability. We in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia did not expect to see happen what has happened and is still happening in Afghanistan, because we were convinced that the sons and leaders of Afghanistan were aware that the shock of fighting in Afghanistan, its motives, and circumstances would be disastrous. [passage omitted] What is happening in Afghanistan has tarnished the true image of the genuine Islamic Jihad that is carried out in the name of God; yet this Jihad is driven by individuals' whims, affiliations to groups and gatherings, and the conflict between the sons who share the same faith and land. Not only that, but what is happening there gave the impression that individual ambitions that had emerged there had become bigger than Afghanistan, and that the attainment and achievement of these ambitions and interests take precedence over everything else, even if this meant a long war between the bellicose parties and turning the country into ruins because of the spread of a civil war. [passage omitted] Today, however, and three years after the Afghan state had recovered its identity and sovereignty, we cannot find any justification for what is happening there. The only justification we can find is that this situation forms a part of a huge plot that targets not only Afghanistan and the Arab and Islamic states, but it also targets Islam and Muslims inside a Muslim land that had witnessed the greatest acts of heroism and gave rise to some of the greatest men in Islam. What causes us real pain and real suffering, and what really frightens us is to see Afghanistan, and for some long years, as a source of concern, disturbances, and instability in the whole world; after it had been a source of amity and peace on earth. Do the leaders of Afghanistan really accept this situation?. [passage omitted] The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not blame any party at the expense of another party for what is happening there, it considers them all responsible for the continuing explosive situation. It appeals to everybody to show a responsible stance through which an end to the bloody phase can be reached; they should look to the future with open minds and hearts; they should put the interest and the people of Afghanistan above all other considerations. Only then we will open our hearts to all of them and welcome them once again in Mecca, and for the last time, to agree the foundations that they deem suitable to bring about peace and stability to Afghanistan. Brothers in God, Muslims everywhere: In spite of the relative calm in Somalia after a difficult period of conflict and fighting among its various sections, nationalities, and leaders, the situation is still vague and threatens danger at any moment. The final reconciliation has not happened. Therefore, the lying in wait by some sections for the others still constitutes a danger to stability in that country. [passage omitted] We thank God that our sons in Somalia have successfully discharged their humanitarian duties in the best way, and they are meeting with all appreciation and respect from all the Somalis who have seen their efforts and benefitted from their food and medical aid. What we have always hoped and wished for is to see the brothers in Somalia arrive at a formula acceptable to all of them, so that all parties get together in the service of the Somali homeland, and all potentials and capabilities may be put in the hands of a state able to save the country from the causes of division and dispersion. [passage omitted] Brother heads and delegation members, brother Muslims everywhere. There are three basic issues that are now giving us a great deal of concern and to which we attach considerable interest. These issues are: First, the peace process; second, security in the Gulf region; third, the situation in Yemen. We in Saudi Arabia look forward to, and strive continuously for security and stability everywhere in the world, and particularly in our region, for our brothers and for all states and peoples of the world. We thank God that the peace process has gone ahead satisfactorily, and that on 5 May the Palestinian brothers managed to attain with the Israelis a final agreement in Cairo to hand over the authority in Gaza and Jericho and the start of a new era of coexistence, and turn the peace efforts into practice. We are happy to see the Palestinian brothers begin a new era of exercising their legitimate rights on their land, and Saudi Arabia will continue to stand on the side of the just Palestinian cause until it gains victory. At the same time, we look forward for more sincere and constructive efforts by His Excellency President Bill Clinton of the United States and his government to complete the peace process and arrive at a just, comprehensive, and complete peace in the region, and to define the remaining tracks so as to arrive at the desired objective. We are convinced that the remaining Arab brothers [Syria, Lebanon, Jordan] want peace and seek to realize it, and no doubt they will find in the clear and encouraging determination of the U.S. President to put an end to the state of war in the region, with the help of all parties, a sign of a wish for peace and an investment for the current peace momentum as well. For our part, our efforts here in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will continue in all directions to serve this objective, whether in cooperation and coordination with his excellency the U.S. President and his administration, or with the Arab brothers, or with the other states and international quarters interested in the cause of peace in the Middle East. Regarding the situation in the Gulf, this country is very eager to achieve a tangible cooperation between all the parties concerned in sincere and constructive endeavor to remove the causes of dispute between the six GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] member states and Iran. The beginning and end of these causes lie in the fact that the brothers in Iran should commit themselves to observe international conventions and standards based on mutual respect and noninterference in the domestic affairs of states, and give back the three islands [Lesser Tumb, Greater Tumb, and Abu Musa] to the United Arab Emirates. We are convinced that such a firm commitment will provide the factors of trust required to establish constructive cooperation with Iran for the good and interest of all. Concerning the situation in Iraq, the fact that its regime continues to cheat on the UN resolutions will prevent any change in the regional and international positions to it. The Iraqi regime must carry out the UN resolutions in full without cheating, and when the current situation in Iraq comes to an end, it is expected that the region will witness a stage of stability and prosperity, and the Iraqi people will be the first to reap its fruit. When we review the current situation in fraternal Yemen, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia feels deep regret at the deterioration of the situation there. We expressed our frank and fraternal position on 5 May, when we urged the parties to the conflict to seek arbitration in reason and logic, and to put the interest of Yemen and the people of Yemen at the forefront of priorities. We have said this and we continue to affirm it because the security of Yemen and the stability of the situation there interest us before others, and it is in our interest to see the situation stable there. Today, we reaffirm that realism in thinking and understanding between the parties to the conflict are liable to bring the elements of security and stability to Yemen, and to spare it dangerous wars and complete destruction. Brothers in God, Muslim brothers everywhere. The oil markets are living in changeable and unstable conditions, as a result of which the producing countries within OPEC, at the fore of which is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, have sustained great sacrifices due to the drop in prices during last year, the reasons and motives of which are not unseen by those who follow up the circumstances of the commodity and the production levels inside and outside OPEC. We in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia firmly believe that this situation will not serve anybody, on the contrary it will harm us all producers and consumers and will be sharply reflected in the world economic situation. We do not need to warn against the absence of full understanding between the producing countries inside OPEC and the producing countries outside it, and also against the limited level of coordination and cooperation between the member states within the organization, that falls short of the level that ensures the interests of all. However, we need to emphasize that the time has come to draw up a firm policy and clear strategy that will ensure the stability of the commodity and spare it the changing political whims and climates and the special considerations and circumstances through which some countries are passing, which prompts them to pursue practices harmful to everybody. It is in the interest of everybody to seek the judgement of reason and logic, to consider everybody's interests, and agree upon a new basis and criteria that is dictated by the realities of the market, the production levels, and the world consumption needs of energy and nothing else. [passage omitted] O brothers in God; O Muslims everywhere! Almighty God has granted us the honor of being able to serve this country, of assuming responsibility for the affairs of its loyal people, and of being vigilant over their comfort, peace, and security and promoting their interests. We praise God the almighty and all-powerful that he has enabled us to exploit the resources and potentials of this country so that our dear country has achieved its present position, to raise the standard of living and of the services provided to the sons of our homeland, and to achieve prosperity and development, both of which we are proud of. [passage omitted] Recently, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has planned extensive and serious steps in the fields of organization and administration and God has made us successful in issuing the basic statute for the system of government, the statute for the new Council of Ministers, the statute for the Consultative Council and its establishment, and the statute for the regions and attached regulations and complementary procedures in order to put these statutes into effect and achieve more benefits and progress for our people and our nation in the future. The Consultative Council has begun to bear fruit and participate in developing the various organizational means in our country, and is playing a positive and effective role alongside the Council of Ministers in serving and promoting the homeland and its people. The regional councils have begun to carry out their work in such a way as to give rise to happiness and optimism. [passage omitted]
