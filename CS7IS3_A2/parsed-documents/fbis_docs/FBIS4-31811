For example, the conductor may be mortally insulted if an unfortunate traveler deferentially seeks a bit of rope or wire to somehow tie up the completely collapsed back of his seat: "Rope! Where would I get rope? If I had rope, I would hang myself at once! The seat is broken, and I cannot do anything about it, so don't make trouble, do you hear!" That is how it was last fall, but this spring the quarrel begins on the platform of the Belgrade bus terminal. The participants are the bus driver ("boss," "brother," "bro") and a woman who is trying to send a package to Bosanska (now Kozarska) Dubica by him: "Listen, madam, I cannot take the package, they will give me a hard time at the border." The fear is certainly justified--by contrast with the Serbian police, who work quickly and routinely, the MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs] of the Srpska republic take their job much more seriously. At the border checkpoint in Bosanska (now Srpska) Raca, young men in new uniforms (blue camouflage garrison caps with a brim like that of General Zivojin Misic) study personal identity cards carefully, and the customs officials poke around in the baggage compartment: "Whose bag is this with the flowers? Please come out." In the end, it turned out that the flowers were artificial and harmless. The bus passes quickly through Bijeljina without problems unless it is market day, when trucks, cars, and wagons completely block the narrow street that borders the market. There are no visible traces of war until Brcko, which is riddled and destroyed and where soldiers fill the bus. These are mainly people from Bosanska Krajina who are going on leave. Good humor is at an enviable level, so no one objects if the barrel of some kalashnikov pushes against his side. A trip is unthinkable without the inevitable tipsy fellow in good humor who prattles on for hours about the aunt of his comrade-in-arms, that is, about her impressive bust. The music from the radio is stylish and ethnically pure--they only tune in to "patriotic folk music." For instance, aside from the increasingly popular refrain "Long live orthodox concord, us and 300 million Russians," they also sing "The small and the tall have risen up, we are creating you, Srpska republic," but the most fascinating is a poetical dialogue with a former friend of a different religion: "What kind of Bosnia do you want, friend, One in which the Serbs would do your bidding? How do you feel now, my former friend, Now that the tanks are rumbling?" The Moral The music is interrupted by the voice of the woman announcer, who reports that "Muslim units this morning opened infantry and mortar fire on positions of the Army of the Srpska republic near Brcko, but the Serbs did not return it." A soldier who obviously had not learned all he should in moral-political training cheerily commented: "Come on, why is she lying, damn her eyes, my battery alone fired 15 shells this morning, ha, ha." The militance is nevertheless frightening, and the news that the U.S. Senate voted to remove the embargo from imports of arms intended for the Muslims is met almost with approval: "Well, thank you, now they can't forbid us from settling accounts once and for all." The worst part of the trip through the corridor is the macadam road around Derventa. This road was cut immediately after the corridor was cleared, before it was widened, but even now it is sometimes used. This section is some 20 km long, the houses along it have been completely destroyed, and it takes at least about an hour to travel it. The sun is frying, and every car that passes in the opposite direction raises a cloud of dust that covers the bus, and so we seek salvation by closing the windows. Only then do you realize the real meaning of the term "gas chamber." The windows, however, remain closed even when we finally leave the macadam and head for Prnjavor and Banja Luka on the decent asphalt road. Every attempt to let a bit of air into the overheated tin can meets with looks full of primitive fear and an imploring: "Don't, it is blowing on my head." The tense and sweaty faces of the passengers speak clearly of the attempt to settle the issue of who is to blame for this kind of heat: the Muslims, the Croats, the leaders of the opposition in Belgrade, or perhaps the bus drivers. The closed windows have nothing to do with that, and it is well-known that a breeze causes instant death, if not something worse. Advantages Nor did the trip from Pakrac to Belgrade begin without a quarrel. To be sure, the drivers are more liberal and take packages for Belgrade, but on the other hand they do not recognize travel passes: "You have gone to Belgrade 10 times and you always have some pass from the Red Cross, the opstina, a firm, God, and the devil. You have to buy a ticket." The ticket from Pakrac to Belgrade, incidentally, costs 25 dinars, but from Belgrade to Gradiska (a trip 40 km shorter) 27 dinars. A ticket bought from Pakrac Tours is perhaps cheaper because there is no music in the bus, but that fact might easily be taken as an advantage. On this trip, they do not take the macadam, but the asphalt, through the center of devastated Derventa, but on the other hand they cannot avoid the checkpoint where a zealous policeman spends an entire hour checking papers and the content of the package referred to, which is marked "Fragile." The content of the suspicious package: Slavonian ham, eggs, and walnuts. Aside from the regular one-hour rest stop at the Atina Restaurant between Brcko and Bijeljina (prices similar to those in Belgrade, a toilet that takes your breath away), another stop had to be made to take on at least half of the passengers from a broken-down bus traveling the route between Okucani and Belgrade. It goes without saying that elderly ladies with immense bags effectively push their way into the bus, by contrast with a young woman and a child, who correctly judged that uncertainty on the highway is a lesser evil than the possibility of her child being smothered in an overcrowded bus. At the border, it turned out that the Srpska republic is incomparably more difficult to leave than to enter. In this direction, the baggage is not checked, but on the other hand every male of "military age" who has an identity card from the Srpska republic must show a certificate that his military obligation has been met, and the police of the Srpska republic are particularly interested in those whose names might indicate a non-Serb origin. Only a personal identity card from Belgrade rescues these people. Finally, when a Serbian policeman enters the bus at Sremska Raca, ordinary mortals can hardly resist the impulse to hug him and kiss him, and the casual examination of papers, the incidental (unfulfilled) threat "Come on, people, if you have a weapon, turn it in yourselves, so I don't have to look for it," and the already forgotten "Good-bye and good trip" prove that it does not take much for a man who has a hard time to immerse himself in the deceptive dream of freedom and democracy.
