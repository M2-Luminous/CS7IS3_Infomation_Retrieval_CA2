Rural Party faction and Coalition Party faction bill prescribes formation of a committee, the members of which would be appointed by parliament factions and which would have to clarify how the activities of the board of RAS Rahva Haal, that issues the daily, have limited freedom of press and how much financial damage has been caused to the state by this. The Centrist faction presented another bill according to which a temporary committee be formed to solve the incident over RAHVA HAAL. The bill proposes to stop the activities of the board of RAHVA HAAL till the end of investigation, abolish contracts with AS Hommikuleht and demand that the latter return money paid to them by the state. Turmoil over the daily started already in May last year when Estonian Privatization Agency decided to privatize the state-owned newspaper. Head of the Privatization Agency Liia Hanni has admitted later that in the course of the privatization, the result of which is, that two applicants, one of them AS Hommikuleht, to the daily gave the matter to the court, the Agency acted in disagreement with existing laws. At present the matter has reached the Supreme Court and the privatization of the daily has been stopped. In October last year the board of the daily was changed with majority given to representatives of the government coalition. On March 18, the board adopted a decision to change the statutes of the company, abolishing the institution of editor-in-chief and creating a new institution of publisher-in-chief. Majority of the staff of the paper, in protest to the decision, resigned and decided to join AS RH, formed by the RAHVA HAAL staff last year to participate at the privatization. Editor-in-chief Toomas Leito was dismissed by the board "for loss of trust" and not preserving political balance of the paper. Toomas Leito told ETA that the decisions of the board of RAS Rahva Haal had been of "purely political" nature. After the staff of RAHVA HAAL had left to AS RH, they started to publish their own paper EESTI SONUMID. RAHVA HAAL was published by RAS Rahva Haal in cooperation with AS HOMMIKULEHT, another Estonian daily. On Monday, Estonian Ministry of Culture and Education sent a letter to the managing director of AS Ajakirjandusmaja that administers the Tallinn Press Building where most of the biggest newspapers are located, demanding that in 24 hours "outsiders" (meaning the former staff) leave the 5th floor rooms rented to RAS Rahva Haal. Managing editor of EESTI SONUMID Tiit Lehiste told ETA that from Monday morning EESTI SONUMID staff has not been let into their rooms in the 5th floor, with security guarding the door. The staff was let into the rooms only in pairs to fetch their private things. Also phones were switched off and door locks changed. Chairman of the board of AS RH Ester Sank told ETA that on Thursday, before the Easter holidays, AS RH had had an agreement with the chairman of the board of RAS Rahva Haal Veiko Jurisson according to which half of the rooms on the 5th floor could be kept by AS RH till April 21. The decision was for some reason changed during the holidays, she said. Monday evening, managing director of AS Ajakirjandusmaja Juri Kriisemann told ETA that an agreement has been reached with two companies that they would temporarily, for about one month, give up their rooms at the Press Building in favor of AS RH, a decision that has also been accepted by Ministry of Culture and Education. EESTI SONUMID has sent a letter to Riigikogu [parliament] introducing the situation and asking MPs' position and support in the matter in order the conflict not to reach an incident with tragic results. The letters says that in Estonia "precedent has been created where a civil dispute is solved with force with the support of the executive authorities", calling it "states violence with political colouring". Estonian Press Complaints Board discussed the problems around RAHVA HAAL/EESTI SONUMID, on Monday, and made a statement saying that the state as the owner of RAHVA HAAL "has not acted in accordance with state of justice norms of the end of 20th century", and what has taken place in relation to the staff of the paper was to be considered as "limitation of the freedom of press". RAHVA HAAL is the biggest daily distributed all over Estonia that belongs to the state. Its circulation is 47.6 thousand at week-days and 50 thousand at Saturdays. EESTI SONUMID, according to their own data, have reached almost the same.
