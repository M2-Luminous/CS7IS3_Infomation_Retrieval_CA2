Large amounts of weapons and ammunition bearing Hebrew lettering were seized. Among the estimated four truck loads of weapons are 300 M-16 rifles, 20 RPG's, and 20 machine guns in addition to hand grenades, radio equipment, and bullet-proof jackets. Another Army unit this morning stormed a second Lebanese Forces center in al-Nab'ah. Six 107-mm rockets were found on the center's lower floor. Security sources pointed out that the continuing possession of weapons and ammunition caches and confessions by people arrested in connection with the Sayyidat al-Najat Church crime, saying they were instructed to gather information on the Lebanese Army centers in particular areas, again prove the bad intentions behind this conduct. Elsewhere, naval targets were monitored off the Jubayl and Beirut coast today. This called for tightening security measures among the Lebanese Army forces along the Lebanese coast to prevent it from being used for illegal transportation.
