In an interview published today in the Ecuadoran newspaper EL TELEGRAFO, Fujimori said: "We are promoting this candidacy. I bet on a winner and I hope Cesar Gaviria will win." The Peruvian president added: "I have always been very clear on this issue. We have expressed our clear position of total support for President Gaviria." Fujimori announced that his government is negotiating Peru's reintegration into the Andean Pact, which it abandoned in 1992. The Andean Pact comprises Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Fujimori added: "This is a period of transition, of readjustment. I am sure the Andean Pact will continue and be strengthened with the reintegration of Peru." The Peruvian president noted that he is not campaigning for reelection. Fujimori said: "I do not want to talk about becoming a candidate. Of course, the (new) Constitution invites me, the people have invited me, but I have yet to decide."
