An official part of the visit begins today, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI writes. It will be the continuation of the dialogue on a summit level, started in Vancluver, Canada, last April. The newspaper points out with reference to Russian experts that "the discussion of the programme of partnership and cooperation between Russia and the United States for the late 90s and the beginning of the 21st century will be the feature event of the meeting of leaders of the two countries." An article by Dr.Anatoliy Prokhorovsky, deputy director of the Institute of U.S. and Canadian Studies under the Russian Academy of Sciences, published by the same newspaper, says that the U.S. is doing its utmost for "promoting rapprochement with Russia." IZVESTIYA stresses in the headline to the article, dealing with the visit of the American president, that "Clinton will not have much spare time in Moscow." Touching upon the meeting at the Spaso- House (the residence of the U.S. Ambassador) between Clinton and Russian politicians and business people, planned to be held today in the evening, the newspaper points to the absence of V.Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, among those invited to the meeting. Quoting American sources, IZVESTIYA writes that "he is evoking apprehension in the Washington circles, and not only because of his political views, but also because of his manner of behaviour. They are afraid that his eccentricity will put Clinton in a very embarrassing position." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries articles about the visit of the honoured American guest under the headlines "Russian President -- Best Friend of American President" and "Importance of Talks To Begin in Moscow is Enhanced by Compromise, Reached by Moscow, Washington and Kiev." As was reported, representatives of Russia, the United States and Ukraine agreed in principle about a possibility of signing an accord on the dismantling of Ukrainian nuclear missiles. The newspaper calls in question the correctness of this step made by Ukraine. In its opinion, Ukraine "could imposed its terms on others for a long time to come, showing a nuclear fist from under the table." KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA writes about President Clinton's visit to Moscow: "It is expected from the Russian president that he will share with the U.S. guest his personal observations over the progress of the economic reform in the country, especially after the parliamentary elections. They are sure to bring up the question about the role of international financial institutions in the building of capitalism in Russia and in giving a 'human touch' to it." According to PRAVDA, the Russian part of clinton's visit to Europe is described by local observers more and more often as the demonstration of support for Yeltsin. Commenting on the U.S. plan "Partnership for Peace," KRASNAYA ZVEZDA writes that "it was drawn up and adopted with due account for Russia's lawful interests in the sphere of security." It is quite probable that Moscow will express the desire to take part in it, the newspaper points out. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, TRUD and other newspapers give wide coverage to the work of the Federal Assembly (the Russian parliament). It is pointed out that a more constructive stand assumed by members of the Federation Council enabled them to make a far greater progress than that of the State Duma. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA compares the first days of the work of the State Duma and the first congress of the former Russian people's deputies. According to the newspaper, they were characterised by "verbal attacks on Georgiy Lukava, a pilot and the doyen of the State Duma, representing the Liberal Democratic Party, and an ordinary adjustment to each other. The behaviour of many members of parliament showed that they have no idea of the ABC's of the parliamentary work." TRUD carries a full text of the interview with Professor Aleksandr Stoyan, chairman of the Ukrainian Trade Union Federation. He recognised that Ukrainian trade unions were not ready to take effective action in defence of working people in conditions of market-based relations.
