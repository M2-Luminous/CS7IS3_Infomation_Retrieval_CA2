This is an extreme religious approach whose adherents refuse to recognize any non-Islamic political entity. This credo motivates the activities of Hamas and other radical organizations in the territories. Therefore, an arrangement with the PLO is the only possibility. The prime minister made these remarks in a meeting with kibbutzim members.
