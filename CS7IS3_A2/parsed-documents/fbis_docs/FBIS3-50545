This is the situation: There are problems getting food. Stores are closed in some areas. Hotels are serving food only to their guests, and it is just one kind of meal, nothing else. Local drugstores are finding it difficult to obtain medical supplies as members of the Zapata National Liberation Army [EZLN] looted the stores when they arrived. Thus there are no medical supplies for a medical emergency. It is also worth noting that the Mexican Army has resumed reconnaissance and surveillance flights all over the city. Starting at approximately 0700 when the weather allowed because the fog lifted a little, Mexican Army helicopters have been flying over San Cristobal de las Casas and the area 7 km away, where the 31st Military Zone is stationed. I must also state that local residents are afraid the EZLN members will resume their activities near the city. Up until 0200 we could hear heavy caliber weapons, chiefly howitzers and cannons, firing at rebel objectives. Early this morning I had the opportunity to inspect the city. It was almost deserted. Fear prevails as the ringing of heavy caliber weapons has been heard since early in the morning from both far and near. Many tourists have been stranded here because gas stations are not observing regular business hours as they fear gasoline may be rationed. Why is that? Because so far, Pemex [Mexican Petroleum] trucks have not come to supply the city's three gas stations. [passage omitted] Stores and schools are closed in this city. The only thing we see is that a few people are coming down from the mountain range to try to sell their products here. In Ocosingo and mainly on the San Cristobal de las Casas - Ocosingo Highway, a distance of approximately 117 kilometers, military roadblocks are still up to keep people from entering due to the fierce clashes taking place in the mountain range, as we were told. Stores, public offices, and houses were looted in Ocosingo as well. A report states that 15 policemen were killed in a clash with the EZLN members. Four members of the Solorzano family were kidnapped. They are local ranchers. We can also report that in (Chiompla) Municipality a young woman was brutally beaten and raped for refusing to give food to the EZLN members. The state government reported that the Army is in Las Margaritas and Altamirano, although there is no word yet as to whether the soldiers have been able to enter these municipalities. The fighting continues. It was also reported from (Chiompla) that a stronger military operation w??l be conducted, although the time has not been announced. That is what is happening now in San Cristobal de las Casas and on the highway to Ocosingo.
