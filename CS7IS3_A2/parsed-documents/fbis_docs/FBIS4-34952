The woman is Aurea Genoveva Feria Cao, 51 years old, who was sentenced in 1990 for spreading enemy propaganda after her activities to destabilize the Cuban Government were proven. Reliable sources reported that the woman was released before she had served her full sentence as the result of talks with the Spanish Government, particularly Galician authorities. Asked by PRENSA LATINA last night about the Cuban authorities' decision to approve her trip to Spain, Feria Cao said: I appreciate this gesture very much. Feria Cao, mother of four children, two of whom traveled with her, said she was not mistreated while in prison but that serving time was a very hard thing in her life because she had been a housewife. I would rather have served my five-year sentence in the state's security installations, she said about the time she served in prison. Asked about her plans for the future, she said: I will not participate in political activities. She also announced her intention to reside in Spain. I will devote myself to my children and my home, she said.
