FBIS3-49481 "dreeu007__a94026" FBIS-EEU-94-007-A Document Type:Daily Report 11 January 1994 ANNEX Poland ZChN Opposes Budget Proposal, Urges Unity LD0801224494 Warsaw PAP in English 2204 GMT 8 Jan 94 LD0801224494 Warsaw PAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 8 -- The political committee of the Christian National Union (ZChN) criticised the governments budget proposals and called for the intensification of moves towards the integration of Polands right wing political groupings, in a statement released after its meeting in Warsaw on Saturday. The ZChN leaders think that the right wing unity is necessary because of an offensive from the left aiming at "far reaching political and ideological transformations" in Poland and because the local government elections are due soon. ZChN President Wieslaw Chrzanowski said at the press conference following the meeting that the Movement for the Republic of Poland (RDR) would decide next Saturday whether to join the "triple agreement" of right wing parties made up of the ZChN, the Centre Alliance (PC) and the Polish Peasant Party-Peasant Agreement (PSL-PL). Chrzanowski said that RDR leader Romuald Szeremietiew was already participating in the three parties meetings as an "associated person". Ryszard Czarnecki said that the government coalitions budget proposals ignored the wishes of the electorate. The coalition was not honouring its electoral promises, he maintained. Czarnecki added that the failure to increase spending on the nations defence was cause for concern given the uncertain situation in the East.
