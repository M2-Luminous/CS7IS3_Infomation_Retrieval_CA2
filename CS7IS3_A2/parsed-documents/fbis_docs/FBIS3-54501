An official of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), which groups all the opposition organisations, told AFP that the phony papers had been distributed since January 6 and that another edition was being prepared. "We imitated the dummy and the lay-out with photos of Saddam Husayn and filled the columns with criticism, calls for overthrowing the regime and revelations which Iraqis living under Saddam's rule are not used to," the opposition official said by telephone from Irbil in northern Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region. Other INC leaders contacted by telephone in Irbil and London said the distribution of the fake BABIL edition was continuing despite a campaign by the Iraqi authorities to confiscate all the copies. They said another edition was being prepared in Irbil, which has been under the control of Iraqi Kurds since 1991, and where the INC have a computerized printing-house. "The state television had to issue warnings on January 16, calling on the Iraqis to denounce the offenders," a INC official said. "We receive all the Iraqi newspapers in the north. The citizens living under the control of Baghdad need to be able to hear other views than the official literature," he added. He said it would not be difficult for the opposition to infiltrate other publications into the country. Iraq's Kurds declared autonomy after expelling Iraqi troops from their mountainous region in an uprising which followed Baghdad's defeat in the Gulf war early in 1991.
