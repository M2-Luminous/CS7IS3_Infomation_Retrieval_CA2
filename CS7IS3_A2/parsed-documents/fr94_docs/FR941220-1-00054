PWSs shall deliver pamphlets to all physicians and all medical facilities within the PWS service area, including, but not limited to, city, county and State health departments, pharmacies, public and private hospitals and clinics, family planning clinics and local welfare agencies. The PWS shall request the operators of such facilities to make the pamphlets available, in particular, to pregnant women. The pamphlets shall contain the information in paragraph (r)(3)(ii) of this section. The pamphlet shall define the extent of the geographical service area in question. (v) Signs. A prominent, permanent sign in a durable material, such as plastic, shall be placed at each faucet, fountain or source of water which could be used for drinking water in places such as restaurants, hotels/motels, rest areas, campgrounds, gas stations and public areas where not all taps will have treated water. If such facilities are equipped with a POE device or with POU devices such that all taps deliver water in compliance with the sulfate MCL, sign posting is not required. The signs must state the location of the nearest source of water which complies with the sulfate MCL and why precautions should be taken by non-acclimated persons. The text of the sign, in multiple languages where appropriate, shall be as follows: This water contains high levels of sulfates. This mineral can cause diarrhea in persons not accustomed to drinking water with high sulfate content. Persistent diarrhea can cause dehydration. Special care should be taken for infants. Bottled water is available nearby at XXXXXXXXXX . (vi) Notices to the media. PWSs shall submit copies of the notice described in paragraph (r)(3)(ii) of this section to radio and television stations that broadcast to the community served by the water system as soon as possible, but in no case later than 14 days after sulfate in excess of the MCL has been detected in the water, and once every six months while the water delivered into the distribution system exceeds the sulfate MCL.
