There is still a great deal of uncertainty over the other aspects of Russian-Belorussian economic union. According to a sociological poll conducted by Belorussia's [Belarus's] "Public Opinion" service, 66 percent of the country's inhabitants back monetary union, while 34 percent are against or cannot make up their minds. The idea of economic union with the powerful -- compared with Belorussia itself -- eastern neighbor is popular with a people who still have a poor idea however of what kind of union this is and what it is like. The main point is when, where, and at what rate of exchange Belorussians will be able to obtain the more stable Russian rubles instead of the rapidly devaluing "hares" (the level of inflation in March was around 40 percent). Even Belorussia's top leaders cannot provide a clear answer to that question now. Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb did not give IZVESTIYA a specific date for money exchange. So Belorussians were fretting for nothing as they tried to get rid of "hares" during the first few days following the signing of the treaty with Russia. (The current rate of the Russian ruble against the local bills of exchange is 1:8.) There is every indication that the farewell to the "hare" will not take place very soon: There are too many questions over monetary union and they still have to be settled. At an extraordinary Supreme Soviet session Belorussian deputies made the legislative adjustments necessary to ensure that the agreement with Russia works. But the question of the National Bank of Belorussia which, as a result of this agreement, is reduced to the level of a regional branch of the Russian bank, has not been resolved: One of the articles of the recently adopted Belorussian Constitution needs to be altered for that. People in Minsk are not desperately keen on doing that. Mechyslaw Hryb said that during a conversation with him the Russian president also remarked that "it is better to work on the text of the treaty than change the Constitution." The Supreme Soviet chairman believes that the first stage in the implementation of the Russian-Belorussian agreement will make it possible to judge whether the treaty is at all workable. Although for Mr. Hryb himself the need for economic union with Russia remains axiomatic. "Our economic orientation is eastward," the Belorussian speaker said. "The form that this orientation may take is another matter...." Meanwhile not only one-third of Belorussians polled by sociologists, but also the opposition are prey to gnawing doubts about the need for an economic treaty with Russia. People's Deputy Vladimir Novik, for instance, believes that "Belorussia will end up in complete financial isolation as a result of monetary union and bound tight to Russia. Russian Government strategists, rich financial corporations, and industrial groups can then set about sharing out Belorussia's national wealth." Mechyslaw Hryb does not however see any particular problem in the possibility of Russian capital's active penetration of the Belorussian market since this will, in his opinion, "at any rate be working for us by producing goods and giving our people work." The latter is a particularly pressing issue for the Republic since many of Belorussia's enterprises are on the verge of closure. Union with Russia, however much it means for Belorussia's one-sided economy, can hardly be a panacea for all ills. Their own economic reforms are also needed. Whether they will finally be implemented and in what direction will not be decided before 23 June, the day of the presidential elections. The future of the Belorussian economy once again rests on the outcome of political battles. Just six weeks remain until the election of Belorussia's first president, but two possibilities for the future of the Belorussian economy are now clear. If a moderate democrat or representative of the local "power party" wins, Belorussia can expect increasingly close rapprochement with Russia and gradual reforms somewhat reminiscent of the course pursued by V. Chernomyrdin's Russian Government. If a nationalist or Communist candidate is successful that may spell the beginning of senseless experiments, which may bring about the downfall of this country's economy.
