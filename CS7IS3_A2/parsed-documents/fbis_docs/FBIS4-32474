Therefore, the second day of the assembly session (?was characterized) by Dr. Silajdzic's speech on the basic principles of the new government's tasks. [Begin Silajdzic recording] I would like to stress that the government should have a unified program concept, regardless of the fact that it has a double role. There are no strategic differences concerning the political aims of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina that would require different program principles. The Federation is based on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, therefore, the preservation of sovereignty [word indistinct] aim that determines the unified direction of the action of all republican and federal authorities. This is also a strategic aim of the program and [words indistinct], whose verification will be decided on by this assembly. I believe that in this respect we have a consensus, not only of the Bosniak and Croatian people, but also of all the citizens who consider Bosnia-Herzegovina to be [words indistinct]. In addition to the unity on this vital aim, it is also very important to have a unified view on the means with which we intend to accomplish this aim. I believe it is undisputable that we have decided to achieve this primarily in a peaceful way and with political means. Setting up the federation itself confirms that approach. We have invested much effort to find qualitatively new solutions that will secure full national equality, democratic relations, and the highest standards of human rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This concept is determined by the Constitution of the Federation and it is already demonstrating its effectiveness on the ground with the majority Bosniak [words indistinct]. After the signing of the Washington agreements, the fighting in the region stopped within a very short period of time, and processes leading toward the establishment of a lasting peace have been started. This is certainly a very important [word indistinct] in the direction of finding an overall peace solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, we do not consider the federation to be a war coalition of two nations against the third, but a model of relations that offers all peoples and citizens an equal position within Bosnia-Herzegovina as an internationally recognized state. This is confirmed by the positive reaction by those political forces that are also beginning to emerge increasingly within the ranks of the Bosnian Serbs as an expression of resistance to the fascist nationalism of the SDS [Serbian Democratic Party] and its leaders. Everyone can see what relations we are proposing and setting up at present. The assembly that I am addressing as a Bosniak, a Muslim, as a (?nominal) prime minister is presided over by a Croat and a Serb alternately, depending on the constitutional form of the assembly' session. This is no coincidence. This is a real expression of a political project that we are promoting and offering. We believe that the federation is a project that has a future, a project that will sooner or later be, not imposed, but accepted and established throughout the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, we are very clearly expressing our commitment to finding political solutions in a peaceful way, political solutions that will justly satisfy the interests of all the nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is a commitment that the government will firmly pursue at home and abroad. [end recording] [Reporter] However, considering that the aggressor is still obstructing the peace initiatives, the international community must determine the sanctions for the aggressor and the guarantees for the implementation of the peace plans. The new government will consider [words indistinct] one of the priority tasks in its work. [Begin Silajdzic recording] With the signing of the Washington and Vienna Agreements, the adoption of the Constitution and the corresponding Constitutional Law, the election of the president and vice president, the initial phase of the process of setting up the federation has been completed. Today's decisions on appointing a reshuffled government and laws on the federal state administration will fully establish the (?instruments) of the executive authorities at the federal level in a way that is constitutionally regulated for the transitional period. The necessary prerequisites have therefore been created for an accelerated implementation of the constitutional provisions and the (?organization) of the authority at the cantonal and communal levels. In some regions activities have already been started to set up communal councils and cantonal assemblies. With its activities, the government should present a strong impetus for this process to be completed throughout the federation as soon as possible. There are no longer any valid constitutional-legal or political reasons to justify delays in the implementation of the Constitution at all levels [words indistinct]. The reasons why we should speed up the setting up of new bodies throughout the federation are not of a formal nature. This is the essential prerequisite for solving in an organized and systematic way the enormous problems caused by the war in all walks of life, problems ranging from the return of refugees to the revitalization of the economy and the reestablishment of production and the financial system. The constitutional position of the cantons in the federal system is such that they have numerous and very important duties that used to belong to the central authorities. These duties can and must be taken on only by the legal cantonal bodies, who will at the same time assume full responsibility for their work as determined by the Constitution. In that case, the government will indeed be able, in addition to its involvement in the peace process, foreign affairs, and defense, to involve itself maximally in work on the development of the economic system and economic policy, including the planning and rebuilding of the country, as well as regulating trade at home and with other countries, financial transactions at home and with other countries, (?setting up) the financial system, establishing control of the currency, creating monetary and fiscal policy, as well as defining energy policy. This means the inter-cantonal distribution of energy and the provision and maintenance of the necessary infrastructure. It stands to reason that these issues will occupy the dominant place in the government's program, since these are areas in which the federation has exclusive jurisdiction, and which are by their very nature such that they mostly belong within the government's jurisdiction. The government will also -- in accordance with the jurisdiction that will be determined within the federal authority -- program and implement its tasks in the health service, social policy, communications infrastructure, the utilization of economic resources, and other areas in which the federation and the cantons have divided rights and responsibilities. The government has to devote particular attention to the implementation of the constitutional regulations on human rights and basic [word indistinct], and -- within this -- the application of the right guaranteed by the Constitution for refugees to return to their homes is of particular importance. This is a problem whose solution cannot be delayed or conditioned by waiting for more favorable circumstances, at least not when it comes to territories under the control of the legal bodies of the republic, that is, the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is a clear relationship here between the time that has passed and the number of people that will return. The longer it takes to return, the fewer will return. This is why it is the responsibility of all the bodies, including the Federal Government, to work in an organized way and, most important, quickly for the return of the refugees and displaced people. All those who do not behave accordingly can be considered accomplices in preserving the effects of ethnic cleansing. For this reason, and apart from other measures, it is very important that the federal courts envisaged by the Constitution be formed as soon as possible -- in which a certain number of foreign judges will participate -- and that the institution of the ombudsmen, the guarantors of human rights, be activated as soon as possible, which will initially function under a patronage of sorts of the CSCE. The return of the refugees cannot depend solely on local cantonal authorities. This problem even exceeds the federal framework, since this is obviously a problem of international proportions. This means that the international community -- in solving this problem -- will be present both through the necessary financial help and through certain forms of institutionalized control. One such concrete step by the international community is the agreement by the European Union to administer the city of Mostar. We believe that this will help the [word indistinct] of this city, not only in material terms but also in overcoming the tensions created by the conflict, restoring confidence, and returning refugees. So the government should, within its jurisdiction, support this project by the European Union [words indistinct]. Within this time frame for the implementation of the [word indistinct], I would like to mention the foreign affairs [word indistinct]. Why? [words indistinct] the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government, since the federation still has no international legal status, and the constitutional solutions envisage that the federation will not engage in foreign affairs until the peace process is completed. As for the trends in foreign policy, I think that, in essence, the policy so far will be continued, with possible corrections as determined by developments, both external and internal. At the moment, however, there are no significant reasons for any radical changes in foreign or domestic policy.
