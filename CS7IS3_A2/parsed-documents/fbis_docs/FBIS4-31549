Geroski: "`Evidence' on Gligorov's Desk"] [Text] As we have discovered from a number of informal discussions in the delegates' group of VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian National Unity], yesterday a delegation of this party, consisting of Ljupco Georgievski, president, Dosta Dimovska, vice president, and Boris Zmejkovski, secretary general, was received by Kiro Gligorov, president of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FRYOM] just before the beginning of a new parliamentarian session. The same sources claim that the president was presented with "documentary evidence" of the state security service's involvement in the latest events within this party. Denial Allegedly, it was a "evidence" to show that the VMRO-DPMNE had again been bugged, as well as a "document of the state security service" in which some of the delegates of this parliamentary group (the factionists) were mentioned under coded names. Yesterday, Georgievski, Dimovska, and Zmejkovski were hesitant about commenting on the meeting, and we were told to wait for the statement expected to be issued by the president's office. Nevertheless, we registered that they were not prepared to submit this evidence in formal proceedings of the competent parliamentary commission for control over the work of the state security service, headed by the factionist Stoile Stojkov. Georgievski reiterated his denial of the claim made by Stojkov and Stefkovski that he had sent them to Gligorov to discuss the flag. We have unofficially found out that such a meeting was held with Stefkovski, Stojkov, Jordan Boskov, and Tome Stojanovski. However, according to yesterday's version, delegate Stojkov came out with his own initiative for replacing the 16-pointed star on the flag with the double tailed lion. Claims Yesterday we also spoke to the other side -- the delegates Stojkov and Stefkovski. They both claimed they were still in the VMRO-DPMNE and they were also sure that their option would win in this party. Stefkovski said that they did not intend to attack Georgievski and Dimovska, because they considered they were not the actual leaders of the party, in which the alleged leaders are Zmejkovski, Dinevski, Sokolov, and Florovski. Stefkovski pointed out that in an informal discussion with Georgievski they had agreed not to attack each other mutually, but the leader broke the agreement in his interview for VECER. Besides, Stefkovski claimed that, according to the party statute, Georgievski could in no way be elected coordinator of the delegates' group, because Article 30 paragraph 2 of the Statute says that the leader and the deputy of the delegate group are proposed by the president of the party (in this case Georgievski proposed himself, the factionists claimed). The general impression of your chronicler is that there is total dissatisfaction within the ranks of the VMRO-DPMNE delegates' group, but also beyond it, within the opposition circles, because of the fact that the affair has acquired such dimensions. They are now making rapid attempts to work out how to correct what should have been corrected a long time ago, at the time the people of this party decided to embark on fierce mutual showdowns. [Box, p 3] "Clarification of Legal Procedure" Yesterday Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov received the leaders of the VMRO-DPMNE at their request, that is, the party president, vice president, and general secretary, Ljupco Georgievski, Dosta Dimovska, and Boris Zmejkovski. Their request for a meeting with President Gligorov was based on the explanation that they wanted to inform him about the state security service's attitude toward the opposition and that they wanted to hand over to him documented evidence. According to their claims, it had to do with telephone bugging and operations of the state security service involving a number of VMRO-DPMNE delegates. At the very beginning President Gligorov emphasized that, according to his constitutional and legal authority, he was in no position to examine the involvement of the state security service in internal party relations. By clearly defined constitutional and legal authority, he expressed his firm belief that questions of this kind had to be raised and dealt with within the framework of the defined legal procedure. In that sense, President Gligorov emphasized that, under the Constitution, the only competent place to discuss information or suspicions about the state security service's attitude toward the VMRO-DPMNE was the Macedonian parliamentary commission for control over the work of the state security service, and that was the appropriate place to discuss documents related to initiating proceedings with the competent bodies -- the public prosecutor and the appropriate court. That is the only way to avoid speculation or rumors surrounding such serious charges. It is also the only way to safeguard the basic principles of democracy, respect for the law and management of the authorities in the republic. President Gligorov also stressed that, in the present preelection period, it was especially important to create a democratic atmosphere and respect for the law as a permanent political orientation in the republic. That will help to reinforce the feeling inside and outside the country of respect for the basic national interests and the maintenance of the integrity of our country, in the face of either internal conflicts or foreign pretensions. The VMRO-DPMNE agreed with this appeal of the president's.
