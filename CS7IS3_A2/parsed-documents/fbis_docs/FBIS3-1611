This was stated by Zhang Sai, director-general of the State Statistics Bureau, at a press conference focusing on a communique on the 1993 national economic and social development. According to the official, the country's gross domestic product (GDP) last year reached 3,000 billion yuan, an increase of 736 billion yuan, or 13.4 percent over the 1992 figure at comparable prices. This was the highest annual growth since 1985, Zhang said. The output of key industrial and agricultural products was all-time high and the infrastructure facilities were improved further, thus creating favorable conditions for the sustained development of the national economy, he added. Zhang also said that in 1993, China's scientific and technological capabilities continued expanding, and that the foreign exchange reserves increased. On people's living standards, he noted that in 1993, household income registered further increase. The per capita income of urban residents that could be used as living expenses was 2,337 yuan, and the per capita income of rural residents was 921 yuan, a real growth of 10.2 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, if the increase in prices was excluded. The living conditions in both urban and rural areas further improved, Zhang said, noting that 266 million square meters of new housing were completed in urban areas and another 570 million square meters of new houses were built in the countryside. The scope of household consumption widened. Following possession of durable goods such as refrigerators, color TV sets, VCRs and hi-fi systems, some families were targeting telephones and automobiles as new items of consumption, Zhang said. By the end of 1993, he continued, private telephone subscribers had reached 7.826 million, 3.672 million more than a year ago. Seven percent of the urban households had installed telephones. Pagers and mobile telephones were becoming increasingly popular. On China's economic reforms, he noted that in 1993, reforms that focused on the establishment of a socialist market economy developed in depth. The official cited progress in the rural reforms and reforms of the state-owned enterprises, the labor and wage system, the social security system, the housing system, the macro-economic regulation system and the pricing system. Major breakthroughs were made in two aspects, he said. On the one hand, the price system was straightened out, and this helped raise the unduly low prices of basic products and infrastructure facilities and promote the formation of market mechanisms. On the other, while breaking away with the traditional means of macroeconomic regulation, experiments were made in using various regulatory approaches at proper timing with appropriate strength. Positive results were made and good experiences accumulated as a result. In 1993, Zhang said, China continued its opening policy in a comprehensive, in-depth and multi-facet way. Foreign trade further expanded, with improved structure of import and export. The utilization of foreign capital registered significant increase, and new record was set both in the number of new contracts signed for using foreign capital and in the value of foreign capital actually used, he said. The official also noted what he called "noticeable progress" made in economic and technical cooperation with foreign countries and in international tourism. According to Zhang, major problems that remained in China's economic performance included: a decline of living standards for some households as a result of the high price increases, two large a scale of the investment in fixed assets under construction, and failure of the development of basic industries and the infrastructure to meet the requirements of the high economic growth. In summary, Zhang said, the economic development in 1993 was encouraging, and new changes took place in all fields, thus creating favorable conditions for implementing the guideline for 1994 economic work -- seizing the opportunity, deepening the reforms, widening the opening of China to the outside world, accelerating development while maintaining stability.
