There are some indications that in autumn you might become the youngest chancellor. Does this speed not sometimes frighten you? [Scharping] No. [DER SPIEGEL] That is a lot of self-confidence for a 46-year-old from the provinces in Mainz. [Scharping] At 46 one is right in the middle of one's life -- hopefully. Should I apologize for having learned and done many things when I was younger? [DER SPIEGEL] How do you respond to the skepticism that you, as a foreign policy layman, are challenging the statesman Kohl? [Scharping] As far as I know no one has yet been born chancellor. And what someone can do outside depends very much on what he achieves at home: in overcoming mass unemployment, in dealing properly with public finances, for more social justice or ecological modernization. [DER SPIEGEL] Kohl can show off his official visits. You are touring districts in Rhineland-Palatinate and undergoing training in a fitness room to get broad shoulders. [Scharping] Fitness is always good. I will certainly not be accused by anyone of not fulfilling my office properly. This includes direct contacts and a precise knowledge of the inner workings of a country. Whoever has spent a long time on the stage in Bonn, removed from everything else, no longer knows everyday life. A chancellor should not just tour flourishing landscapes in the Far East but also get to know the misery in the east close by, in the new laender. [DER SPIEGEL] Are you not frightened by the prospect of becoming chancellor right in the middle of a crisis? [Scharping] No question, this is a serious challenge. But things depend not only on one person alone but also on the quality of the team. I am very confident in this respect. The SPD will have no problems in being better in any office than the current government. [DER SPIEGEL] Whom are you going to nominate, and when are you going to present them? [Scharping] On 22 June we will first adopt the government program. Then we will name the people -- mostly men and women who are already working on the government program. [DER SPIEGEL] Will there be fewer ministries in a Scharping government? [Scharping] Quite certainly. The former Ministry of Youth, Family, Women's Affairs, and Health has been turned into three ministries. I think this is superfluous. It is not absolutely necessary that the Ministry of Education and Science as well as the Ministry of Research and Technology are separate. When the postal reform has been completed, we will no longer need the respective ministry. And a Construction Ministry in which one official coordinates the work of three state secretaries is also absurd. [DER SPIEGEL] Under Kohl the number of parliamentary state secretaries rose to 26. Will you abolish these expensive servants of the state? [Scharping] In any case, there will be clearly fewer of them. [DER SPIEGEL] The FRG is also in a political crisis: The trust in the people's parties is waning, there are right-wing extremist trends, and in the east the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, is getting more and more followers. Do you see any dangers for democracy? [Scharping] The stability and the ability of the democratic institutions to act are being affected. Major and minor scandals are one thing. Second, the citizens realize that decisive politicians -- in particular after 1989 -- do not say what they think and do not do what they say. And third, the people are right to say that many politicians' ability to expect their own followers to accept unpleasant truths is clearly lagging behind the inclination to inflict new burdens on the followers of the other parties. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you see a way out? [Scharping] We will get out of this situation probably only if the citizens and those who hold responsibility in the parties realize that in politics, and also in everyday life, one needs a different mode of behavior than the one that has become usual in the west German distribution society: Solidarity and internal peace mean not only that the weak should stick together but also require the model of the elites. And without unemployment, the lack of housing, and the bitter social injustices one cannot explain the rising outrage and the political extremism. After all, there is a great readiness to get involved. Look at the many citizens' initiatives. When these people no longer let themselves be integrated into the large parties, the trade unions, or the churches, this must have something to do with the state of affairs in these institutions. Therefore, we have consistently modernized the SPD, and we are also giving independent experts a chance. [DER SPIEGEL] Have you already resigned yourself to the fact that your party will get stuck in the 30-percent range? [Scharping] No, of course not. However, one must realize that a high turnout and large shares in the votes by the two large parties were phenomena in particular of the 1970's. In this respect, we now have some sort of normalization, which naturally bothers me. Without people's parties, at least without the SPD, there will be no social democracy in Germany. However, in the meantime we have already been achieving quite respectable results again.... [DER SPIEGEL] But still below 40 percent -- this is certainly a reason why party colleagues of yours, like ex-Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, are flirting with the majority voting system. [Scharping] I am not. [DER SPIEGEL] Because in Mainz you are ruling together with the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], which would not then exist any more? [Scharping] No, because I am convinced that our voting system has proved its worth. I think the parties should rather try to convince the citizens of the quality of their policy and themselves than think about how a stability that does not really exist can be fabricated with the help of the election system. [DER SPIEGEL] It has always been one of your political principles not to talk about coalitions before elections. Why is it that you now rule out a grand coalition at the federal level so definitely? [Scharping] Have you ever asked this question of someone from the Union? No one wants a grand coalition. Nor will there be one. [DER SPIEGEL] But you, like us, know that there may be an election result that hardly permits anything else than an elephants' wedding -- just as in Baden-Wuerttemberg. [Scharping] Why should I worry about necessities at a time when I have the possibility to use every ounce of my strength to make sure that this does not happen. [DER SPIEGEL] This sounds different. [Scharping] No, I would like to repeat: There will be no grand coalition, before or after the elections. [DER SPIEGEL] Your big election campaign topic -- employment and social justice -- was also the focus of the unsuccessful campaigns of Johannes Rau and Oskar Lafontaine. Why should it be successful this time? [Scharping] In Germany we are short at least 5 million jobs, and, thanks to the cold policy of this Federal Government, social division has reached alarming proportions. I am sure that citizens have become much more aware of the need for a national employment pact than they were four or six years ago. We are striving for this pact: easing the burden of costs on labor; easing the burden on the companies so that they can invest, modernize, and create jobs; easing the burden on the social security systems constituted by tasks that are tasks for all of society and, therefore, must be paid for by everyone -- just to cite the central points. [DER SPIEGEL] Some proposals by the SPD Commission, which is working out your government program, do not sound like easing the burden. Thus, the Brandenburg social minister wants "children's cash," with every child getting 600 German marks [DM] per month. Can something like that be financed at all? [Scharping] What must be urgently achieved is exempting the subsistence minimum from taxes and easing the burden on families with children. In this respect I agree with Regine Hildebrandt, but I do not agree with the instrument. Furthermore, the advantages of splitting taxes among spouses should have an upper limit. Families with children must be better off in the future. [DER SPIEGEL] Your deputy, Wolfgang Thierse, calls for an equalization of burdens between east and west or a tax for the benefit to the east. Can the SPD win the elections in the west with that? [Scharping] The equalization of burdens is taking place. More than DM150 billion is being transferred to the east every year. The problem is not the equalization of burdens but its wrong financing from loans and from contributions by working people. This must be changed, because reconstruction in eastern Germany is a common task. A debt explosion a la Waigel and the unilateral burdens on working people ruin both solidarity and solidity. [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, you do not have a "pfennig for the east" in your government program? [Scharping] We will develop the program on the basis of decisions made at the Wiesbaden party congress -- and they do not include a "pfennig for the east." [DER SPIEGEL] Can you envisage anything else for the reconstruction in the east? [Scharping] Yes. I am very much in favor of using French experiences: Prime Minister Balladur issued a loan. Instead of the planned 40 billion francs, it yielded more than 100 billion francs. Analogous to that, we could issue a loan for the reconstruction in the east, but also for large infrastructure investment or for a future investment program and make the revenue exempt from tax. Balladur linked the project with the possibility to redistribute existing savings assets and to acquire an option on purchasing shares of privatization projects, such as the privatization of French Telecom. Now he has relegated privatization to the back burner. However, no one prevents us from making such a loan attractive and from making such an offer after turning German Telekom into a shareholding company. This also applies to other public companies. [DER SPIEGEL] Have industry and the banks already reacted to your idea? [Scharping] I have talked about it with some people; such an activity would not be considered competition. All in all, I get the impression that the SPD and, in particular, its chairman get a better response in many internal talks with leading industry managers over the past four months than the Union or the chancellor. [DER SPIEGEL] Lafontaine demands that a government headed by the SPD also reexamines all the social services. Does this also mean cutbacks in unemployment benefit or sick pay? [Scharping] No, we concluded this debate in connection with the thrift, consolidation, and growth laws. I say it quite clearly: When I am chancellor, we will retract the cutbacks in bad-weather compensation, because in winter they just lead to rising unemployment. [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, nothing will be reduced after reexamination? [Scharping] Many things will remain as they are; regarding other measures, the scope and purpose of the financing will be changed, and then there can be gradual corrections, for instance on subsidies. Specifically: We will abolish tax credits for children for the benefit of a unified children's allowance. We will introduce income-neutral promotion instruments for the construction of one-family and two-family houses. We will struggle against abuse in the tax and social system. [DER SPIEGEL] When things get serious, the SPD also shies away. For the sake of your government power in Duesseldorf and Saarbruecken, you do not dare to abolish the billion-mark subsidies for coal in the Ruhr and the Saar. [Scharping] This has nothing to do with government power but with industrial policy and the contribution to a certain independence of German energy supplies. [DER SPIEGEL] Imported coal is cheaper. [Scharping] Giving up domestic coal for the benefit of imported coal would be a structural break with unpredictable consequences in the Ruhr area, in the Lausitz region, and in the Saar. Rainer Barzel once said: "When there is fire in the Ruhr, the waters of the Rhine will not be sufficient to extinguish it." The steel and coal policy is a pillar of jobs and social peace, that is, of Germany as an industrial location. [DER SPIEGEL] After the elections in Lower-Saxony in March the SPD will soon be facing another test. How important is the presidential election on 23 May for the Bundestag elections? [Scharping] At the election of the president, it will be decided whether the Federal Assembly follows exclusively party policy interests and thus decides against the will of the clear majority of the population. Then there will be a new debate about having the president elected by the people.... [DER SPIEGEL] ...which you have hitherto rejected. [Scharping] Yes, but a considerable number of parliamentary deputies from the Union will vote for Johannes Rau. Then one must not forget the FDP and the three possible ballots. [DER SPIEGEL] With Constitutional Court President Roman Herzog the Union is backing a candidate who meets with more approval than Steffen Heitmann. [Scharping] The president of the Federal Constitutional Court should be more restrained in interviews. As a party candidate he cannot be an independent judge. If Mr. Herzog become the candidate of the Union, he should not exercise his office in Karlsruhe any more. [DER SPIEGEL] Why has the SPD not suggested east German Richard Schroeder as a candidate for all parties? [Scharping] This is being done for Johannes Rau. He is the best man for the office. [DER SPIEGEL] You have often and with pleasure met with the chancellor.... [Scharping] ....it is you who say that it is with pleasure. [DER SPIEGEL] Could people be confused when Kohl and Scharping attack each other publicly in the super election year and then get together behind closed doors? [Scharping] Kohl has once again issued an invitation for 14 January. The topic will be the move to Berlin. As regards legislation, nursing-care insurance still has to be settled, in addition to the postal reform. My need for small talk with Helmut Kohl is very small. However, it is not my fault that his government is unable to do anything useful, not even in connection with combating organized crime. [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Scharping, thank you for this interview.
