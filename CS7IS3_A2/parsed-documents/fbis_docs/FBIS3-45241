China began to grant special government allowances to outstanding experts in 1990. By the end of last year, nearly 110,000 experts had been granted allowances. Compared to those selected before, there are more young people among those selected this time, and many of them are engaged closely in agriculture, industry and technological popularization. The officials said the allowance program helps encourage hard working people and thus intensifies people's respect for knowledge and professionally capable personnel. The state will continue to carry out the program with the improvement of relevant regulations and concrete measures, the officials said.
