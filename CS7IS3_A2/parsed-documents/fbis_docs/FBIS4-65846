In particular, can you comment on TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] President Rauf Denktas' statement to the Turkish parliament that "the TRNC will move to integrate with Turkey if the Greek Cypriots are allowed to join the European Union [EU]"? [Yilmaz] I attended the EC ministerial meeting as Turkey's foreign minister in Luxembourg in 1988. I disagreed with then Foreign Minister Genscher when he described the Cyprus problem during the opening session of that meeting as a determining factor in EC-Turkish relations. The meeting broke up because of that. Unfortunately, the same view was adopted during the summit in Dublin as official EC policy. Consequently, we have to considere EC policy on Cyprus in our relations with that organization. Actually, that was a step the EC considered but failed to take for many years. That approach was adopted as the EC's official policy in 1990. The second step the EC plans to take at the present time is to allow Cyprus to join that organization. Purporting to be the legal government of all of Cyprus, the Greek Cypriot Republic of Southern Cyprus [title as published] has signed a partnership agreement with the EC. The question of Cyprus becoming an EC member is now on the agenda. Contacts are being held on when the talks should begin. As far as Turkey and the TRNC are concerned, the matter is extremely important. Turkey was one of the first countries to sign a partnership agreement with the EC. It officially applied to join that organization as a full member in 1987. However, its application has been suspended during the past seven years. Considering all that, Southern Cyprus joining the EC as an entity that represents the entire island will be an EC move against Turkey. Furthermore, it will make a solution of the Cyprus problem more difficult. [Ersanel] Will the EU fail to realize that? It seems that President Denktas has a clearer approach to the matter. [Yilmaz] The EC will definitely feel the need to make an assessment to avoid having the Cyprus problem placed within its framework. Turkey's stance is an important factor. I am convinced that Turkey must clearly explain Rauf Denktas' argument. This will contribute to the EC's assessment. The EC must be informed immediately that Southern Cyprus joining it will mean the "de facto" solution to the Cyprus problem because north Cyprus will move to fully integrate with Turkey. Consequently, the effort made within the UN framework to resolve the Cyprus problem will have failed. Meanwhile, it must be recalled that the 1960 agreements, which provided for the establishment of a partnership government in Cyprus, contain a provision that Cyprus can become a member of international organizations only with the consent of Turkey and Greece, the guarantor powers of the partnership. A legal debate can be held on the validity of a partnership between Southern Cyprus and the EC, which Turkey will not approve. [Ersanel] It seems that you regard this stance as a "diplomatic trump card." [Yilmaz] Yes, I do. That is what I am saying. [Ersanel] Can an argument be made on its validity? [Yilmaz] Two factors must be established if effective steps are to be taken to find a solution to the Cyprus problem. First, the two communities in Cyprus must be regarded as two separate entities. That is not the case at the present time. The existence of the Turkish Cypriot community as a separate entity is a reality that is ignored by the world. The second is the removal of the differences, economic differences in particular, between the two communities in due course of time. The outcome of integration with the EC will an very negative effectson these issues. The economic imbalance between the two sides will worsen. [Ersanel] Can you comment on the U.S. approach to the Cyprus problem? [Yilmaz] The United States has always regarded the Cyprus problem as a priority issue that has a bearing on its domestic politics. In view of the Greek lobby's influence, the U.S. Administration has always focused attention on the Cyprus problem and regarded it as a priority issue that has a bearing on domestic politics. Meanwhile, the views the U.S. presidential candidates expressed on the Cyprus problem during past election campaigns were modified in accordance with U.S. foreign policy after they were elected. However, the matter is completely different from Turkey's viewpoint. The Cyprus problem does not concern domestic politics in Turkey, it is a national issue. I have always argued that the Cyprus problem does not concern Cyprus alone. It is a matter that tests Turkey's will to defend its legitimate rights and interests. Turkey has maintained the right approach on the Cyprus problem and its intervention on the island was legally justified. Otherwise, the problem would not have continued for 30 years. If Turkey agrees to a solution, which would conflict with its interests and with those of its kinsmen in Cyprus, the implications of that approach will not be limited to the island. In fact, it would set an example for similar problems in other parts of the world. [Ersanel] Can you give an example? [Yilmaz] A very important example is the problem in the Aegean Sea. [Ersanel] Can you comment on Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's Cyprus policy? She has said that the "Cyprus problem will be solved." [Yilmaz] I do not believe that Mrs. Ciller is aware of the historical perspectives of the problem. She has already said that the Cyprus problem is an obstacle for Turkey and has described the existing state of affairs on the island as a no-win situation. She has said that this harms Turkey. Furthermore, she has claimed that the effort made to resolve the problem has been deliberately obstructed in the past and has noted that she is determined to solve the Cyprus problem. What Mrs. Ciller has said in a diplomatic way is that Turkey has significantly suffered because of the Cyprus problem. Therefore, it is ready to make concessions to have it solved. Naturally, that approach will stimulate more pressure on Turkey. In view of that, I believe that her approach is very wrong. It conflicts with the policies of the governments that have come to power in Turkey during the past 30 years. The only hopeful factor is that her approach is not shared. It is not shared even in her own party and government. Therefore, I hope that she will refrain from making new assessments and initiatives on the matter. [Ersanel] Can you explain the solution you have in mind for the Cyprus problem? [Yilmaz] Considering the Greek Cypriot intentions and approach, I believe that Turkey must clearly say that it is convinced that the continuation of the negotiating process is useless. I believe that we must send a clearer message on the matter to the United States, the United Nations, and the other countries that are related to the problem. The Turkish Cypriots responded positively to the two packages former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar proposed in the past. The packages were rejected by the Greek Cypriot side. Regarding UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's confidence-building measures, the Greek Cypriot side has disclosed that it is prepared to agree to that package only if certain changes are made. That indicates that the Greek Cypriots intend to use the confidence-building measures to achieve their objectives. In view of that, I believe that the Turkish Cypriot side must inform the world that it is convinced that maintaining the present process is useless. Meanwhile, it must use the political developments in the world to strengthen its case. The adoption of a determined approach by Turkey may create an opportunity for new efforts to find a realistic solution to the problem. Of course, the pressure on Turkey may be intensified. That, too, must be considered. Nevertheless, the future of Cyprus may be hopeless if the effort that is made to solve the problem through the concessions the Greek Cypriots demand is maintained. Cyprus may turn into a country like Bosnia. In short, Turkey must clearly inform the world about what can and cannot be achieved in Cyprus in light of the Greek Cypriot approach and international opinion on the problem. I am convinced that initiatives that are only aimed at gaining time are useless.
