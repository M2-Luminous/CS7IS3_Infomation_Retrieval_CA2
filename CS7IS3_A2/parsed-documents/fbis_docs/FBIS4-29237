In his interview he said it was proved that the present "regime" is a treacherous and flunkeyist "regime" which evaded a probe into the May 18 truth and opened rice market against the demand of the people over the last one year and coiled up tensions on the Korean peninsula with the introduction of Patriot missiles. It is a judgement of Hanchongnyon that there is no need to expect from the Kim Yong-sam "regime" any longer, he said. Touching on this year's reunification movement, he said that the federation would defend the principle of great national unity, demand the signing of a peace agreement and continue to maintain the keynote of the student movement in the reunification movement including a successful opening of the pan-national rally. He demanded that the present "regime" renounce its anti-reunification attitude to suppress Hanchongnyon.
