Major General Ilan Biran, commander of the Central Command, decided to ban Israelis from entering the city until further notice. Our Army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David reports that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] was scheduled to hold a rally in the city this evening and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] was worried about possible terror attacks. Earlier today Hamas staged a few processions in the city. Yoram Kohen reports: [Begin Kohen recording] Today's procession in Jericho was a first test. Most participants came from outside the city, from Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas leaders in the territories sent hundreds of supporters to Jericho, seemingly to test the patience of the Palestinian police commanders. A similar demonstration was held recently in Gaza. The Hamas rally started with a procession bearing provocative religious symbols, Koran books, and green flags, and marchers proudly chanting: 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam is our mentor. The Palestinian police commanders explained their decision to allow Hamas to hold the rally in Jericho's big mosque by saying that theirs was a democratic society which did not shut people up, perhaps out of a wish to avoid confrontations. Such a concentration of Hamas members in the self-rule area led Maj. Gen. Biran to take precautions. Consequently, he banned Israelis from entering the city until further notice. [end recording]
