FR940525-0-00033 FR940525-0-00020 XII. Part B Premium A. Legislative Provision Section 1839(e) of the Act establishes the amount of the Medicare Part B premium at 50 percent of the monthly actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over for months in calendar years 1984 through 1990; section 4301 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 added specific premiums for 1991 through 1995 based on Congressional Budget Office estimates, at the time, of premium amounts that would equal 50 percent of that actuarial rate. Section 13571 of OBRA 93 amended section 1839(e) of the Act to again have the premium determined annually so that it equals 50 percent of the monthly actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over for calendar years 1996, 1997 and 1998. B. Regulations Revisions To reflect OBRA 90 and 93 we are revising 42 CFR 408.20, Monthly premiums, by adding calendar years 1991 through 1995, and calendar years after 1998, to the heading and content of paragraph (b), which currently contains the methodology for the period July 1976 through December 1983 and the periods after 1990. We are specifying that the rates cited in section 1839(e)(1)(B) of the Act apply to 1991 through 1995. To reflect OBRA 93, we are adding calendar years 1996 through 1998 to the heading and content of paragraph (c), which currently discusses the methodology for determining premiums for calendar years 1984 through 1990. XIII. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking We ordinarily publish a notice of proposed rulemaking for a regulation in the Federal Register and provide a period for public comment. However, we may waive that procedure if we find good cause that prior notice and comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. As noted earlier, this rule updates our rules to properly reflect explicit statutory requirements that are clear on their face and that we are not interpreting in any way beyond their commonly understood meanings. Without these changes, certain regulation requirements are in conflict with the statute, possibly misleading those who rely on our regulations. In addition, some of the statutory changes included in these regulations have been enacted with retroactive effective dates or effective dates close to the date of enactment of OBRA 93. Under these circumstances, prompt publication of the correct up-to-date rules best serves those governed by these regulations. Because this rule does not create any legal requirements and because publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking here would perpetuate conflicts between clear statutory directives and our regulations, we find that publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking before issuing this final rule would be unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. However, we are providing a 60-day comment period for public comments on the final rule as indicated at the beginning of this rule. XIV. Response to Comments Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on FR documents published for comment, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. We will consider all comments we receive by the date and time specified in the DATES section of this preamble, and, if we proceed with a subsequent document, we will respond to the comments in the preamble to that document. XV. Regulatory Impact Statement We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all Medicare-participating facilities are considered to be small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of small entity. Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule will have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. This final rule with comment period updates our regulations to incorporate numerous self-implementing statutory provisions that are not interrelated. None of the regulations interprets or extends requirements beyond those included in the self-implementing legislation. The amendments to which this rule pertains are already in effect or will go into effect independent of the publication of this rule. Consequently, there are no actions to be taken that would flow from further analyses of the impact of these provisions on entities. Therefore, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and would not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. In accordance with the provisions of E.O. 12866, this final rule with comment period was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. XVI. Collection of Information Requirements This document does not impose information collection and recordkeeping requirements. Consequently, it need not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).
