FR940930-0-00012 FR940930-0-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 92&hyph;ANE&hyph;33; Amendment 39&hyph;9038; AD 93&hyph;19&hyph;02R1] Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney JT9D Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule, request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment revises an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT9D series turbofan engines, that currently requires eddy current inspection and modification of the diffuser case rear rail, and removal, if necessary, of the diffuser case. This amendment corrects an error in paragraph numbering in the compliance section and allows modification of diffuser cases in accordance with previous revisions of a PW Service Bulletin as an alternative means of compliance. This amendment is prompted by comments received after issuance of AD 93&hyph;19&hyph;02. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent diffuser case rupture and an uncontained engine failure. DATES: Effective on October 17, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations was approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 18, 1993 (58 FR 51212, October 1, 1993). Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before November 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 92&hyph;ANE&hyph;33, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Pratt & Whitney, 400 Main Street, East Hartford, CT 06108. This information may be examined at the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Daniel Kerman, Aerospace Engineer, Engine Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7130, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 16, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued AD 93&hyph;19&hyph;02, Amendment 39&hyph;8695 (58 FR 51212, October 1, 1993), as a final rule with request for comments that superseded AD 86&hyph;11&hyph;04, to define initial inspection requirements that will allow for transition to more stringent repetitive on-wing eddy current inspections of the diffuser case rear rail for cracking. AD 93&hyph;19&hyph;02 also requires ultrasonic and metallographic inspections of the shell wall, and ultrasonic inspection of the rear rail at the Boss 6 location to determine weld size. In the previous AD, 86&hyph;11&hyph;04, diffuser cases were allowed to remain in service with weld repairs of up to 4 inches in length. In AD 93&hyph;19&hyph;02, diffuser cases with weld repairs in the rear rail of greater than or equal to 1.5 inches in axial length at Boss 6 must be replaced. In addition, AD 93&hyph;19&hyph;02 requires a one-time X-ray inspection of the rear rail and sides of bosses for weld quality. This inspection is necessary since in the last two failures, weld defects were undetected by the inspections required by AD 86&hyph;11&hyph;04. Also, diffuser cases with rear rails that have been weld-repaired must incorporate the modifications described in PW SB No. 5805, Revision 6, dated September 15, 1993. Finally, an optional terminating action to the inspections and modifications of AD 93&hyph;19&hyph;02 is available with the installation of a new, improved diffuser case in accordance with PW SB No. 6105, Revision 2, dated May 14, 1993.
