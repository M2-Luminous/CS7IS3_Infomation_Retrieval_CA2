Police authorities at the Serbian border said to the Swedish representatives who were accompanying the Albanians that "the group cannot return to Kosova and you can do anything you like with them." This act ranks Serbia in the group of countries like Eritrea and Ethiopia which do not accept their nationals return to the country, the largest Swedish newspaper DAGENS NYHETER writes. It also reports that a day after, the group of Albanians were sent back to Stockholm and then to some cities in Sweden to stay for some days until a reply will be given. According to international convention of 1948, everyone has the right to return to his country. But human rights are not of any value in countries like Serbia, said Bjorn Gesta Sporong, adviser in the Justice Department at the Swedish Foreign Ministry.
