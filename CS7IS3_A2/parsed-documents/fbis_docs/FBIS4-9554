Neokrnje located in the triangle between the Travnik, Teslic, and Skender Vakuf communes. Our defenders' action has significantly expanded the free territory on the Vlasic plateau. Dozens of Chetniks have been killed and we have captured a nice collection of material and technical equipment [words indistinct] -- a 105-mm howitzer, a Praga antiaircraft weapon, a SAM-110 vehicle, 120-mm mortar, a antiaircraft machine gun mounted on a tractor, (?several pieces) of small caliber weaponry, and a substantial quantity of ammunition and military equipment. As we file this report, the members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 7th Corps have captured the mountain resort on Mt. Neokrnje which the Chetniks used as quarters for manpower and hardware during battles.
