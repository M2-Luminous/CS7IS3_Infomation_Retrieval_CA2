FR940525-2-00027 FR940525-2-00019 [FRL&hyph;4887&hyph;9] Public Water System Supervision Program Revision for the State of North Dakota AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Public notice is hereby given in accordance with the provisions of seciton 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. 300g&hyph;2, and 40 CFR part 142, subpart B-Primary Enforcement Responsibility, that the State of North Dakota has revised its Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) Primacy Program. North Dakota's PWSS program, administered by the North Dakota Division of Municipal Facilities, has adopted regulations for lead and copper that correspond to the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) in 40 CFR part 141 for lead and copper promulgated by EPA on June 7, 1991 (56 FR 26460&hyph;26564). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has completed its review of North Dakota's primacy revision and has determined that it is no less stringent than the NPDWR for lead and copper. EPA therefore approves North Dakota's primacy revision for the Lead and Copper Rule. This determination shall become effective June 24, 1994. Any interested parties are invited to submit written comments on this determination, and may request a public hearing on or before June 24, 1994.
