Virgilijus Bulovas, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary and a member of Seimas, has been appointed head of the working group, which will have four additional members. Bulovas previously headed the national delegation for negotiations with Russia, since dismissed by the president. The other members of the group did not belong to the earlier national negotiating delegation. They are Raimondas Barcevicius, vice-minister for industry and commerce; Arvydas Lescinskas, vice-minister for transportation; Ricardas Seibelis, director of the account settlement center of the Bank of Lithuania; Petras Zapolskas, head of the foreign ministry's CIS countries section. Some of the members of the delegation for negotiating with Russia, dismissed by decree of the president, have decided not to dissolve their group. They have not, for the time being, outlined their status more clearly, but intend to do so at the first meeting of the group, which will probably take place right after New Year's. Romualdas Ozolas, one of the members of the group, calls the decision by the former negotiators a "civic initiative" to observe and evaluate the negotiations with Russia as well as the treaties that are made with it.
