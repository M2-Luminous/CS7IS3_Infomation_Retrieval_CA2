Is that correct? [Peres] We are making progress all the time, the breakthrough in principle has already been made, now we have to make further progress. [Gay] As we heard, you went into the details yesterday, so let us also go into them. For instance, the deployment of Palestinian policemen at the crossing points. Is it true that the PLO has agreed to yield on that? [Peres] I do not want to go into details. We are negotiating and I think we are quite close to an agreement, but I prefer not to go into details at this stage. [Gay] How close is quite close? [Peres] If we receive reasonable answers from the other side, I think we will overcome the differences. In other words, things they said no to before, they are now reconsidering. We will give them time to review things and then see. [Gay] If you do not want to go into details, then let us talk about the principle that previously they said no, and now they are saying perhaps, and tomorrow they might say no again, as has happened in the past. [Peres] What has been signed is finalized, and we are now aspiring to sign a paper, which we will bring home, and on which we will consult with the prime minister. I do not think it pays to make haste in making statements instead of waiting a few more days and presenting things in a precise way. New ideas were raised and a breakthrough is in the offing, but until it is signed and entered in the protocols, a shadow hangs over the agreement itself. [Gay] We heard that Foreign Ministry legal adviser Yo'el Singer will confer with Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] next week and that they will finalize everything in writing. Is that meant to prevent a situation in which one side can claim the following day that it was misinterpreted? [Peres] Definitely. We want a paper signed by both sides. There is a genuine difficulty I do not want to dismiss. Except for the fact that both sides have internal problems, the real hardship is that it is an unprecedented agreement, it has nothing to base itself on and nobody to learn from. Therefore, any problem we come up against is not only a new problem but also sets a precedent. That is why we have to invest a great deal of what the Americans call creative effort to overcome the difficulties. I think we have succeeded in overcoming some of them. [Gay] What about the Syrian track, can you tell us about any progress or an improved atmosphere on that track prior to tomorrow's Washington talks? [Peres] No, not yet, but we will receive tomorrow initial indications in which direction things are moving. What is clear is that the United States is very, very interested in reaching an agreement, a comprehensive agreement, although for us a comprehensive agreement means with all the Arab states. [Gay] Yes, but we are not signing the agreement with the United States, we are signing it with Syria, Jordan, and the Palestinians. [Peres] Absolutely, that is why we are negotiating with them. I am simply saying that the United States is very interested and is offering its good offices in order to reach that, although it is very careful not to appear to be a participant. In other words, it does not raise its own proposals and is more of a facilitator to permit the sides to make progress. [Gay] In reference to the international fund you helped set up yesterday. What can you tell us about that? [Peres] The issue is that the Palestinians do not have the seed money to set up an administration or a police force. Foreign states do not tend to hand out funds to such an entity or organization because they all have to answer to their parliaments. What I suggested is a structure that permits the Palestinians to receive seed money and start implementing their plan, their actions. I suggested that a group made up of four trustees, a sort of mutual fund, be set up headed by a UN representative and have an American, a Norwegian, and a Japanese member. Later, I spoke with all those involved. The Japanese will probably donate $7.5 million, the Norwegians will give $7.5 million, and the United States will donate $10 million. There will be a total of $25 million and the trustees will be the ones to decide on what to spend the money so that it will not be wasted on personal or political matters. That was done relatively quickly and it solved a complex problem at the initial stage. I suggested that it be called the Holst Fund, which was accepted. [Gay] To conclude, can we hear your impression of Yasir 'Arafat, whom you met yesterday. You were recently heard expressing hesitation and doubts about his ability to come up with the goods or his desire to do so. What was your impression yesterday? [Peres] I got the impression that like you said, he wants to provide the goods, in other words, to complete the agreement. In our talks, he was very businesslike and what is called low key [last two words in English]. The deliberations were definitely based on logic and not emotions.
