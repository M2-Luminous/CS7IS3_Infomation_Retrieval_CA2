Ayatollah Khamene'i made the remark in the oil-rich city of Gachsaran Friday morning on the last day of his four-day tour of Kohkiloyeh-Boyer Ahmad Province in southwestern Iran. The leader also said that Iran was the only member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to annnounce its stance and seriously insist on it. Ayatollah Khamene'i said that the progress of arrogant Europe and America is based on oil which belongs to the Middle East, Persian Gulf and other Muslim regions. If the Muslims stop the export of their oil to the West, the industrial societies would be reduced to lifeless shells, he added. Ayatollah Khamene'i further noted that due to the treachery of some of the regional allies of Europe and America, oil --the backbone of industiral civilzaiton-- is sold at a very low price so much so that the West's profit from oil imports and taxes is much higher than what the producing countries gain through oil exports. Leader of the Islamic revolution said that the awakening of the Muslim nations was the only remedy to the problems of the Muslim world.
