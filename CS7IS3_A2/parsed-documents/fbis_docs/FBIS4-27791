FBIS4-27791 "dreas108__a94022" FBIS-EAS-94-108-A Daily Report 19 May 1994 ANNEX Japan NTT Pressured by Freeze on Rate Hike NTT Pressured by Freeze on Rate Hike 942A0271A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 19 May 94 p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0271A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), which had applied for rate hikes averaging 18 percent on the basic charge and additional hikes on the information call rate, reveals an increased sense of crisis as it says, "If expected rate increases are not approved in the fall, financial results for this fiscal year will be fairly bad." The operating program for fiscal year 1994, submitted for approval at the end of February, projected recurring profits of 104 billion yen. The figure did not include the requested rate hikes, making them little changed from the 106 billion yen in recurring profits expected for fiscal year 1993. However, inclusion of a special charge to cover voluntary retirements will drop aftertax profits for fiscal year 1995 to 61 billion yen. Since maintaining a 10-percent dividend payout rate will require 78 billion yen, profits retained from fiscal year 1993 will have to be used to cover dividend payments. NTT revised its new subscriber estimates for fiscal year 1993 from the initial 1.3 million connections to 1.2 million and there is a strong possibility that it will revise downward as well its fiscal year 1994 estimate of 1.2 million. Telephone call revenues fell by 130 billion yen in fiscal year 1993 from the prior year and are expected to drop another 90 billion yen in fiscal year 1994, because long-distance call rates were reduced to compete with the new common carriers. President Hitoshi Kojima makes no attempt at concealing his disappointment, asserting that NTT's applications for rate hikes were "unavoidable measures after a series of cost-reduction actions and reductions in long-distance call rates. We would hope that our rate hike application will not be treated in the same manner as other public utility rate increases." Sources at the Telecommunications Bureau of the MOPT say, "We cannot conceive of NTT falling victim to deficits immediately, but there is the potential of having difficulty maintaining the current dividend rate or the fear of delaying improvements in infrastructure such as the installation of optical fiber cables.
