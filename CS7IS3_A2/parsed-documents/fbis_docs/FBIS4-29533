At the Unification Security Coordination Council meeting held on 17 June, the government showed a different reaction to the results of the Kim-Carter talks from that of the United States. The government stated: "We will fine-tune our position after studying former President Carter's talks with Kim." This reflects the complicated stance of the government. The government is showing such a reserved attitude because the government feels as if it had been hit on the back of the head-- because the United States, which has so far led the moves for the imposition of sanctions, has abruptly changed its attitude--while attempting to keep pace with the U.S. policy. Since North Korea unilaterally replaced fuel rods at the five-megawatt reactor, the United States has virtually attached preconditions to the realization of the third round of North-U.S. talks by stressing that "there should be an advance in the negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]" before the third round of talks are held. As soon as the substance of the talks between former President Carter and Kim Il-song was made public, U.S. President Clinton and Assistant Secretary of State Gallucci have made the holding of North-U.S. talks a fait accompli, while responding affirmatively to North Korea's proposal. In this connection, some officials are even speculating if there have been secret contacts between the United States and North Korea. One government official in authority stated: "North Korea's proposal is a new one in terms of its intention to allow IAEA inspectors to remain in North Korea and to guarantee the operations of monitoring devices. A top priority for us is to certify what else is included in the proposal." The government is still unclear about the following regarding North Korea's proposal: the substitution of a light-water reactor; the return to safeguards regulations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the IAEA, including special inspections [tukbyol sachal]; and a freeze on nuclear development. The government feels if North Korea's promise turns out to be true, it has no choice but to agree to the holding of the third round of high-level North-U.S. talks. Under the circumstances in which the United States has virtually made the holding of North-U.S. talks a fait accompli, the government seems to have taken such a position on the basis of its own judgment that, although it is somewhat unbecoming, the government will have to follow the United States if the proposal includes "special inspections," in which North Korea's past nuclear development will be uncovered; and "a freeze on nuclear development," in which the future and the present are guaranteed. As a result of the abrupt turnaround of the United States, the government has been mired in a dilemma. Some officials believe the government should distance itself from the United States when dealing with North Korea's nuclear issue in the future. Therefore, it is expected that the turnaround of the United States this time will serve as a factor for conflict between the ROK and the United States during the UN Security Council debate on sanctions in the future. One official concerned stated: "This dialogue phase will serve as a turning point to help escape from another crisis, rather than as a decisive opportunity for the settlement of the situation. We should reexamine the ROK-U.S. cooperative system this time, to avoid North Korea's nuclear development from becoming a long-term issue."
