The note, which was rejected last night by President Joaquin Balaguer, says: "The importance of the Dominican (democratic) achievement increases our concern because of violent incidents that have occurred during the electoral campaign and because of the belief by some Dominicans that there will be an electoral fraud." Last night, a few days before the general elections on 16 May and before the electoral campaign concludes on 14 May, Balaguer declared the note issued by U.S. Ambassador Robert Pastorino as nonsense. Balaguer stated that the Dominican Republic has achieved such a level of development that it will not permit laws to be violated or the people's will to be mocked this coming Monday. He added that there will not be any fraud because the Central Electoral Board comprises people of "irreproachable ethics" and "also, the country has achieved such a level of development, that it will not permit the violation of laws or the mockery of the peoples' votes whatsoever." In addition, the U.S. ambassador recognized in his public note that "the Central Electoral Board (Dominican), advised by international experts, has worked arduously to implement the mechanisms that regulate fair elections. "We hope your work will pursue that goal. The presence of international observers underlines the importance of respecting the legitimacy of the people's will. "We appeal to all the participating political parties in the Dominican elections to work to curb the climate of violence and to promote fair and clean elections." The United States, through its ambassador, also implicitly supports the "Civic Pact" proposed by opposition candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez -- whom it does not cite -- so that no party will claim victory before the official results are announced. "We applaud the concepts voiced by political leaders in the proposed Civic Pact which seeks to ensure an atmosphere of peace and order in the elections," the embassy notes says. "The U.S. Government and people are completely neutral regarding which candidate or political party wins the elections. Nonetheless, we are extremely interested in seeing that the people's will be respected through fair and honest elections." The U.S. Embassy's entering the Dominican electoral game has sparked a national controversy. In addition to the position voiced by the president, the opinion of Dominican political circles is divided among those who feel that the statement is a healthy call for vigilance while others feel that it is an interference in the domestic affairs of the country. National Assembly President Jose Oswaldo Leger describes it as "meddling" in national internal issues, emphasizing that the Dominican people are qualified to resolve, by themselves, internal problems resulting from the electoral process. "The ambassadors accredited to the country (Dominican Republic) must be respectful of our sovereignty," he said. Angel Lockward, leader of the ruling Social Christian Reformist Party, agreed with Leger and rejected the U.S. Government's note. The public letter, however, was praised by other politicians, including Hatuey Decamps, secretary general and spokesman for the Dominican Revolutionary Party. Regardless of whether the note represents U.S. interference in the Dominican electoral process or not, observers and other diplomats in Santo Domingo emphasize that the U.S. remarks are like preaching to the choir. In the last part of the Dominican electoral campaign, which has been marked from the beginning -- mid-February -- by political leaders disavowing each other, there has been a lack of government proposals, while violence has claimed at least 10 lives and all parties have increased their warnings of fraud. When EFE asked a diplomat accredited in Santo Domingo, who requested his name not be disclosed, what he thought about the U.S. note, he merely answered: "He who has ears should listen."
