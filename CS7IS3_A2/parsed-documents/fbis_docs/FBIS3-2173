At an extended meeting of the cabinet in the Kremlin, the cabinet chief said that although a market economy already existed in Russia it needed to progress, taking into account the fundamental differences in the economic and political situation which have been created since the beginning of 1994. "We must pay attention to the lessons learned from the government's mistakes and earlier programs," he added. President Boris Yeltsin told the meeting that Russia's economic situation will remain complicated this year and social and political conditions quite tough. "The government is facing very complicated challenges." he said. The meeting, attended by cabinet members, leaders of the state executive bodies, parliament chamber speakers and local leaders, was called to discuss the economic situation in the country and plan this year's government reform tasks. Chernomyrdin said he fully agreed with Yeltsin's objective of strengthening the Russian state as defined in his state of nation message to Parliament last Thursday [24 February]. He described it as the basis for continuing reform which would put an end to the crisis by restructuring the economy and creating conditions for economic, political and social stability. "We see no possible grounds for radical changes in the course we are pursuing. The government will take guidance from the program adopted last August and approved by the president, we shall stick to this program and implement it no matter how difficult it maybe, " Chernomyrdin stated.
