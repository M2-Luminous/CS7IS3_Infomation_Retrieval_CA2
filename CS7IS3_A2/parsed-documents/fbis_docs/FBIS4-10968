In just one move, Cardoso may have played into the hands of those contending that the plan is election-oriented. Besides, in so doing, Cardoso has put his successor at the Finance Ministry, Rubens Ricupero, in an awkward position. Ricupero's authority has been eroded by Cardoso. Ricupero sustained this blow at a time when he is trying to strengthen his position as manager of the economic plan and to free himself from the persistent shadow of his predecessor. Proof of this is Ricupero's assertion that the plan is acquiring a new identity. For his part, Cardoso -- whose aim is focused on the election -- has made it clear that he does not want his trademark removed from the plan. Cardoso also is leaving himself open to an uproar of criticism by his adversaries, who are interested in weakening his candidacy by way of his economic plan. If Cardoso wants to influence the stabilization program's future, it would be best for him to use his Senate seat to help revive the constitutional revision process.
