And Not Only With the West"] [Text] "To heed the call of the future" -- Boris Pasternak considered this essential for a poet. Likewise, the ability to pick up signals for the future in rapidly changing situations and on a daily basis, is the most important quality for someone in politics. I do not think I will go far wrong if I say that this week, for Russia, this call of the future was concentrated in the word "integration." At the same time, there were precise manifestations of two integrative aspects which, in my view, will also determine Moscow's policy in the foreseeable future. First and foremost, it is a matter of our country's further accession to the global economic system now emerging, the guarantee of Russia's maximum participation in the formation of European and world security. And here, some highly important steps were taken. Above all, the matter concerns the agreement signed by Boris Yeltsin in Corfu on cooperation between Russia and the European Union [EU]. After that -- the formalization of Moscow's relations with NATO, which took place in Brussels. These days, the demand for integration on another level made itself heard in the most insistent manner. It cannot but be noted that the pivotal question of the presidential election campaigns both in Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus] (and it is highly noteworthy that the matter concerns republics whose leaders finalized the disintegration of the Union in 1991) was the question of reintegration with Russia. However, listening to an insistent demand resounding from the future is only half the task for a politician. The newspaper SEGODNYA recalled an extraordinary incident which occurred in the sphere of Russian diplomacy almost two centuries ago. Soon after the conclusion of the Tilsit Peace, it emerged that France had no intention of honoring the commitments which Napoleon had given in a conversation with Alexander I. In response to Russia's protests, a cynical Talleyrand replied: "Politics is just like music. A tune which has not been inscribed on paper, and a tune which has not been determined in note form, is no more than an empty noise." But the role of a politician is to transform trends favorable to his country into specific treaties, into a clearly prescribed position. However, this is something we succeed in doing far from always, and with great difficulty. It is no coincidence that it took so long -- almost two years -- to elaborate the agreement with the EU. After all, unlike a similar agreement signed in 1989 with the USSR, it enshrines not just general principles, and not just wishful thinking about cooperation. It is a matter of specific economic commitments. The key provision is the possibility of free trade between the EU and Russia as of 1998. The fact is that by contrast with, say, Ukraine, Russia is deemed to be a country with a transition economy. This gives it the opportunity, in relations with West European partners, to obtain the very same benefits which are enjoyed by states within the GATT framework. At the same time, the EU "has understood the position" of Russia and agreed that it can continue to protect the most socially vulnerable spheres with the aid of tariffs and import duties for a certain amount of time. Each of the agreement's signatories had to traverse his own section of the road to reach it. EU countries were able, for the sake of strengthening stability in Europe, to fight the egotistical urge not to allow foreign goods onto their own markets. Moscow agreed that various restrictions will operate for certain categories of goods and services (textiles, steel, aluminum, fissionable materials, commercial use of launch vehicles). It would be too optimistic to state that efforts to isolate us are a thing of the past. This is proved not only by the restrictions which have been retained, but also by the fact that Russia is not seen as one of the countries earmarked for admission to the EU (where room has been found for the East European states.) Less obvious is the success in establishing genuine partnership relations with NATO. Ultimately, Moscow, as promised, signed a framework document on NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program. And, in my view, this will bring our country nothing but good, no matter what fairy tales Russian conservatives may be conjuring up on this score. Admittedly, Russia failed to attain the formalization of relations with the North Atlantic Alliance which would have corresponded to its role as a nuclear state exerting a definite influence on European and world security. It had to be satisfied that the possibility of setting special terms beyond the framework of the "partnership" program is enshrined in the protocol on the results of the discussion between the Russian Federation foreign minister and the North Atlantic Council. The protocol is no more than a very vague melody, which has yet to be painstakingly transformed into a "tune" of specific agreements and mutual commitments by our diplomats and our military, and their NATO colleagues alike. But be that as it may, this integrative aspect looks very specific. If only because Moscow's aims here, as a rule, are obvious both to Moscow itself and to its partners. The picture regarding relations with the former Soviet republics, where the question of the fundamental reinforcement of relations with Russia has already been placed on the agenda, looks different altogether. Just as, three years ago, some politicians tried to use to their ends the aspiration for sovereignization which suddenly overwhelmed their peoples, today others are trying to harness the trend toward reintegration. The Belorussian [Belarusian] premier's lightning visit to Moscow on the very eve of the presidential elections clearly had the purpose of demonstrating to the people this very contender's special relations with Russia. This is not the only example. Meanwhile, in Russia itself, isolationist ideas are spreading widely, their thrust being that it is not worth our weak, but not defunct economy's taking on the burden of other states' problems. Official Moscow is still playing a waiting game, preferring that its partners themselves should define the level and nature of the relations they would like to have with Russia. This was the only possible approach yesterday, in the period of sovereignization panic. But today, the time has come to formulate more clearly just what Russia's state policy is on this issue. Does Moscow want a new and closer association than the CIS presupposes? If so, then on what terms in the sphere of politics, economics, and security guarantees could this come about? A clear position here is important not least because it will block the road to demagogues and political speculators. The collapse of the Union created difficulties for the millions and millions of family and friendship links. It is this, in the experts' view, which became one of the main reasons for the terrible economic slump. And now, when the task ahead is, if not to halt this slump, then at least to slow it down, the issue of restoring old relations on a new and mutually advantageous basis appears pertinent to the highest degree. Many people in the West understand the need for this. At the very least, the agreement between Russia and the EU provides for preserving preferential economic regimes in relations with Moscow and CIS countries. "Russia's future might will depend upon its ability to guarantee security and its own influence everywhere where geography offers such a possibility." This is the view of Helene Carrere d'Encosse, member of the Academie Francaise and a recognized expert in Russian affairs, which she expressed recently in LE FIGARO. It would seem that she has picked out the call of the future. The ball in in Moscow's court.
