ACTION: Notice of availability of environmental assessment and decision record, 30-day appeal period. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), New Mexico State Office, announces the availability to the public of the Environmental Assessment (EA) and Decision Record (DR) for Six Coal Lease Applications and One Application for Coal Lease Modification in the Southeast Oklahoma Coal Leasing Area (LeFlore and Lattimer counties, Oklahoma). This EA analyzes the potential impacts on the environment of five alternatives, including the no action alternative, for issuing the six coal leases and modifying an existing lease to avoid bypassing federal coal reserves. On June 29, 1994, a public meeting was held in Poteau, Oklahoma to solicit comments on the EA and to obtain public input on BLM's determination of fair market value and maximum economic recovery of the coal. No comments were received on the adequacy of the EA and no public input indicated opposition to the proposed leasing. The Bureau of Land Management, in cooperation with the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) has selected Alternative B, the Sale of Revised Tracts to Mine by Pass Coal and also the agency's preferred alternative, for implementation. ADDRESSES: Questions or concerns on this project can be directed to: Bureau of Land Management, New Mexico State Office (NM&hyph;921), Attn: Gary Stephens, P.O. Box 27115, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87502&hyph;0115. Copies of the subject EA and Decision Record are also available from this address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary Stephens, Oklahoma Coal ETA Team Leader, at the above address or telephone (505) 438&hyph;7451 or (505) 438&hyph;7442.
