On either side of the balance sheet, the National Bank of Cambodia's [NBC] Economic and Monetary Statistics Review for February aims to deliver an optimistic report. "In the banking sector, one feature which needs to be highlighted is the buoyancy in deposits growth," it said. "It may be recalled that aggregate deposits had shown a dip in November 1993. There was a recovery in December 1993. The growth in deposits during the first two months of 1994 has been remarkable with an increase of more than 30 billion riels witnessed in each of these months," the report added. The NBC links the increase to foreign currency deposits which reached a new height of 180 billion riels in February. It would be even more encouraging to see an outright growth in demand deposits which suggest the extent of development of a nation's financial structure. However, intermediation in financial services are being built up gradually. A 1992 World Bank report cited the "lack of public confidence in the banking system" particularly in rural parts of the kingdom and the "scant earning potential for depositors with riel-dominated accounts". It is true that savings as a percentage of GDP only notches a low eight per cent, but rural credit schemes are being evolved and are being custom-made for the local context. On the assets side of the banking system, the NBC reports that credit to the private sector "recorded a sizeable decline from 181.94 billion riels in January to 169.4 or a decline of 6.9 per cent." However, it urges that the decline be "viewed in the context of a sharp rise of 12.6 per cent witnessed in January 1994", and also notes that the level of credit to the private sector for February remains higher than that for December. Net claims of the banking system on the public sector remain unchanged. However, the NBC records a 7.2 billion-riel rise in credit to the government which it attributes to a decline in "deposits of the Government with the banking system", which dipped to 47.5 billion riels from 55 billion riels. Meanwhile, total foreign exchange assets of the banking system continue to rise, though not as dramatically as in the previous two months. February saw a 11.4 billion-riel rise for forex assets, to reach a total of 321.9 billion riels. This is a four per cent rise and though not as high as the 21.6 per cent and 19 per cent increase reported for previous months, the report concluded that "this consistent uptrend in assets is quite encouraging". A significant increase in forex assets would provide a support to import activity and structural adjustment of the economy. Foreign exchange assets are an important indicator of the future health of the economy as all official reserve assets are either held as foreign exchange, as balances with overseas correspondence banks or through bilateral clearing arrangements. Overall, the NBC report is confident that the banking system is "growing from strength to strength".
