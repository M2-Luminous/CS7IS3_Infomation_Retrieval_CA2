Following Discua's car, we see President Carlos Roberto Reina's car approaching. We are going to try and wait for the president to arrive to learn his views. The general did not want to talk. He flatly refused [words indistinct] to answer our questions. The president's car is approaching Hernan Acosta Mejia Air Force Base. Gustavo Torres seems to be helping us improve the sound quality from the base. We are going to interview the president, if he is ready to make a statement, if he wants to talk to the media. The president's white car is reaching the area where he will get out. We will try to carry his remarks on HRN, as he is now getting out of his car. Good morning, Mr. President. HRN is voicing the people's concern over the reports of a plot against you. [Reina] I think this is a warning for anyone involved in public life or governing the state. Deep down, these are criminal activities by mobsters; that is my impression. Nobody is immune to those dangers. I have the support of the majority of the people, to whom I am grateful for their tremendous demonstration of support in the wake of this development, which we all must express regret over and condemn. These are no longer [words indistinct] Mexico has recently become the victim of this kind of turmoil, which, of course, forces us to be very careful with these criminals.

[Reyes] Different sectors of society have supported you [words indistinct], but some have said this may be [words indistinct]. [Reina] There are always those who have different opinions, which I respect. [Unidentified reporter] Why [words indistinct], Mr. President? [Reina] These are criminal acts. Any public official.... [pauses] And reporters should be careful too. [Reporter] Politics have nothing to do with this, Mr. President? [Reina] No, no. These are criminal acts. [Reporter] [Words indistinct]. [Reina] Out of courtesy, and because we are friends [passage indistinct]. Some calls of support and solidarity [words indistinct] for the president of all Hondurans. [Reyes] Have you ruled out politics? [Reina] Yes, I have. [Reyes] These were remarks by President Reina from Hernan Acosta Mejia.
