In marked contrast to this situation, extrabudgetary funds have substantially increased yearly, and are showing a tendency toward large-scale inflation. In our search for reasons, we found that serious losses are being incurred in the budgetary income of public finance, and our investigations have revealed that there are the following eight channels which are allowing budgetary funds to be diverted to become extrabudgetary funds. First channel: Diversions put in place through public finance budgets. Public finance is presently practicing a system of separate administrative responsibilities, referred to as "preparing one's own meals at separate kitchens." When preparing their annual financial budgets, some regions will therefore try to promote local economic developments and build up financial resources by making appropriate provisions in their budgets for "special-purpose funds" to support production. As we understand, most of these funds are allocated out in the form of revolving funds by the business departments of the public finance agencies, without providing for reimbursements, from budgetary accounts to extrabudgetary accounts, and are left deposited there. In the process of transferring these funds to the extrabudgetary deposits and allocating them for payment, it happens quite frequently that the business departments within the public finance agencies at every level retain some of these funds and divert them for other purposes. This, then, is a way of turning budgetary funds into extrabudgetary funds. Second channel: Diversion through financial credits. Financial credit is one form by which public finance agencies use capital funds by means of fudiciary bank loans. In recent years, there has been an increase in the locally retained funds, and as a consequence, financial credit activities have also expanded. Some public finance agencies are utilizing intermittently available budgetary or surplus funds, on the pretext of supporting production, and either directly loan such funds out on budgetary accounts or employ an agency pattern in extending loans. Some also invest the funds as shares in enterprises, starting up all kinds of fiduciary loan activities, and collecting "fund-occupancy" or "fund-use" fees. Third channel: Diversion of income earned by administrative business units by not turning over such income to the state treasury. Income from administrative business units is an important source of budgetary revenue of public finance. However, in recent years, some units that earn budgetary income use various kinds of pretexts for remitting less than due, or for not remitting at all, income that should be paid into the state treasury. Particularly serious are the cases of units which themselves collect such revenue and spend it all by themselves. They thus retain the total amount of such income and turn these funds, that should have been administered within the budget, into their own small money-chests and their own small treasuries, and in this way provide the monetary resources for unhealthy tendencies. Fourth channel: diversion by not turning over to the treasury fines and confiscated funds collected by the state's law enforcement agencies. Following more effective law enforcement, income from fines and confiscated funds, collected by the law enforcement agencies in the course of the performance of their duties of exercising state controls, have increased yearly. According to regulations, fines and confiscated funds must be paid into the state treasury in full, while expenses incurred during the investigation of the cases in question shall be allocated and paid out of the budget of public finance, thus collection and expenditures shall be two separate operations. However, in actual fact, implementation of this rule is difficult. Quite a number of units use as an excuse the fact that circumstances had been exceptional, and that no money had been available to investigate the cases, to make out that revenue and expenditure have evened out. They will spend the money as they please, and budgetary income funds will thus be retained and misused for other purposes. Fifth channel: diversion by dispersions and retentions carried out by agencies in charge of finance, taxation, and the imposition of levies. Investigations revealed that some agencies in charge of finance, taxation, and the imposition of levies had opened special accounts, or rather, arbitrarily opened accounts, with various banks and urban or rural credit cooperatives with the intention of retaining budgetary revenue and willfully diverting the money to other uses. These activities have assumed serious dimensions. Especially some basic-level units in charge of finance, taxation, and the imposition of levies do not administer affairs according to the provisions governing state treasury administration. They do not promptly report and hand over the full amounts of budgetary revenue, but will, without authority, divert the budgetary revenue to other purposes or privately deposit public funds with the intention of making private profits for themselves or for their group. Particularly serious are the cases where they act in complete disregard for party discipline and state law by willfully and arbitrarily misappropriating funds that belong to the state treasury. Sixth channel: diversion by public finance agencies setting up economic entities. During the last two years, public finance agencies of various ranks have set up a large number of economic entities, and, for the purpose of providing these economic entities with the needed funds for running expenses, also as capital and operating funds, some agencies in charge of public finance have financed these economic entities with budgetary funds in such forms as allocations from budgetary accounts, or loans, or by taking up shares in these entities. A part of the budgetary funds was thereby converted into funds owned by the subordinate economic entity. Seventh channel: diversions by finance and tax agencies refunding paid-in budget revenue and refunding taxes. Taxes and profits from enterprise units figure large in the budgetary revenue of state finance. However, some districts merely take their partial and local benefits into consideration, will disregard the state's laws and regulations concerning public finance, will concoct all kinds of pretexts, use a great variety of forms, and will, in an arbitrary excess of their powers, reduce taxes, refund taxes, and refund paid-in budget revenue. They will, in particular, arbitrarily refund or reduce budgetary revenue of the central government and revenue that belongs to both, the local as well as the central government. In the administration of budgetary revenue, there is also the problem that the agency in charge of administering the state treasury does not conscientiously carry out its official duties. In such specific accounting processes as reporting and paying the proper proportions in tax categories and tax items as pertaining to the central government or the local governments, investigations and checks are not strict. This too is responsible for diversion of a part of the budgetary revenue, converting it from central government to local government budgetary revenue, or to extrabudgetary funds of enterprise units. Eighth channel: diversion by enterprises cutting down on payments to the treasury and claiming higher costs. When drawing various special-purpose funds, some enterprise units will arbitrarily expand the scope of the project and raise significant proportions and criteria. For instance, when drawing funds for the depreciation of fixes assets, they will shorten the service life and claim depreciation before its proper date. They will cut down on payments to the treasury and will use the money for their own purposes, and they will increase cost expenditure. By doing so they will correspondingly reduce enterprise profits and taxes, and expand the source of extrabudgetary funds of their own enterprise units. To bring about a radical solution of the serious problems of the above-mentioned conversion of budgetary funds to extrabudgetary funds and to stop up loopholes, it is my opinion that it is necessary to actively push on with the structural reform of the finance system with a separate taxation system, that we straighten out the distribution relations between central government and local governments, increasingly promulgate laws and regulation, as soon as possible produce a law on budgeting, enhance the work at the state treasury, fully bring into play supervisory and administrative functions of the agency in charge of the state treasury, and effectively check the administration of the state treasury and close loopholes.
