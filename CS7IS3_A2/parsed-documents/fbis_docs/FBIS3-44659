"We are now seriously studying the invitation from the US side," foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a weekly press briefing. Washington wants to cut China's textile quota by 25 to 35 percent to compensate for what it says are illegal exports trans-shipped through third countries. An existing bilateral accord had been due to expire on December 31, but U.S. officials in Washington agreed to extend the deadline for imposing the quota cut to allow further talks in Washington in January. However, China has so far given no official confirmation that it will attend the talks. "The officials of the two sides are now maintaining contacts with each other as regards some specific arrangements of the proposed visit," Wu said. "The Chinese side is always in favour of settling the question of Chinese exported textiles to the United States through negotiations," he added. China exported 4.5 billion dollars' worth of textiles and clothing to the United States last year, accounting for some five percent of total exports. However U.S. officials have estimated that a further two billion dollars' worth was trans-shipped illegally.
