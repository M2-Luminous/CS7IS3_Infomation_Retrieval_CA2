The APH program operates within limits prescribed by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq. ), only on those crops identified in this section in those areas where the Actuarial Table provides coverage. Except when in conflict with this subpart, all provisions of the applicable crop insurance contract for these crops apply. §400.52 Definitions. In addition to the definitions contained in the crop insurance contract, the following definitions apply for the purposes of the APH Coverage Program: (a) APH _Actual Production History. (b) Actual yield_ The yield per acre for a crop year calculated from the production records or claims for indemnities. The actual yield is determined by dividing total production (which includes harvested and appraised production) by planted acres for annual crops or by insurable acres for perennial crops. (c) Adjusted yield _The transitional or determined yield reduced by the applicable percentage for lack of records. The adjusted yield will equal 65 percent of the transitional or determined yield, if no producer records are submitted; 80 percent, if records for one year are submitted; and 90 percent, if two years of records are submitted. (d) Appraised production _Production determined by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), the FCIC, or a company reinsured by the FCIC, that was unharvested but which reflected the crop's yield potential at the time of the appraisal. For the purpose of APH ``appraised production'' specifically excludes production lost due to uninsurable causes. (e) Approved APH yield _A yield, calculated and approved by the verifier, used to determine the production guarantee and determined by the sum of the yearly actual, assigned, and adjusted or unadjusted transitional or determined yields divided by the number of yields contained in the database. The database may contain up to 10 consecutive crop years of actual and or assigned yields. At least four yields will always exist in the database. (f) Assigned yield _A yield assigned by FCIC in accordance with the crop insurance contract, if the insured does not file production reports as required by the crop insurance contract. Assigned yields are used in the same manner as actual yields when calculating APH yields except for purposes of the Nonstandard Classification System (NCS). (g) Base period _Ten consecutive crop years (except peaches, which have a five-year base period) immediately preceding the crop year defined in the insurance contract for which the approved APH yield is being established (except for sugarcane, which begins the calendar year preceding the immediate previous crop year defined in the insurance contract). (h) Continuous production reports _Reports submitted by a producer for each crop year that the unit was planted to the crop and for the most recent crop year in the base period. (i) Crop year _Defined in the crop insurance contract, however, for APH purposes the term does not include any year when the crop was not planted or when the crop was prevented from being planted by an insurable cause. For example, if an insured plants acreage in a county to wheat one year, that year is a crop year in accordance with the policy definition. If the land is summerfallowed the next calendar year, that calendar year is not a crop year for the purpose of APH. (j) Database _A minimum of four years up to a maximum of ten crop years of production data used to calculate the approved APH yield. (k) Determined yield (D-yield) _An estimated year for certain crops, which can be determined by multiplying an average yield for the crop (attained by using data available from The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) or comparable sources) by a percentage established by the FCIC for each county. (l) Master yields _Approved APH yields, for certain crops and counties as initially designated by the FCIC, based on a minimum of four crop years of production records for a crop within a county. (m) New producer _A person who has not been actively engaged in farming for a share of the production of the insured crop for more than two crop years.
