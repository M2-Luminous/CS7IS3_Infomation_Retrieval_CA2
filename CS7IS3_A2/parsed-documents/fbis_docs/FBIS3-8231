He is the highest religious authority in Bosnia. The Muslim faithful turn to him like Catholics to the pope. He received us at the "Careva Djamija," the city's oldest mosque, built on the banks of the Milijecka by Isak Isakovic in 1461, one year before the Turks occupied Sarajevo. [F.B.] NATO has not bombed the hills around Sarajevo. The Serbs are controlled by the UN forces. How do Muslims feel about this result of the ultimatum? [Ceric] I do not know what NATO has done for us in 22 months. I do know, however, that we now have a double occupation. First, there was only the Serbian occupation. Now there is also the occupation by the Russians, who came solely to legalize what the Serbs have accomplished. In fact, they have consolidated the partition of the city. Therefore, thanks to the United Nations and NATO our position has worsened. Now we are slaves forced to live in a ghetto. The reason for this lies in the fact that as far as the international community is concerned the true problem does not lie with the Serbs, but with the Muslims. [F.B.] That is a harsh opinion, one which combines pessimism with ill feeling. [Ceric] We have survived so far, and we will survive in the future. However, Europe and the world have bound our hands, and now they are obliged to untie them. They have stopped blackmailing us with humanitarian aid and pushing us to surrender. We will not commit suicide. Therefore, I am neither pessimistic nor optimistic. I am realistic and I know that if we had been animals instead of human beings, the world would have taken a greater interest in our cause. [F.B.] Just a few days ago, French President Mitterrand forcefully defended you. [Ceric] Mitterrand should stop talking about human rights: Rather, give us arms to survive. We know the Serbs well and we know how they have to be treated. [F.B.] Many people in the West fear an Islamic state. [Ceric] Why? We have no fear of Christianity. We Bosnians are used to living in a pluralistic and diverse society. Believe me when I say that I truly wish the Bosnians were fundamentalists so that we could find the strength and cohesion needed to fight. [F.B.] What kind of model are you thinking of for the Bosnian state? [Ceric] Nothing innovative. The models are those which are already known. They are all subject to international laws. For example, laws cannot be passed to institutionalize ethnic cleansing. We live according to the laws of the international community. That is not true of the Serbs. They have overturned the principles of morals. So the right question to ask is this: Is it possible not to be multicultural? Or not to live in an international context? That is the question which Europe must answer. [F.B.] But? [Ceric] But Europe is putting the aggressors and those who have been attacked on the same level. However, if the world is unable to answer this question about the need to be multicultural, it will be the Serbs who bring their morals to the streets of Paris, Berlin, and London. And the question will arise as to whether the idea of a united, multinational, and multicultural Europe has not died right here in Sarajevo. [F.B.] Many Muslims have fled Sarajevo. Will they return? [Ceric] Anyone who has fled will return. War is not made up of soldiers alone. Often, the side effects are the most dramatic. Look at the UN soldiers who are here: They have no feeling for this land, they do not identify with the people, they do not see themselves in the culture. They are merely occupation troops. As for the humanitarian organizations, there is a legitimate suspicion that they want the war to continue. Indeed, for them the war has become the only reason for their existence.
