He noted that the freedom of the press "is incompatible with any type of totalitarianism." Menem also asked journalists "to report in a responsible way." He said the media's credibility "is linked to its commitment to the truth." The president made these remarks during a speech he delivered in Government House's White Hall while signing the Chapultepec Declaration, a list of principles for freedom of the press that was released on 11 March by the Inter-American Press Association [IAPA] in Chapultepec. During the signing ceremony, which was attended by publishers from Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and the United States, IAPA President Raul Kraiselburd delivered a speech. Kraiselburd noted: "In the great battles fought in the continent to preserve the democratic system, the restoration of freedom of the press represented a goal for very different and competing groups." Menem stressed that "the freedom of respect and of the press" prevailing under his administration "has not been and will not be changed because we understand there cannot be any democratic system without freedom of the press." Menem pointed out: "We heartily support Thomas Jefferson's remark that `it is preferable to have freedom of the press without a government than a government without freedom of the press' and, in this regard, we demonstrated our belief by accepting, without any type of censorship, the harshest and most pungent criticism ever received by any president in the Argentine Republic." Menem stressed: "The gates to information were always open. If there was any friction and, sometimes, bumps with the journalists, it was more because of abundant information than lack of information." Menem added that the Chapultepec Declaration "therefore represents for us a logical result, supported by the goal of having this freedom of the press now prevailing in Argentina equally prevail in all American countries and in the entire world as a basic guarantee for human rights." Menem stressed: "The freedom of the press is incompatible with any type of totalitarianism. Totalitarianism cannot tolerate freedom of the press because it would be tantamount to tolerating criticism, and history has demonstrated to us that totalitarianism are more prone to self-criticism, which always comes late and in a more cushioned way." Concerning the Chapultepec Declaration, Menem emphasized that "no one will be allowed to force a journalist to reveal his or her sources of information" and that "no one may impair or deny the right to seek or receive information, that there may not be any censorship before publication, that there may not be any forced association, and that the freedom of the press may not be impaired through tariff policies or paper and advertising control policies." Menem pointed out: "Nevertheless, this declaration also points out that the media's credibility is linked to its commitment to the truth." At the end of his message, Menem said: "Some day I will no longer be president. I will have to resume my private activities. We basically want democracy to continue prevailing and liberty to continue increasing, and, within this framework, we want Argentina to regain the place it was able to occupy in other periods of its institutional life."
