FR940228-1-00049 FR940228-1-00007 Certification of notice to patients. If the sanctioned practitioner or other person chooses to use the alternative notification approach, he, she or it would be given 30 calendar days from receipt of the notification from the OIG to return an OIG-prepared certification form stating that: (1) He, she or it has informed each of their existing patients that a sanction has been imposed; (2) if excluded from Federal programs, the program will not pay for items and services ordered, furnished or prescribed by the practitioner or other person and that this ban will remain in effect until the practitioner or other person is reinstated; (3) if excluded, he, she or it will provide this information, prior to providing services, to any new patient seen until he, she or it is reinstated; and (4) he, she or it certifies to the truthfulness and accuracy of the notification and the statements in the certification. Non-election of the alternative method of notification. If the sanctioned practitioner or other person does not elect this alternative method of notification of informing his, her or its patients and returning the certification form within the proposed 30-day period, the OIG would follow its standard procedure for public notification, which consists of notifying the public directly of the identity of the sanctioned practitioner or other person, the obligation that has been violated, and the effective date and duration of any exclusion. Failure to comply with alternative method of notification after electing such method. If the sanctioned practitioner or other person elects the alternative method of notification by returning the certification form within the proposed 30-day period, but the OIG receives reliable evidence that such practitioner or other person has not adequately informed his, her or its new and existing patients of the sanction, the OIG would follow its standard procedure for public notification as described above. Once a practitioner or other person has elected the alternative notification option by returning the certification form to the OIG, his, her or its failure to follow through and fully comply with the notification requirements will be considered adversely at the time of his, her or its application for reinstatement. In order to ensure that patient notification is enforced and provided in a timely manner so that patients are not at risk of receiving poor quality of care, we are soliciting comments on how best to enforce this provision. Under this proposed approach, when the OIG learns through patient complaints or other forms that the practitioner or other person has not fully complied, the IG at that point may additionally consider specific action to remedy the situation, such as pursuing penalties for the filing of a false statement. Comments on this alternative notice process and on whether this enforcement approach is reasonable and effective are specifically invited.
