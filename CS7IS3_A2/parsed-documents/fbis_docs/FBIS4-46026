'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, named by southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid as his deputy, said in a telephone interview with AL-YAWM that, for now, international intervention is the only way to stop the war. Al-Jifri predicted imminent international recognition of south Yemen's secession. He said delay in recognition was natural in view of the rapid succession of developments in Yemen. 'Ali Salim al-Bid stood ready to meet with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih anywhere, on condition that the meeting coincided with a cease-fire and a pullback by northern forces to the pre-unity lines. Victims of the offensive on Shabwah Governorate showed symptoms indicating the use of chemical weapons, al-Jifri said. The southern official said he thought it unlikely that northern forces would enter Aden, citing strong defenses, rather than political considerations. [passage omitted]
