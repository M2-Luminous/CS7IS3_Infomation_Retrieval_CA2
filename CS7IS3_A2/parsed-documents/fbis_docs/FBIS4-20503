FBIS4-20503 "jpcst006___94030" JPRS-CST-94-006 JPRS Science & Technology China 11 April 1994 Telecommunications R&D Implementation of Pre-ISDN in Shanghai Implementation of Pre-ISDN in Shanghai Detailed Information 94P60141B Shanghai DIANXIN KUAIBAO [TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFORMATION] in Chinese No 1, Jan 94 pp 2-4 94P60141B Shanghai DIANXIN KUAIBAO [TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFORMATION] Chinese CSO [Article by Du Jiazhen [2629 0857 3791]: ``Implementation of Early-Stage ISDN in Shanghai''; MS receipt data not given] [Abstract] The S-1240 switches incorporate foreign technology but are made in Shanghai, while the F-150 switches are directly imported from Japan. Between its S-1240 switching offices, the existing Shanghai telephone network uses common-channel Signaling System Number 7 (SS7), while between two F-150 switching offices or between an F-150 office and an S-1240 office the existing network uses China's MFC [expansion not given] Signaling System Number 1. As part of the renovations for the pre-ISDN, the F-150 switches had to be converted to SS7, while the S-1240 switches' SS7 TUP [telephone user part] had to be upgraded with new ISDN-capable circuit boards. Moreover, the project was hampered by the difficulty of importing appropriate ISDN equipment and software. The key to the entire project is the realization of digital user access: the analog subscriber line interface circuit (ASLIC) boards in the digital switches had to be replaced by digital subscriber line interface circuit (DSLIC) boards to permit terminal-to-terminal digital communications. In order to avoid replacing the software in the digital switches, the digital subscriber circuit signaling protocols had to maintain the same techniques as the analog subscriber circuit signaling protocols. The basic configuration of this pre-ISDN is shown in Figure 1 below. Two types of DSLIC boards have been developed: one for S-1240 switches and one for F-150 switches. The ASLIC boards in the S-1240 switches have an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) called the dual processor terminal controller (DPTC) [see JPRS-CST-92-010, 22 May 92 pp 53-56], which is the interface with the terminal control element. This ASIC is retained on the S-1240 DSLIC boards. The U interface device (UID) uses 2B1Q encoding to reduce bit rate; when the transmitted information rate is 144 kbps (2B + D), the actual bit rate is 80 bauds. Each DSLIC board (S-1240 type and F-150 type) has four UIDs, providing four 2B + D lines. Figure 1. Configuration of Pre-ISDN The digital cross-connect node configuration for this pre-ISDN is shown in Figure 2 below. Each node has 15 2W (2W = 2B + D) lines multiplexed to form one 4W (4W = 30 B + D) [i.e., 2 Mbps] line, which can be switched to any of seven DS1 circuit I/O pots (labeled 4W1-4W7 in the figure) going to other nodes.
