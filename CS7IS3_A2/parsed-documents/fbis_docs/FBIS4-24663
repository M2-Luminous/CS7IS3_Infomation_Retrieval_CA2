During an exclusive interview with these reporters a few days ago, Luo Bingsheng summarized the overseas development strategy of Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation as a "two-step" plan. Shougang Overseas Headquarters, which has a staff of 6,000 people, has been established. General offices in Hong Kong and New York, which are subordinate to the headquarters, were set last year. Earlier this year, Shougang Southeast Asia Holdings Corporation was registered in Singapore. The company's overseas development strategy -- standing firm in Hong Kong, unfolding its two wings, opening up new battlefields, and building new bases -- has begun to take shape. Luo Bingsheng said: In the course of reform and opening up, the gates of Shoudu Iron and Steel Company must not only open to the domestic market, but must open to the outside world as well. The company must march into the international market to compete with the largest corporations in the world. Luo, an expert in iron and steel production who graduated from Guizhou Industrial College in the 1960's, has such ideas: "It is necessary to set up a concept of operating in debt and courageously borrowing money and utilizing foreign capital to develop ourselves." In October 1992, the board of directors of Shoudu Iron and Steel Company made a decision within 24 hours to join hands with Hong Kong's tycoon Li Ka-Shing to take over Hong Kong's Tung Wing Steel Holdings Limited. Later, it consecutively gained control of four listed Hong Kong companies, comprising Eastern Century Holdings Limited, Santai Manufacturing Limited, Kader Holdings Company Limited, and Hoi Sing Holdings Limited. This series of actions shook the Hong Kong stock market. According to Zhou Guanwu, chairman of the Shoudu Iron and Steel Company, the above actions were not giant strides but small ones for the company in marching into Hong Kong. In the meantime, the company took a major step to acquire a steel works in California and a large iron mine in Peru, which evoked repercussions both at home and abroad. Luo Bingsheng added, smiling: Our business in the United States is merely at a "stage of laying out chess pieces" and our goal for the next step is to enter the U.S. stock market. Luo Bingsheng said: The overseas development strategy put into practice was the brainchild of Zhou Guanwu, the "chief architect" of Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation. In every country, a number of backbone enterprises seek access to international markets. Similarly, Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation is ready to enter international markets because it has grown in strength and possesses this capability as a result of 15 years' of reform. According to Luo Bingsheng, a milestone of historic significance in the development of the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation was Deng Xiaoping's inspection on 22 May 1992 and his instructions on that occasion that the company should take the lead in the country's iron and steel industry. Afterward, leading cadres of the State Council, including Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Zou Jiahua came to inspect Shoudu Iron and Steel one after another, and, centering around the development objective of building the company into a large transnational enterprise, decided to grant "three powers"--investment power, financing power, and decisionmaking power in foreign trade--to the company. With these three powers, Shoudu Iron and Steel, like a tiger with wings, began to operate international businesses as it already had the important prerequisites for the exploration of overseas markets. Looking forward to the company's future, Luo Bingsheng said: At the turn of the century, the output of the company's iron and steel production base in Beijing will reach 10 million tonnes a year, and that of the Qilu production base, which has yet to be built, will also reach 10 million tonnes a year. With the construction of an overseas iron and steel base with an annual output of 5 million tonnes to be completed, the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation will fully deserve the name of the largest iron and steel company in the world. Why can China's large enterprises not operate on an equal footing with the big companies of the world? This is an issue the general manager of Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation is always thinking about.
