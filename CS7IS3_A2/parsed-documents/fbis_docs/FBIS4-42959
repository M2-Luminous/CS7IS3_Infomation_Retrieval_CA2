Finance ministers agreed yesterday in Luxembourg to recommend to heads of state and government that they only approve the list of 11 priority projects submitted to them. They considered that in the current state of affairs, a decision on a potential "Union Bond" issue could wait until the next European Council meeting, scheduled for next December in Essen. In other words, projects will go ahead and the Union will worry later about additional funding if need be. Perfectly aware that the dispute has been taking a turn for the worse, the Twelve's finance ministers will no doubt be in a hurry to confirm this approach next Monday [13 June]. Jacques Delors himself seemed to have reconciled himself to the notion. That is, he appeared to accept that studies on priority projects should carry on without the European Council committing itself right away to letting the Union turn to capital markets in order to raise the funds needed to complement those already earmarked. The latter are funds to come from national public organizations, the EU budget, the European Investment Bank (EIB), and private investors. The notion of a large-scale "Union Bond" issue is therefore postponed indefinitely. Of course, the quarrel appears rather preposterous in view of the actual amounts involved. These are rather trivial when compared to the Twelve's initial ambitions. The white paper approved at the Brussels Summit in December 1993 envisioned a ECU220 billion investment from 1994 to 1999, including ECU120 billion to come from the Union. The problem was then to find another ECU8 billion annually to complete funds earmarked in the EU budget (ECU5 billion) and EIB loans (ECU7 billion) and hit the yearly target of ECU20 billion. Today, the amounts at stake are much lower. According to estimates provided by European Commissioner Hennig Christophersen, the mark has now been lowered to a mere ECU32 billion over six years for the various investments concerning the 11 priority projects. With maximum contributions of ECU3.8 billion from the EU budget, ECU2 billion from the EIB (applying its 15 percent maximum participation rule), about ECU11 billion from member states, an estimated ECU1.6 from railway operators, and ECU7 to ECU8 billion from private investors, the shortfall would be a mere ECU4 to ECU5 billion by 2000. Nothing here that warrants starting an EU crisis! True, the European Commission wanted a precedent-setting agreement in principle. However, one can understand most capitals -- with Paris foremost among them -- when they consider that this is no pressing issue. Especially since the EIB indicated on Monday in Luxembourg that it would strive to contribute more to the creation of the large networks under consideration. "Provided that projects are viable and member state determination and commitment are significant," EIB President Brian Unwin said. So, in the coming months, the projects selected so far will be refined, with special attention being devoted to their cost and the financial arrangements that could be devised. In such a context, Brussels may try to show that such networks are intended to nurture an economic synergy and therefore that the self-funding approach is inappropriate: Instead, all regions and industries likely to benefit from such networks should be made to contribute more, one way or another.
