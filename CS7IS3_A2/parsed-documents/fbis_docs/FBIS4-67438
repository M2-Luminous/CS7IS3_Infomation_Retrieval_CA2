Finnish Police Break Up Antinuclear Action"] [Excerpts] The international ecological organization "Greenpeace" held a protest action yesterday in the Finnish town of Loviza (110 km from Helsinki) in connection with the impending transporting to Russia of nuclear waste. The same day the Moscow branch of "Greenpeace" circulated a statement on the illegal nature of transporting nuclear waste from Finland to Russia. [passage omitted] Talking to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, Dmitriy Tolmatskiy of the Moscow branch of "Greenpeace" clarified some of the questions on bringing nuclear fuel to Russia. "The agreement on cooperation in the area of nuclear power engineering of 14 May 1965 between Russia and Finland contains not one word to the effect that the radioactive waste of processed fuel is supposed to be buried in Russia. The thing is that nuclear fuel becomes totally Finland's property the moment it crosses the border, and Russia bears no responsibility whatever for it. More, commitments on the return of fuel are not stipulated in the agreement." Mr. Tolmatskiy also underlined that literally every page in the agreement says that nuclear materials may only be used for peaceful means whereas the "Mayak" combine (the biggest nuclear waste processing enterprise) is a military facility which, up to now, has been producing weapons-grade plutonium from used nuclear fuel.
