FBIS4-5633 "dreas071_q_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 AUSTRALASIA New Zealand Officer's Diary Provides Evidence of Espionage Officer's Diary Provides Evidence of Espionage BK1204092494 Hong Kong AFP in English 0842 GMT 12 Apr 94 BK1204092494 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Wellington, April 12 (AFP) -- New Zealand appears to have engaged in some form of spying on India, a cryptic entry in a the diary of an army officer lost here reveals, the EVENING POST reported here Tuesday. The bulky, black-leather Filofax, owned by Major Scott Turner who is assistant director of electronic warfare in the Ministry of Defence, was leaked to various media outlets after it was found in long grass last week. The POST said the man who found the Filofax, identified only as Mike, had decided to release the diary after he saw what it contained. "This is public information. It is important this be released because we spend millions of dollars on the organisation this guy works for and it suggests we spy on people we consider our allies like India," "Mike" said. One Filofax entry, under the heading RNZN (apparently a reference to the Royal New Zealand Navy), says: "Indian photos [word indistinct] DSD get them." The POST suggested that this entry disclosed some espionage operation against India. It interpreted DSD to mean the Australian Defence Signals Directorate. The Filofax includes a diary, work plans for 1994, duties' lists, notes of meetings with others in the New Zealand intelligence community, four used train tickets, two business cards and details of the officer's recent purchase of a house. Contents of the Filofax show Turner was coordinating with the secret Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), which runs two large electronic listening bases linked into Australia, Britain and the US. There are also references such as "Tropic Twilight -- Cook Islands Aug-Sep, Intercept range upgrade 2MHz - GHz" as well as some action regarding tensions between Papua New Guinea [PNG] and the Solomons over Bougainville, a PNG province affected by civil war. Defence spokesman John Seward said Tuesday the owner was getting legal advice "and will seek police assistance to get it back". Seward said electronic warfare was not spying and the Filofax was "not in itself a classified document. "Electronic warfare is a long-established legitimate and widely known part of military operations." Seward said the Filofax was the personal diary of a staff officer although he said he believed it was unusual for a staff officer to record classified acronyms in a personal book.
