A member of the Ukrainian parliament, Masol was the last head of the Ukrainian Government under communists. Earlier he worked for 20 years at the Novokramatorsk machine-building plant, rising from assistant foreman to general director. He later worked on the state planning committee and headed the Ukrainian Government until October 1990 when he resigned in protest against the political and economic course approved by the then parliament under pressure from national democrats. In the present parliament Vitaliy Masol has no party affiliation, although he says he remains "a communist at heart." The former premier has a good chance of regaining the post, because the communist majority in the parliament is expected to back his candidature. Vitaliy Masol will present his programme to the parliament within the next few days.
