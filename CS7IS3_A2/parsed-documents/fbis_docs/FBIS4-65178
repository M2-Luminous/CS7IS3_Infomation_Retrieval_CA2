This leads to an extrapolated annual rate of 15.4 percent. With this final figure, the Bundesbank on Tuesday [10 May] slightly modified the figures it had originally predicted. The original annual rate indicated for March had been 15.2 percent. The M-3 money supply contains the circulation of notes and coins, cash deposits, time deposits under four years, as well as savings deposits. There was an extremely large increase in the stock of money due to special factors at the beginning of this year. This "basic effect" influences monthly figures. For 1994, the Bundesbank is aiming at a money supply growth rate of 4 to 6 percent.
