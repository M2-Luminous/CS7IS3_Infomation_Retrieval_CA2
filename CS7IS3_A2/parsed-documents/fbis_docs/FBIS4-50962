The on-the-spot meeting on education in patriotism in primary and secondary schools in Shanghai jointly convoked by the Central Propaganda Department, the State Education Commission, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, the Ministry of Culture, and the Communist Youth League Central Committee will give a powerful thrust to and be a powerful promotion of unfolding education in patriotism in primary and secondary schools in depth and breadth in a persistent manner. Education in patriotism is basic engineering for improving the quality of the entire nation. The focus of this basic engineering is the broad masses of teenagers. The population of primary and secondary pupils on campus approaches 175 million across China; they are a generation that straddles the 20th and 21st centuries, and will be the main force in building socialist modernization in China in the 21st century. The histories of various countries teach us that only when the younger generation has a good knowledge of the history of its own country and nation, and shapes such knowledge into a strong patriotic awareness, while converting its will to render service to the country into conscious actions to serve the motherland, will it be possible for it to become a generation that can accomplish a lot. When we grasp firmly the education in patriotism among primary and secondary school pupils, the entire society will be affected, and the main theme of patriotism will be sharper and more conspicuous, while the building of socialist spiritual civilization will mount a new level. In a nutshell, putting education in patriotism in primary and secondary schools in an important place on the agenda, while earnestly implementing it, is a mission history has bestowed on us. Our party and government leaders attach great importance to the education in patriotism among primary and secondary school pupils. Party and government leaders, including Jiang Zemin, have repeatedly stressed that it is imperative to make the concepts of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism the "theme of the entire society." Party and government leading departments at all levels have created many good methods, which are vivid and lively, of conducting education in patriotism among the broad masses of teenagers, and accumulated many fresh experiences. A very successful example is precisely the use of fine films and television movies to unfold education in patriotism in primary and secondary schools across China. This activity has aroused a warm response from the whole society, with very good effects. However, we must also see that the gap between our work and the requirements of the times, as well as the rich contents of patriotism, is still great. For instance, a small number of departments and units do no more than pay lip service, writing documents on conducting education in patriotism among teenagers, rather than taking practical measures; some of them lack understanding of teenagers' actual conditions, and fail to study the characteristics of education in patriotism during the new period; the education lacks essence, and is also pointless. In other departments and units, the forms of education are monotonous and rigid, always being the same thing and with no differences in level. Much work and joint action in various social aspects are called for to grasp and take care of the matter with common efforts to further conduct education in patriotism in depth and breadth in a persistent way. China is a country with a long history and a brilliant culture, and one that is advancing toward modernization with full vitality. To conduct education in patriotism among primary and secondary pupils, it is precisely necessary to bring forth the fine traditions of patriotism, and help this generation of teenagers to understand the outstanding contributions our ancestors made to the civilization of mankind and the tremendous and profound changes in all aspects in China since reform and opening up, thus augmenting their pride in the nation. From history to reality, there are extremely rich potential resources for conducting education in patriotism in various arenas of social life. Better effects will be achieved if we link the fine traditions of the Chinese nation to the reality of reform and opening up. Patriotism reflects people's rational understanding of the relations between the individual and the motherland; at the same time, it contains people's lofty feelings for the motherland. It is a kind of consciousness and spirit embodied in conscious actions as well as every single specific matter. To augment education in patriotism, it is precisely necessary to grasp the art of education. It is necessary to work hard at such links as seeing the truth, knowing the situation, stirring up passion, and cultivation to stimulate the broad masses of teenagers' devotion to "having knowledge of, cherishing and building the Chinese nation." It is necessary to adopt various methods and ways as well as diversified propaganda vehicles, and to be familiar with the forms the masses love to hear and see, while infiltrating all aspects of teenagers' study, labor, life, and amusement with the education in patriotism. The school is an important place in which to conduct education in patriotism among teenagers. That being the case, the education in patriotism must run through the whole course of teaching and education from kindergarten through college, with institutions set and mechanisms formed. It is imperative to give full play to the roles of the forms teenagers love to hear and see, such as films and television, drama, books and magazines, music, drawing, and calligraphy, so that patriotism may strike root among teenagers. In addition, it is necessary to be good at giving play to the educational role of various kinds of museums, memorial halls, historical remains and ruins, as well as famous mountains and rivers. Education in patriotism is systems engineering, as well as a long-term strategic task. It is necessary to persist in it and to continuously blaze new trails so that it may be unfolded in greater depth and breadth. Let us hold aloft the banner of patriotism, and strive for the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
