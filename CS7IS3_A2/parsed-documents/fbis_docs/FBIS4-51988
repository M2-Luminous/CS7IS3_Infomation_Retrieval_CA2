Twenty years have passed since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published the historic 7 May document following the publication of the program of modeling the whole society after the chuche idea. In this period, during which a glorious and brilliant era was unfolded in the accomplishment of the chuche cause, changes of which we can be proud of with dignity have been effected and abundant fruit has been produced in socialist press construction. The press plays a great role in the development of society and in the struggle for the revolution. In the war of confrontation without sounds of guns between socialism and capitalism in today's international arena the ideological war, the war of the press, has formed a most acute and fierce struggle front. Destroying the imperialists' reactionary ideological and press offensives and firmly defending the ideological position of socialism is a serious problem related to the destiny of socialism. Socialism, ever since its beginning, has pioneered its road and has been victorious amid the struggle against capitalism and reactionary ideological trends. The imperialists' slandering and false propaganda against socialism and their reactionary ideological and cultural offensives against it have become more cunning and vicious with each passing day. What should we do in order to check all sorts of reactionary sophistries and corrupt and bourgeois ideology and press and, thus, to firmly lead socialist press construction to the road of victory? The press of our times and the socialist cause are faced with this historic question today. Let us listen to the voices ringing from chuche Korea for a while. Ideology is life in socialist society. Attach great importance to pen and microphone. Reporters and journalists are vanguard standard bearers who are standing at the first line of the party's ideological front. When and where has this resolute and revolutionary voice ever rung nobly in the history of socialist press construction? This voice with regard to the important mission of the socialist press and the vanguard roles of reporters and men of the press is a solemn declaration that can be rung only in the country upholding the great leader [widaehan yongdoja]. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the prominent, great man [kolchurhan wiin] who has unfolded the great golden age of the socialist press on this land. This is the dignified shouts of Korean reporters and men of the press who are conducting publication and press activities, upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-chol as the master of the press. The new golden age of the socialist press construction in our country was unfolded by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. In the middle of the 1970's when our party and the revolution entered an era of great change again the dear comrade leader, who had brilliantly inherited the tradition of publication and press created by the great leader and wisely led publication and press work, published the 7 May document, the immortal work, and ignited the flames of the newspaper revolution, the press revolution, and the publication revolution. This was an occasion of revolutionary changes that opened up a bright vista for socialist press construction. Recorded in every page of the 20-year-long history in which our Korean reporters and men of the press have carried out the newspaper revolution, the press revolution, and the publication revolution along the road elucidated by the 7 May document is the truth that only when one upholds the great leader [widaehan yongdoja] can one brilliantly realize the cause of socialist press construction. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the great ideologist and theorist who has brilliantly elucidated the ideology of socialist press construction. The chuche-oriented publication and press ideology was created by the great leader and has been brilliantly embodied by him. The dear comrade leader inherited the tradition of the revolutionary publications such as SAENAL, VOLSHEVIK, [word indistinct] WOLGAN, and SOGWANG founded by the great leader in his anti-Japanese struggle period and has resolutely safeguarded and defended the tradition and given sagacious explanations to the new ideological and theoretical problems arising in the practice of the press of our times. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Our party's publications, communications, and broadcasts have inherited the brilliant revolutionary tradition created by the great leader. They take the leader's chuche-oriented publication and press ideology as its only guiding principle. They also take it as their lofty purpose to consummate to the end the glorious revolutionary cause pioneered by the leader [suryong] generation after generation. The 7 May document, which our reporters and journalists always and kindly call and regard as a guideline, is a powerful ideological weapon [sasangjok mugi] that makes it possible for our media to actively contribute to modelling the whole society on the chuche idea. In the 7 May document, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has defined the character and basic mission of our party's media. He has maintained that the basic principle of the press and publication activity is to strongly establish the party's monolithic leading system by regarding the chuche principle as a cornerstone of the party's media and to vigorously carry out the speed battle by making a good choice of cores in literary works. Also, he has fully solved all problems arising in effecting a revolutionary upsurge in press and publication propaganda by bringing about a revolutionary change in the areas of the newspaper [sinmun], press [podo], and publications [chulpan]. All these ideologies, theories, and policies expounded in the 7 May document have been a valuable press program that opened the golden age of the socialist press today. The dear comrade leader's press ideology fully expounded in his many works, including the historic 7 May document, has an originality based on his profound speculation and new discoveries [saeroun palgyon]. He has not regarded old practices and experience as absolute but rather has creatively solved new problems arising in socialist press construction in conformity with the demands of the current times, the developing revolution, and the rapidly changing situations. The dear comrade leader's press ideology is a weapon of omnipotence, as well as an encyclopedia, enabling us to fully solve all problems in the press and publication activity. He is well-versed in all the sectors and units of the press and publication works, including newspapers, communication [tongsin], broadcasting [pangsong], books, magazines, and photos, and, also, has more profound knowledge of them. Ranging from the general direction and basic mission of the press and publication work to the characteristics of all kinds of articles -- including editorials, special articles, political essays, and news reports -- the method of writings, and the method of editors' and reporters' activities, everything has been expounded in the dear comrade leader's press ideologies and policies. The dear comrade leader has talked on many occasions about the press and publication works and has clearly solved all problems in a timely manner. Whenever we receive teachings from the dear comrade leader, we cannot but truly express our admiration for his keen wisdom and multisided talents. Even functionaries -- who contribute their whole life to the press and publication works -- esteem and respect him as the great master [kojang] of the press, thus expressing their admiration for him. The dear comrade leader's press ideology is based on the chuche idea and, also, its kernel is a revolutionary outlook on the leader [suryong]. Therefore, in the 7 May document, the dear comrade leader has defined the character of our party's media in relation to the great leader's [suryong] esteemed name and has enabled our media, communication, and broadcasting to always and mainly propagate the greatness of the leader [suryong]. In the world there is no other media except our party's media -- which regards the dear comrade leader's press ideology as a guideline -- that gives the greatest reverence and loyalty to the leader [suryong] when it reports, even one time, on his picture or revolutionary activity, overflowing with his idea. Truly, the dear comrade leader's press ideology -- which is the highest peak [choegobong] in the socialist ruling party's press ideology -- is a leading guideline that enabled our party's media to be established, strengthened, and developed based on the most correct way without the slightest deviation and vicissitudes, as well as an invincible and ideological weapon that has been monolithically systemized in a great press practice [oron silchon]. The might of his press ideology has been fully proved as well. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the great leader [yongdoja] who is victoriously leading the press and publication work to embody the chuche press ideology with his seasoned organizational power and his energetic activities. The history of 20 years -- since the 7 May document was published -- has been brilliantly recorded by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's practical activity that has outstandingly effected a great innovation in all the press and publication sectors, along with the ideological and theoretical activity in which he has fully elucidated the socialist press ideology. Ranging from the revolution, construction, social development to the struggles against (? enemies) and the concrete conditions of life, all the sectors and units have been affected by the press. The leadership on the press is the most sensitive and creative activity that must deal with, by the minute, a great number of the complicated and sharp problems arising in the country, as well as abroad. The energetic activity and work of the dear comrade leader--who correctly settles all problems in a timely manner, personally shouldering all heavy responsibilities arising in the practice of the press despite his busy work in leading party work, state work, military work, and external work--are indeed astonishingly vast. The high-toned voices which rang in the site of the seventh meeting of the Korean Journalist Union held last year are still vivid in people's minds. The voices stated: The dear comrade leader is the genius of newspaper and press information. The dear comrade leader is the commander of the war of communications and radio waves who makes the chuche-oriented radio waves sweep all over the world. The dear comrade leader is the prominent leader who has elucidated the lifeline of the chuche-oriented broadcast work. The voices of participants and debaters in the meeting were the dignified shouts of their boundless fortune of upholding the dear leader as the great lodestar of the press whom mankind has ever met. They were also an expression of the infinite praise of his energetic activity as the great press activist who wisely leads the work of newspaper, communications, broadcast, and publication organs. The dear comrade leader gives precious ideological and theoretical provisions which form the contents of our publications and press information and solves all important policies arising in press and publication work. He often personally checks the main subject and theme of articles. He reviews reporters' poorly written manuscripts and personally corrects and completes them. When he finds materials on laudable communist virtues, which are efflorescing throughout the country today, he sends them to the press organs in order to see to it that they are propagated and generalized among the people. Articles and editorials, including special articles and political essays, which have moved the hearts of millions of readers and made a big sensation in the world thanks to such guidance of the dear leader, are countless. The dear comrade leader has seen to it that the immortal works that he personally wrote are published in NODONG SINMUN, which is the party's newspaper, and KULLOJA so that our press and publications will not only widely propagate the party's ideology and position internally and externally, but also enhance by all means the party's prestige and influence. The dear comrade leader's energetic leadership in the socialist press finds expression in his on-the-spot guidance to press and publication organs. On 19 August 1993 cadre functionaries, reporters, and editorial staff members of NODONG SINMUN greeted the dear comrade leader who arrived at the newspaper company for a visit without prior notice. At this time, their joy was indeed infinitely great. The dear comrade leader looked around modern editing process facilities for a long while and gave guidance to functionaries of NODONG SINMUN, the party's newspaper. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who had ignited the flames of the editorial revolution in the party's newspaper and energetically led the editorial revolution, brilliantly elucidated the road on which NODONG SINMUN can outstandingly perform its mission and duty as the authoritative party's newspaper of the Workers' Party of Korea and indicated: To safeguard and defend our country's socialism and to consummate the socialist cause under the complicated and tense situation it is imperative to more firmly rally party members and the working people around the party and to vigorously accelerate socialist construction. The party's newspaper occupies a very important position in this. Overflowing in his remarks--which were full of infinite energy and vigor--were the sharp and thorough analysis of the prevailing domestic and international situation, the iron-like will to resolutely defend the socialist cause, and the matchless courage to sternly smash the enemies' vicious, reactionary ideological offensives by firmly arming and uniting all of the people ideologically. History has shown that the imperialists and reactionaries perpetrate all sorts of frantical maneuvers at home and abroad to aim at the party's newspaper first and to degenerate it in order to destroy the party and the socialist system and to disarm the people ideologically. If the party's newspaper shakes and changes in quality the press circles are reduced into yellow and gray, all sorts of reactionary ideologies are infiltrated, and eventually a tragic event of swallowing the gains of the revolution attained in blood is created. This is a bitter lesson shown by the realities of those countries in which socialism has collapsed. On that historic day, the dear comrade leader made programmatic remarks on needs for the party's newspaper to give priority to indoctrination and strongly arm the party members and workers with the party's idea, the socialist idea, in compliance with the changing environment, correctly handle various editing materials, carry articles that arouse curiosity among readers, enhance roles of reporters and editors, and further modernize the newspaper company's operation. He also taught a need to give spiritual nutrition [chongsinjok yangsik] to coal miners working in underground deadends and fighters waging struggles under difficult environments to ensure that they maintain their belief and fidelity. The dear comrade leader's words gave all officials, reporters, and editors of the party's newspaper the belief and will that they will share the same destiny with their party and socialism no matter how many times the world may turn upside down. He, feeling sorry to part with journalists-fighters [munpil chonsa] whom he personally raised, stopped his limousine and left the compound of the party's newspaper after waving his hands to their enthusiastic applause. He kindled flames to further strengthen the party's newspaper and score revolutionary upsurges in the overall publication and press work in compliance with the demand of the new environment in which our party and the party's newspaper had the heavy historic mission of defending and advancing the socialist cause. Therefore, the dear comrade leader's on-the-spot guidance to the NODONG SINMUN company will be of greater historic significance as time goes by. In the vortex of the ever-changing situation, the war of communications and electronic waves [tongsin chonpajon], as well as newspapers and broadcasting stations, plays a very important role in the press war [ollonjon] to defeat the imperialists' reactionary ideological and cultural offensives. The footsteps of the dear comrade leader's on-the-spot guidance can also be traced to the Korean Central News Agency [KCNA] company. On 5 October 1980, a few days before the historic sixth party Central Committee congress, the dear comrade leader visited the KCNA company though he was very busy. It was very surprising. He elucidated the path which the news agency should take and took all necessary measures to ensure utmost promptness and correctness in the coverage of the party congress. He stayed with the reporters and editors of the news agency for a long time that day. All people were filled with great joy and deep emotion when they saw the sacred image [korukhan yongsang] of the dear comrade leader, who appeared at the podium of the historic party congress a few days later, in newspapers and on television. At the time when every minute and second of his was very valuable because he was in charge of the important work of successfully holding the party congress, he examined each and every task of the news agency even on the podium of the congress and promptly resolved each task. No other party leader [yongdoja] in the world has done his utmost to carry out the press work. He sometimes gives teachings on several occasions a day. Because of his prudent guidance, KCNA fulfills its mission as an important ideological weapon that deals a strong blow to all reactionary ideas and utter trash that haunt the space on diverse frequencies and waves and that makes our party's independent positions and just voices resound throughout the world. Throughout the days when he made the publication and press work lead the party's ideological front and made every effort to strengthen and develop this work, he spent numerous nights to review articles and editing materials for newspapers, the news agency, and publications and strove to develop the publication and press work. He even made these such efforts to develop the work of publication and the press alone. Therefore, he surely has no time to take a rest because he is personally in charge of party and state affairs, military affairs, and the grand historic task of winning victories in the Korean revolution and mankind's cause of independence. The new era of chuche-oriented television broadcasting opened because of these sleepless and tireless efforts by the dear comrade leader. The dear comrade leader earlier proposed starting television broadcasting and energetically led the work of implementing this initiative. The first chuche-oriented television broadcasting started in our country because of his careful and energetic leadership, and the work of spreading the television network across the country was carried out successfully. Each segment of television programs boundlessly ennobles and enriches the ideological and spiritual lives and cultural and emotional lives of all party members and workers and is filled with the dear comrade leader's intention and concrete guidance to highly display the superiority of our-style socialism. When the party and the revolution were entrusted with heavy tasks and when the situation at home and abroad was grave, the dear comrade leader paid deep attention to the militant role of publications and mass media and led them to launch large-scale ideological offensives. In this way, he strongly armed the entire party, all the people, and the entire Army with the party's ideology and will, consolidated the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks, and vigorously inspired all party members and workers into carrying out socialist construction, the cause of achieving the fatherland's reunification, and the cause of achieving independence throughout the world. Even under present circumstances in which the imperialists are frantically trying to inspire the people with reactionary ideas and spread decadent and corrupt [toepyejogigo malsegijogin] (?bourgeois) life-styles, every newspaper, news agency, broadcasting station, or book in our country upholds the banner of the chuche idea, the socialist banner, without shaking and fulfills its heavy mission as an important media organization that correctly represents and defends their party's ideology and position and propagandizes and implements the party's policies. This is unthinkable apart from the dear comrade leader's wise leadership. Today, our party's publications and mass media have a reputation and a great influence in international journalism circles, and the people of the world pay attention to voices resounding in Pyongyang. This is a valuable result achieved by the tested leadership art and powerful press war tactics [yuryokhan ollon chonbop] of the dear comrade leader, who firmly adheres to the chuche-oriented position and revolutionary principle in the ideological press war [sasang ollonjon] and resolves all issues in a matured and sagacious manner. In the history of the working class' prolonged struggle for socialism, there are many parties and leaders [yongdojaduri] that founded revolutionary publications and media organizations and utilized them. However, no other political leaders [yongdoja] in the history of the development of the journalism of the world and in any party attached greater significance to publications and mass media, more positively utilized them, and further strengthened their might than our dear comrade leader. The dear comrade leader, a [word indistinct] of the press of our era, set a world-class example in the leadership of the publications and mass media. Our dear leader General Kim Chong-il is a great leader [yongdoja] and a teacher who built a large unit of revolutionary journalists who are boundlessly loyal to the party and revolution and the fatherland and people. In countries where socialism has collapsed, reporters and journalists have changed in ideological terms and degraded in moral terms because they had no great leader [yongdoja] at the head of their party and eventually turned into trumpeters for the enemy's antisocialist maneuvers. At such a time, reporters and journalists in Korea have upheld the red banner of the revolution and shared the same destiny with the party without shaking or changing their minds. The Korean reporters and journalists have been able to take the lead in the party's ideological front and excellently fulfilled their heavy mission and duty before the era and history. This is because they have been indoctrinated and raised under the care of great General Kim Chong-il. The relationship between the leader [yongdoja] and reporters and journalists in our country is not simply a relationship of being led and receiving leadership, but it is also formed of a relationship between the great teacher and pupil and a benevolent father [chaaeroun opoi] and blood children. Here, the blood-tied relationship and an impregnably complete unity exists in which there lies the greatest happiness and glory of our Korea's reporters and journalists, and the invincible might of our press. The dear comrade leader who attaches just as great importance to the role of the pen and microphone in the revolution and construction and social development, as the might of a million-strong force, indoctrinated and trained the reporters and journalists not just as writers, but as those who love justice and truth and as resolute fighters and enthusiastic patriots unhesitatingly devoting their lives for the revolution. The revolution of the newspaper, the press, and publications which was kindled by him was a glory of ideological training and a school of the revolution, fostering our reporters and journalists into chuche-type communist revolutionary and competent literary fighters. On 6 April 1974, the dear comrade leader highly assessed the reporters and made the following impressive talk: Those who write in accordance with the party's intention are heroes. Even when the political and ideological level and literary skills of the reporters and journalists were in their infant stage, Comrade Kim Chong-il, our benevolent teacher, led them hand in hand and step by step, thus embracing such valuable glory to them. Reporters and journalists have been called comrade and eternal companion by their leader [yongdoja] and even received a reply letter from the leader [yongdoja] after sending a letter containing a do-or-die pledge toward the leader [yongdoja] when they were faced with an arduous trial before the revolution. Such an impressive fact has not been recorded in the history of the development of the press for all ages and countries. The dear comrade leader's high political faith and love toward the reporters and journalists are truly endless. Amid the bosom of the great father [widaehan opoi], the reporters and journalists were rendered distinguished services with gold medals and became people's reporters and people's journalists. Also, reporters and journalists who performed meritorious deeds for a long time received benevolent birthday tables, and bear the honor of being laid in the patriotic martyrs tomb after their deaths. Korea's reporters and journalists truly cannot live even for a minute and cannot elucidate the honor of the party's literary fighters apart from the bosom of the great General Kim Chong-il. The dear comrade leader exerted such great efforts and energy to foster and present the reporters and journalists. Even so, he is an endlessly humble and benevolent father who turned all the meritorious deeds and glory toward the reporters and journalists. We cannot forget 19 November 1993. On this day, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il sent a letter to the participants of the seventh congress of the Korean Journalists Union. It was an inspiring event in which it manifested to the whole world the relationship of complete harmony among the leader [yongdoja], reporters, and journalists. In the past, our reporters and journalists were endlessly loyal to the party, and today they are unchangeably sharing the fate with the party as in the past. Where are such highly proud reporters and journalists who are carrying out press and publication activities with their pens, microphones, and cameras amid the great leader's [yongdoja] great faith and love? Only the chuche-type blood embraced by the party is flowing in the bodies of our reporters and journalists who have been fostered and trained by enjoying such great glory amid the protection of the great leader [yongdoja]. Also, they are highly praising only their party and the leader [suryong] and are writing and carrying out broadcasts advocating their fatherland and system. Our Korea's reporters and journalists have a firm view of the revolutionary outlook, have a firm stand on socialism, do not want any comfort or worldly fame, but are gathering news, writing, and carrying out broadcast activities with the spirit of a war correspondent. Today, all the People's Army officers and men with rifles and the 5 million young vanguards who desire to be guns and bombs are firmly united around great General Kim Chong-il. Ranks of faithful reporters and journalists who are firmly grasping pens of the revolution are also firmly united as one around him in strong faith and will. There is no force in the world that can break the rank of our reporters and journalists who are death-defyingly defending their leader [yongdoja] politically, ideologically, and theoretically with absolute worship of, loyalty, and filial obedience to him. As long as this iron-firm rank exists, our party's press and publications will shine forever as the great Comrade Kim Chong-il's press and publications. The 20-year history of our party's press and publication that has advanced along the road elucidated by the historic 7 May document! The days of the past 20-year history and the brilliant reality of today vigorously demonstrate the justness and might of the great comrade leader's original press ideology and the greatness of his leadership achievements. As we uphold the great leader [yongdoja] at the top of the party, the revolution, and the press, our Korean reporters and journalists have indeed been able to walk along the glorious road of victory, and our party's press and publications have been able to accumulate historic accomplishments that will shine forever all over the world. What enables us to look back on the past days, filled with dignity and pride? Our party's press and publications, reporters, and journalists have the greatest pride and honor in the fact that they have actively contributed to the brilliant solution of the question on the succession of leadership in implementing the socialist cause. Our party's press and publications have firmly defended the stronghold [chinji] of the socialist ideology by concentrating all efforts on broadly propagating ideologies and theories of the dear comrade leader, who is leading the socialist cause along the single road of victory, and on firmly guaranteeing his leadership through generations. Whether the stronghold the socialist ideology can be defended or not, greatly depends on the role of the press. The degeneration of the press results in the degeneration of society. This is why imperialists and reactionaries are trying to destroy the party and the socialist system, to degrade the people ideologically, and to degenerate the press by all means. All of our newspapers, news agencies, broadcasting services, magazines, and books broadly explain and propagate the superiority of socialism of our own style that has embodied the chuche idea, and they prevent any strange ideology [chapsasang] or voice that has no relation to the party's ideology and position, the working class-oriented position, or socialist principles from infiltrating into our society. In printed columns or on screens, our press and publications make features of the dear comrade leader's immortal achievements and his greatness as a great ideological theorist, a great politician, a great military strategist, and the people's father so as to have all people and the People's Army officers and men bear deep in their hearts the will and faith that they can complete the socialist cause only by following him. Thanks to the great contribution of our party's press and publications, our entire party, all people, and entire Army are resolutely defending the stronghold [poru] of socialism, united as one around great General Kim Chong-il today. The Korean reporters' and journalists' contribution to the sublime cause of solving the question on the succession of leadership by upholding great General Kim Chong-il -- the destiny of socialism -- at the top of the party, the revolution, and the Army will shine forever as their greatest exploit that they can squarely brag about in the present and before history. As long as the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great man of the socialist press, and the rank of faithful reporters and journalists who share their destinies with him exist, our party's ideological front, the ideological stronghold of socialism, is impregnable forever.
