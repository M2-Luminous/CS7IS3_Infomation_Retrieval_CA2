Addressing a theoretical study class for senior officials, Jiang, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, called for unremitting efforts to help arm the whole party with Deng's theory. He asked officials at all levels, particularly senior officials, to attach top importance to the study of Deng's theory during the current new period. He noted that only by becoming clear-headed theoretically, will it be possible for party and government officials to be firm politically, to become more conscientious in carrying out the party's basic line of taking economic construction as the central task, and to attain China's modernization goal. The Marxist theoretical level of leading officials is essential to the success of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, he told senior officials from across the country attending the class in the party school of the party Central Committee. That is why all officials, veteran and young, must continue to study Deng's theory assiduously and lead party members in studying the theory persistently, he added. In studying the selected works of Deng Xiaoping, it is necessary to seek correct answers to the questions that have arisen in the course of reforms and economic construction, especially in building up a socialist market economy, Jiang said. Speaking of how to balance the relations between the reform, development and stability, Jiang Zemin stressed the need to educate party members, officials and the people, on Deng Xiaoping's ideas on the issue. Meanwhile, it is imperative to correctly grasp the current overall situation in China, and solve in a positive and appropriate way prominent problems adversely affecting the reform, development and stability, he said. Furthermore, "we must unswervingly follow the party's mass line and give play to the initiative of all sectors of society," he said. The establishment of a socialist market economic structure and the deepening of reforms have made it imperative to strengthen and improve party leadership and party building, and bring the role of party organizations and members into full play, he said. He also called for efforts to train and promote younger officials so that they will be able to assume leading responsibilities beyond the year 2000.
