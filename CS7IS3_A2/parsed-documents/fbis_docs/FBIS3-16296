But despite the passion with which officials have given themselves over to this task, they have not crowned themselves with laurels. The statute on elections to the kray legislative assembly scheduled for 27 March forbids the publication in the 10 days prior to the voting of the results of public opinion polls connected with the forthcoming elections. We recall that this ban was in operation on the eve of the 12 December all-Russian parliamentary elections but led to nothing good. And now it is happening again. Why the kray administration needed this is in general understandable: By receiving punctually sociological information which is closed to the press it will receive an opportunity to control the course of the election campaign where the rest of the public is assigned the role of extras. Officials will find it easier to make operational conclusions and to manipulate public consciousness. The kray referendum is scheduled for 27 March: The population is to express its attitude toward the local law "on the foundations of direct power of the people and the organization of state power in Krasnoyarsk Kray." The interpretation of the power of the people and of democracy in this document gives rise to a mass of questions. But let us return to the elections ceremony. Seven days before them the governor has also banned "the dissemination of materials detrimental to the honor and dignity of candidate deputies." What, in the remaining days -- before and after -- is it possible to cause harm? And what about the honor and dignity of other citizens who are not contenders for seats? The local administration separately approved inter alia a statute on the procedure for the use of the mass media by candidate deputies which includes the following point for one: "Journalists, creative workers, and officials who commit violations may at the suggestion of the relevant electoral commission be removed for the period through the end of the election campaign from work connected with its coverage by the leaders of the mass media.... The electoral commission, in cases where mass media editorial offices violate the procedure for conducting election campaigning more than once, have the right to raise the question of the dismissal of leaders of mass media editorial offices...." Under the law "on the mass media" this is called interference in the activity of editorial offices and violation of their professional independence (and the 10-day moratorium on the publication of sociological reports is forcing the journalists to renounce the dissemination of information). It seems there is one thing left for the local press: not to fulfill illegal bans. Incidentally, KRASNOYARSKIY KOMSOMOLETS had the day before, 12 December, familiarized its readers with the data of sociological polls so the outcome of the elections was no sensation for them. Incidentally, KRASNOYARSKIY KOMSOMOLETS because of financial difficulties was recently obliged to take on as a co-founder the kray administration's press and information department. But the new owner does not even have enough money for those who do not contradict it. So far no demonstration against the restriction of freedom of speech in Krasnoyarsk has been observed. On the other hand, the triumphal procession of bureaucrats is continuing to talk of the establishment of a civil society and the separation of powers.
