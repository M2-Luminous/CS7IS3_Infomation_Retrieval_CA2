Because Factor VIII protein maintains its solid state at 4�C and the solid and liquid phases are in a balance state at 4�C, Han was able to skillfully separate the solid and liquid phases of freshly-frozen plasma at 4�C temperature. Using this technique, he separated Factor VIII protein from the solid phase by removing the undesirable proteins that dissolved in liquid phase at 4�C. The technique has greatly enhanced the utilization rate of human plasma. After being separated from plasma, the purified Factor VIII was preserved in sucrose and glycine solution and viruses were inactivated for 10 hours at 60�C. Using the new technique, the preservation rate of Factor VIII's biological activity and in vivo recovery rate, which reached 73.09 percent and 97 percent respectively, were all much higher than using other conventional methods. According to data released by Chinese Blood Transfusion Association, China's annual output of medium-pure Factor VIII is about two million IU (International Unit), which can only treat 14.1 percent of China's 60,000 hemophilia A patients.
