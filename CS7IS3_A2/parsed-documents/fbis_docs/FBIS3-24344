A legal basis has been laid, and organs of multilateral cooperation in economics, defense, and foreign policy have been established and are functioning. The Coordinating-Consulting Committee and the Executive Secretariat of the Commonwealth have begun active operations. A unified economic space is being formed, although it is not simple, on the basis of the Treaty on Formation of the Economic Union. We declare our sincere resolution in carrying out the will of the peoples of our states to broaden and strengthen the traditional, historically established relations of friendship, cooperation and mutual understanding among our states on a new basis. In the given historical stage, under the difficult conditions of the transitional period, it is vitally important to preserve everything good that bound our peoples together through the centuries of common history in politics, economics, culture, humanitarian ties, and personal dealings and on this basis develop cooperation on a qualitatively new level. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the states, mutual trust and openness, renunciation of the use of force, the threat of force, and economic pressure, resolving disputes by peaceful means, non-intervention in internal affairs, conscientious performance of obligations assumed, and mutually advantageous partnership should become the foundation of interstate relations. It is essential to be aware of the exceptional nature of this stage in the life of our peoples, who are living through not just a political and economic transformation, but also a profound psychological change, growth in national self-awareness, and the rebirth of their own spiritual cultures. Under these conditions we, the heads of states, politicians, as well as cultural, scientific, and artistic figures, and all the citizens of our states must show balance in evaluations of one another and an attitude of cherishing the priceless heritage acquired by our peoples and the possibility of civilized development on the basis of sovereign equality in the system of international relations. We affirm that the most important thing, on whose behalf we aspire to strengthen trust among ourselves, is international consensus as the highest political, ethical, and human value. The members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, in introducing their national currencies, will strive to establish free, civilized exchange of national currencies and solve problems in mutual payments. This should create the objective conditions for evaluating the possibility of forming a payment and currency union by stages. We all need one another's support, cooperation, and mutual understanding today. The future of our peoples, security, stability, and peace and tranquility in the homes of simple people depend directly on the level of trust among the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. We, the heads of state and also of governments, must show maximum wisdom, good will, and responsibility and do everything possible to perform the obligations assumed by the Commonwealth. Willingness to reach reasonable compromises will make it possible, without infringing on the interests of sovereign states, to progress along a constructive path and jointly shape an effective treaty-law basis for our cooperation in the name of the flourishing of our peoples. The experience of the 2 years of existence of the Commonwealth of Independent States convinces us that constructive dialogue, multilateral consultation, and consideration and respect for the positions of the partner foster a real consolidation of the political and economic independence of the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States and help them achieve a high level of integration. The Commonwealth of Independent States has demonstrated its openness in practice. Its participants have grown. While permitting each state to realize its own choice as to political and economic order according to its own specific features and nationality characteristics, participation in the Commonwealth has created the necessary political and socioeconomic conditions for building a democratic society in each of them. The sovereign members of the Commonwealth, as independent and equal subjects of international law, preserve to themselves the right to participate in world and regional organizations. Recognizing the importance of maintaining peace and stability within and among the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the heads of state of the Commonwealth members have agreed on the need for new efforts to strengthen the peace-making potential of their states. Expressing concern at the continuing armed conflicts arising on the soil of expansionism, nationalism, chauvinism, xenophobia, and religious intolerance, the participants of the Ashgabat meeting take note of the importance of efforts to bring these phenomena to a prompt end and are filled with determination to broaden cooperation with one another in this sphere and do everything necessary, including collective measures aimed at peaceful settlement of armed conflicts and eliminating the causes that lead to their occurrence in the future. We, the heads of the states of the Commonwealth of Independent States, expressing the will of our peoples, declare our readiness to do everything we can to ensure a normal life for people, provide them with social guarantees, prevent forced migration, and ensure conditions for economic stabilization and the realization of large-scale development programs. We express our profound conviction that the political, economic, and humanitarian potential of the Commonwealth of Independent States is a powerful guarantee that the historic challenges facing our peoples will be met.
