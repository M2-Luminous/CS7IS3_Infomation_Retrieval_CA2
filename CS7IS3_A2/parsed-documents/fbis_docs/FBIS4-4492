We affirmatively estimate the efforts of Russia to find a solution through political negotiations, opposing "sanctions" and pressure. But we fear that the Russian proposal for multilateral negotiations might complicate the matter. As for the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it is a political and military problem which should be settled between the DPRK and the United States first of all in view of its cause and its nature. The U.S. authorities themselves had already admitted this and responded to DPRK-U.S. talks. The United States published a joint statement with the DPRK, admitted the reasonableness of the DPRK's proposal for a package deal and agreed to immediate steps of simultaneous action. But the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is undergoing twists and turns, without progress yet, because the United States, after reaching an agreement at the negotiating table with the DPRK, arbitrarily reversed the agreed points, setting unreasonable preconditions outside the conference room. It wholly depends on the attitude of the United States how the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula would be settled in the future. If Russia wants to contribute to the solution of the nuclear issue, it would be more suitable to the prevailing situation for it to exert its influence on the United States so that the latter may honestly implement the points of its agreement with the DPRK and observe the principle of impartiality, we think.
