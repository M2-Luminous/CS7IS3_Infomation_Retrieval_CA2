The delegates had decided, among other things, on the formation of a three-member government and demanded from parliament the ratification of the voted resolutions. Today they are holding a demonstration in front of the Legislative Palace from which Rothschild Francois reports live: [Francois] Indeed, the demonstrators are gathered before the Legislative Palace. They are severely criticizing the legislators -- deputies, and senators. They are demanding the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies and of the Senate of the Republic. The demonstrators are also chanting words hostile to the embargo, to Aristide, and to the international community. It should be noted that these demonstrators are not from Port-au-Prince, but from the Plateau Central and from the North. They came in response to a call by the Committee of Public Security, which is determined to install a new government in Haiti. So they came to Port-au-Prince this morning to demonstrate. Let us listen to Mobile 18, who met Leveille, in charge of the committee. [Mobile 18] I am with Mr. Herve Leveille who is a member of the Group of the Great North and of the national congress. Mr. Leveille, did the mobilization begin today? [Leveille] The mobilization has begun. Only the Plateau Central is represented in this demonstration. The other delegations will arrive later. There is a problem on the northern road, so we might not have the delegation from the North. Thus Plateau Central, the West, the Southeast, and the South delegations are due to arrive during the week. I am taking this opportunity to invite all the people in Port-au-Prince and the people from Cap-Haitian living in Port-au-Prince to come demonstrate with us their total rejection of the embargo and to demand the immediate formation of the Government of Public Security. [Mobile 18] Mr. Leveille, we notice that you have gone to great effort. We especially notice that you have used a state bus to carry the people. Is this not prohibited by law? [Leveille] If it is only this state bus that is available in a faraway zone, where these demonstrators live, how could they not use it? It is normal. Here, you have more options. But with the embargo, there is almost no car running in the provinces. And you should, instead of dwelling on these minute details, note the effort behind bringing 500 people to the capital now. You should understand what that means, with fuel at $20 a gallon now. Even if a truck driver is willing to help us, his car gets worn out. It is normal to use what is at hand.
