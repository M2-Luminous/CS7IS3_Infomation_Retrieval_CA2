On Monday the Moslems lodged yet another protest with the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) accusing the Croats for violating the ceasefire in Mostar and its surroundings, said Sarajevo Radio in Monday. Members of the Bosnian Croat armed force (HVO) without any provocation opened strong infantry fire on the separation lines, while in the central parts of the city the HVO fired from hand-held rocket launchers on Moslem positions, Sarajevo Radio said. The Moslem radio failed to say whether the Moslems had returned fire or if there had been any casualties. A representative of the Moslem authorities on Sunday expressed doubt that life in Mostar would return to normal soon despite the Washington agreement. The Bosnian Croats and Moslems have for the past year been engaged in fierce battles in Mostar in an attempt to divide the city, from which they have expelled almost all the Serbs, into two ethnically clean parts. The representatives of the Bosnian Moslems and Croats in Washington submitted to strong U.S. pressure to set up their federation in the territory of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a subsequent one with the republic of Croatia. Political analysts believe that Washington's initiative aims to isolate the Bosnian Serbs and pressure them to make additional territorial concessions.
