Robaina told Gili that: [Begin Robaina recording] I am going as a guest of several foreign ministries, in this case the foreign ministries of five countries located on a continent with which we have, historically, maintained special relations. You are aware of the offensive the country, and the Foreign Ministry in particular, has launched in areas like the Caribbean, Latin America, and other areas of the world. In this particular case, we will be touring Ghana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Angola, and Namibia. In Angola, as in the other countries, we have always been in contact with our counterparts. The health, commerce, economy, and tourism ministers have also been in close contact with their counterparts in those countries. We are pleased to announce that on this trip we will be meeting with the presidents of the five countries. I believe that Europe and other countries of the world are being manipulated by a one-sided version of the news regarding our country which is handled by a manipulated press. This country is not the hell many reporters paint it to be nor is it the paradise others paint it to be. We must exploit the means to tell those countries what our country is all about. Unfortunately, when we tell the big newspapers what the situation is, they do not always print what we tell them. The offensive involves, above all, explaining our truth to Europe. Our truth has good, average, and bad things to it, but we must have a chance to explain it. For example, I believe that the recently concluded meeting with the European Parliament opened a space for this communication. We agree on some issues and disagree on others; but the idea is not whether we agree or disagree; the idea is to keep communication channels open. I believe that communication with Europe is indispensable to this offensive. In the economic area I believe there are already some European countries that have an important presence in our country. Many have an opinion about Cuba, many express opinions about Cuba, but not many have direct contact with Cuba or express their views on Cuba. I am not asking that they share our views or that they share the views of others; all I ask is that they analyze our situation and that we be heard before a decision is made about us. We do not like it when others talk about us and we are not allowed to tell our side. That is what I am talking about. Our side must be heard. Unfortunately, those who oppose us have much more space than our Revolution has. [end recording]
