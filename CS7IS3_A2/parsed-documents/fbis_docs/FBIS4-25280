A news release from Boeing Defense and Space Group said some 129 research teams have submitted proposals to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in response to a NASA research announcement. The science proposals are directed at research in environmental monitoring, biomedical applied physiology, human factors, fundamental biology on humans, lower vertebrates, non-vertebrate animals and plant life, and for research to develop advanced technologies for life support. As part of its restructured space station program, NASA will be cooperating with the Russian space agency to conduct as many as ten shuttle flights to the Mir space station from 1995-1997. During this period, U.S. astronauts will be on board Mir for four missions, the first lasting 90 days and the next three lasting 180 days each. The research announcement the science teams have responded to presents the opportunity to conduct long-duration microgravity experiments during these four flights.
