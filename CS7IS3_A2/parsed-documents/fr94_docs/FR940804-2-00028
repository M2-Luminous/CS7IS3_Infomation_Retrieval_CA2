FR940804-2-00028 FR940804-2-00010 [A&hyph;469&hyph;805] Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Stainless Steel Bar from Spain Agency: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Jenkins or Kate Johnson, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;1756 or 482&hyph;4929, respectively. Preliminary Determination The Department of Commerce (the Department) preliminarily determines that stainless steel bar (SSB) from Spain is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (the Act), as amended. The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Scope of Investigation The merchandise covered by this investigation is SSB. For purposes of this investigation, the term ``stainless steel bar'' means articles of stainless steel in straight lengths that have been either hot-rolled, forged, turned, cold-drawn, cold-rolled or otherwise cold-finished, or ground, having a uniform solid cross section along their whole length in the shape of circles, segments of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), triangles, hexagons, octagons or other convex polygons. SSB includes cold-finished SSBs that are turned or ground in straight lengths, whether produced from hot-rolled bar or from straightened and cut rod or wire, and reinforcing bars that have indentations, ribs, grooves, or other deformations produced during the rolling process. Except as specified above, the term does not include stainless steel semi-finished products, cut length flat-rolled products (i.e., cut length rolled products which if less than 4.75 mm in thickness have a width measuring at least 10 times the thickness, or if 4.75 mm or more in thickness having a width which exceeds 150 mm and measures at least twice the thickness), wire (i.e., cold-formed products in coils, of any uniform solid cross section along their whole length, which do not conform to the definition of flat-rolled products), and angles, shapes and sections. The SSB subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheadings 7222.10.0005, 7222.10.0050, 7222.20.0005, 7222.20.0045, 7222.20.0075 and 7222.30.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.
