While Cassandras predicted doom and disaster, more sober Opposition politicians mildly rebuked Mr PV Narasimha Rao for undertaking such a venture at this point of time. Precisely a week later, Mr Rao is returning home after his American sojourn to thunderous applause. By all accounts, this has been his most successful foreign trip--indeed, he has excelled himself, providing a glimpse of a determined elder statesman that nobody knew lurked behind his persona of a brooding and dithering politician. Whether at the various meetings he had with American businessmen or in his fine speech to the U.S. Congress, Mr Narasimha Rao exhibited a confidence that reflected the indomitable spirit of India: He portrayed himself as the epitome of all that modern India stands for; he carried with him a message not from a Third World country but a developing economy which stands on the threshold of emerging as tomorrow's economic giant. Any residual images of India that may have lingered in the U.S. of the PL 480 days, were wiped away by the strength of conviction with which he spoke: He appealed without cringing; he beseeched without pleading; and, he demanded the attention that has been denied all these years of people who matter. Not surprisingly, at the end of the day, he has earned the respect and admiration of at least one section of American society-- the business community--which also happens to be extremely influential. In fact, it can be said with a degree of certainty that the immediate effect of Mr Narasimha Rao's visit will be felt in the realm of trade and commerce between the two countries. If the response of American businessmen and industrialists to the Prime Minister's statements is any indication, then they can be expected to push aside all doubts that may still exist about the future of economic liberalisation in this country and invest in the Indian market. Therefore, before the year is over, the total amount of American investment in India could well be many times over the present level of $1.1 billion. This is, of course, a supposition that is dependent upon many variables, but it will be extremely surprising if there is no upsurge in American investment in the Indian economy. However, no such certainty can be applied in the other crucial area of Indo-American relations. For, official U.S. Administration policy towards India will not necessarily be influenced by a single summit meeting and it will be incorrect to judge developments on this front on the basis of improved trade and investment. After all, while industrialists and businessmen have a narrow perspective and are goaded by the profit motive, politicians have to take into account larger issues and are prompted by imperatives that may be of little interest to the former. This difference is best exemplified by the fact that while American investors are loath to get bogged down with issues like human rights violations, the U.S. Administration cannnot but rake up such issues from time to time despite the negative fallout this invariably has on bilateral relations. If further elaboration is needed, it can be found in Sino-American relations. But neither is there any reason to believe that official American policy will remain entirely unaffected and that White House will persist with the status quo. American business is known to have greatly influenced foreign policy in the past and it is more than likely that those who dream of multiplying their wealth with the help of the Indian market will be more than eager to bring about pressure on policy-makers not to upset the apple cart. To that extent, Mr Narasimha Rao has skilfully sought to win over American businessmen and industrialists, fully aware of the fact that at moments of crisis they can prove to be effective allies and protect India's interests. Even otherwise, despite persisting differences, a greater understanding of India's position can be expected on issues like nuclear nonproliferation, the missile programme and Kashmir. As much was evident from the tone and tenor of Mr Clinton's comments at the post-summit Press conference and those of officials later. More importantly, Mr Narasimha Rao's trip has initiated a process that could yield rich dividends for India in the long run. For instance, the planned visits by high-level officials of the U.S. Administration over the next one year can only take the dialogue for constructive cooperation to its logical conclusion. No less important is the demonstrative value of such interaction: The message of joint Indo-U.S. military exercises, if they come about, to subcontinental countries inimical towards India cannot be overemphasised. However, one area that will continue to cause some amount of friction is American policy on Pakistan and its fallout on the sub-continent. Although Mr Clinton has stressed that the Kashmir issue has to be ultimately solved through bilateral negotiations, a point that has been reiterated in the communique (which interestingly validates the same Shimla Agreement that was not so long ago rubbished by the Assistant Secretary of State, Ms Robin Raphel), he has shown an ambivalent attitude towards Islamabad's role in sponsoring terrorism in the Valley. Both Mr Narasimha Rao and Mr Clinton, one an elderly politician groomed in the Cold War era and the other a representative of the baby boomers' generation, have shown exemplary effort to check the downslide in relations between the two countries and start a new chapter that will be written over the next few years. Neither of them may be in office by the time the last line of this chapter is written, but hopefully their efforts will ensure that it ends on a happy note of mutual accommodation.
