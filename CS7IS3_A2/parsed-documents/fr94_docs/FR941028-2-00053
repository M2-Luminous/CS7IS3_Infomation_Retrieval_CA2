Weston, Inc. AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice; request for comment. SUMMARY: EPA hereby complies with the requirements of 40 CFR 2.310(h) for authorization to disclose to its contractor, Roy F. Weston, Inc. (hereinafter ``Weston''), of Seattle, Washington, Superfund confidential business information (``CBI'') which has been submitted to EPA Region 9, Hazardous Waste Management Division, Office of Superfund Programs. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Chang, Office of Superfund Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105, (415) 744&hyph;2338. NOTICE OF REQUIRED DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT PROVISIONS AND OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA'') as amended, (commonly known as ``Superfund'') requires completion of enforcement activities at Superfund sites in concert with other site events. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires that EPA provide requested information to other parties. EPA has entered into a contract, No. 68&hyph;W9&hyph;0046, with Weston for enforcement and FOIA support services. EPA Region 9 has determined that disclosure of CBI to Weston is necessary in order that they may carry out the work required by that contract with EPA. The contract complies with all requirements of 40 CFR 2.301(h)(2)(ii), incorporated by reference into 40 CFR 2.310(h)(2). EPA Region 9 will require that each Weston employee sign a written agreement that he or she: (1) will use the information only for the purpose of carrying out the work required by the contract, (2) shall refrain from disclosing the information to anyone other than EPA without the prior written approval of each affected business or of an EPA legal office, and (3) shall return to EPA all copies of the information (and any abstracts or extracts therefrom) upon request from the EPA program office, whenever the information is no longer required by Weston for performance of the work required by the contract. These non-disclosure statements shall be maintained on file with the Project Officer. Weston employees will be trained on Superfund CBI requirements. EPA hereby advises affected parties that they have ten working days to comment pursuant to 40 CFR 2.301(b)(2)(ii), incorporated by reference into 40 CFR 2.310(h)(2). Comments should be sent to: Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, James Chang (H&hyph;8&hyph;2), 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. Dated: October 7, 1994.
