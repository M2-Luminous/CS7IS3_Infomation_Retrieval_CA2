Qiao, chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, made the statement in talks with Wilhelm Vorndran, president of Bavaria state's parliament. Qiao noted that 1994 is an important year for China's deepening reform, during which many important measures will be taken. Qiao stressed, "The aim of our reform is to accelerate the building of the country's market economic system and quicken the pace for economic construction." "We also need to strengthen cooperation with the international community, and in adopting measures for the reform we are seeking conformity with the international community," he added. He said that tariffs readjustment will help restore China's status as a signatory party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Qiao told Vorndran, "We are still facing an arduous task of drawing up laws and we will initially set up a frame structure for the legal system to meet the requirements of the market economy within the five-year term of the Eighth National People's Congress." In this regard, China should draw on the experiences of foreign countries, he added. Qiao said he is very pleased to see the sound growth of bilateral ties, including the relationship between China and the state of Bavaria. He expressed the hope that such relationship will not only involve economic cooperation, but also cooperation in culture, education, science and technology. Prior to the talks, Vorndran hosted a welcoming ceremony for Qiao and his party. Bavaria state and China have enjoyed very good ties, Vorndran said, adding that Qiao's visit will give a new impetus to such ties. He said he is glad that China will set up a consulate-general in Munich which, he said, is an indication of the developing relations between Bavaria state and China. Qiao noted that as early as the 1980s, Bavaria state established a partnership with Shandong Province in east China, and its cooperation with other parts of China has also been fruitful. "It is certain that my visit to Bavaria will produce abundant results," he added. Earlier today, Qiao and his party visited BMW Limited Company, the 11th largest industrial enterprise in Germany.
