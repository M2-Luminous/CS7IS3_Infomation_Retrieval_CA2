That is why our correspondent met with the CINC of the Air Defense Troops Col-Gen of Aviation Viktor Prudnikov. [Ivanov] Viktor Alekseyevich, what has changed in the PVO [Air Defense] Troops in the last year? [Prudnikov] A lot has changed. These changes are associated primarily with military reform. The Order of the President of the Russian Federation and the corresponding order of the Ministry of Defense practically gave a new face to the PVO Troops. In the future they will be the basis for creation of Russia's aerospace defense. That is a natural future, because the air and space spheres are so interrelated that they have long been viewed as an inseparable whole. The principle of formation of the PVO system will also be changed. It will acquire a quite different content and will become territorial. Within the time periods designated by the defense minister, zones and regions of air defense will be created. It remains only to establish them legally, through the appropriate documents. I assume that this will require special study. If we consider the specific results of combat readiness and activity of the troops, then it must be stressed that we have been able to preserve the quality and reliability of the PVO while reducing them quantitatively. My second point is that all outmoded arms and equipment have been eliminated. Units and subunits are equipped now with the most modern and powerful systems and complexes which will make it possible to retain efficiency of use while shrinking the combat formations. But perhaps one of the most urgent problems is the fate of those who work at radar consoles, in the cockpits of the fighter interceptors, in the missile systems. Last year was quite hard for them. As a result of the cut, thousands of officers and warrant officers were released. And although we tried, to the extent possible, to allow for the interests and desires of each, I cannot say that the process is a painless one. Even those who do not fall under the cuts begin to lose confidence in tomorrow. This situation requires that the military council, the troop command and the cadre organs conduct purposeful work to strengthen social protection, and requires an individual approach in deciding the fate of each who is subject to the organizational personnel measures. We strive to do everything so as not to offend those who faithfully served the Fatherland for many years. We will not discharge service members without apartments. The current material and financial support of the troops is a matter of concern. Last year we were not able to achieve regularity in payments even of pay and allowances. Even now in a number of units service members have not received their pay for March. It is hard for the families of officers and warrant officers to live under these conditions, for most of them have no other sources of income. We are striving to distribute the money we do get as uniformly as possible. I have ordered that we first satisfy the remote garrisons, and that officer personnel receive their pay last. [Ivanov] Viktor Alekseyevich, how then is the main mission of the PVO Troops, maintenance of high combat readiness, being accomplished? [Prudnikov] In the near future, if we do not thoroughly correct the system for supplying the units with resources to conduct combat training in a planned fashion, then I must say bluntly that the status of combat readiness will begin to drop. By this I mean that the fliers must fly, and the missilemen and the radar operations must turn on their systems and perform their training drills and fires. Daily training must be conducted. And this is not happening today to the full extent because we don't have the resources. Nonetheless, combat training is proceeding. For now we have tried to conduct everything that was planned for this training year, the exercises, fires, operational assemblies, and conferences in their full extent and on time. [Ivanov] Just a year ago, monitoring of the use of Russian air space was a very serious problem. What is the state of affairs now? [Prudnikov] Unfortunately this question has not been resolved. In order to have everything necessary to monitor the air border and the flights of aircraft through it, we must perform a great volume of work, very expensive by today's standards. The normative documents are also necessary, to regulate the use of Russian air space. Their lack makes it harder for the PVO Troops to perform their missions. I won't say that this state of affairs has led to any flagrant violations. Virtually everything depends on the discipline of those who pilot the aircraft. But we have already encountered incidents of violations. Not long ago we were compelled to use the on-duty air forces to force an intruder aircraft to land at Mineralnyye Vody for a customs inspection. [Ivanov] The PVO Troops have already experienced several cuts. Now there is a new stage. But is there some sort of limit in numerical strength and the complement of the groupings beyond which the combat readiness of the troops will drop? [Prudnikov] The minimal acceptable numerical strength of personnel and PVO groupings have been calculated. The figure was reported to the leadership of the Armed Forces. I will say that there is understanding of the problem. Now the Main Staff of the service is working on proposals to reduce the troops in such a way as not to do harm to their combat strength. [Ivanov] In 1991, ex-president Gorbachev ordered the creation of the Strategic Deterrence Forces, to which troops of the Missile-Space Defense were assigned from the PVO Troops. As far as I know, even now there is talk of variants of a transfer of the Missile-Space Defense Troops to another Armed Service. The motivation is simple, they say these troops are not precisely working in air defense. [Prudnikov] My opinion is not based on that fact that there is no need to transfer anything to anyone. If it helps matters, then there's nothing more to say. But let us see how and why the Missile-Space Defense was included in the PVO system. They proceeded first of all from the fact that to ensure safe protection of the state from air and space, a strong command and control system was needed. It was created, and it works successfully. And it would not be advisable to touch anything in it today, let alone tear something out. [Ivanov] One last question, Viktor Alekseyevich. Recently various high state and military authorities have been receiving letters in which veterans and service members have expressed their concern about the future of the PVO Troops. You have partly answered this. Still, how well-founded is their alarm? [Prudnikov] At present a very serious and intense study is in progress to determine the structure of Russia's air defense. As far as I know, the proposals have been reasonable, well-considered, and not directed toward weakening the combat might of the PVO. But I must say the following in this regard. There is no need to sound a false alarm, at times without knowing the actual situation, or pelting the country's and the Armed Forces' leadership with collective letters. I don't think anyone will allow the collapse of the air defense. I want to congratulate all of those who serve in the PVO Troops, and the industrialists and contractors on their holiday, and to thank them for their selfless labor and devotion.
