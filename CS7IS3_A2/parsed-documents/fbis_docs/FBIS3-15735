Asked by the anchorwoman about the results of British Prime Minister John Major's visit to Nizhniy Novgorod, Nemtsov replies that this was the first such visit in the centuries-old history of Nizhniy Novgorod. No Western leader has visited Nizhniy Novgorod since 1221. Nemtsov continues that this is the first time that he has seen a person from the West coming not just with promises, but with a concrete program supported by concrete millions of pounds. This program includes implementation of three major projects in Nizhniy Novgorod. The first project concerns investments into enterprises which have gone through the stage of privatization, but found themselves broke. This project is expected to get 4.8 million pounds. The second program concerns specialists who do not have enough skills in market economy, but need them very much. This training program will be funded by about 1 million pounds. The third is a program aimed at establishment of something like an all-Russian automobile alliance in Nizhniy Novgorod. As for the political significance of the visit, Nemtsov believes that the British prime minister saw for himself that the money spent on technological aid to Russia was not wasted. The program of privatization of truck transportation and the land reform program have been developed with the support of the money provided by the British Government. Both programs are being implemented in Nizhniy Novgorod, and they will become models for all of Russia, in the opinion of the Russian government. Speaking about an expected visit of the Russian prime minister, Nemtsov says that Nizhniy Novgorod has been waiting for that visit for two years already, that he invites the prime minister every time he sees him, but this time it seems he will come to Nizhniy Novgorod on 10 March. According to the anchorwoman, the mass media has been writing a lot about an alleged opposition between Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin lately. As far as Nemtsov knows, there is no such opposition between them. Speaking about the recent visit of former Finance Minister Fedorov to Nizhniy Novgorod, Nemtsov says that Fedorov came at his invitation. He is a State Duma deputy and heads the commission for finances and banks. Nemtsov says that the purpose of Fedorov's visit was to get acquainted with the process of formation of local budgets, with the state of economy on the regional level, and to learn more about the work of commercial banks. In addition to that, Fedorov was interested in the notorious problem of the automobile building plant, because it was Fedorov who initiated the inspection at that plant. There was a presentation of the cellular phone system in Nizhniy Novgorod that day. Speaking about its importance for Nizhniy Novgorod, Nemtsov says that Nizhniy Novgorod is the first provincial Russian city that got the cellular phone system. First, it will provide a possibility to make calls from absolutely anywhere and get connected to any place in the world. Second, it finally broke through the monopoly of one phone service for many years. Third, he hopes the quality of service will be much better, because there is competition now. This is a very expensive service, but the city has paid nothing for it. Investments of a million and a half dollars have been made into the development of the communications system in Nizhniy Novgorod. Speaking about the lavish attention given to the forthcoming elections of a new mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod, Nemtsov says that it is understandable, because the mayor will head both the legislative and the executive branches of power in the city. The difficulty is that people will have to choose between two very worthy candidates -- Bednyakov and Krestyaninov. This is a very rare situation. Nemtsov says that Nizhniy Novgorod residents know both candidates very well, and they will be able to make their choice. He says that he knows both of them personally, and he will vote for Krestyaninov. The city faces very serious problems because of the developing process of privatization. Nemtsov believes that there should be very rigid control over that process and over those who are involved in that. That control can be exercised by deputies, the independent mass media, the opposition, and the authorities. Nemtsov thinks that Krestyaninov understands the significance of the organs of representative power, and he will have no problems with higher-ranking authorities either. Besides, obvious problems of the city, such as transportation, crime, roads, cleanliness, etc., which are not as attractive as opening ceremonies of exhibits, are the problems that should nonetheless be dealt with every day. Nemtsov thinks that Krestyaninov could do that efficiently and calmly. Besides, he says that he is a normal man, and he can openly say that Krestyaninov is his friend, he is proud of that, and people may consider it the main reason why he is going to vote for him.
