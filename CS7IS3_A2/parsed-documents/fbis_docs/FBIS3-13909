The House also condemned a U.S. statement that the Palestinian territories are disputed and not occupied territories. In a statement issued today, the House called on Arab and Islamic parliaments, as well as the parliaments of states upholding just causes, to officially protest against the U.S. position. The House said it strongly regretted the poor coordination of the Arab delegations at the United Nations, which contributed to this result. The House appealed to the kings and presidents of the Arab states to call for a summit in order to discuss the situation of the Palestinian and Arab people under occupation and shoulder their responsibilities toward the brothers who are being exposed to a continuous annihilation campaign. The House of Representatives expressed its appreciation for the steadfastness of the heroic Palestinian people and their legitimate defense of their lands and rights, emphasizing its support for these struggling people.
