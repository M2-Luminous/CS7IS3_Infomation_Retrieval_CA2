The semiconductor industry has become one of the leading players in the economy's upward movement, thanks to the expanding world chip market and the competitive edge of Korean chips in quality and price over their rivals on the world market. A semiconductor department official at Samsung Electronics Co. said, "the state of meeting 80 percent to 90 percent of our orders is continuing into this year. Our exports in January are likely to exceed the year-on-year rise of 80 percent we recorded a year earlier because exports in January last year were not very brisk." The automobile industry is also enjoying brisk business. A Hyundai motor official said his company's exports and domestic sales in January should increase 50 percent and 15 percent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis, though January and February are usually the off-season for the car industry. "We expect domestic sales in January to increase 25 percent from a year earlier, and I think exports will start increasing sharply in March though they were slow in January," said Kang Yong-ho, a Daewoo Motor board member. The improving electronics and automobile industries are pulling up the steel industry, as they are major users of steel. Yi Ku-taek, executive director of Pohang Iron and Steel Co., was happy about the improvement: "Business started improving in January, and we expect sales of steel plates and sheets to increase more than nine percent this year." The consumer electronics industry anticipates that it will achieve growth of 10 pecent to 15 percent in the coming year. "The strong yen and the resulting hardships facing Japanese firms, the U.S. market's recovery, labor peace, low oil prices and the stabilized exchange rate of the won against major foreign currencies will push up exports of consumer electronics goods more than 20 percent in 1994," Yi Pyong-song, a board member of Goldstar Co., predicted. Seoul's department stores, which ran a 10-day sale last month, expect to record sales growth of more than 30 percent in January. With the lunar new year season coming in the second week of February and the spring fashion sales in March, they anticipate no recession in 1994. The situation is just the opposite, however, in the traditonal marketplaces. Although lunar new year's day is only 10 days away, Namdaemun Market merchants are complaining that they alone remain mired in recession. A dealer in children's clothes said, "my sales these days are less than half of what I sold a year ago." The shipbuilding industry, which enjoyed a big boom last year, is not very optimistic about its prospects for the coming year. The industry has enough orders to keep it busy until the end of next year but the Japanese, who are striving to recapture their place as the world's top shipbuilders, pose a formidable challenge. Moreover, the cargo shipping industry shows few signs of expansion or a business upturn. Kim Yon-sin, planning officer of Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery, said, "we can hardly expect as good a business in the new year as we enjoyed last year. One of the reasons is that shipyards' excessive competition for expansion makes shipping firms put off placing orders for new ships until the race is over."
