Sergio Corrieri, the president of the Cuban Institute of Friendship With the People, has announced that Cuba has received approximately $50 million in donations through his organization. Donations were mainly in the form of powdered milk, school supplies, and medicine. Aid came from 72 countries, but more than the value of the merchandise itself, Corrieri stressed that it is the aid's "symbolism" that matters.
