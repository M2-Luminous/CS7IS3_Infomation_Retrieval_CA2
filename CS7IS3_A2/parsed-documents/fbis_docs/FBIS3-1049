The general secretary of the Conservative Party [CP], Dr. Lem Theron, has accused the MP for Schweizer-Reneke, Dr. Pieter Mulder, of seeking cheap publicity for the Freedom Front. He said those in favor of participation in the election had chosen a soft option and had entered the election in the hope of personal financial gain in what he called a communistic system of government. Earlier, the Freedom Front accused the CP of unilateral action, saying that certain individuals in the party had apparently found it necessary to put pressure on Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg. According to reports up to 10 CP parliamentarians could be standing in the election for the Freedom Front.
