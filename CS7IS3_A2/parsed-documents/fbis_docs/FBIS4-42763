The law does not contain anything that would not be acceptable to the SPD, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] politician said. Kanther indicated that he does not think anything of "unraveling" the package of laws and of adopting it one part after the other. Thus, Hesse, for instance, wants to deal with measures on combating right-wing extremism in a separate draft. The law must live up to its name, the minister stressed. It must be directed against all fields of crime, also against organized crime. Kanther said it is incomprehensible that the SPD should advocate the bugging of apartments "in an unsuitable procedure" but rejects the bugging of telephones "in a suitable procedure." Internal security cannot live with policy out of the party box. It should be kept out of the election campaign. Kanther said that he is watching the SPD-led laender's deportation practices with concern. The CDU politician sees the deportation of asylum-seekers who are not recognized as having a right to asylum as an essential pillar of the asylum compromise. He admonished Rudolf Scharping, SPD chairman and Rhineland-Palatinate minister-president, not to establish an independent regulation for old cases. Scharping should consistently stick to the asylum compromise, which was achieved across party lines. To have this compromise be even more effective, securing the borders remains a great challenge, the minister stressed. The border police are facing their most difficult task between Saxony and the Czech Republic. An agreement to return illegal immigrants, similar to the one with Poland, is in the offing. Obviously, the adoption of such an agreement has so far failed because of domestic problems in the Czech Republic. [passage omitted]
