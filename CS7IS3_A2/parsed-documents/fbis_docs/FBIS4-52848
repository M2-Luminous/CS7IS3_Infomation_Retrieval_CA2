The three-member inspection team, led by IAEA inspection chief (Hainamen), left for Vienna via China on the evening of 15 May, Korean standard time, and is due to arrive in Beijing at 0840 on 16 May. The inspection team, entrusted with the special mission to make on-the-spot confirmation of the nuclear fuel rods replacement, will make a stopover in Beijing and arrive in Pyongyang via Koryo Civilian Air on the afternoon of 17 May. During its stay, the inspection team will confirm on the spot whether nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon have actually been replaced. The IAEA will call off its inspection and pull out its team earlier than scheduled if North Korea has removed the nuclear fuel rods seals and replaced the nuclear fuel rods. However, if North Korea has just begun preparations for the nuclear fuel rods replacement, the inspection team will carry out inspection activities until 24 May. It will check seals and replace surveillance equipment at major nuclear facilities, and conduct additional inspections of the radiochemical laboratory.
