Tomorrow's Halle-based MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG reports German air force spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Eike Krueger as saying: "That is not planned at present." Apart from the ability to locate enemy aircraft movements and antiaircraft radar, and pass that information on to friendly aircraft, the AWACS planes can, according to information from the paper, provide close air support and reconnaisance. Krueger said that in the event of NATO air strikes, AWACS would not be used to carry out such an operation. However, he admitted that the system would continue to be active in the same way in the event of air strikes, thus supplying information for the operation. The presence of a tactical air control organization on the ground was however decisive for successful air strikes. The AWACS flights have been monitoring the no-fly zone over Bosnia declared by NATO since last April.
