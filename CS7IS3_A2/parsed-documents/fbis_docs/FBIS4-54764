Today Mr. Alatas was received by President Zhelyu Zhelev and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and met with the Deputy Chairwoman of the National Assembly Snezhana Botusharova. The lack of controversy between the two countries provides a basis for mutually beneficial economic cooperation, it was pointed out. President Zhelev asked Mr. Alatas to intercede with the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) so that the problem of ethnic Turks in Bulgaria be taken off the agenda, president's spokesman Valentin Stoyanov said after the meeting. President Zhelev explained that the issue had been taken up years ago and is no longer topical, as ethnic Turks in Bulgaria now enjoy full rights. It is a justified request; the memorandum I received from Foreign Minister Daskalov and my own impressions convinced me that the Turkish minority issue is no longer topical, so I believe the OIC can strike it off the agenda, Mr. Alatas told reporters. The issue will probably be tabled for discussion at the organization's next session which is to be held in Tunisia. The situation in the Balkans and particularly the fact that Bulgaria's closeness to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia poses risks which hinder foreign investment were also discussed by Mr. Alatas and President Zhelyu Zhelev. During his meeting with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov Mr. Alatas pointed out that Indonesian business circles display keen interest in Bulgaria. Several companies have already come here to set up joint ventures, the spokesman for the government Raycho Raykov said after the meeting. Indonesia's foreign minister discussed the development of parliamentary contacts with the Deputy Chairwoman of Bulgaria's National Assembly Snezhana Botusharova. They also discussed human rights issues and the free expression of the individual. Mr. Alatas praised Bulgaria's role as a stabilizing factor in the Balkans and pointed out that its economic stabilization will further enhance this role. Although my visit here was short, it was extremely productive, Mr. Alatas told a news conference before his departure. There are no controversies between us; what we have to do now is make the bilateral relations more meaningful, he added. Our purpose is to open the door to international cooperation, said his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Daskalov. During the meetings Mr. Alatas had with Bulgarian officials it was pointed out repeatedly that Bulgaria and Indonesia share a similar geopolitical position: They can both be used as bridgeheads to other regions. Indonesia could help Bulgaria approach the markets in southeastern Asia and Bulgaria could help Indonesia into the markets of the former Soviet republics and the Balkan countries, the two foreign ministers pointed out. "We should not restrict ourselves to bilateral cooperation; we should try to capture third markets together," Mr. Alatas said in conclusion.
