Pavel Sergeyevich, a great deal has been said over the past five years about the Afghan war. Many appraisals have been made, mainly negative ones. But, you know, even we journalists cannot speak confidently about the results and figures. After all, it is a matter of concern to many that the numbers of our losses, the numbers even of those who took part in the war, are still unknown. Maybe today, after five years, you, as Defense Minister, will lift that veil for us. [Grachev] Yes, after five years, we shall lift the veil, at last, from the tragedy that occurred several years ago. Esteemed comrades and friends in battle. One of the most dramatic pages in our history is now in the past -- a war that lasted a long nine years and 51 days. A war that even today does not allow our memories to rest and evokes pain in our hearts. Today's assessment of those events is well known. But no matter who describes the Afghan war and how he describes it, our casualties cannot be devalued, nor our wounds and illnesses, or the grey hairs of our mothers and wives. We Afghan veterans, and there are 545,000 of us, performed our military duty honorably, and we are beyond reproach. The servicemen in Afghanistan during that war were soldiers of whom the vast majority did not spare themselves and displayed true courage, heroism and loyalty to the military oath, to the people, to the Motherland. Nearly 200,000 of them have been decorated with Orders and medals; 76 became Heroes of the Soviet Union, including 26 posthumously. Today their names are known to the whole country. It is not our fault that the army had to pay with its own blood for the mistakes of the political leaders. So today, 15 February, we are marking the anniversary not of the withdrawal of the troops, not of any jubilee. Today is a day of recollection and a day of mourning for us. A total of 13,833 of our comrades-in-arms did not return from the Afghan war. The lamentable number of the overall losses in Afghanistan is also well known -- 14,454 people. Eternal memory and glory to them, the officers and men, generals, manual and office workers, security men, MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] personnel, advisers, doctors, nurses, and journalists. We shall remember them, bowing our heads low, for as long as our hearts shall beat. I call on you to honor the bright memory of those who died with a minute's silence. [crowd rises and observes moment of silence] Please be seated. Friends in battle, Afghan veterans. We paid a terrible price in that war. While carrying out combat operations on the territory of Afghanistan, 23,258 people were wounded, 26,798 people were injured, maimed or shocked, and over 400,000 suffered illnesses of varying degrees of severity -- mainly infectious ones. We have no right to forget that in Russia alone 4,500 people maimed in Afghanistan live alongside us. Over 7,000 people in Russia, Russian families, are in mourning for sons, brothers or fathers. It is our sacred duty, the sacred duty of Russia, to do everything possible so as not to leave the mothers and widows of those who died, and the orphaned children alone with their grief. I think that today we are once again obliged to pose the questions of the social protection, psychological and moral support of Afghan veterans in society, with full regard for their acuteness. Unfortunately, even today, someone is trying to depict the Afghan veterans as a ruined, lost generation. Such statements can only be made by people without honor or conscience. The Afghan veterans do not expect handouts or charity from anyone. Most of them have found a worthy place in society. They are working, studying, bringing up children, helping their friends in combat and, doing their utmost -- I'm not afraid to use a lofty word -- to build up and to help to reconstruct the country. But society must value them properly. It is necessary to step up the efforts to search for our servicemen and bring them home -- the prisoners of war, whose numbers are still put at 293. Practical, real business is essential in each specific case and in each destiny. I am addressing these words not just to the people of Russia, but also to the Afghan veterans who are today the citizens of other Commonwealth states. They number 320,000. Today our armed forces comprise some 30,000 officers and ensigns who trod the fiery roads of Afghanistan. They are a particular class of servicemen, and I want to give them a special mention. Today the Afghan veterans form the real nucleus of the new Russian Army. The armed forces are proud of them and draw on their experience of life and combat. They bring into the teams of servicemen a spirit of comradeship, mutual help and true service to the Fatherland. Their role is extremely high in educational and patriotic work and in dealing with welfare matters. As for the Afghan veterans' movement as a whole, we see in it a healthy force aimed at strengthening morale and the combat spirit of the army and navy, building up new armed forces, uniting and regenerating Russia. Dear Afghan veterans. Dear members of the families, near and dear ones. I wish you on this day cheerfulness, optimism, joie de vivre, good health and happiness - to you and those who are close to you. Thank you. [Shkirando] Thank you, Pavel Sergeyevich, The figures you have given are higher than those that were known previously, and it is, in general, surprising that it has taken five years to establish at least that truth. But, clearly, it is the fate of this war, as it is the fate of those who died there or who went through the war, that we find out the truth only years later. I personally am sure that this is not the whole truth either and that it has not been stated in full.
