Guangdong, one of the economic giants of China, has reported year-on-year increase in absorbing foreign investments, which reached 9.65 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, with a large part coming from Hong Kong and Macao. Statistics show that Macao's investment in China's mainland totalled 4.3 billion U.S. dollars and Macao-funded enterprises reached 2,300, most of them are located in Guangdong Province, especially the Pearl River Delta area. As of the first quarter of 1994, Macao businessmen have set up more than 780 joint or solely-funded firms in the neighboring Zhuhai special economic zone. These firms are mainly involved in textile, electronics, medicines, food production, cloth-making and real estate industry. Meanwhile, there are also a great number of enterprises from Guangdong which have invested in Macao to set up enterprises, contract projects, run real estate or export and import businesses. Their total investment in Macao stands at about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. Moreover, trade between Macao and Guangdong has also developed rapidly in recent years. In 1982, some 40 percent of Macao's exports to China's mainland went to Guangdong Province, while the figure increased to 80 percent in 1992. Additionally, some 40 percent of Macao's imports from China's mainland came from Guangdong.
