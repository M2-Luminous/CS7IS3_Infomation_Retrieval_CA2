The Security Council, the United Nations should take additional measures to guarantee safe areas in Bosnia, including, naturally, Sarajevo, and "exclude the possiblity of continuous cease-fire violations in the region," the minister said. If there are exchanges of fire, attacks on places where UN forces are deployed, where they are carrying out their tasks, the command of UN forces appeals to the organization's secretary general who, after a vote in the Security Council, makes the appropriate decisions on supporting them, including aerial support, that is, on the possibility of launching an air strike to defend the UN contingent in Bosnia, the Russian minister continued. "Our position is immutable," Andrey Kozyrev stressed. It's another matter, he noted, whether such military support needs to be 'obtained' in every specific case, at every specific moment. This question still remains open. But Russia does not exclude aerial support in principle, since it is provided for directly in the Security Council resolution, which Moscow voted for. Three weeks ago, the Russian side put forward the proposal to reinforce safe areas and to take additional measures, the minister recalled. "Unfortunately, it took the tragedy at Sarajevo market (I want to express special gratitude to CNN, thanks to whom the world learned of the horror) for our partners to be concerned about reinforcing safe areas, for the United Nations, the Security Council, the UN forces to step up their participation in resolving the problem," he noted. "I want to reiterate that an air strike is not excluded in principle, but for that to happen, the UN forces on the spot should raise the specific question, on a specific situation, and the UN secretary general will make a decision in coordination with the members of the Security Council." Speaking of the proposals by the ministers of foreign affairs of France and Germany for Russia to join in the settlement plan, Andrey Kozyrev said that these proposals were the basis of the plan of the European Union. This document contains many elements which were discussed by the minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation and Klaus Kinkel, and which Vitaliy Churkin, Lord Owen and Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the London conference on the former Yugoslavia, are working on now. The United States has now put forward its proposals for seeking a peaceful settlement. As far as the NATO ultimatum is concerned, the minister noted, this decision by NATO accords with the Security Council resolution, the part which provides for involving individual states or regional organizations (in this instance, NATO) in aerial support, if the UN command on the spot appeals for help to defend its personnel. "There is no point in joining this," Andrey Kozyrev thinks, "but we said immediately that the NATO decision contains elements which the Security Council resolution does not spell out, at least clearly." Heavy artillery is not enumerated, nor are the UN forces' functions to take heavy arms under control, while this is mentioned in the text of the NATO decision. We think, the minister continued, that the decision on the UN forces should be made by the UN Security Council. And the letter by the organization's secretary general says that the United Nations will instruct its forces to carry out certain functions, and NATO's proposal to defend these forces accords with this. The letter says that the UN mandate must be clarified. The minister recalled that he wrote two letters to the UN secretary general on these questions even before the UN ultimatum on the need to reinforce the functions of the UN forces, to defend safe areas. Had it been done earlier, CNN might not have had to show the tragedy at the market in Sarajevo. But in this case the point is not competition, or priority, but acting together, without any claim to the truth, to bring the matter of a settlement to a conclusion. We all now have to work in the Security Council, the Russian minister said, and in Geneva on the "Sarajevo group" (of issues), that is, to address the problems of withdrawing heavy weapons and strengthening the security zone, and on guarantees, including, if such a specific need should arise, "perhaps, also carrying out air strikes." The second group of issues, he continued, is the actual Bosnian settlement. Speaking of Russia's position on the Bosnian settlement, Andrey Kozyrev pointed out that the essence of the problem lay in the fact that Bosnia will have to be divided, while preserving the framework of a single state, into parts that are quite independent according to the ethnic principle. There are various options for division, he said. One of them is the well-known Vance-Owen plan, now there is another -- simpler and easier. The point is that Russia and the European Union have elaborated a plan which determines the division of Bosnian territory between the three sides. We are pressing these sides to agree to a compromise in solving territorial questions. Until recently the United States did not join us, the minister said, it did not give us full support, displaying restraint in this matter. But now Washington supports the plan and is pressing all three sides in the conflict to agree to a compromise. "In the main we have been working with the Serbian side," Andrey Kozyrev said, and Germany with the Croatian, and there was a kind of "missing link" -- the Muslim side. Maybe the United States could exert a certain pressure and work with the Bosnian Government. This is why, the minister believes, it is good news that Washington is joining the efforts of the European Union and Russia in trying to reach agreement. "As concerns the Russian side," Andrey Kozyrev said, "we will continue what we were doing before -- cooperating with the European Union and the United States in seeking a peace settlement in Bosnia." Talk about air strikes is leading some representatives of the Bosnian sides to be tempted temporarily to postpone making a decision on a settlement, and to direct all attention to the problem of air strikes, the Russian minister stressed. Unfortunately, this talk is stimulating some people in Serbia itself, since they understand that in military terms such air strikes will be quite limited, but in moral terms it frees their hands for various kinds of military campaigns and actions. The Russian minister said in conclusion that for the defense of UN forces "air strikes may be used, if the UN forces themselves ask for this, as it must not be allowed for peacekeeping forces to be left defenseless, and not only in Bosnia, but also in Somalia, Abkhazia and other places. This is why we are taking such a cautious attitude toward the idea of air strikes, as this distracts world attention from the search for a political settlement in Bosnia."
