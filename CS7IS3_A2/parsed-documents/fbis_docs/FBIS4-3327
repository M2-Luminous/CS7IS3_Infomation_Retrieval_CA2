The exchange held a seminar in Beijing, at which it introduced itself to Chinese business leaders and explained how firms can list their shares on the London market. The seminar attracted officials from some large firms, securities companies and banks. The exchange showed its commitment to working with the Chinese by sending Nigel Atkinson, head of listings, to the conference. This followed the March visit to Beijing by the chairman of the exchange. The British delegation, which arrived last Saturday, had a series of detailed discussions with Chinese securities authorities. Atkinson described the talks as very constructive. "It is still in an early stage, but I believe the willingness on both sides will take the talks forward," he said. The discussions were aimed at briefing Chinese authorities on the regulatory requirements of the exchange, he said. The London group will also find out if Chinese firms have any special requirements, he added. "We are conscious of the special requirements in Hong Kong," Atkinson said. "We need to make a study as to whether we need to do something similar in London." He added that his side wants a formal agreement signed to ensure the Chinese understand stock exchange rules. And the China Securities Regulatory Commission is expected to come up with a formal memorandum. Atkinson said the number of Chinese firms seeking overseas listing will group rapidly in the coming years. "We feel it is very important for London to respond to the need as an international stock market," he said. A number of Chinese companies have already expressed interest in listing shares in London, he said. But before they formally apply to London, they need approval from Chinese authorities. "We are waiting for our turn," he said. "We hope it will be soon and the capital market in London is very keen to participate in Chinese is sues." The central government has selected 22 domestic firms for possible overseas listing this year. Most of them will be listed in Hong Kong with some in New York or London. Atkinson said Chinese firms which will arouse international investors attention have substantial growth potential. And they will need good long-term prospects, he said. If Chinese firms want to list their shares in London, the first thing to do is to appoint a sponsor familiar with that market, he said.
