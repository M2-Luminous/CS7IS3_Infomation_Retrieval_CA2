FBIS4-9522 "dreeu082_y_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-082 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Federal TANJUG: 1.5 Million on Brink of `Poverty' TANJUG: 1.5 Million on Brink of `Poverty' LD2604123794 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1108 GMT 26 Apr 94 LD2604123794 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Belgrade, April 26 (TANJUG) -- The U.N. sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have brought to the brink of social poverty at least 1.5 million citizens by forcing them to seek Red Cross humanitarian aid. One of the parameters of the drastic overall impoverishment of the Yugoslavs, either left jobless by the sanctions or with considerably lower salaries, is the fact that 95 percent of parents of under-age children are unable to provide school snacks. Regular check-ups in Belgrade schools alone have shown that as many as 1,100 children suffer from undernourishment and aenemia, while many cases of fainting from hunger have been recorded. This is why the Red Cross of Belgrade last month began distributing meagre snacks to all pupils in Belgrade which has the biggest number of schools in the country. Over 500,000 families, i.e. at least 1.5 million people, have so far registered for relief aid with the Yugoslav Red Cross. This is a drastic rise in the number of socially threatened citizens compared to two years ago, when the U.N.imposed sanctions against Yugoslavia and when 62,583 families (or 142,608 people) had asked for humanitarian aid. Demands for opening soup kitchens are arriving from all parts of the country. Owing to the efforts of the International Conference of the Red Cross (ICRC) the Yugoslav Red Cross managed to set up some one hundred soup kitchens which distribute 4,500 meals each day. Today Yugoslavia has over one million unemployed, and those who have work cannot secure the minimum living conditions for their families. Monthly wages are barely sufficient for ten days as the price of the consumer basket by far exceeds the monthly earnings. On January 24 the Yugoslav Government introduced a new economic program of monetary reconstruction and economic revival. In the two months of its implementation, the living standards of the citizens gradually began growing and the hyper-inflation, which had soared to world record highs, has been stemmed. Despite this, the U.N. sanctions have put the majority of Yugoslavs, even those who are still employed, in the category needing humanitarian aid.
