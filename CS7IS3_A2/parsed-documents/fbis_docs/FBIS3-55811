Estonia should get back Ivangorod, the area around the Narva river, and Pechory. But the majority of Estonians hope that a solution will be found which is acceptable to both states. The newspaper POSTIMEES drew this conclusion on the basis of a sociological poll carried out by the "Emor" company. Specialists questioned 1,000 people. These were on the whole young Estonians (16-24 years of age) and elderly Estonians (65-74 years of age), who stated that it is necessary to reinstate the Tartu (Yuryev) Peace Agreement and the border between the countries which it established. According to the paper, those with a low level of education favor the prewar border. Estonians with higher education and Estonians living in the republic's northeast come out in favor of a compromise solution for the border problem.
