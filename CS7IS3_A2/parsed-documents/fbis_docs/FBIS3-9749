A two-day HZDS conference, which opened here yesterday, elected today Olga Keltosova HZDS deputy chairwoman in charge of social welfare area and Sergej Kozlik HZDS deputy chairman in charge of the economy. Ivan Lexa was elected HZDS executive secretary. After the election of the new HZDS leadership, Meciar told journalists that about half of the delegates spoke in favour of the movement's transformation into a party, while the other half was against. He said the HZDS programme described HZDS as a future "pragmatic centre party." A lot will also depend on the development of other parties, Meciar said. The current withdrawal of experts and a part of members from the Democratic Left Party (SDL) gave the HZDS a chance to gain influence among the Social Democrats, he added. HZDS leading official Ivan Laluha said the issue of HZDS orientation had not yet been settled and added that he himself favoured social democratic orientation. Referring to Slovak President Michal Kovac, Meciar said: "I can only state that political culture is not a strong point of the Primacialny Palace (the seat of Slovak President)." He said that after a letter which Kovac sent to the conference yesterday was read, delegates whistled. "There was no one clapping their hands, but many were whistling," Meciar said. In the letter, Kovac said he did not want to hide the tension between him and Meciar which had gradually grown into open attacks on Kovac. In Kovac's opinion, it was not a personal but a social and political conflict which had a negative impact on the developments in Slovakia. Meciar said that the HZDS was coming to the conclusion that Kovac and his office would be tripped by what they had done to Meciar and his cabinet. "They will slowly come to realise -- it is a question of days or hours for them to figure that out -- that this is the way it is and that they will have to fight hard for themselves," Meciar said. He went on to say that the HZDS would not consider legitimiate new leaders of the Supreme Inspection Office (NKU), to be elected at a forthcoming parliamentary session, and would not acknowledge them as constitutional officials. The NKU leadership was dismissed by the new coalition government at the latest session of parliament. Meciar said this ran counter to the constitution. He stressed the HZDS would reject the coalition-announced offer that the HZDS fill the post of NKU deputy chairman. Meciar described as shaky the position of the present Slovak government of Jozef Moravcik. He said the HZDS "was familiar with curricula vitae of the government members" and that government discussion on its programme could already indicate something. HZDS deputy chairman Sergej Kozlik told reporters that the priorities of a new HZDS economic programme were pro-export policies, qualified protection of the home market, rapid privatisation and revival of financial channels and agriculture. He said he had "great" reservations about work of the present government in the area of home market protection. Kozlik said Moravcik's cabinet had launched a frontal retreat from positions which the cabinet of Vladimir Meciar "had worked out in considerable detail" with relation to the Czech Republic and other countries.
