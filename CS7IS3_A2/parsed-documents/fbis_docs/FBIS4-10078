FBIS4-10078 "drlat067_i_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 Nicaragua Deputies on Drug Trafficking, Money Laundering Deputies on Drug Trafficking, Money Laundering PA0604194894 Managua Sistema Nacional de Television Network in Spanish 0200 GMT 6 Apr 94 PA0604194894 Managua Sistema Nacional de Television Network in Spanish 0200 GMT 6 Apr 94 Spanish BFN [From the "National Newscast"] [Text] With approval of the new narcotics law being debated by the National Assembly, Nicaragua will establish the legal framework for combating drug trafficking more efficiently, but the law alone is not sufficient, Deputy Carlos Gallo, chairman of the Human Rights Committee, has said. We need resources and assistance even from the U.S. State Department. [Begin Gallo recording] The State Department can help in obtaining assistance for Nicaragua's police apparatus to combat it. You know how precarious the National Police budget is. [end recording] The law is also being drafted to fight money laundering, which has not taken hold in Nicaragua. [Begin Luis Humberto Guzman, Christian Democratic Union deputy and National Assembly president, recording, in progress] ...the report does not review the volume of financial transactions in Nicaragua's banks. We could not necessarily talk of money laundering; at least not for now. [end recording] Nicaragua has not reached the level of drug trafficking of other countries. [Begin Guzman recording] Perhaps Nicaragua's only implication is that its territory and air space are used as a drug-trafficking and transshipment point. [end recording] The law may be passed in the next four weeks. Controversial topics will be DEA operations in our country and the extradition of nationals, something our Constitution bars.
