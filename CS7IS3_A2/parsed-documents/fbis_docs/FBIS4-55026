Mr. Secretary General: Your envoy for Yugoslavia, Mr. Yasushi Akashi, has, with his latest actions, destroyed the minimum of trust that is a precondition for any kind of cooperation. Our people and the international public have for a long time been witness to his strange and incomprehensible techniques in handling the basic issues of war or peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In our view, his conduct and decisions regarding the crisis in Gorazde are clearly contrary to the corresponding Security Council resolutions and NATO decisions. They have helped the aggressor to maintain his machine for killing people and destroying cities. In granting permission to Karadzic's Serbs yesterday to allow the passage of tanks through the zone strictly forbidden for heavy arms, and securing an escort for these tanks to be moved to new positions, Mr. Akashi has effectively sided with the aggressor. I am sure that no well-intentioned person, including his closest associates, can understand or explain Mr. Akashi's conduct. It is no wonder that the Serbs are ignoring the decisions of the international community if its official representatives fail to observe them. The result of such conduct is an endless continuation of the war, which has entered its third year in this region, and an increasing remoteness of any chances for peace. Mr. Secretary General, it is my duty to inform you that these reasons make it impossible for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government to continue to cooperate with Mr. Akashi. Respectfully yours, Alija Izetbegovic
