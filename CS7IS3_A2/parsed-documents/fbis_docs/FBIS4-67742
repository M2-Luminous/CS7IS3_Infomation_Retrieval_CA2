Such publications "are clearly aimed at destroying mutual trust, and at aggravating relations between the signatories of the Convention banning biological weapons," he said at a briefing in Moscow. Karasin noted that Russia as legal successor of the USSR took all responsibility for the implementation of the 1972 Convention, including the functions of a guarantor of this document. Under the trilateral agreements between Russia, USA and Great Britain, mutual visits to biological facilities and exchange of information continue between the sides. Karasin also said that Russia is in favor of the creation of a control mechanism for the implementation of the Convention. A special conference on this issue will be convened in Geneva in September.
