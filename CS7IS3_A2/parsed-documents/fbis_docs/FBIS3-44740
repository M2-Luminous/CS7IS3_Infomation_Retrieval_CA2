The mainland's request to invite a Hong Kong Government civil servant to Beijing to explain the airport management plan was advanced at a meeting attended by Chinese officials and Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. However, the request was immediately turned down by the British Hong Kong authorities on an excuse of there is no need to establish another channel of communication. Responding to the refusal from the Hong Kong Government, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, said the Hong Kong Government failed to offer any convincing argument for the refusal. Construction of the Hong Kong new airport is one of the matters stretching the change-over of power in 1997. Therefore the draft airport corporation bill should be discussed through consultation between the Chinese and British Government, Zhang said. The PWC shoulders the responsibility of studying issues relating to the smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong. It is logical for them to invite an official from the Hong Kong Government to explain the airport bill, he added. Zhang stated that the draft airport corporation bill was published under the demand of the Chinese side to seek opinions from local residents. He said he is expecting that the current invitation of public opinions would be done in real earnest instead of making a gesture.
