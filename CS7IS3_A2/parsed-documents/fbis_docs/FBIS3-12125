Attending the meeting are the 18 commanders in chief of national navies and a member of the Inter-American Defense Board. At issue are different topics of interests for different Navies. The commanders will meet with President Lacalle during the week. The agenda includes contributions by each delegation and provides for some of the issues to be discussed behind closed doors. Vice Admiral James Coates, the Uruguayan Navy commander in chief, confirmed that a meeting with the president is scheduled for midday on 24 March at the Punta del Este Yacht Club. He said: "The National Navy will present two issues. One refers to the inter-American war games, a technical issue of minor importance compared to the second issue: the South Atlantic Maritime Area. Uruguay for the first time is hosting the organization's coordinator." Coates said the organ "is a maritime traffic control organization that has existed for many years. Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina are members." He said: "The issue is very important, not just for us, but for all other Navies as well. It is the only case in the world of cooperation between Navies from different countries on such an important issue as maritime traffic control. This is a military issue which has many implications that go beyond the military sphere of influence including ocean contamination, the control of oil spills, the control of fishery plundering actions, arms contraband, drug trafficking, and similar items. All these topics come under the chapter of maritime traffic. This is the first time four countries have cooperated on something as important." Regarding the commanders' meeting with Lacalle, Coates said: "The president has had the courtesy to invite all the participants to a luncheon during which we will probably exchange ideas on different issues with the representatives of the Navies of the Americas."
