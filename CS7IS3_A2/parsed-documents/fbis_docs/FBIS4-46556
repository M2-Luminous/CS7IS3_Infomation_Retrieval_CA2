[End box insert] The state of affairs in the defense complex presently is one of the questions demanding the most careful attention of society, specialists, lawmakers, and the executive department. We recall how for several years it was impressed on the country that the military-industrial "monster is devouring taxpayers' money, squandering labor, energy and resources" and so on. But then economic reforms and avalanching conversion burst forth (Americans ooh and aah over five-percent reductions and conversion of military production, but for us they are measured in tens of percentage points in a year). In 1993 compared with 1991 the production volume of arms and military equipment was 21.7 percent, capital investments and RDT&E financing volumes were halved, and the export of military products decreased by more than three times. What Did Reforms Give Us? It is without question that the militarized economy needed reforming, but let us have a look at whether or not the federal budget deficit dropped after the engagement with the so-called monster, and in essence with ourselves. Who in the country began to live better and who was helped by debts and advances unpaid to the defense establishment, by insufficient funds of defense and of the budget of financed products, and by interest on enormous credit discount rates? Is structural perestroyka under way? How are conversion programs being fulfilled? Why did the country reject the billions of dollars it could have received from export deliveries? Is it possible to underfinance the Army with defense capability and sociopolitical consequences in mind? Finally, how did it happen that the state and government began to consider it permissible for themselves to take away products of the defense establishment, but not pay for them, or to specify a state order, but not pay an advance for its fulfillment, not index the working capital of enterprises, and so on? Answers to these questions are provided by life itself. Here are the facts. Quite recently the number of defense enterprises and organizations exceeded 1,800 and employed 4.5 million persons (including 800,000 in the sphere of science). If we figure in the "family" factor, then this is 12-15 million persons. The defense industrial complex includes over 70 so-called monofunctional city-plants with an isolated production and life support infrastructure. One does not have to be a state figure to understand that reforming such a complex without losses (present and future) for the country's defense capability and without social shocks for people or at least with minimum losses is a task not just for a single year. But what is happening in the defense complex today has no logical explanation. There is another side to the question. A significant portion of defense design bureaus, scientific research institutes, and plants having unique technologies, equipment and cadres already were supporting production of consumer products long ago. In 1993 the proportion of civilian products put out by defense enterprises was 78.3 percent of the overall volume. It seemed clear to everyone that conversion programs also require large investments of funds, but it very often happens that enterprises, having prepared 50, 70, or 90 percent of production capacities for output of consumer goods, do not receive the remaining money from the state to begin production. Private capital also is in no hurry to invest. The majority of directors say with substantiation: we work and attract, but neither the domestic nor the foreign entrepreneur comes to us and hardly will come in the next few years! Help can be expected from nowhere except the state. To sum up briefly, no positive results are seen from past reforms, with little exception. On the other hand, devastation in the defense complex and the increased potential of technological, structural and sociopolitical dangers are quite evident not only from the standpoint of defense capability, but also for the country's sociopolitical situation as a whole. It Is Very Costly To Economize on Defense The extremely serious situation in defense sectors of industry at the present time is the result of an avalanching reduction in military expenditures, an avalanching conversion, which reached 80 percent, and a monetary system utterly wrecked by mutual non-payments, by credit and debit indebtedness, by a delay of payments for fulfilled orders on the part of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and other clients, by late payment of conversion credits and subsidies, by the lengthiness of noncash banking transactions, and by an absence of working capital. As of 1 January 1994 the indebtedness of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, i.e., the state, was R1.217 billion and that of customer enterprises was R770 billion. Because of late payment of the state defense order, enterprises of the defense complex were forced to pay R400 billion from budgetary funds for use of bank credit, basically to commercial banks. Overall indebtedness for payment of wages is up to R200 billion. The price increase on material resources and energy carriers of almost 11 times compared with 1992, the significantly lesser price increase (by 6.6 times) on manufactured products, and also late charges brought the majority of enterprises to the verge of bankruptcy--artificial bankruptcy, we will note. The number of workers at enterprises of Goskomoboronprom [State Committee for the Defense Industry], 4.5 million, dropped by 500,000 over the last three years basically because of an outflow of highly skilled cadres. The drop in the number of associates of many scientific research institutes and design bureaus was from 30 to 50 percent. Experimental, test and range facilities are in a depressing state. There has been a sharp reduction in the scope of tests and experiments being carried out. At least 1.2 million persons from defense sectors may be let go in 1994 because of a reduction in budget appropriations, including around 400,000 from the scientific sector, which will lead to irreversible consequences for the defense complex. The 1993 state defense order for certain kinds of arms and military equipment busied only 10-15 percent of production capacities. The order fell below the minimum permissible level for many kinds of articles, and as a result this is leading to degradation and loss of high-tech industries. Thus, appropriations for 1991-1993 were reduced by almost 8.3 times for military RDT&E and by more than 5 times for civilian RDT&E. A further reduction in appropriations both for purchasing arms and military equipment as well as for RDT&E is envisaged for 1994, which in particular will permit only paying debts for 1993, paying for products manufactured during January-March 1994, and paying for reserve property. No funds remain for the rest of defense products envisaged by the state order for 1994. The 1993 state order has been fulfilled only by 47.9 percent and the actual financing of military RDT&E in 1993 was around 30 percent. Financing for these items is envisaged at the 20-22 percent level in 1994. As a result of such actions, entire directions for development of combatant ships, special communications systems, combat subsystems and military aviation elements will be terminated, work to create a reserve of advance scientific work essentially will cease, work to develop military science and technology as a whole will stop, and creative scientific-design collectives formed over the years will break up once and for all. The bill "On the 1994 Federal Budget," introduced by the Russian Federation government and approved in the first reading by the State Duma, provides for allocating defense expenditures at the level at which existing Ministry of Defense indebtedness essentially equals the volume of allocated funds. Enterprises will not even be on starvation rations for essentially the two remaining quarters... In evaluating the situation professionally, members of the State Duma committees for Defense, for Industry and others cannot agree with the proposed draft budget. There also is a positive attitude of the President of Russia toward bringing corresponding expenditures for the defense complex to the minimum permissible. Amendments to the second reading of the law on the budget have been prepared and the Duma should approve them, while at the same time taking a tougher approach to forming the income part of the budget. Not Just the Manufacturer Is Responsible for the State Order The astounding system of interaction of state, government as a whole and Ministry of Finance which has been revealed, particularly with the defense complex, demands changes. There must be real responsibility (right up to judicial liability and dismissal of responsible government persons) for ensuring fulfillment of the state defense order and financing it. Under market conditions the system of placing the state order must become competitive for enterprises of all forms of ownership, with guarantees of necessary profitability and concessions on the part of the state. In the absence of working capital (there also is a presidential edict on this subject), all work must receive a mandatory advance. It is necessary to determine the rank of the government [kazennyy] defense enterprise and compile a list of these enterprises. The rest should be relieved of exorbitant overhead expenses and the system of mobilization reserves should be revised. The formula in this case is simple. If the state cannot finance, release the enterprise and perhaps it "will provide for" itself. But now even the state order is sent down and no advance at all is given! Laws "On the State Defense Order," "On Mobilization Reserves" and "On the Government Enterprise" are about to be adopted. These laws are in the Duma's portfolio of bills. The law on the state defense order is in the June plan. The time has come to revise export policy. Not only would many defense enterprises be able to survive, but they would be able to develop successfully even with minimum export deliveries. A law on military-technical cooperation with foreign states is needed. The task is to return lost markets and currency earnings to Russia. Of course, each problem touched upon is a subject of independent analysis. On the whole, however, it is clear that Russian reforms of the economy cannot be carried out by cutting off the branch on which we sit. After allowing a sharp slump in industrial production, in profits and in taxes into the budget (budget incomes in the first quarter were around half of those planned), it is now impossible to find money to pay for these same reforms. There are no grounds to expect outside investments as well as investments of private and banking capital in the next few years. This means it is necessary to restore the base nucleus of industry and not allow a further production slump. An adjustment of economic policy in the country is necessary. The State Duma and its specialized committees are working in this direction, but the legislative process is not rapid. Operational management decisions and adjustments to the economic course in the country are up to the government and the president. It must be hoped that the long awaited expeditious actions on problems being discussed today also finally will follow.
