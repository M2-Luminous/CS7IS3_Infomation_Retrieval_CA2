Through argumentation, it has got the pressure released to some extent and now some pressure has been diverted to India too which was not the case before. Talking to THE NATION and NAWA-I-WAQT on Friday, he said by the grace of God "we are fully capable of defending the country and military-wise our country is in strong hands. In this connection, no one should have any misunderstanding, nor does anyone need to worry about that." Commenting, he said the present government has realised the importance of defence and has provided the required funds. Both the Prime Minister and the Chief of the Army Staff are fully aware of the situation. That is why, no cut has been made in the defence budgetary allocations. He said if need be "we are ready to ask the nation for donations for country's defence." Emphasising unity, he said it strengthens the defence. But the nation is not united to the extent it should be. There are two methods of getting the defence strengthened: first, to increase the military capability and, second, by increasing friends at diplomatic and political levels. "Sometimes you achieve a goal diplomatically which is difficult militarily or otherwise." However, he said, one cannot deny the importance of military might. "This is because you have more friends when you are powerful and the country which is weak economically and militarily cannot make many friends." He said the present political situation demands that "we get united". National unity is very important he repeated. No country can endeavour to establish peace single-handedly as this is the responsibility of all the countries of the region. Whichever proposals Pakistan has given for peace have been appreciated by all the countries, Iran, China and even the U.S. has declared it a positive approach. But India has not liked these suggestions, he added. "If India does not like our proposals, it should give its own." India should bring its proposals at the negotiating table, he said, adding that "we want permanent peace in the region as much as does someone else." He said the impression that "we the atomic scientists are against peace is wrong." Any general or atomic scientist loves peace as much as others do. Coming to the Kashmir issue, he said Pakistan wants peaceful solution to the issue. Pakistan has given some proposals for establishment of peace in the region and now it is the duty of India to respond positively. Answering a question on Kalabagh Dam, he said the apprehensions and fears which some people have must be addressed Changes in the designs of the project and other such matters [word indistinct] introduced with the consent of all the concerned, but this matter should not be politicised. Those having objections to the plan should make their objections clear and those who are responsible to remove these should do that. He said instead of politicians the debate on this project should be given to the experts. Besides, no hurdles should be created in this plan. He said it is generally believed that this dam should not be built, for it would result in some loss. Whereas the other opinion is that this plan is very much in the nation's interest and, accordingly, it should be started at the earliest. He said when a big project is started, some people do get affected. The construction of Tarbela and Mangla Dams also affected many but it also benefited the entire nation. The government paid the compensation to the affectees. He said the power crisis can be overcome by setting up nuclear power stations. He revealed that fresh round of talks between Pakistan and France on atomic power plant is about to commence. France promised to give Pakistan that plant. Later on, it did not fulfil its promise due to certain reasons, "I think we have the right to get that plant and I hope negotiations would start soon which would prove useful." He said there is no denying the fact that there was much pressure in the past as regards its peaceful nuclear programme. But the stance of Pakistan has forced those pressurising elements to see the reality, Pakistan has always adopted the stance that it should not be discriminated against as far as the atomic programme is concerned. Rather both Pakistan and India should be treated alike. Further, Pakistan's proposal to declare South Asia nuclear-free region was appreciated by all with the sole exception of India. Pakistan has clearly stated that it favours nuclear proliferation. [sentence as published] But this is something Pakistan cannot do alone. If this aim is to be achieved. India too would have to be convinced. He said Pakistan rejected any unity lateral pressure on it because of which the supply of F-16s has been suspended although Pakistan has paid for the aircraft. Even then Pakistan did not compromise on its national defence. "Had we compromised, the aircraft would not have been withheld and supply of other military aid too would have started again. "We think the present government has got the pressure released through its logics and now some pressure has been diverted to India." He said getting any country's atomic programme frozen and linking it with foreign aid can in no way be declared in line with the UN Charter or international demands. Every country has the right to utilise all its resources to ensure its defence. However, if a formula is chalked out to ensure international peace, it should be applied to all the countries without any discrimination. India increased its defence budget. It is a big country. What danger does it have? It has no threat from any other country. It has increased its defence budget only to establish its regional supremacy. But the old ideas to establish supremacy have died out as even small states can make their defence strong against big countries. He said Benazir Bhutto and COAS [Chief of Army Staff] Gen Abdul Waheed are fully aware of the situation. That is why, no cuts have been made in the budgetary allocations for defence. Had India reduced its defence budget. Pakistan too had an option. The attitude of the government, its foreign policy, the steps it took as regards Kashmir and the decisions taken by the political and military leadership are correct. He, however, said the present steps being taken for the scientific and technological development are not enough. "We have to do much more in this connection." Dr Qadeer observed the energy crisis has not surfaced overnight. There are many reasons behind them. As such, it cannot be overcome overnight. Particularly the economic and energy crises cannot be redressed overnight. The common man thinks about what the previous governments have done in this regard. Had some concrete steps been taken at the very outset, the situation would have been different. Its a good sign that the present government had initiated some plans for energy. But energy crisis would take some time. He said even the Ministers do not want to take the portfolios of Science and Technology. "This shows how much interest we take in this field. Fund collection is no problem." Like other benefit shows, one can be arranged to better the economic conditions of the country too, he concluded.
