Representatives of five Solidarity regions have come to Labour Ministry to fix the date for talks between the government and the Solidarity national commission. According to the unionists their arrival to the Labour Ministry resulted from Thursday's televised speech of Minister Miller in which he invited Solidarity for talks. In an adopted statement, the unionists said that the fact that Minister Miller failed to show up means that the "government's declaration concerning its readiness to dialogue with Solidarity is simply a sheer lie. That is why the government side is taking on responsibility for what would happen in the country," the statement reads. When the unionists were about to leave, Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski appeared and said that the government's actual readiness to negotiate had been checked. He added that the protest action headquarters is to meet in Katowice on March 13 to discuss possible changes to the protest action schedule for next week. He announced that the protest action can escalate if the government does not start talks with the union. The unionists were received by Deputy Labour Minister Andrzej Baczkowski who said that the government does not see any justification for conducting separate talks only with Solidarity. He explained that Minister Miller invited Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski to talks on social guarantees and work within the tri- partite commission for socio-economic issues. On Friday minister Miller was paying a visit to Slupsk where he met with representatives of local governments and the unemployed. The unionists represented extracting, metallurgy, power and arms industries.
