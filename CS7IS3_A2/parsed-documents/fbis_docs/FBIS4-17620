At present, the re-stationing of armed militants, belonging to the movement of the Islamic Party of Tajikistan's Revival, continues in northern provinces of Afghanistan, and in particular, in the Badahshan Province where modernised military formations are arriving. Military sources say that a large group of militants has concentrated in the Afghan settlement of Baharvk. The aim of the group is to destabilise the situation in the Pamir border area and cross into Tajikistan. Tajik anti-government militants are being assisted by high-ranking Afghan military officials. The command of Russian border guard troops in Tajikistan jointly with Tajik government troops are taking additional measures to prevent armed provocations in border areas controlled by the Ishkashim and the Horog border guards units. Border guard posts have been reinforced in the most vulnerable border areas.
