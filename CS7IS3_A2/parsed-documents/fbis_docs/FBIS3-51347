One of the oil pipelines, which goes from the oil wells in Cano Limon in the eastern part of the country to the Caribbean port of Covenas, was dynamited by the pro-Cuban National Liberation Army (ELN) in the northern Department of Cesar. The pipeline, which is 780 km long and has the capacity to pump up to 250,000 barrels of crude oil, suffered a breakdown, which caused 5,000 barrels to be spilled and a subsequent fire. In addition, there is serious ecological destruction that is being controlled by Ecopetrol emergency technicians and workers. So far this year it is the fourth attack on the Cano Limon-Covenas Pipeline, which has been the target of attacks by the ELN. Last year the ELN blew it up 39 times. Meanwhile, the Colombia Oil Pipeline, which pumps crude from the northwestern Department of Antioquia to the port of Covenas, was damaged by an explosive device in Remedios Municipality, Antioquia Department. The oil pipeline, the second most important one in the country, has been blown up three times this year. Last year it was attacked 10 times by the ELN. The aforementioned guerrilla group's attacks on the oil pipelines are part of its "war" on President Cesar Gaviria's oil policy, which the rebel group believes is hurting Colombian interests.
