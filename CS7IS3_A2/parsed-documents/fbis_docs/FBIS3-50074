ZERI also reports that the mandates of deputies, elected two years ago in the Albanian elections in Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija], will be verified at the session. In a statement for this paper, the Albanian politician Adem Demaci commented on this information and said that the Serbs have held 12 multiparty elections in the past 12 years [figures as received], while the Albanians went to the polls only once. Rexhep Qosja, the most influential Albanian intellectual, said that if Serbia allowed the session of the republic of Kosovo parliament to take place, this would confirm his earlier assessment that the organizers of the elections and the Albanian parliament were actually Quislings. Let me remind you that the first attempt to hold a session of the phantom republic of Kosovo's parliament in the Pristina-based Alaudin school [medresa Alaudin] was prevented by the police because there was a chance of this event provoking a rebellion of the Albanian separatists in Kosovo and Metohija.
