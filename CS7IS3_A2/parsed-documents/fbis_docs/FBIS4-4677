The number of items and descriptions related to Japan has increased from the previous year and occupies a large portion of the report. It can be said that the report clarifies the Clinton administration's trade strategy urging Japan to open its markets wider. Certainly, Japanese markets are still bound by many government regulations and the principle of competition is not fully being carried out in Japan. The relationship between the government and the private sector lacks transparency. Also, complicated business practices still exist. Reforming the economy's structure is a top priority task for Japan to open up its markets wider. Japan should voluntarily and actively remove trade barriers to imports of both quality and less-expensive goods as well as services before other countries demand that it do so. The removal of such trade barriers will help maximize the effect of the yen's appreciation, bring benefits to consumers, and help develop world trade. In this sense, Japan should listen to the voices of other countries hoping to gain access to Japanese markets. However, it will be a different story if the United States unilaterally imposes sanctions, such as retaliatory tariffs, if its demands are not met. The USTR report provides a basis for application of the Super 301 provision of the U.S. Trade Act (which outlines steps for retaliation against trade partners' unfair practices) that was reinstated by Clinton's executive order. The USTR will specify by the end of September the countries and market fields that are subject to the application of the Super 301 provision. This year's report covers all topics negotiated in the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, including Japanese Government procurement of telecommunications equipment. It is expected that if no agreement is reached in the framework trade talks, the United States will seek solutions in individual sectors by threatening sanctions under the Super 301 Provision. Needless to say, unilateral sanctions in line with the Super 301 provision will run counter to the agreement in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks to be signed in mid-April. Asian and European nations have urged Japan to open its markets wider. But they are also very critical of the U.S. strategy of threatening sanctions in trade negotiations. We hope Washington will reconsider its strategy. What Japan and the United States should do now is to resume the suspended framework trade talks. Japan has recently announced the "outline of external economic reforms," which is inadequate but a step forward. We hope opinions and criticism should be exchanged at the negotiating table. We believe that this is the way to create a new relationship of trust. Recent remarks and actions by U.S. officials, including the USTR annual report, are full of assertions that past Japan-U.S. agreements have yielded almost no results. Such assertions could be aimed at urging Japan to implement bold market-opening measures. Even so, they will cause misunderstanding among the peoples of both countries. We should refrain from overreacting in each case, but we think the recognition of facts should be done more accurately. For example, beef imports increased 1.9 times and orange juice imports 4.3 times between 1988 and 1992. Artificial satellites have all been procured from the United States since the signing of a bilateral agreement. There are more examples. As such, Japan-U.S. economic relations never remain stagnant.
