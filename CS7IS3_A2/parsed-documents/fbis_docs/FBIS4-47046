The adoption in May 1993 of the Tatarstan Republic Law on Emergency Measures To Fight Crime has enabled us to concentrate efforts on the implementation of measures used in the fight against crime. To achieve this end, R839.7 million was allocated from the city budget and rayon budgets in 1993. Some 79 additional vehicles and means of individual protection were acquired for the city militia. The Sovetskiy Rayon Internal Affairs Directorate building was put into operation. Efforts continue to institute supplementary militia divisions and provide them organizational staffing and equipment. The numerical strength of the Kazan Garrison increased by 1,200 individuals last year, enabling our law enforcement organs to carry out their duties in the intensified operating mode. In addition, it is planned this year to allocate more than R2.5 billion to law enforcement activity. The Tatarstan Republic Law on Emergency Measures To Fight Crime has been an important factor in improving the crime situation in the city of Kazan. Energetic efforts by the criminal-militia services are being directed against the "authorities" of the criminal world suspected of having committed grave crimes. Forces of the Kazan Militia Garrison have conducted inspections, jointly with the Tax Inspectorate, of commercial structures controlled by various criminal groups. About 500 violations of various kinds--from tax evasion to the sale of spurious alcoholic beverages--were uncovered. In all instances, measures were undertaken to file appropriate charges against the violators in accordance with the law. Implementation of the Law on Emergency Measures To Fight Crime have enabled us to put a halt to the growth of crime. According to 1993 results, the level of crime in the city decreased 5.0 percent (from 22,209 to 21,074). Over the first four months of this year, crime was reduced 9.8 percent from the level observed during the same period of last year, while the number of crimes solved increased by 20 percent. At the same time, analysis of the program's implementation shows that there have been a number of defects in its execution. Development of a system of private investigative agencies is not reflected in the package of urgent measures. Some grave crimes, including crimes against the individual, remain unsolved. Personnel turnover in the Kazan Militia Garrison is such as to have an effect on the overall growth of professional skills and the state of official discipline. Inadequate attention is being devoted to the prevention of crimes committed by intoxicated persons and juvenile delinquents. There is no system for publishing and distributing law enforcement literature for the populace. A number of issues pertaining to public education and health care remain unresolved. Regulation is lacking with respect to the kiosks, stores, and other places where alcoholic beverages are sold. A number of these are located in direct proximity to children's and educational institutions. Proceeding from the above statements, the Kazan City Soviet of People's Deputies RESOLVES: 1. To take into consideration the information on the course of implementation of the "Package of Urgent Measures To Fight Crime for 1993-1995." 2. That the head of administration of the city of Kazan (K.Sh. Iskhakov) shall continue its efforts to further implement the "Package of Urgent Measures To Fight Crime in Kazan for 1993-1995," taking into account the proposals and observations expressed by deputies in session of the city soviet of people's deputies. 3. That the Standing Commission for Observance of Legality, Legal Protection of Citizens, and Safeguarding of Law and Order shall: 3.1. Continue to monitor execution of the "Package of Urgent Measures To Fight Crime in Kazan for 1993-1995." 3.2. Develop and submit for ratification by the presidium, jointly with the city administration, measures for implementation of the proposals and observations expressed during discussion of the issue in question. 4. To ask the Tatarstan Republic Supreme Soviet to extend the term of effectiveness of the Law on Urgent Measures To Fight Crime, prior to adoption of legislative acts by the Russian Federation to intensify measures in the fight against crime. 4.1. To present an initiative to the State Duma of the Russian Federation on adopting a law to stiffen liability for carjacking, racket operations, and theft of personal property. 5.

Akbarov) shall ensure that militia personnel comply with provisions of the law in the execution of their official duties. 5.1. To direct that additional proposals be drawn up on the establishment of a system providing operational communications between citizens of the city and organs of the militia. 6. Responsibility for the course of implementation of this resolution is entrusted to Deputy Chairman of the City Soviet N.N. Rybushkin. [Signed] Chairman K.Sh. Iskhakov
