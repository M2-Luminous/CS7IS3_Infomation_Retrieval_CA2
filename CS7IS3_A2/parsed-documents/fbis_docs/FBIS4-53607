FBIS4-53607 "dreas099__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-099-A Daily Report 20 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo To Seek `PKO Center' at ASEAN Forum Tokyo To Seek `PKO Center' at ASEAN Forum OW2205032794 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN in Japanese 20 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2205032794 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The government has decided to announce--jointly with Indonesia and Australia--a proposal on setting up a "PKO [Peacekeeping Operations] Center" in the Asia-Pacific region at the "ASEAN region forum" to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, in late July. The PKO Center will enable the ASEAN forum participating nations to conduct joint exercises on UN-required PKO, and exchange information relating to them. The government will present this concept first at the high-level working meeting for the ASEAN expanded foreign ministers' conference to be held in Bangkok 22 May. Explaining the decision to propose the inauguration of the PKO Center, a Foreign Ministry source noted: "With the Cold War ended, the international community is now in quest of a new world order. Meanwhile, there are increasing conflicts and confrontations over territorial, ethnic, or religious issues, and there is a growing need for PKO." What the PKO Center is hoped to achieve is: 1) to enable PKO personnel to improve mutual communications by conducting joint exercises, thus enabling them to have smooth relations with each other at the PKO sites; 2) to enable the Asian nations to have a better understanding on the Japanese Self-Defense Forces' participation in PKO; 3) and to enable the Japanese Government to gain information on the areas where PKO are ongoing or are expected to be undertaken, thus providing useful information to Japan--which has to meet five conditions to participate in PKO under law--in making decisions as to whether it should or should not take part in certain operations. As far as the government is concerned, it also hopes to get public agreement domestically on the question of the country participating more actively in PKO, and thus hopes to use this opportunity as an stimulus in getting the current PKO Law revised next year. The law bans the country's participation in UN peacekeeping forces (PKF). The forthcoming ASEAN forum will turn out to be the first security talks in the Asia-Pacific region, and member nations of the ASEAN extended foreign ministers' conference and other countries, such as China, Russia, and Vietnam, are expected to attend. The holding of the forum was agreed on at the last session of the ASEAN extended foreign ministers' conference. The most important purpose for the forum is for the participating nations to exchange views on security situations, and to gain mutual trust among these nations. As a specific way to build up trust among the nations, the Japanese Government wants to propose setting up the PKO Center, and also to discuss the topics of ensuring transparancy in defense policies by requiring the nations to issue defense white papers, and holding meetings of defense-related personnel and conducting mutual exchanges. Japan will be represented by Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa at the forum.
