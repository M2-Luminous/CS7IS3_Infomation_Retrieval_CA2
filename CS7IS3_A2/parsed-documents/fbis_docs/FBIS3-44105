That association says that some 60 people perish in jail every month because of the subhuman conditions they face. Many succumb to physical brutality, others because of physical exhaustion caused by terrible hygiene conditions in jail. In a report it published recently, the Angolan Human Rights Association noted that there were many detainees who had not been charged but who were serving long sentences. No health care is given, even though serious and contagious diseases are common in those jails. In the third quarter of last year, an Assembly of the Republic team visited the jails and found the situation there to be cause for much concern. At the time, that team promised to work to improve the situation, but nothing has changed so far. According to a source here in Jamba, that situation benefits the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, whose idea it was to order the construction of those jails.
