He stated that the provincial conscription work has completed the first three phases of public announcement and registration, education evaluations and physical examinations and now we are entering the phase of political investigations, induction and transportation. In order to guarantee that the conscription assignment levied on our province by the State Council and the Central Military Commission is completed on time, safely and according to high quality standards, in the coming days we must focus on both the quality of the new conscripts and on honesty in conscription and acceptance work. He stated that focusing on political quality is of extreme importance and each level of the party committees, the government, the military organs, public security and the grass roots organs have the responsibility to carry out a responsible political investigation of the newly selected conscripts, and must resolve to not induct or to accept even one new soldier not meeting the political criteria. In order to guarantee the quality of the new inductees and the honesty of the conscription and acceptance process, this aspect cannot be slighted in the least. When the key moment of decision is reached, supervision must be augmented; in conscription and acceptance, both sides must accept supervision; the military service organs must accept supervision by the masses. All persons who participate in conscription and acceptance work must be honest and self-disciplined, accept no personal favors, take no bribes, make no promises, and create an environment of equal competition for those being conscripted. Make a good impression on the minds and hearts of the masses; by words and actions, give the new recruits their first lesson in honest government. Commander Zhang also specifically made the point of requesting all levels of the military services and the discipline inspection departments to handle the communications and visitations of the masses conscientiously, but people or situations which seem to take advantage of the conscription process to thwart or transgress discipline should be investigated thoroughly, and miscreants punished severely. At the same time, conscientiously handle the ideological work associated with the youths and the parents of the youths who answered the call but were disqualified or eliminated because of numerical restrictions; cherish and preserve their willingness to voluntarily offer themselves for the cause of national defense.
