In any case, acrimonious may be the kindest term that can be applied to relations between Paris and Washington today. Given the tone used by the French and the Americans in lecturing each other on political ethics, one finds it hard to believe that this is a dialogue between two allies, two friends. Paris is convinced that those who are today blocking the peace process painstakingly elaborated by the Twelve are the Muslims, encouraged by the United States, which has been sustaining the hope of an illusory Western intervention. Such is clearly the opinion of the French foreign minister, who has asked the Americans to exert pressure on the Muslims. As a result, a suitably incensed Washington has reminded the apparently oblivious France of decency's imperatives. Any pressure should be exerted on the Serb aggressor, not on the Muslims, who are the victims. In other words, the Americans do not mind a continuing war as long as moral standards are preserved. The oratory contests stemming from this basic disagreement are only a symptom of the malaise that permeates an international community confronted with its obvious inability to put an end to the bloodiest conflict Europe has known since 1940. While France, together with its European partners, has spared no effort in its attempt to achieve a negotiated settlement, it can only recognize today that every initiative it took was ultimately a failure. As for America, the only country able to muster the necessary means for imposing peace on the three warring factions, its primary concern has always be and still is to avoid being drawn into the Bosnian bloodbath. Thus heaping charges and countercharges upon each other, Paris and Washington look like an old couple bickering over its reciprocal shortcomings. However, the slightly sordid quarrel may in fact be no more than a convenient smoke screen. Since neither the French nor the Americans or their European Union and NATO allies agree on what must be done, it necessarily follows that nothing will be done. Which is exactly what all of them want. One must be resigned to the fact that the end of this war is as far off as it ever was....
