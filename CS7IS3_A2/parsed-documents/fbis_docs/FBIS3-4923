The delegate of the measure committee for compensations to the "comfort women for the army" and victims of the Pacific war said that all documents and materials concerning the "comfort women for the army" were carried to Japan at the time of its defeat. "The attempt of the present Japanese Government to keep its past crimes in darkness, while concealing all the materials in its possession, is a mockery of human conscience and an insult to the victims," he said. The delegate demanded that Japan open all the materials on the crimes to the public, punish the criminals by law and make sincere compensations to the human rights victims. The delegate of the World Council of Churches said that sexual enslavement by the Japanese Army, an encroachment upon human conscience and morality, can never be overlooked. He demanded that Japan sternly punish those responsible for the issue of "comfort women for the army" and make proper compensations to the victims. He called upon all the non-governmental organisations to join in the cause of defending human morality and conscience with a united action. The delegate of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation demanded that the Japanese Government bear responsibility for the grave crimes against mankind and take practical measures for a fair solution of the problem. Kim Won-ung, democratic member of the South Korean "National Assembly," charged that the South Korean authorities and the Japanese Government were taking an insincere and deceptive stand toward the settlement of the problem of "comfort women for the army". He said the "comfort women" issue denotes a heinous and inhumane war crime and criticized the attempt of the Japanese Government to hush it up.
