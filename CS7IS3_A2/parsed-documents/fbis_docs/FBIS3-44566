Liu Shuqing, president of the Chinese Institute of Foreign Affairs (CIFA), held a working meeting with the delegation this afternoon, during which the two sides exchanged views on the improvement and development of Sino-U.S. bilateral relations. The current visit is designed to explore the prospects of expanding trade and co-operation in the field of energy, and exchanging views on a variety of issues such as trade in military products, nuclear proliferation and issues related to China's most- favored-nation status. As CIFA's guest, the delegation is a continuation of a series of visits by groups of U.S. Senators who have toured China since last August, and is the first delegation to visit China since the Sino- U.S. summit in Seattle between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton, a CIFA official said. Among the delegation are seven Senators, including the Senate's minority leader, Alan Simpson. The delegation is the biggest yet to visit China from the U.S. Senate, the official said, and senior Chinese leaders will meet it before it leaves for Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong Province.
