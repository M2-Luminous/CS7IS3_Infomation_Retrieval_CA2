This was stated by Heinrich Hornef, financial director of the Trust Agency, in a talk to correspondents in Berlin. So far, only two companies have been taken over by banks. In addition, the Trust Agency has received four specific declarations of intent for taking over Trust Agency companies. Serious examinations are still under way for 10 to 15 companies, Hornef said. If one takes DM20 to DM40 million each as being needed to improve the companies, 30 to 50 companies should be sold. Within the framework of a "last reserve," the Trust Agency will once again offer 50 to 60 appropriate firms for examination by the banks. In deviation from the original concept, minority participation has also been offered. "Our imagination will not be insufficient regarding the use of the DM1 billion. The Trust Agency is ready for unconventional solutions," Hornef said. As one of the reasons for the low success of the bank DM1 billion, Hornef cited differences in opinion about the portfolios of the companies. At first, the Trust Agency wanted to offer the companies in portfolios consisting of 10 to 25 companies each. The banks, however, insisted on individual negotiations. Hornef accused the institutes of having reacted too slowly and inflexibly as a whole. In 1993, two company portfolios with 32 companies were sold to the banking sector outside the Solidarity Pact. Without Trust Agency involvement, land banks took over 13 east German companies for a total of DM150 million. Of the 214 companies, which the Trust Agency offered to the banking sector and of which most were sent back to it, the Berlin Agency has meanwhile sold almost 100 to other interested persons.
