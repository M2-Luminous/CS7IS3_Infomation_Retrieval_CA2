Each design is subject to acceptance by REA. (2) Housing types and capacities. (i) Housings used in outside plant are either the smaller housings generally known as pedestals or larger housings known as equipment or splice cabinets. Both categories may have designs intended for stake mounting, pole mounting, or pad mounting. (ii) The classifications of pedestals are the general purpose channel Type (H) and the dome Type (M). The Type H pedestal has either front only access or back and front access while the Type M pedestal has top only access. Pedestals are further designated as follows: ␣ 1Stake mounted 1Type 1Pole mounted 1Pole mounted (extra high) BD3 H BD3A BD4 H BD4A BD5 H BD5A BD7 H BD7A BD14 M BD14A BD14AG BD15 M BD15A BD15AG BD16 M BD16A BD16AG (iii) The minimum volume associated with the pedestal designations shall be as shown in the following table: ␣ 1Pedestal1 housing designation 1Minimum volume 2Cubic centimeters cm3 2(Cubic Inches) (in.3) BD3, BD3A 2 9,000 (550) BD4, BD4A2 15,000 (900) BD5, BD5A2 35,000 (2,100) BD7(2) 72,000 (4,400) BD14, BD14A, BD14AG3 9,000 (550) BD15, BD15A, BD15AG3 27,000 (1,600) BD16, BD16A, BD16AG3 38,000 (2,300) Note 1: Housings designed for unique purposes will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Note 2: For Type H pedestals, the minimum volume is that space as measured 5 centimeters (cm) (2 inches (in.)) below the top of the housing to a point 40 cm (16 in.) above the bottom of the lower cover plate. Note 3: The minimum volume of the Type M pedestals shall be the space within the dome measured from the lower edge of the dome to a point 5 cm (2 in.) from the top.
