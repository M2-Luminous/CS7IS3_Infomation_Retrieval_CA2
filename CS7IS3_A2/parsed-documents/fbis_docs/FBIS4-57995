[Reporter] What is your opinion on the results of the Sandinist Special Congress? [Pereira] It is important for the country's future development to show political stability. This is why it is very important [words indistinct] of the parties to show the rest of the world that Nicaraguans have a (?common vision) of the country and that we all want the same thing for this country. The results concern us [words indistinct] because, basically, one current imposed itself on another. In one way or another pluralism [words indistinct) future development of democracy in Nicaragua [words indistinct] is not clear with these results. More than anything, the radical sector, which seized the key positions, has had a marked influence. [Words indistinct] the government's economic and social policy. To a certain extent this [word indistinct] because the economic and social policy followed by the government has been aimed mainly at correcting mistakes of the past and dismantling a number of things, such as controls on domestic commerce and foreign trade, bank monopolies, and the concentration of businesses in state hands [words indistinct] reverse many things that the previous government had done. Given that the previous government was headed by Daniel Ortega, who now heads the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN], as determined by the Special Congress, he obviously tends to oppose our actions because we are [word indistinct] many things they did. I have, however, said publicly that Daniel Ortega was going to face a very difficult situation. If the FSLN does not change -- although he has this opportunity and his party gave him this new responsibility -- in the long term the FSLN might not survive. If the party changes [words indistinct] direction of what the government has been doing; that is, that savings are valuable, taxes are paid, credits cannot be given away. An economy based on subsidies [word indistinct] in Nicaragua or elsewhere in the world. We must transfer productive resources from the public sector to the private sector and reduce consumption to increase production [words indistinct] there are simply no resources to meet all that demand. A responsible political leader must tell [passage indistinct]. Thus, my opinion is that there is some concern because the current that [words indistinct] needed to help Nicaragua move forward [passage indistinct] there will be contributions to this country if there is a change within the FSLN. If it does not change there will be no progress [words indistinct] for the good of Nicaragua. [Reporter] Dr. Pereira, in his speech Daniel Ortega called for three things: promoting a national movement to win the 1996 elections, defending revolutionary achievements, and confronting the government's neoliberal policies. [Pereira] I think that it is important that there exists in this country the political desire to win the upcoming elections to [words indistinct] of this country. The great [words indistinct] of Nicaraguans is that the fate of this country has been in the hands of extremists [words indistinct] if we continue to leave the fate of this country in the hands of extremists. The church itself, in its recent pastoral letter, called on all citizens to participate in politics [words indistinct] power fell in the hands of extremes in Somozist and Sandinist times [words indistinct]. As for the neoliberal policy [words indistinct] we are promoting a market economy. In the modern world, unfortunately, the market economy model and the [word indistinct] is the model that will create employment in a sustainable manner and will reduce poverty [words indistinct] in these modern times would be deceitful [passage indistinct]. As for the achievements of the FSLN, I think that [words indistinct] among the poor, but for that to happen conditions must be created to produce material goods and wealth. Many of the great achievements of the Sandinist process [words indistinct] based on Socialism. During their 10 years in office that government spent more than it received in revenues. When a government spends more than it receives, it makes society poorer. It is not possible to [words indistinct] of the poor when society was made poorer for consecutive years. Only when the government spends less than it receives in revenues will it be able to [word indistinct] society. Thus, the way to combat any problem [words indistinct] that there be austerity and savings, that the size of the public sector be reduced, that the productive sector be programmed differently, and above all, that there be contributions to the attainment of political stability. In this country [words indistinct] of those who burn tires and stage uprisings, is to deceive the people. I recently read a report on the situation in the rural sector related to how the previous administration's economic program caused a real disaster, specifically in the condition of rural women. I am convinced that this is why they lost the elections. The entire population, and mostly women, are aware of the unfortunate consequences that could come about when the country is continuously subsidized, there is ceaseless paternalism, and it is treated like a small child. We recently visited several San Carlos communities, and it was quite refreshing to listen to the people say that they were not interested in any type of subsidies or handouts and that all they really wanted was an opportunity to work. This can be accomplished through an economic model such as the one we are currently promoting. This is the same case throughout most of the rural sector and also as it relates to women. These sectors are aware that the practice of granting largess and subsidies does not lead [words indistinct]. In concluding, I would like to say that I believe that, regarding economic policy, the only thing we can learn from the previous administration is exactly what we should not do. Nevertheless, that does not solve the problems of the most needy sectors; you are all aware of this. Regarding FSLN economic policies, it is quite clear that there has been no encouragement to attract investments, and this is not something the government says. This has also been a major Sandinist failure. On the social side, there has also been a lot of cosmetics. Therefore, looking at things objectively, I believe that those of us who are involved in the dialogue are aware that there is an opportunity for Daniel Ortega. If he simply starts to promote a policy of sustainable growth based on [word indistinct], then I believe that he can truly contribute. If he changes his practice of promoting violence, aggression, and confrontation, then he can definitely contribute. This will also be the case if he makes promises based on concrete arguments and not vague [words indistinct], then he can most definitely contribute. If changes are made in the right direction, he can obviously contribute enormously, and the Nicaraguan people will be thankful. Now, regarding the elections, my forecast is that they definitely stand no chance of winning. The Nicaraguan people still remember quite clearly. Obviously the FSLN still has a long road to travel mostly to recover its identity, if not its unity. However, this does not mean they do not possess an identity. Identity entails having a clear economic program on what can be done to contribute to the country's development. So far, the only thing that has happened is that they have blocked this country's development. We still have to see what they can do to develop this country.
