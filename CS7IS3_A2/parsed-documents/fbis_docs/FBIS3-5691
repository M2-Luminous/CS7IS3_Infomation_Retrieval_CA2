A widening gap and amplified discord among the coalition parties are the net result of his bungled attempt, which he suddenly brought forward after returning from a Japan-U.S. summit. "Hastiness" stalks the prime minister. Still fresh in our memory is his aborted "national welfare tax" concept. Having made one blunder after another, he must take full blame for causing so much confusion in politics and state affairs. When he first expressed his desire to reorganize the cabinet, we questioned the propriety of a reshuffle at a time when he faced imminent deliberations on fiscal 1994 budget, which contains, as its main pillars, economic measures designed to overcome the recession. It does not surprise us that he ended up having to forgo his bid. It is true that there are precedents where cabinets were reorganized after the compilation of draft budgets, but in those cases the draft budget process had invariably been completed in December, leaving ample time before budget deliberations began in the new year. In Hosokawa's case, had he reshuffled the cabinet on 3 March, he would have had only one day before his scheduled 4 March policy address to the Diet. In addition, newly appointed ministers without adequate knowledge would have had to answer questions from the opposition parties on draft budget items compiled by their predecessors. That certainly would have brought the severe criticism that the prime minister had treated the people and the Diet with contempt. Given the fact that he faced so many obvious pitfalls, it is hard to understand why he sought to ram through his initiative. The prime minister tried to explain that a reshuffle was necessary to secure a line-up of ministers to form a cabinet devoted to economic reform that should constitute his next central objective now that political reform has essentially been achieved. It sounded reasonable. However, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who was asked by the prime minister what he thought of the reshuffle plan, disclosed that the prime minister asked him "to move to another post because of strong criticism against him (from within the coalition)." However, it was evident that the prime minister's "abrupt" move for a reshuffle was simply to "oust Takemura." Moreover, it was also obvious that this scheme had its origin in Shinseito representative secretary Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yoichi Ichikawa, rather than the prime minister himself. Ozawa and Ichikawa are in rivalry with Takemura and their opinions are becoming far apart. Observers agree that it was, in fact, not only a power struggle over whether the future political map should consist of two major parties or a "tripolar" arrangement, but also a difference in their political styles and a personality conflict. Although we respect the prime minister's exclusive prerogative to hire and fire his ministers, we question his inclination toward one party. It is said that fiduciary relations between Hosokawa and Takemura have loosened since the confusion over the failed "national welfare tax" proposal. If the rift between the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary -- who is supposed to be his closest confidant -- is widening, they may have to "negotiate a divorce." Although it is a prime minister's exclusive right to reshuffle his cabinet, Hosokawa, as leader of a coalition government, should have enlisted the views of the coalition parties and reached a consensus before moving for a reshuffle. He must remember that he is driving a coach drawn by "eight horses," and he must handle the reins with extreme care if he wants to stay in his seat. We urge Prime Minister Hosokawa to go back once again to the starting point of the coalition government.
