BBWR's leadership announced a transformation of the group into a political party. The final decision will be made at a congress of the organization which will be held in the fall. BBWR's First Program Conference was supposed to work out a concept of political and economic changes in the country but in practice, it showed dilemmas that the entire group is facing with the upcoming elections for the post of president of the Republic of Poland. That BBWR's concept is different from that of the President's Office, is best demonstrated by the fact that practically nobody from among high ranking Belvedere officials took part in the substantive debate. When asked about BBWR's candidates in the upcoming presidential elections, Professor Zbigniew Religa replied laconically: As long as Lech Walesa does not make a decision to run, there is nobody we could support. But if our economic concepts are substantially different from the president's program principles, then we will propose our own candidate. A program for Poland -- which was debated during the Krakow session -- covers, among others, a draft of a new constitution based on a presidential-parliamentary system of power, speeding up of self-governmental reforms, enfranchisement of citizens in the form of a complete and popular privatization, defining the state's position on foreign capital taking into account the interests of national economy, as well as devoting higher amounts of money to the education system and civic education. Professor Jerzy Eysymontt, chief of the BBWR Parliamentary Club, was asked by NOWA EUROPA about whether economic slogans declared during the election campaign proclaiming 300 million zlotys for each citizen, are still valid. His response was: We are in favor of a popular enfranchisement, and everything that leads to a complete privatization of the economy will be supported by us, and that is why we still think that the 300 million zlotys which we proposed in the election campaign, is a slogan under which important parts of the national wealth should be transferred over to citizens.
