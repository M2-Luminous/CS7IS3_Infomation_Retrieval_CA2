Li made the remarks when meeting with GATT Director-General Peter Sutherland this afternoon in Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the State Council. The Chinese premier said that China's foreign trade is developing in tandem with the growth of the country's gross national product. Preliminary estimates show that the annual import and export volume will reach 400 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000, he added. China will continue to import raw materials and primary products which are in short supply in China while importing more technologies and equipment, Li said, and the prospects for China's economic cooperation and trade with foreign countries are promising. The premier said that China's bid for re-entry into GATT is a result of the country's reform and open policies which have been implemented since the late 1970s. China's foreign trade regime has basically met GATT requirements through its economic reform in more than a decade, he said, and China will observe the rules of the Uruguay Round and shoulder corresponding duties, while enjoying its due rights. He said that China is willing to resume its GATT membership at an early date and will make its greatest efforts to realize the target based on the principle of balance between obligations and rights. Yet, he stressed, whatever efforts China makes must be in line with the level of its economic development. Li cited China's signing of the final act of the Uruguay Round and the agreement on the establishment of the World Trade Organization as a good demonstration of China's determination and sincerity to re-enter the world multi-lateral trading system. The Chinese premier expressed his thanks to the director-general and the GATT Secretariat for their support for China's re-entry into GATT. Sutherland said that he was very much impressed by China's efforts and sincerity in the process of negotiations on its re- entry, and he appreciated China's courage in its reform. The GATT chief said he had always believed that China should be brought into the world multi-lateral trading system. It will substantially benefit both China and the world if China bases its foreign trade regime on the rules of the multi-lateral trading system, Sutherland said. China's fast economic growth based on controlled inflation is not an easy target, he said, and he expressed hope that China will make greater achievements in future economic reform.
