Sola has asked the Foreign Ministry to "urgently" convey a protest to the Mexican Government, and to demand that the measure be revoked. On 16 February the Mexican Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources Secretariat banished the import of rice, wheat, garlic, and peanuts from Argentina for health reasons, although this decision was not officially reported to Buenos Aires. In a communique Sola stated: "We are confronting a serious nontariff restriction to commerce, which sets a very bad precedent for future commercial relations." He said: "The argument of plagues and diseases is nothing new for Argentina, and the measure is technically groundless considering that most of them also affect Mexico." He added: "Mexico imports these products from other countries such as the United States, which is also stricken by the same plagues." Sola believes that "the Mexican Agricultural Secretariat's attitude is dishonest" and added: "I cannot understand either the measure or its implementation, as under the same criteria Mexico should have already suspended the import of a great number of products from the United States." He noted that should this measure persist, the export of rice, peanuts, and garlic projected for this year will be harmed. The measure worsens the situation for wheat because of the U.S. and Canadian decision to subsidize its sales.
