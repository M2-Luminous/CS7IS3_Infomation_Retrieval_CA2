Nemchinov, Moscow; UDC 533.72:535.233] [Abstract] The principal problem arising in the study of subsonic radiative wave propagation under the effect of laser radiation, i.e., finding the mechanisms of its propagation, measuring its velocity, and establishing the wave structure, is addressed on the basis of numerous published sources. In particular, a steady-state model with nonequilibrium radiation, numerical calculations of the problem of plane subsonic radiative wave propagation, steady-state model of an ultraviolet laser-supported subsonic radiative wave, the dependence of the subsonic ultraviolet laser-supported radiative wave parameters on the radiation flux, two-dimensional subsonic radiative waves, the quasi-steady subsonic radiative wave propagation conditions, the effect of the irradiation spot radius, the effect of the radiation nonuniformity, and the effect of the thin reduced-density channel are considered in detail. The conclusion is drawn that such laser pulse parameters as the pulse duration, power, and wavelength and the properties of the gaseous medium surrounding the obstacle are the determining factors in the laser-supported radiative wave propagation. The analysis is based on the analogy between the propagation of optical discharges and combustion and detonation of flammable substances. Figures 7; tables 2; references 45: 44 Russian, 1 Western.
