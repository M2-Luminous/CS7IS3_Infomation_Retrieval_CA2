FBIS4-64822 "drweu089_q_94010" FBIS-WEU-94-089 Daily Report 4 May 1994 TURKEY Columnist Warns Army Chief To Stay Clear of Politics Columnist Warns Army Chief To Stay Clear of Politics NC0605184094 Ankara TURKISH DAILY NEWS in English 4 May 94 p 3 NC0605184094 Ankara TURKISH DAILY NEWS English BFN [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "Generals Should Stick to Their Duties"] [Text] Very recently we commented that Gen. Dogan Gures, the current chief of staff of the Turkish Armed Forces who will retire in the summer of 1994 due to the official age limit of 67 and because he has completed four years in office, should not be speaking on domestic issues and should keep away from daily politics. Ever since our comments appeared in the Turkish Daily News we have received much support from all quarters. As a matter of fact, new developments came to the surface regarding Gen. Gures which only proved our point. There were rumors that Gen. Gures attended a dinner recently with businessmen and there he allegedly made comments about the formation of a new government dominated by technical experts. The news broke when Culture Minister Fikri Saglar, the new secretary general of the coalition partner Social Democrat People's Party (SHP), told a newspaper that Gen. Gures should disclose whether or not these claims were true. This development came amid reports that Gen. Gures was seeking new ways to have his term of office extended for another year. There were also reports that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller also wanted such an extension. At a separate press conference Saglar also said the SHP was against the extension of the term of office of Gen. Gures and the commanders of the Navy and Air Forces. So the General Staff made a statement on Sunday [3 May] saying the military was not the body to set up governments in Turkey. The statement also said laws and regulations were clear about the appointment and retirement of military personnel and called the press reports absurd. Yet those of us who remember how coups come and go in Turkey and the controversial way the chief of staff's term in office was extended last year amid cries of foul play were not too impressed. Actually the chief of staff himself could not remain silent despite the General Staff statement and had to make rather awkward statements which showed either his lack of knowledge of a true democracy or his lack of interest in it. Gen. Gures criticized Saglar and said the politician did not know the state hierarchy. He said the extension of the term of office of force commanders was made when the chief of staff made an offer and the minister of defense, the prime minister and the president approved this. "When did he (Saglar) become a prime minister? I didn't know he was in the state hierarchy." It seems the chief of staff is unaware that his boss is the civilian government which is a coalition government and the SHP is a partner to it. Thus the SHP and its officials have a say in whatever happens. This is a sad fact of democracy which a military person is obliged to know. On Tuesday Saglar also made a statement reminding the chief of staff of the facts of democracy. The chief of staff has recently said everyone should take pains to avoid any controversies about the office of the chief of staff as it may erode this very important post. We agree. Yet, the chief of staff himself should be beyond all kinds of controversy. Now, he may ban Fikri Saglar from entering the General Staff headquarters as he did the Turkish Daily News. But this is all a passing phase. Military commanders come and go while we are here to stay. One day Gen. Gures and a handful of his men will go. We have no hard feelings toward the Armed Forces because we are aware there are very valuable and competent generals and admirals in the Turkish Armed Forces who could and will replace them and the military will function with great success. Gen. Gures will one day be an ordinary citizen. Then he can say whatever he likes and we can assure him we will be on hand to defend him to the bitter end against all unjustified attacks. Today, every word from him is plunging the Armed Forces deeper into a fruitless and damaging controversy. We oppose this because we feel the good name of the Turkish Armed Forces has to be preserved at all costs.
