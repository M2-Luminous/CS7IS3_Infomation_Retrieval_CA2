As of 23 February 1994, the indebtedness to Russia's nuclear power stations for electrical energy supplied by the "YeES Rossiya" RAO (Russian joint-stock company) and the territorial energy systems totaled 409,812 million rubles [R]. This has led to the indebtedness of the nuclear power stations to their suppliers of fuel and material resources, to contractors, and to the budget of R341,183 million and has also led to rebuilding, modernizing, and technical re-equipping work on nuclear power stations being scaled back, which has had a negative effect on ensuring their safety. There are delays of many months in the payment of wages, and programs for the socioeconomic development of collectives are not being implemented. Taking into account the complex financial situation of the "Novovoronezhatomenergoremont" PRP, the "Rosenergoatom" concern has been systematically rendering the enterprise assistance. At the initiative of Minatom and the "Rosenergoatom" concern, the RF government has made several decisions aimed at stabilizing the financial situation in the nuclear power complex; however, these have not improved the situation substantially. In the first two months of 1994, nuclear power stations were paid for only 25 percent of the electrical energy they supplied. At the present time, the "Rosenergoatom" concern, along with the "YeES Rossiya" RAO, is striving to reduce indebtedness by means of the mutual cancellation of debts, the introduction of bill of exchange circulation, the payment of debts in the form of goods, and so on. [Signed] Concern President Ye. N. Pozdyshev With this letter, the concern's president, whom RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA editors thank for his attention to their publication, also sent six pages of appendixes. Especially interesting is appendix No. 3, "A List of Government Decisions on the Issue of Financial Provision for Nuclear Power Work." The list contains 12 decisions, and only one of them is marked: "Implemented." What about the rest? Ominous formulations: "To ensure the immediate implementation, . . ." "Take immediate exhaustive measures. Report. Deadline 10 days," "Within a week's time, finish putting together and distributing financial funds. . . . Report to Russian government on implementation by 10 December." If, God forbid, a new Chernobyl ever comes crashing down, someone is going to use these notes to compose an entire story of how people tried to avert disaster. In conclusion, we will mention two documents. Here is an instruction from the chairman of the RF government's Council of Ministers, V. S. Chernomyrdin, No. VCh-P14-41316, of 4 December 1993, to B. G. Fedorov, V. V. Gerashchenko, O. N. Soskovets, and Ye. T. Gaydar on a working memo from the first deputy head of the department of industry, O. S. Pushkareva, of 3 December 1993, no. P14-11-1133, "On the Emergency Situation in Russian Nuclear Power." On the document is Fedorov's instruction to Gerashchenko: "Situation critical. I ask you to submit within three days' time proposals for stabilizing the financial situation in nuclear power." Here is an instruction from the first deputy chairman of the RF government, O. N. Soskovets, of 22 January 1994, no. OS-P14-01786, on the subject of a letter from the Russian State Committee on Emergency Situations about the critical situation in nuclear power. It is addressed to Minatom (to S. K. Dubinin), the Bank of Russia (V. I. Solovov), the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy (Mintopenergo) (V. N. Kostyukin), and "YeES Rossiya" RAO (A. F. Dyakov). The words are more than alarming: "Multiple instructions from the government of the Russian Federation on this issue . . . have been systematically ignored, which is having a substantial effect on the safety of nuclear power stations. I ask you, in conjunction with Minatom and other interested organizations, to examine without delay the issues involved in the financial stabilization of nuclear power stations and to take effective measures." The note on both documents reads: NOT IMPLEMENTED.
