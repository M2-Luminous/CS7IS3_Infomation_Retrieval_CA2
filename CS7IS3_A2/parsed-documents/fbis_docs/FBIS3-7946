Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac and Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik are not taking part in its 85th regular session. It is, however, expected that the government will adopt a position today on personnel questions concerning the posts of minister of foreign affairs and minister for administration and privatization of national property of the Slovak Republic. The president of the Slovak Republic asked Vladimir Meciar for this yesterday. The president refused to appoint Jozef Prokes minister of foreign affairs yesterday. The name of Olga Keltosova, minister of labor, social affairs, and the family, is being mentioned in this connection, as well as that of Ivan Mjartan, Slovak ambassador to the Czech Republic. Olga Keltosova, however, has allegedly denied her candidature. According to our information from government circles, Eva Mitrova, current head of the permanent mission of the Slovak Republic at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, is a hot candidate for the post of minister of foreign affairs. The candidate for the post of minister for administration and privatization of national property, according to Vladimir Meciar, has been known to the coalition government for several months. As he said recently, he has been waiting to appoint him only because the position of the government was not stable and he considered the appointment of a minister in these circumstances illogical. [passage omitted] Ondrej Hanko, head of the government office press department, has said the following: [Begin Hanko recording] [passage omitted] In the next part of the session, the prime minister reported on the president's letter, which he had received. In this connection, I would like to tell you that I have been empowered to deny yesterday's statement by the spokesman of the president of the Slovak Republic in which he said that the Slovak prime minister agreed that the president did not wish to appoint Deputy Prime Minister Prokes to the post of minister of foreign affairs. The prime minister never uttered these words at yesterday's talks with the president. [passage omitted] The prime minister said that he has decided not to sign the bill on big privatization that the government passed to the president. He stated that he will pass it to the National Council for it to be discussed again. [end recording] This was from the session of the government. [passage indistinct]
