Where shall I begin with Mr. Tahir Muhammad Hassun, the mayor of Baghdad? How much time do I need to satisfy my curiosity and come out with the result I desire? The man gave me no opportunity to arrange my questions, for he spoke first, as if he had read my mind. He asked and answered, inquired and explained. My journalistic duty forces me to say that I heard not one word of justification from him. He did not take the role of defense attorney for his institution, as many do. Instead, I found him taking the side of the citizen against the apparatus of his department, many of whose practices he criticized. He did not mince his words. He said there are negative phenomena that must be uprooted, corrupt elements of which the city administration must be cleansed. In this area there is dilatoriness; in that area there is negligence. Thus it was an interview more characterized by agreement than by disagreement and argument. Corrupt Officials, Out-of-Control Citizens ['Abdallah] What is the first priority on your agenda? [Hassun] Many tasks are competing for priority and precedence. I can list them as follows: Baghdad's cleanliness, maintaining the sewage system, repairing cave-ins, and keeping the drinking water network at the required purity. ['Abdallah] Have you given each of these its share of attention? [Hassun] Our basic problem lies in our insufficient technical and human resources due to conditions of the embargo. The resources of a single municipal unit of metropolitan Baghdad in terms of engineering and mechanical effort used to equal the resources of the municipality as a whole after the embargo. Nevertheless, this situation does not warrant weak performance in any section. We must not make the embargo a peg on which to hang the persistence of the negative phenomena and conditions that emerge in various places. We must uproot and eradicate them whatever the circumstances. Accordingly, we must be on the scene to observe, monitor, and diagnose the places where defect hides. We must examine the efficiency of performance. Through intensive presence on the scene, we have discovered many negative phenomena and have rung the bell to announce that there are defects in two basic elements: the corrupt official and the out-of-control citizen. ['Abdallah] However, the directives and laws of the mayor's office have contributed to creating corrupt officials by giving lower-level staffs powers that enable them to treat people arbitrarily. [Hassun] That is true. We have dealt seriously with the matter by restricting penal powers to high-level staffs--specifically, in the field monitoring apparatus, the unit directors, and general directors. We noticed that the lower-level staffs that had power and authority to fine and punish had begun to collude shamefully with violators. A minor city official could be bought for a paltry price. With the taste of his free lunch still in his mouth, he would become a defender of the restaurant owner who threw trash into the middle of the street. He would also be accustomed to taking his cut from storekeepers--each in his specialty. An official could get his food free from a restaurant owner, have his hair cut without fee by the barber, have his car repaired without cost at the mechanic's, and take regular protection money from wrongdoers, turning a blind eye to their misdeeds in return. He would see people throw trash and oil into the sewer lines or leave it wherever they wanted, and would turn his eyes--and the city be damned! I say this in sadness and bitterness, after having uncovered many such elements and having been forced to dismiss them and cleanse the city bureaucracy of them. If you ask me what the duty of the lower-level staffs should be, I say that their real duty is to monitor the movement of garbage trucks. This is their duty according to the ordinance of the city of Baghdad. Anyone who likes this duty is welcome; anyone who doesn't--goodbye to him! ['Abdallah] This means that the number of inspectors has become restricted to the number of unit and general directors. Do you think this number issufficient to monitor the streets of Baghdad, as extensive as they are? [Hassun] Our mission is not to give punishments and fines to citizens. Our goal is to establish behavior and models that citizens respect, rather than what a city official wants. What harm would there be if the administration's upper staff, starting with the mayor and ending with the unit directors, turned into inspectors, if that protected citizens from the blackmail of the weak-spirited and realized the noble end we all seek--the cleanliness of our beloved Baghdad? I am sure that if citizens see real, just, and serious oversight, they will be eager to obey the municipal laws. Thus we shall achieve the desired goal of municipal discipline. Major Blight ['Abdallah] This concerns the commercial and tourist districts. What about the residential districts? Garbage has begun to accumulate in some of them until there are tall piles of trash, as well as overflowing and clogged sewers. [Hassun] I agree with you that our service efforts in the residential districts are not at the desired level. This is because our attention now is focused on the tourist and commercial districts. If the service units we have established in the commercial and tourist streets bear fruit, and if the sanitation contractors can carry out their duties successfully and trustworthily despite our observations against them, we shall be able to move a large part of our service effort to the residential districts. We hope to do this shortly. ['Abdallah] While we are on the subject of sanitation contractors, are you satisfied with their work? Didn't the city administration cancel its contracts with them not too long ago, and then contract with them again? What was the reason? [Hassun] Necessities required that we again enter into contracts with the contractors. In the past, some of them were selected on dishonest principles. But I am for encouraging and supporting the experiment if correct, sound, and honest formulas are found. I think that large sanitation companies must be created, as are found in many countries. Although we have recorded our observations against some of them, we are not hesitating to support by various formulas and means those that are dedicated. ['Abdallah] You announced that all the pumps draining the water of the sewers would be repaired. Yet despite the shortage of water in the current winter season, many of Baghdad's streets have been flooded. What was the cause? [Hassun] There are 259 main water drainage stations in Baghdad, with 910 vertical and submerged pumps. There are 6,000 km of rain, sewage, and shared pipes, in addition to 600,000 rain water grills scattered throughout the city of Baghdad. You can imagine the effort required to maintain and repair this complicated large network that has not been given any real maintenance since it was built until the time of the broad campaign we have undertaken for this purpose. The overflows that flooded the streets had many causes. For one thing, rain water grills became blocked because trash had accumulated in them and because grease had been discarded. There were also the cave-ins that the sewer network has suffered--between 25 and 30 every month, some medium-sized, some big, with depths from 1 to 9 meters. Add to this the obsolescence of the sewer network and the effect of the 30-nation aggression, which was accompanied by a complete stoppage of the drainage pumps. This led to a rise in the level of stagnant water and its not being drained. The result was instability of the ground, not to mention the obvious effect in this regard of the flood season that the country experienced in 1988. However, I concentrate here on an essential cause--what I would call the "killer cause"--misuse of the drainage networks by citizens. Surely you have heard about the blockage of the sewers in Saddam City. We made a field investigation of the state of the sewer system there and found--marvel of marvels!--we discovered that all the waste and residue that the industrial district in Kisrah and 'Atash produces are thrown into the sewers--grease, automobile parts, tires, and animals. What network is there that could swallow all these objects? What pumps could get rid of them? We diagnosed three main sources of damage to the sewage system in Saddam City: street vendors, the industrial district in Kisrah and 'Atash, and the popular markets. We have formulated a plan to clean up and maintain the sewer system in Saddam City in coordination with the General Federation of Labor Unions. Shop owners in Kisrah and 'Atash will bear part of the cost of maintaining and cleaning up the sewers. We have collected 3 million dinars for this purpose. As a first step, we have built 13 regular lots for street vendors in the whole of Baghdad. We have taken the initiative to fence and pave the popular markets. We have set a time limit for completing this task not to exceed three months. Flight From "Repellent Occupation" ['Abdallah] One notices that many residential-district open spaces designated as parks have become areas to collect garbage. Aren't the units of the Baghdad municipal administration concerned about these areas? [Hassun] The natural place for these wastes is the sanitation burial area 50 km from the center of the city of Baghdad. But because of a shortage of vehicles to transport waste, we have been forced to create temporary trash collection areas. The trash will be transported later to the sanitation burial area. Therefore, the areas to which you referred have to be cleaned up, and their trash must be taken to the temporary collection areas. The reason for its accumulation has to do with the lack of resources in city administration units, as I mentioned to you at the beginning of the interview. ['Abdallah] Haven't you found a means to deal with the phenomenon of citizens' aversion to taking jobs and positions with the Baghdad city administration? [Hassun] The essential reason for aversion to working in some city occupations is social attitude, which cannot be remedied by administrative decree. Nevertheless, in order to create incentives sufficient to overcome this phenomenon, we have established a system of incentives and productivity criteria. We have granted the general directors full powers for this purpose. However, city occupations remain "repellent occupations," rather than "attractive" ones. ['Abdallah] What was the first negative phenomenon you remedied after you assumed responsibility for Baghdad's city administration? [Hassun] The first slogan I raised was: "War on lying." No one shall make me hear the words "Yes, sir!" without their being accompanied by honest and exact implementation. I have continued to make war on liars and dishonest people. My ultimate goal is to cleanse the city administration of corrupt people and reward and support those who are sincere and honest. ['Abdallah] We said goodbye to the mayor of Baghdad, having taken from his office an important fact--that the mayor has assumed a heavy legacy of bureaucracy, job corruption, and administrative idling. As a result, bad money in the Baghdad administrative has driven out the good. This equation he is determined to reverse. May none but the trustworthy remain trustees!
