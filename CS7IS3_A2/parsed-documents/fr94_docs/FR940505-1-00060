FR940505-1-00060 FR940505-1-00012 Because many of the FIP rules are unprecedented in their regulatory targets or approach, EPA has reserved portions of the rules for later development, and seeks full input from affected sources on the best ways to fill in these implementation details before the compliance deadlines of each rule approach. In other cases, EPA must complete ongoing technical projects, including further emissions sampling and analysis, to finalize important rule implementation elements, such as protocols for use in the stationary and area source cap rules. Ideally, EPA would undertake these projects in coordination with affected industry and State and local air pollution control agencies in the FIP areas. These additions to the FIP rules may be proposed as actual regulations or they may be issued as supplementary guidance materials that expand on practical compliance issues. EPA encourages readers to provide information and regulatory suggestions to allow EPA to improve the proposed rules' clarity and compliance certainty, provide for least-cost compliance approaches, and tailor the rules more precisely to fit local circumstances and foster program transfer to the State or local level. In many cases, affected sources are already subject to existing State and local emission reduction requirements, and the responsible State and local agencies may be developing further regulatory initiatives, as part of their ongoing SIP efforts. EPA has attempted to craft FIP rules which, to the extent possible, match the format of State or local regulations and minimize conflict between the federal regulatory regime and current or proposed State and local requirements. To reduce compliance costs and duplication of effort by sources and the enforcing agencies, EPA will consider future FIP rule amendments for the purpose of harmonizing federal and State controls and eliminating any jeopardy of the regulated community for inadvertent violations of similar but not identical federal and State rules. b. Enforcement. As described in section III.A.2.a of this NPRM, the FIP requirements contained in sections 52.2950&hyph;52.3002 are proposed pursuant to section 110(c) and other sections of the Clean Air Act. If finalized, these requirements will be subject to Federal enforcement under section 113(a)(3) of the Act. Pursuant to section 113(a)(3), EPA may pursue the following actions against any person who violates a requirement of the final FIP rules: (1) Administrative penalty order. EPA may issue an administrative order assessing a civil administrative penalty of up to $25,000 per day per violation. (2) Compliance order. EPA may issue an order to comply with any requirement of the FIP. (3) Civil action. EPA may commence a civil action for permanent or temporary injunction and/or assess a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per day per violation. (4) Criminal action. EPA may request that the Attorney General commence a criminal action against any person who knowingly violates any requirement of the FIP. Owners and operators of sources subject to the FIP rules should be aware that compliance with the FIP requirements does not generally relieve them of the obligation to comply with other applicable federal requirements or with their obligations under State law and regulations, or local air pollution control rules. c. Application of FIP Requirements to OCS Sources. Section 328 of the 1990 CAA Amendments required EPA to establish requirements to control air pollution from Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) sources to attain and maintain federal and state ambient air quality standards and to comply with part C of title I of the CAA. EPA promulgated the new OCS air regulations at 40 CFR part 55 (``Part 55'') on September 4, 1992 (57 FR 40792). As required by section 328 of the Act, OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries, 22 must meet requirements that are the same as the requirements that would be applicable if the OCS source were located in the corresponding onshore area (``COA''). 23 These include, but are not limited to, all applicable federal, state, and local requirements for control technology, permitting, monitoring, reporting, compliance and fees. New OCS sources must comply with the requirements of Part 55 immediately and existing sources must comply by September 4, 1994. 22 The state seaward boundary of California extends three miles from the coastline. 23 Part 55 also establishes federal requirements for sources located beyond 25 miles from state seaward boundaries. However, there currently are no OCS sources located, or proposed to be, in this outer regime. Both VCAPCD and SCAQMD are designated as the COA for several OCS facilities located within 25 miles of the State seaward boundary. These OCS sources will be required to meet all the applicable requirements of the FIP when the FIP requirements are incorporated into part 55. The OCS rule establishes a ``consistency update'' procedure at 40 CFR 55.12 to amend part 55 to include new federal, state, and local regulations when they are adopted. The OCS rule also establishes procedures for EPA to delegate implementation and enforcement of the requirements of part 55 to state and local agencies. Thus, any FIP requirements applicable to the affected OCS sources can be implemented by VCAPCD and SCAQMD when they are delegated authority for part 55. The reader is referred to the preamble of the OCS regulation for further background and information on part 55. d. Application of FIP Requirements to Sources Located in Indian Country. As described below, the CAA empowers EPA to apply the FIP requirements to affected air pollution sources in Indian country. 24 Thus, EPA is also proposing to apply the FIP requirements to all affected air pollution sources located on Tribal lands. This means that the proposed FIP rules will apply with equal force to State and Tribal lands. 24 Indian country includes: (a) All land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and, including rights-of-way running through the reservation, (b) all dependent Indian communities within the borders of the United States whether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether within or without the limits of a state, and (c) all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same. 18 U.S.C. section 1151. Congress has authorized EPA to make Indian Tribes partners in Clean Air Act implementation in the same manner as States. See section 301(d)(2) of the Act. As a prerequisite, EPA must identify provisions of the CAA for which it is appropriate to treat Tribes in the same manner as States. EPA may provide by regulation other means by which it will directly administer any other provisions of the CAA not identified, to achieve the appropriate purpose. See section 301(d)(4). The overarching purpose of the Clean Air Act is, among other things, ``to protect and enhance the quality of the Nation's air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.'' See section 101(b)(1) of the CAA (emphasis added). The NAAQS are one of the fundamental CAA benchmarks by which public health and welfare protection is measured. EPA has not yet issued rules under section 301(d)(2) authorizing Tribes to submit NAAQS-related CAA programs for EPA approval in the same manner as States. Sections 110(c)(1) and 301(d)(4) of the Act nevertheless evince Congressional intent to authorize EPA to directly protect public health and welfare where States or Tribes fail to submit such CAA programs or lack authority to do so. Federal implementation on Indian lands is especially appropriate in these particular exigencies where federal action will prevent voids in public health and welfare protection. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. EPA, 803 F.2d 545, 555&hyph;56 (10th Cir. 1986) (affirming EPA's authority to directly implement Safe Drinking Water Act Underground Injection Control program on Indian lands in Oklahoma where concluding otherwise would contradict the meaning and purpose of the Act by creating ``a vacuum of authority over underground injections on Indian lands, leaving vast areas of the nation devoid of protection from groundwater contamination).
