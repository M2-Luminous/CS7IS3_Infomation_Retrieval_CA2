Shushkevich has described the upcoming official visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton as an important and positive event for Belarus. As S. Shushkevich said in an interview with the ZVYAZDA newspaper correspondent, one of the most important tasks at the Belarus-U.S. talks is to clarify positions on the basic strategic issues of our policy and, in particular, issues concerning the security of Belarus. "When Belarus implements its constitutional law on neutrality and nuclear-free status it would like to have guarantees for the preservation of its neutral status, such as those that at one time Finland had from the United States and the USSR," stressed S. Shushkevich. Concerning B. Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" initiative, S. Shushkevich noted that he also considers it expedient to examine the official strategy of Belarus in creating in Central Europe a belt of neutral states with certain guarantees from the great states of the world. Furthermore, S. Shushkevich considers that B. Clinton's visit to Minsk will encourage U.S. investment in its economy. [passage omitted]
