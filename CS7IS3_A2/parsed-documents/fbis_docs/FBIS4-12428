Welcome minister. The first question I will put to you is the following: today the Bank of Algeria announced a 40.17 percent devaluation of the dinar as from 10 April. First, what will be the economic impact of this devaluation? Second, will this devaluation take place in one go or will it be introduced gradually? [Benachnou] First, in the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate; as you know, the value of a currency depends on the law of supply and demand. What is happening in Algeria is that revenues in hard currency dropped for several reasons, the first one being a decline in oil prices. This required an adjustment in the value of the dinar in relation to the hard currencies, which are in huge demand but are not in sufficient supply. As for the repercussions of the devaluation of the dinar, I will say that these will be both positive and negative. First, the positive repercussions will include an increase in tax revenues for the state as a result of higher oil revenues when the latter are converted into dinars. Second, this will enable us to give a greater freedom to imports. Third, this devaluation will in the near future, God willing, encourage exports other than oil. As regards the negative repercussions, the first one will be on prices. However, I must point out that the parallel market [black market] was ahead of the state as far as the exchange rate of the dinar is concerned. You know that in the parallel market the dinar is lower than the official rate. [Correspondent] As we have just heard, the International Monetary Fund has expressed its full satisfaction. Does this mean that the agreement with the IMF has been signed, and if it the case, what are the contents of that agreement? [Benachnou] We signed a letter of intent this evening after the government discussed and approved the contents of the letter. On the whole, the letter of intent sets out the economic, financial, and monetary policy the Algerian Government intends to follow until the country returns to the path of development and to a stability in prices and until it checks inflation and boosts investments again so that enough new jobs can be created to keep up with the number of youths entering the job market every year. The contents of this letter are all built around these objectives. By way of illustration, I will now give some of the points this letter addresses. The first point is the rate of the dinar. We have already talked about this. The second point is linked to the lifting of all restrictions on imports to allow our economy to be financed effectively and in a way that reflects the real requirements of the economy and not decisions taken by civil servants sitting in their offices who do not know how the economy or companies are run by operators who are directly responsible for production. There is also a measure concerning the budget because several deficiencies we notice in our economy are the result of a lack of restraint on the part of the state in terms of expenditure. At times this expenditure exceeded the revenues, and consequently the state had to borrow money from the Central Bank. This in turn led to the inflation Algeria is now experiencing. As regards the policy of managing public funds, I can say that we will achieve a greater restraint and that this restraint will enable us to curb the price rises we are currently facing. This letter addressed another problem, namely the restructuring of state-owned companies. We are aware of the huge delay in tackling this problem. In any case, the state-owned companies contribute to the national income with 60 percent, but this contribution is well below their capacity. These companies have a higher capacity of production, and we must give them the means to maximize it in the best way possible and with the necessary standard. There are other measures that are purely technical, and this may not be the best place to talk about them. However, I must stress that this letter will enable us to receive first of all $1 billion from the IMF, as its director general announced. We will also receive some loans that had been suspended and that had been linked to this letter. These loans are coming to us from the World Bank, $175 million; Japan, $150 million; the European Union, $180 million; and finally the Arab Monetary Fund, $100 million. This will be the first tranche. For the second tranche, we have started talks with a number of states such as France, Spain, Italy, and Belgium and with other institutions to enable us to finance our balance of payments to meet the imports requirements and the requirements linked to the servicing of our foreign debt. As regards the foreign debt, its problem is also linked to the signing of this letter of intent. As the IMF director general said, and I can only repeat what he said, we will be able to enter talks with our creditors when we achieve a significant reduction in the servicing of our foreign debt, and I mean a very big reduction. [Correspondent] Thank you minister. I hope we will meet again for more information on other economic matters. Thank you again.
