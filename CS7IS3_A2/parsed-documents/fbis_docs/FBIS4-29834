Bolger's answer in parliament came in response to a question on the upcoming visit by MP Phil Goff. "Will it be a condition of that visit that the delegation be free to speak with whomever they wish, and given Amnesty International's warnings on past experience about victimisation of those who speak to such delegations, will it be a condition that those spoken to will not be subject to subsequent forms of reprisal?" Goff said. Bolger, who visited Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta earlier this year after a majority of New Zealand MPs signed a petition protesting alleged human rights abuses by Indonesia in the former Portuguese colony, said he believed Suharto would welcome the visit by four or five MPs. But, he added, "Its going to be very difficult for us to in anyway to control or monitor that." Bolger said he had suggested the MPs also visit other Indonesian provinces during their August 18-September 13 trip, including West Timor, for comparison purposes. During Bolger's visit to Jakarta, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas claimed New Zealand parliamentarians had only a shallow understanding of the situation in East Timor, annexed by Indonesia in 1975 in a move still not recognised by the United Nations.
