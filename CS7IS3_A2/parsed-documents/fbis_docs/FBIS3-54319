My dear countrymen, peace be upon you. At the time of the establishment of Pakistan, the founder of Pakistan, the great leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah said Kashmir is the jugular vein of Pakistan. Ever since independence day, the hearts of the Pakistani people are with the people of Kashmir till today. The settlement of the Kashmir issue in accordance with UN resolutions for the Kashmiri people has been the cornerstone of our foreign policy. Announcing my priorities after being elected prime minister, I described the settlement of the Kashmir issue as my foremost priority. Only a day after taking my oath as prime minister, I went to Cyprus in order to hold discussions with the Commonwealth leaders on the Kashmir problem. During my minor pilgrimage to Mecca, I drew the attention of the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates toward Indian atrocities in Kashmir. The Kashmir problem remained a priority for the government even during my visits to Iran, Turkey, China, and Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Thank God the world is getting apprised of the human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir. India, until now, has not refrained from using every inhuman machination to crush the Kashmiri people's movement. We initiated a dialogue with India to bring home our stand to the world. The objective of the dialogue was to find a solution to Kashmir issue by peaceful means, not by violence, and in accordance with the UN resolutions. We hoped India would lessen tyranny and repression in occupied Kashmir, but, regrettably, this was not done. As many as 50 innocent people were martyred in Sopor only a day after the announcement of the start of the new round of negotiations. The announcement about the lifting of the siege of the Hazratbal Shrine was not found to be correct. Even today, Indian forces are present around this sacred shrine and are destroying its sanctity. Despite negotiations, Indian atrocities continue in occupied Jammu and Kashmir. India's objective appears to be something different. By staging the show of a dialogue, India wants to distract international public opinion and attention from its atrocities in order to crush the Kashmiri people's struggle free of international pressure. This is not acceptable to Pakistan. We cannot leave our Kashmiri brothers and sisters alone nor can we allow the intensification of repression under the cover of negotiations. India will have to end tyranny and repression in the Kashmir Valley to prove its sincerity. Negotiations will remain devoid of any results until the number of Indian troops in the Kashmir Valley is reduced, until innocent Kashmiris are released from Indian jails, and until international human rights organizations are allowed to go into Kashmir. My dear countrymen, we will continue the process of mobilizing international public opinion against India's continued atrocities against our Kashmiri brethren. Pakistan will identify human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir at the UN Human Rights Commission. I, myself, will put forward Kashmir's case at the Human Rights Commission on 1 February. The objective of our efforts is to mobilize international public opinion and to awaken the international conscience. We know that international public opinion adopts double standards on certain occasions. The world community has not been able to take any effective step in connection with Bosnia; and even in case of Kashmir, the world's record is not that good. We, however, have to continue our political, diplomatic, and moral efforts in this changing world. We are confident that these efforts will ultimately be crowned with success and the Kashmiris will definitely achieve their right of self-determination, God willing. We know that nobody can crush the spirit of freedom. When the Indian foreign secretary came to Pakistan, I told him that negotiations with us will be fruitful only when India is ready to find a political solution to the Kashmir problem; but Kashmir is presently burning. The Kashmiris are being massacred indiscriminately. As soon as the Kashmiri people adopted the path of struggle to achieve freedom from Indian subjugation, a reign of terror was let loose against them. Youths, children, and the aged are being made targets of violence. They are being made the targets of bullets in spite of the fact that they are unarmed. Women are molested and thousands of innocent people are put behind bars. May I ask what is their fault? Their only fault is that they demand the right of a plebiscite. Giving them the right of plebiscite was decided by the United Nations as far back as 1948. Both India and Pakistan are committed to this decision. India has deployed 600,000 troops in the Kashmir valley to deny the Kashmiris the right of a plebiscite. Two more divisions are now being sent there. After all, how many more troops will they send there? When the United States could not control Vietnam by its forces; when the Soviet Union could not control Afghanistan; how can India overcome the Kashmiri fighters? India cannot hide its failures by raising a new iron curtain [preceding two words in English] in the new world. Amnesty International, Asia Watch, Physicians for Human Rights, International Federation for Human Rights are only a few organizations who have provided documentary proof of the Indian atrocities. Members of Parliament of various countries have raised their voice against the human rights violations in Kashmir. These voices are getting louder with the passage of time. We will also raise our voice in unison with the Kashmiri people's voice to carry forward their movement. The Kashmiri people's anguish is our anguish. Their struggle is our struggle. To express solidarity with this struggle is our obligation as well as our right in accordance with international law. We constituted the National Assembly's Committee on Kashmir to express solidarity with the Kashmiri people's struggle and to draw the attention of international public opinion to the Kashmir issue. All political parties are represented in this committee, which is a proof that the Pakistani nation has complete ideological solidarity on the Kashmir issue. The committee is headed by the veteran politician, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, whose political experience is a treasure for all of us. The National Assembly's Committee on Kashmir has decided that a total strike will be observed in Pakistan, Azad Kashmir, and the occupied Jammu and Kashmir on 5 February. The Government of Pakistan fully supports this decision. While supporting this call, I appeal to the people of Pakistan, Azad Kashmir, and the occupied Jammu and Kashmir to observe a protest strike on 5 February. This strike will provide proof that the Kashmiri people want to settle the Kashmir issue through a plebiscite in accordance with UN resolutions. Kashmir is a jugular vein of Pakistan, and we will not allow our jugular vein to be trampled upon by brute force. The 5 February strike will show to the world that the people of Pakistan and our Kashmir brothers and sisters are inseparable nations. The present democratic government considers Kashmir not only a part of Pakistan's history, but also its heritage. The people's government has the same stand on Kashmir as that of the founder of Pakistan, Great Leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah, and as that of the people's leader -- Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. The people are aware that in the past the people's leader, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, had infused new life into this issue and highlighted it at the international level. I will move forward with your help, taking with me the mission [preceding word in English] of these two personalities. I as a mother, sister, and daughter understand the sorrow of every mother, sister, and daughter of Kashmir and offer prayers for the success of every father, brother, and son of Kashmir. I want to assure the Kashmiri brothers and sisters that the people's government considers the freedom of Kashmir a sacred duty. We want every Muslim of this soil to live an honorable and free life. A Muslim, whether from Bosnia, Palestine, or Kashmir, does not live a complete life without freedom. Today every Muslim wants to see Kashmir independent and, God willing, that day is not far when Kashmir will be with us. I want to assure all of you that whatever happens, no power on earth can prevent us from extending moral, diplomatic, and political support to the Kashmiris in their movement. The blood of martyrs is proof that we will not deviate from this pledge. Long Live Pakistan.
