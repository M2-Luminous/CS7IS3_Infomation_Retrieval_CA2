"That is the fundamental agreement. They must leave peacefully because they did not enter in a legal manner," a top official who declined to be identified stated. The source indicated that these persons "will not be punished for breaking into the embassy," but noted that the Belgian authorities have not provided Cuba with the list of persons who are there and that "therefore we do not know who they are and whether there are fugitives or delinquents among them." This official indicated that today, the Minrex will reply "in writing" to the written request for guarantees and other matters submitted by the Belgium side but did not want to venture an opinion on when the incident would end. "What we cannot allow," he said, "is the transgression of the law or the transgression of the extraterritoriality of an embassy to leave the country, because that is not good for us or anyone." Regarding the police deployment around the ambassador's residence -- more discrete during the day but highly noticeable at night -- he said the Belgian authorities requested it to prevent future entries. "That is logical, and, at any rate, we would have provided it," he noted. Asked about the food supply for the occupants, including 24 children, he said that was the Belgian ambassador's problem. "We told him," he said, "the Cubalse state enterprise that supplies the diplomatic corps and foreigners was in a position to provide the necessary food." In fact, it is still a mystery how this large a number of people have been fed since Saturday as the police and neighbors have said that no movement in or out of the embassy has been detected, except by the ambassador and one of the 114 occupants who left last night. Official sources said he was a young man and that he left the embassy voluntarily but did not disclose his name. This morning, when approached by a couple of newsmen while leaving his residence, Belgian Ambassador Paul Veirmeirsch said all had slept well and did not want to comment on how they were fed. This is the most serious incident that has taken place in a diplomatic mission since the 1980 events at the Peruvian Embassy when over 10,000 Cubans invaded it after the Havana government decided to withdraw the guards from the embassy. Previously, Peru had granted political asylum to more than 10 citizens who had forced their way into the embassy in an incident in which one policeman was killed. This time, the group that apparently had gathered in a park in front of the mission took advantage of someone opening the door to storm the grounds. Police sources told EFE that there were five guards on duty but that they were overwhelmed by the crowd. Meanwhile, the rest of the embassies remain with their usual guard, which varies from two to five agents according to the size of the building.
