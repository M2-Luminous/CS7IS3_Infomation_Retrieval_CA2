FR940527-1-00102 FR940527-1-00014 VIII. Other Required Information A. Paperwork Reduction Act As discussed in detail in section III.C. of this preamble, we are proposing several changes to forms used to gather hospital wage data, specifically the Worksheet S&hyph;3, Part II, of the Medicare cost report, and the provider cost report questionnaire (HCFA&hyph;339). The current information collection requirements associated with these items have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under approval numbers 0938&hyph;0050 and 0938&hyph;0301, respectively. We are proposing that the changes to these forms would be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994. However, these changes will not be effective until OMB approval is received under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). B. Requests for Data from the Public In order to respond promptly to public requests for data related to the prospective payment system, we have set up a process under which commenters can gain access to the raw data on an expedited basis. Generally, the data are available in computer tape format or cartridges; however, some files are available on diskette. Data files are listed below with the cost of each. Anyone wishing to purchase data tapes, cartridges, or diskettes should submit a written request along with a company check or money order (payable to HCFA-PUF) to cover the cost, to the following address: Health Care Financing Administration, Public Use Files, Accounting Division, P.O.

Expanded Modified MedPAR-Hospital (National) The Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) file contains records for 100 percent of Medicare beneficiaries using hospital inpatient services in the United States. The records are stripped of most data elements that will permit identification of beneficiaries. Provider numbers and beneficiary claim numbers have been encrypted to protect the privacy of individuals. The hospital is identified by the 6 position Medicare billing number. The file is available to persons qualifying under the terms of the Notice of Proposed New Routine Uses for an Existing System of Records published in the Federal Register on December 24, 1984 (49 FR 49941), and amended by the July 2, 1985 notice (50 FR 27361). The national file consists of approximately 11 million records. Under the requirements of these notices, a data release must be signed by the purchaser before release of these data. For all files requiring a signed data release agreement, please write or call to obtain a blank agreement form before placing order. Two versions of this file are created each year. They support the following: •Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) published in the Federal Register , usually available by the end of May. This file is derived from the MedPAR file with a cutoff of 3 months after the end of the fiscal year (December file). •Final Rule published in the Federal Register , usually available by the first week of September.
