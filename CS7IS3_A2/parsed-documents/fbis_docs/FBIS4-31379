Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali described as relative success the accord on the one-month cessation of military activities in Bosnia-Herzegovina signed in Geneva Wednesday. This document came as a compromise which at the last moment saved from fiasco the conference which the Moslem-Croatian delegation for the first four days boycotted and then blackmailed to the end. According to a U.N. spokesperson in Geneva, Butrus-Ghali set out that the accord was only the first step towards achieving lasting cessation of hostilities and finding a generally acceptable political solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Head of the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) delegation Radovan Karadzic said prior to the official announcement on signing the accord that the Serb side has once again demonstrated its sense for reaching compromise, but expressed doubt this would set the Moslems on course to peace and understanding.
