FR940727-0-00002 FR940727-0-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Parts 831, 838, 841, 842, and 890 RIN 3206&hyph;AG13 Federal Employees Retirement System_General Administration; Government Costs AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is updating the table of normal cost percentages that Federal agencies pay to finance the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). This regulation is necessary for the table to reflect the changes in the rates that are effective in October 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Harold L. Siegelman, (202) 606&hyph;0299. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 21, 1993, OPM published in the Federal Register a notice changing the normal cost percentages effective in October 1994. Subpart D of Part 841 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, contains the methodology that OPM uses to determine the rates that agencies must pay to fund the cost of the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and the procedures that OPM must follow to change the rates. Under those procedures, OPM must publish a notice of changes in the rates at least 3 months before the beginning of the fiscal year in which the new rates become effective. Appendix A to Subpart D of Part 841 contains a table of the normal cost percentages. This table has no regulatory effect. It merely provides information about the rates. This final rule amends that table to reflect the rates that will become effective in October 1994. Under section 553(b)(3)(B) of title 5, United States Code, I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking. Notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary because this final rule merely provides information and has no regulatory effect. Correction of Prior Notice of Final Rulemaking On March 16, 1994, OPM published (59 FR 12143) a final rule concerning payment of survivor deposits by actuarial reduction. (FR Doc. 94&hyph;6046) This document adopted OPM's interim rule on that subject as final rules. In two places, reference to the page number for the interim rule was stated incorrectly. In both places, the incorrect reference to 58 FR 56877 is corrected to 58 FR 52877. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the regulation only provides information about the rate of payment by Federal agencies to OPM for the normal cost of their employees' FERS benefits.
