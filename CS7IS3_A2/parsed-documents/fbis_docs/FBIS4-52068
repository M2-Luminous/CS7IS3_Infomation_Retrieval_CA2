This morning I only told national and international journalists in Phnom Penh that I would welcome a decision by friendly foreign powers to provide the KRAF with urgent military aid in the form of arms and training. I also added that I would always work for the benefit of a peaceful solution to the Khmer Rouge issue. My proposal for a roundtable to be held in the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh or in the Royal Palace at the Lake of Longevity [near Pyongyang] is still valid. Issued in Phnom Penh on 5 May 1994 [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk
