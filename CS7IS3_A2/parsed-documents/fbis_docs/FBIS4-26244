Initial statistics showed that at least 87 persons died because of floods and the direct economic loss was over RMB 1.3 billion [renminbi] as of today. Nearly half of the population of 3.5 million were affected by the natural disaster. An official report said that most of the death toll might be registered in Qingyuan's Liannan County, in which at least 42 persons died and 22 were missing. Most of the dead were young persons who were either drowned or swept away by floods. There were at least 110,000 homes destroyed and 16,000 houses collapsed. The homeless across the city was put at over 10,000 persons, and there were up to 6,000 persons homeless in Fogang County alone in northern part of the city. About 80,000 hectares of crops were flooded across Qingyuan and large pieces of paddy-fields coming near to a harvest were destroyed. One third of 150,000 mu of paddy-fields in Qingxin County was flooded, according to a local official. Quite a lot of trunk roads which were put at 459 and at least two bridges were damaged by violent floods. A 16-kilometre section of a provincial grade road was flooded while 6-kilometre long part of road was seriously destroyed which caused a damage of over RMB 40 million [renminbi]. Traffic across the city was paralyzed. As there were many areas across the city with breakdown of traffic and communications, it is estimated that the death toll and damage would climb up. In Wuzhou of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the flood peak topped the water level of 25.91 metres, exceeding the warning level by 10.91 metres. The flowing rate was put at 46,200 cubic metres per second, registering the greatest flood since 1949. Wuzhou and its suburban areas were flooded to a certain extent. Most of the outbound traffic and communications broke down. It is in a critical state in the Pearl River Delta area in which flood control is in great urgency. In Hunan Province, Hengyang, Xiangtan and Changsha cities underwent the highest flood peak the day before yesterday since 1949. Eight cities along the Yangtze River covering 128 towns were flooded. The State Council sent working teams from the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Construction and the Ministry of Civil Affairs to rush to Guangxi and Guangdong to help fight floods.
