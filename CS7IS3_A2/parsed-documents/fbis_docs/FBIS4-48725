Indeed, a bill adopted yesterday makes for the creation of seven military defense regions that will replace the five military zones that have so far existed. The military leaders of these seven regions, generals or senior officers, will also serve as military advisers to the prefects of the country's nine administrative regions. The military authorities will be responsible "for the preparation and implementation of operational defense" before the Army Headquarters, the same sources explained. Every military region will be subdivided into districts "corresponding to all or part of an administrative region," while special arrangements will be made for border areas. According to the British magazine, MILITARY BALANCE, the Congolese Army is made up of about 11,000 men. The government recently announced its intention to enroll 2,000 young men aged between 20 and 24 to rejuvenate the Army. It currently has a very high proportion of officers and noncommissioned officers.
