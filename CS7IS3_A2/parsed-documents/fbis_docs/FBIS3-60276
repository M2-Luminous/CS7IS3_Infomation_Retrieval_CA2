The decree promulgating the agreement between the two countries established that the goal of the commission and the bank is to support the protection and upgrading of the environment at the U.S.- Mexican border. The agreement creating the two institutions was approved by the Chamber of Senators on 16 December and was promulgated today through its publication in the federation's official newspaper. The text of the agreement underscores the importance of preserving, protecting, and improving the environment for the sake of present-day and future generations and the urgency of addressing ecological problems at the U.S.-Mexican border. The United States and Mexico agreed to create the commission and the bank within the framework of NAFTA, which includes Canada. The U.S. Government promulgated NAFTA on 8 December. The agreement underscores the need to establish an ecological infrastructure at the border, especially in contaminated areas, as well as the need to treat sewage water and solid waste, among others. The agreement states that the commission's goal is to support the preservation, protection, and improvement of ecology at the border area to increase the well-being of the people of Mexico and the United States. The commission will also cooperate, as required, with the North American Development Bank, other national and international institutions, and sources of private investment capital in the development of ecological infrastructure projects in the area. The commission will participate in the drafting, development, implementation, and supervision of those projects and will analyze the financial or environmental feasibility of such plans, and will evaluate the economic and social benefits of ecological infrastructure projects in the area. The commission will have a directorate, two managers, that is, a general manager and a deputy general manager, an advisory council, as well as the officials and personnel it requires to carry out its duties. It will also have legal status and full power to sign contracts, purchase and transfer personal property and real estate, and start legal procedures. The commission will issue a yearly report on its operations in Spanish and English that will be drafted by the general manager and approved by the directorate. Copies of the report will be available to the people of the two countries. The commission will be in operation until one of the parties decides to withdraw, and this party is able to do so six months after filing a written request. The North American Development Bank will finance projects certified by and at the request of the commission and will be assisted by the commission in the achievement of its goals and fulfillment of its duties. In carrying out its duties the bank will use its own capital, funds obtained in financial markets and other available resources, and will promote the investment of public and private capital in companies and activities with ecological purposes. The agreement states that the bank will have initial capital of $3 billion divided into 300,000 shares, each one with a nominal value of $10,000, and they will be at the disposal of the parties. Of that total, there will be $450 million in paid-up shares [liberadas] and $2.550 billion in not fully paid-up shares [pagaderas]. The agreement states that Mexico and the United States each will own [suscribiran] 22,500 paid-up shares and 127,500 not fully paid-up shares for a total of 150,000 shares each and a grand total of 300,000 shares between the two.
