Reception is good. Ayatollah Meshkini begins his first sermon with three minutes of Arabic prayers. He then says: "I would like to say a few sentences about the issue of Marja'iyat [the status of being the source of emulation]. Someone may ask from what source our sources of emulation derive their decrees and interpretations, which they then pass on to people as God's strictures." Meshkini asserts that all the fatwas and interpretations about the correct performance of religious rituals and moral conduct, and also about proper and acceptable religious belief, have one single source, out of which two currents flow. The source, he states, is the prophet, and the two currents are the Koran and the tradition. He then goes on to stress that Koran is a divine phenomenon, and as such its words cannot be questioned. The Koran, therefore, was passed intact through the generations, until it reached the hands of the Marja'. On the question of the tradition, he says: "As far as the issue of tradition is concerned, this is where we differ significantly from our Sunni brothers. How lucky you, the Shiite faithful, are." He then quotes an Arabic verse, and Persian poetry about the Shiites' devotion to their imams. He goes on to say that whatever the prophet said was learned and safeguarded by 'Ali, the first imam. He says: "We believe that the tradition was left with 'Ali for safekeeping, and 'Ali passed it on to Hasan, who then passed it to Hoseyn, who in turn gave it to Sajjad; Sajjad gave to Baqir, who then passed it to Sadiq. Then it passed from Sadiq to Kazem, Kazem to Reza, Reza to Javad, Javad to Naqi, Naqi to Askari, and Askari to the hidden imam. This all tells us that the prophet's tradition is in fact exactly the same as the one which has been passed to us and our sources of emulation today." Meshkini then cites remarks and work on the tradition by the late Ayatollah Borujerdi, saying that he had 36,000 quotations from the prophet and the imams in his book, all of which can be proved to be authentic. He then declares: "To sum up, I would like to say that if someone asks from what source and what reference point a source of emulation derives his interpretations, then we have to answer that the sources and the points of reference are the divine book and the tradition of the prophet, which has been passed to us by the imams." After reciting an Arabic verse, he says: "The Sunni doctrine should not then be referred to as the orthodox sect; orthodoxy is in fact inherent within the Shiite doctrine, because it is the Shiites who have found the true Islamic tradition, on the basis of which they set out to issue decrees and interpretations. I will, on another occasion, refer to the Sunni mode of reasoning and interpretation, and the methods they choose. We are proud to be Shiites of the immaculate family of imams."
