FR941104-1-00009 FR941104-1-00002 * * * * * PART 330_RECRUITMENT, SELECTION, AND PLACEMENT (GENERAL) 20. The authority citation for part 330 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 1302, 3301, 3302; E.O. 10577; 3 CFR, 1954&hyph;58 Comp., p. 218; §330.102 also issued under 5 U.S.C. 3327; subpart B also issued under 5 U.S.C. 3315 and 8151; §330.401 also issued under 5 U.S.C. 3310; subpart H also issued under 5 U.S.C. 8337(h) and 8457(b); subpart I also issued under sec. 4432 of Pub. Law 102&hyph;484. 21. Section 330.201 is revised to read as follows: §330.201 Establishment and maintenance of RPL. (a) The reemployment priority list (RPL) is the mechanism agencies use to give reemployment consideration to their former competitive service employees separated by reduction in force (RIF) or fully recovered from a compensable injury after more than 1 year. The RPL is a required component of agency positive placement programs. In filling vacancies, the agency must give RPL registrants priority consideration over certain outside job applicants and, if it chooses, also may consider RPL registrants before considering internal candidates. (b) Each agency is required to establish and maintain a reemployment priority list for each commuting area in which it separates eligible competitive service employees by RIF or when a former employee recovers from a compensable injury after more than 1 year, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of this subpart, ``agency'' means ``Executive agency'' as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. All components of an agency within the commuting area utilize a single RPL and are responsible for giving priority consideration to the RPL registrants. (c) An agency need not maintain a distinct RPL for employees separated by reduction in force if the agency operates a placement program for its employees and obtains OPM concurrence that the program satisfies the basic requirements of this subpart. The intent of this provision is to allow agencies to adopt different placement strategies that are effective for their particular programs yet satisfy legal entitlements to priority consideration in reemployment. 22. In §330.202, paragraph (a)(1) is revised and paragraph (c) is added to read as follows: §330.202 Application. (a)(1) To be entered on the RPL, an eligible employee under §330.203 must complete an application prescribed by the employing agency and inform the agency of any significant changes in the information provided. This application must provide for the employee to specify the conditions under which he or she will accept employment, including grade, occupation, and minimum hours of work per week, in addition to positions at the same representative rate and type of work schedule (e.g., full-time, part-time, seasonal, intermittent, on-call, etc.) as the position from which the employee was or will be separated. Registration may take place as soon as a specific notice of separation under part 351 of this chapter, or a Certification of Expected Separation as provided in §351.807 of this chapter, has been issued. The employee must submit the application within 30 calendar days after the RIF separation date. An employee who fails to submit a timely application is not entitled to be placed on the RPL. If an agency has components scattered throughout a large commuting area, the agency may allow eligibles to indicate their availability only for certain sub-areas within the commuting area. However, the agency cannot deny consideration throughout the entire commuting area if the eligible wants it. * * * * * (c) Agencies should assist employees to identify positions within the agency for which they qualify and these positions should be listed on the RPL application. 23. In §330.203, paragraphs (a)(4) and (c) are revised and paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g) are added to read as follows: §330.203 Eligibility due to reduction in force. (a) *␣*␣* (4) Have not declined an offer under subpart G of part 351 of this chapter of a position with the same type of work schedule and a representative rate at least as high as that of the position from which the employee was or will be separated. * * * * * (c) A tenure group I employee is eligible for the RPL for 2 years, and a tenure group II employee is eligible for 1 year, from the date the employee is entered on the RPL.
