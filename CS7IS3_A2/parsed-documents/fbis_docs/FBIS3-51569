The demonstrators are protesting against an increase in transportation fares and the sales tax, although the application of the latter at the consumer level was postponed until 28 February, media sources here reported. Disturbances started near the Central University of Venezuela (UCV), in the strategic east-central Caracas area, where hooded students burned a soft drink company truck, and in secondary schools and higher education institutions in central and southwestern Caracas. Capital city firefighters showed up to extinguish the fire caused by the truck torching at the UCV and members of the metropolitan police special brigade fired tear gas at the students, who responded with rocks. The disturbances spread to the Fermin Toro Secondary school in downtown Caracas and to the Caballero Mejias Higher Education Center, in the populous area of La Yaguada, in the southwest, where residents joined the action to protest utility problems. The students protested against an increase in public transportation fares, especially the student fare, and against a sales tax although its implementation was postponed. On 18 January the increase in transportation fares led to violent student demonstrations in Puerto La Cruz, 220 km east of Caracas, where classes at universities were suspended in the wake of looting that led to the arrest of 100 persons, and in Charallave, 50 km to the south. The student protest, which was characterized by the burning of tires and closure of streets, spread to Cumana, 350 km to the east, Maturin, 400 km to the east, and to the Andean city of San Cristobal, 648 km to the southwest.
