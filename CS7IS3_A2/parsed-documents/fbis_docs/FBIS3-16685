On 17 March, a group of fairly well known persons announced in Moscow the creation of a new public movement: "Accord for Russia." The founding fathers include: Valeriy Zorkin, Aleksandr Rutskoy, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Mikhail Lapshin, Petr Romanov, Aman Tuleyev, Sergey Glazyev, Sergey Baburin, Vasiliy Lipitskiy, Aleksandr Tsipko, and others. The list remains open; the movement is ready to admit anyone who is concerned over Russia's fate. At present, the movement's founders themselves are worried most of all by the threat of "a junta-style palace coup." Valeriy Zorkin said at the new movement's first press conference: "The signs of a coup are evident. Currently, analytical memos of this sort have been drawn up and are circulating, various coup theories are under discussion. Something similar occurred on the eve of 20 March and 21 September of last year. It is well known that subsequently the forecasts spelled out in the analytical memos proved to be correct." Zorkin's fears were shared by Gennadiy Zyuganov. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA has managed to obtain an analytical memo. (It is published in a slightly abridged form.) Confidentially Theory 1 (according to information as of 16 March 1994) Attention! Upon the emergence of a new theory the previous ones are discarded. According to available information, a group of statesmen -- First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets, General Staff Chief M. Kolesnikov, and Moscow Mayor Y. Luzhkov -- plan to make an attempt to depose Boris Yeltsin. V. Shumeyko, M. Poltoranin, B. Mikhaylov, chairman of the Russian Federation committee on the press (apparently B. Mironov -- editorial board), reportedly also belong to the group... Those listed above have already held tentative talks with P. Grachev, V. Yerin, and S. Stepashin, and by employing various arguments managed to obtain their agreement not to take countermeasures. In addition, B. Mikhaylov is currently trying to establish contacts with Ye. Primakov's inner circle. A pretext for launching the action should be an address by a prominent public figure or an industrialist on the "Ostankino" first television channel putting forward the initiative in question and giving as reasons the deterioration of the president's health and his physical inability to run the country. To substantiate the argument, a television documentary should be shown portraying the president as a man of poor health and a heavy drinker at that. Then the aforementioned statesmen plan to initiate through their allies at the State Duma the constitutional procedure of handing provisional presidential powers over to V. Chernomyrdin so as to hold emergency presidential elections in the country within the next three months. The chiefs and activists of the Russian Federation Communist Party State Duma faction are aware of the group's plans, and Chernomyrdin's assumption of power suits them, but they are displeased with the presence of Yu. Luzhkov in the group. According to available reports, the action is scheduled to be carried out in March, the deadline is April of this year. Considered as a preliminary option is the imposition of a state of emergency or some elements of it, possibly on limited territories, under the pretext of the difficult economic situation and the struggle against crime. The first attempt to start the action was made 10 March -- on that day Yu. Skokov was scheduled to made a television address and a corresponding documentary was to be shown. Typically, V. Chernomyrdin himself left on that day for Nizhniy Novgorod and then set out for Finland. P. Grachev was in Germany at the time. The attempt fell through, however, because A. Yakovlev, chief of the "Ostankino" State Television and Radio Company, refused to accord television air time and advised the president's inner circle of the intentions. Immediately afterward, a number of those who were directly or indirectly involved in the action left Moscow: Yu. Skokov for Germany, M. Kolesnikov for France (he will return on 16 March). S. Stepashin was hospitalized. On that same week when the unsuccessful attempt to depose Boris Yeltsin was made and also during the preceding two or three weeks a whole range of politicians, primarily those in opposition to the president, made statements about the need for Boris Yeltsin to resign one way or another and for early presidential elections to be held... Former British Prime Minister Edward Heath and former U.S. President Richard Nixon have visited Moscow to meet with domestic party leaders in order to figure out the alignment of political forces and plans with regard to future presidential elections. Despite the initial failure, the group of the aforementioned statesmen have not given up their plans to depose Boris Yeltsin by using an approximately similar plan of action. Currently, talks are under way with R. Vyakhirev, chief of the Gazprom joint-stock company, to persuade him to deliver an address Yu. Skokov failed to make. Given that, it is noteworthy that P. Grachev has postponed his working visit to the Leningrad Military District, which was scheduled for 14 March. This was done at the eleventh hour, when airplanes with a Defense Ministry delegation and a group of journalists had already left for St. Petersburg... On the whole, the Armed Forces leadership can be divided into two groups: Boris Yeltsin's "loyalists," who have repeatedly expressed their commitment to the incumbent president, including P. Grachev and his first deputy, G. Kondratyev; and the "opposition" represented by General Staff Chief M. Kolesnikov and Deputy Defense Minister A. Kokoshin. According to available information, Deputy Defense Minister A. Kokoshin maintains close ties with O. Soskovets; he regularly does various services to him, his deputies, and relatives. A. Kokoshin and O. Soskovets meet virtually twice or three times a week. On 15 March, from 1700 to 1800 P. Grachev met with V. Chernomyrdin. The subject of the meeting has not been disclosed. The very fact of its taking place has not been publicized. What this might mean... The OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board has asked Aleksandr Yakovlev, chairman of the Federal Television and Radio Service, whether Yuriy Skokov was indeed scheduled to make a television address. Aleksandr Nikolayevich said that Skokov did not approach him in that regard, but there was a "sideways" phone call that warned Yakovlev that such an address was being planned. Oleg Poptsov, chairman of the All-Russian State Television and Radio Company, has also received a phone call: ARGUMENTY I FAKTY's correspondent asked him to explain why Russian television denied Yuriy Skokov air time. To all appearances, we are dealing with a clear mystification, an anonymous letter, nothing more. And a fairly rough fabrication at that. The authors' bottom line is only too evident: to compromise a number of the president's closest allies, such as Yuriy Luzhkov, to smear the "power" ministers, to sideline promising politicians by, say, resuscitating "the Skokov threat" -- in a word, to plunge into a regular palace intrigue. This should not, however, be dismissed as an innocuous joke. In principle, a coup d'etat or something of the kind may well be organized this way, too: by "warming up" the situation, pitting influential politicians against each other, ratcheting up the psychosis of universal suspiciousness and provoking the authorities into taking inadequate "security measures." This is a technology in the struggle for power. Definitely, a dirty one. But everyone struggles as one can.
