The aim is to accelerate environmental work in the East. It is of crucial importance for improved and increased environmental work in the countries of Eastern Europe that they have access to cheaper forms of finance for their environmental investments -- in water and air purification installations, for example. So said Environment Minister Svend Auken (Social Democratic Party) who has invited all his East European counterparts to Copenhagen for the first three days in June to discuss "soft loans" in the environmental field in order to exert pressure on international banks. The environment ministers from the three Baltic countries, Russia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine have accepted the invitation. This is the fist time that so many East European environment ministers will have been brought together. "Like the countries of Eastern Europe Denmark is tired of the fact that reports are written and large-scale investigations are carried out without anything coming of them," Svend Auken said yesterday when he announced the meeting. "Now we want to show that something can be done." Svend Auken has long been pressing the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development], for example, to grant cheaper "soft loans" with lower interest rates, longer repayment periods, and a repayment-free period if the loan is for environmental purposes. Today international banks do not have different interest rates for purely commercial loans and environmental loans. This is slowing down the environmental work in Eastern Europe whose countries with their weak currencies need an immediate economic return rather than an environmental return from their investments. "The idea behind the meeting is to influence the decisionmaking processes of the banks, but also to make this into a major issue when we meet in Sofia next year at the pan-European environment conference," Auken said. Representatives of the EBRD, the World Bank, The European Investment Bank, and the EU [European Union] Commission have also been invited to the meeting in Copenhagen.
