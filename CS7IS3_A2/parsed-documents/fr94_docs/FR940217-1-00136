FR940217-1-00136 FR940217-1-00016 Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposed safety zone will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small business concerns under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). The small entities affected by this proposed rule are commercial fishing activities at the deepwater port. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposed safety zone will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposed rule does not require the collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have federalism implications and does not warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. LOOP is located beyond State waters where only Federal jurisdiction applies. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2(c) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposed rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This rule will not result in significant impact on the quality of the human environment, as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES.
