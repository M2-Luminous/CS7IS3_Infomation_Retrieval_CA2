The bulletin said: Since the arrival of flood season south of the lower reaches of the Chang Jiang, the Min Jiang in Fujian and the Xi Jiang in Guangxi were hit by relatively bigger floods; torrential rains and flooding occurred in parts of such provinces as Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Hunan; and major rock-falling disasters occurred in Wulong County, Sichuan, resulting in rather serious economic losses. Water situations in other rivers, streams, and lakes are basically stable. The bulletin said: A stable rain belt which was formed by the mutual effect of warm and cold air, and which has persisted since 12 June from the northern part of southern China to the southern part of areas situated to the south of the lower reaches of the Chang Jiang, has successively caused flooding in the Xi Jiang in Guangxi and the Bei Jiang in Guangdong. At 1400 and 2100 [0600 and 1300 GMT] on 15 June, flood waters moving at 10,100 cubic meters [m] per second and 10,050 cubic m per second successively hit the Rong Jiang and the Long Jiang, tributaries of the Xi Jiang. After these two streams of flood waters converged and entered the Liu Jiang, a flood crest was observed at the Liuzhou Station along the Liu Jiang at 0600 today. The crest, with a water level reaching 88.53 m and a flow capacity of 25,000 cubic m per second, was the third biggest flood water recorded since the founding of the PRC. Our preliminary understanding is that Liuzhou City and Prefecture were partly flooded, with flood water levels generally reaching 2-3 m, and two people were reported dead at the time this news dispatch was sent. At 1000 today, water level measured at the Liuzhou Station along the Liu Jiang had dropped to 88.45 m. However, moderate to torrential rainfall would persist in the Xi Jiang reaches, with heavy rains falling in part of those areas. It is estimated that the flooding would possibly continue for some time. Following the natural disaster, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional party committee and people's government immediately convened an emergency meeting to arrange flood fighting and emergency measures. The general office of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters also sent specially designated personnel to Guangxi to aid in flood fighting and relief work. Since early June, scarce rainfall has continued to cause drought in most of northern China, the western regions of northeast China, and the provinces and autonomous regions of Shandong, Ningxia, and Qinghai. Statistics compiled by the end of 14 June showed that an area totaling 12.87 million hectares in the nation was hit by drought. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hebei Province, and Shandong Province each had over 2 million hectares of areas hit by drought.
