Speaking to the press here, an official spokesman for the European Union executive added how this year the report from the U.S. trade representative was much better than previous years in the sense that there was less criticism of the European Union and even recognition that many problems between the United States and the European Union had been resolved over the past months. This is also due to the end of the Uruguay Round negotiations to renew the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which governs world trade. At the same time, the spokesman stressed how the European Commission remain concerned over the threats implied in the Kantor report, in particular those of sanctions in the field of public contracts and the safeguarding of intellectual property.
