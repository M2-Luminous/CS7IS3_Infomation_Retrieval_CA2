Last week, in fact, Jean Sollier, SEP's CEO, confirmed "the perfect agreement" prevailing on this issue with Gerard Renon, SNECMA's CEO. He, in turn, had recently stated that it was a "natural" idea to merge the brake (Messier-Bugatti) and brake disks (SEP) manufacturers. It also "makes sense" to Jean Sollier "to ally the aircraft brakes manufacturer and the supplier of carbon-carbon disks." According to him, such activities presently account for nearly FF700 million at Messier-Bugatti (that controls between one quarter and one fifth of the carbon brakes market in aerospace) and for about FF170 million at SEP for aircraft and automobile brake disks. Still, nothing has yet been done for this regrouping. As SEP's president says: "The industrial project still needs to be built, the formula for association spelled out, participations regulated, etc." He emphasized that "if the merger is to occur, it will obviously be in 1994!" For, as he puts it: "This merger will allow the new team to win market shares. The prospects are good." And over a few years the activity could engender more than FF1 billion in turnover, considering that the two teams already are well established in civilian and military aircraft brakes, with the Airbus and the Mirage 2000. It is Jean Sollier's view that the joint team could also launch into brakes for trucks and the railway. SEP has already made a stab in this direction, for example, with Formula-1 carbon brake disks and those for top-of-the-line cars (Venturi and Bugatti) and trials on high-speed trains. But real development would come from equipping trucks, busses and rail coaches, and even future generations of the Very High-Speed Train [TGV]. But if the merger of brake and disk activities between Messier-Bugatti and SEP is successful (in several months), Jean Sollier will already have won the wager made in 1990 to diversify SEP's consolidated activity upwards of FF1 billion in 1995. It represents a gambit that already saw the opening move made last year with the buy-back from GEC-Alsthom of its (50 percent) share in Carbone Industrie that will realize a turnover of more than FF230 million in 1993.
