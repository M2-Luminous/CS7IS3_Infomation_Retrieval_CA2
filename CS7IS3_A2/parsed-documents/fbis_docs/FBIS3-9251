Now the same tune is being sung again, but this time in a little more pragmatic manner, allegedly to break the current parliamentary bottleneck, which is becoming increasingly unpleasant for the PDSR leaders. Nothing is being done now, just as nothing was done then, for the simple reason that there is no desire for any action. A member of the ruling party leadership told us a few days ago that under the current circumstances it is impossible to establish a PDSR-opposition government. The strongest explanation for this is the danger that the PDSR might split as a result of such a government. "There are too many of those who oppose such an alliance to allow us to disregard their wishes. The main promoter of this opinion is none other than Adrian Nastase, the executive president of the party. He is afraid of an alliance with the opposition not because he is a member of the conservative wing of the party but because he is a very cautious man, even excessively cautious. However, in politics, one also needs courage to assume certain risks." Adrian Nastase does not want to take any risks. He believes that it is too dangerous to break off with former allies merely for the sake of the opposition. Even though on diplomatic channels he is constantly receiving signals that confirm the wish of the West that the opposition should participate in the government. Because of his obstinacy, Adrian Nastase's relations with the honorary president of the PDSR, Oliviu Gherman, have considerably deteriorated of late. He would be ready to take risks and has already succeeded in convincing even Ion Iliescu about the importance of showing greater courage in politics. Gherman's latest disappointment is that it is that same Adrian Nastase who has recently saved a well-known extremist leader. Afraid that sacrificing this extremist leader would bring about isolation and the loss of certain faithful allies, PDSR Executive President Adrian Nastase made every possible effort and definitively eliminated the danger that seemed inevitable for the leader.
