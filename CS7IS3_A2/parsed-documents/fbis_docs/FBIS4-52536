(Kotra) said. South Korea had exported about 30 million dollars worth of apples and pears to Taiwan while importing the same amount in bananas from that nation until August 1992, when the two countries severed diplomatic ties. The decision to open its market to apples, pears, grapes and peaches is part of Taiwan's efforts to preclude possible problems in joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which champions free trade. Kotra said Taiwan must join GATT this year if it wants to become a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which replaces GATT next year. The Taiwanese Government will allocate a 20,000-ton import quota for apples this year to those countries which have been previously excluded from the quota system, according to Kotra. Only the United States and Canada had been allowed to export apples to Taiwan. Taiwan plans to expand the quota to 30,000 tons next year and to 50,000 tons in 1999 before allowing a free flow of apples into the country in 2000, Kotra said. The Taiwanese Government will also allocate a 2,000-ton import quota for pears to Asian countries in 1995 and expand the quota to 4,000 tons by 2000, Kotra said. Seoul and Taipei have been negotiating the resumption of apple and pear exports to Taiwan since January, when the Taiwanese established a liaison office in the South Korean capital.
