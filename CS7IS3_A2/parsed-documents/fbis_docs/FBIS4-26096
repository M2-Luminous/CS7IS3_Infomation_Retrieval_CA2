According to information released by the national conference on the foreign affairs of courts now being held in Haikou, from 1983 to 1993, the supreme court sent a total of 125 delegations (groups) of 429 people abroad for visits; received 113 foreign delegations of 554 members; established ties with courts in nearly 100 countries and regions; and conducted exchanges with the International Court and other international organizations. Beijing's successful hosting of the 14th World Law Congress in 1990 gave a strong impetus to promoting China's judicial exchanges with foreign countries and won the international community's understanding and support. In a written speech to the conference, Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and president of the Supreme People's Court, emphasized: Courts' foreign affairs are an important component of the government's overall diplomacy. People's courts should learn from the useful experiences of other countries' courts in continuing to improve and perfect a socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics so as to better fulfill the judicial tasks laid on them by the constitution and to better serve the socialist modernization drive. Courts' foreign affairs work should play a more active role and make greater contributions in this area.
