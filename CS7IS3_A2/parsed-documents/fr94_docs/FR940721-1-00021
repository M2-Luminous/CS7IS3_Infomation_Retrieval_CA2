FR940721-1-00021 FR940721-1-00009 II. Evaluation Criteria The 1990 Amendments revised section 107(d)(3)(E) to provide five specific requirements that an area must meet in order to be redesignated from nonattainment to attainment. 1. The area must have attained the applicable NAAQS; 2. The area has met all relevant requirements under section 110 and part D of the Act; 3. The area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k) of the Act; 4. The air quality improvement must be permanent and enforceable; 5. The area must have a fully approved maintenance plan pursuant to section 175A of the Act. III. Review of State Submittal The Michigan redesignation request for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area will meet the five requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E), noted above, if the VOC RACT ``fix-up,'' 5 and ``catch-up,'' 6 and major non-CTG submittals 7 , the 1990 base year emission inventory, basic I/M, and the section 182(f) NO X exemption petition are also fully approved by the USEPA. 8 Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, USEPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request. USEPA's Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD contains a more in-depth analysis of the submittal with respect to certain of these evaluation criteria. 5 Section 182(b)(2) of the Act requires that moderate and above ozone nonattainment areas adopt RACT rules for three types of sources or source categories, i.e. RACT for source categories covered by the CTGs and for major sources that are not subject to a CTG, regardless of time of nonattainment designation. 6 Section 182(a)(2)(A) of the Act requires that ozone nonattainment areas submit rules and corrections to existing VOC rules that were required under the section 172(b)(3) RACT provision of the pre-amended Act (and related guidance). 7 Rules for major non-CTG sources are a requirement under the Section 182(b)(2) catch-ups. 8 The emission statement program was fully approved in a final rulemaking action on March 8, 1994 (59 FR 10752). 1. Attainment of the ozone NAAQS The Michigan request is based on an analysis of quality-assured ozone air quality data which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. Ambient air ozone monitoring data for calendar year 1991 through calendar year 1993 9 show an expected exceedance rate for the ozone standard of less than 1.0 per year of the ozone NAAQS in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area (40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H). Because the Detroit-Ann Arbor area has complete quality-assured data showing no violations of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period, the Detroit-Ann Arbor area has met the first statutory criterion of attainment of the ozone NAAQS. The State committed to continue monitoring in this area in accordance with 40 CFR part 58. (If, however, complete quality assured data shows violations of the ozone NAAQS before the final USEPA action on this redesignation, the USEPA proposes that it disapprove the redesignation request.) 9 The redesignation request documentation presents 1990&hyph;1992 ambient air quality monitoring data demonstrating that the Detroit-Ann Arbor area attained the ozone NAAQS. In order to submit the redesignation request before November 15, 1993, Michigan prepared most of this documentation during the 1993 ozone season, when the 1993 ozone data was not available. However, the USEPA reviewed the ambient monitoring data for 1993 contained in AIRS which demonstrates that the area continues to attain the ozone NAAQS.
