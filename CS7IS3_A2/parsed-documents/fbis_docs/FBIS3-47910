Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic champion for reunification, on his sudden death and sharing pains with the South Korean people, and proposed to have a contact between working officials of both sides at the conference room of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission at Panmunjom at 10:00 AM on January 21 to discuss working matters concerning it. But the contact between the working officials of both sides failed to be held today owing to the unjustifiable attitude of the South side. The South Korean authorities did not come out to contact without a reply telephone message, avoiding our compatriotic and courtesy proposal for a consolatory visit under an inhuman, illegal, unjust and unreasonable pretext contrary to common sense. The North side representatives in Panmunjom of the North-South liaison office informed the South side of our stand concerning the contact at 09;00 this morning by telephone and urged it to come out to the contact but it evaded the contact, not saying a word. The working officials of the North side failed to discuss the Seoul visit of our mourners' group with the South side and, accordingly, the group failed to go to Seoul and mourn the late Rev Mun Ik-hwan on January 22 [as received], the funeral day, as scheduled. The behaviour of the South Korean authorities who refused to accept the North side mourner's group this time showed that they are not human beings, far from being the same nation, and they have neither ancestral manners and customs nor courtesy and morality.
