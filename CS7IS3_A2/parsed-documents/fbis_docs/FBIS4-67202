State Department Counselor Tim Wirth's proposal to reverse U.S. action and widen contacts with Rangoon is badly misguided. His senior rank among U.S. officials lends unwarranted emphasis to his call for a new American policy on Burma. U.S. direction on Asian relations has recently come under internal fire from major Clinton administration officials. Mr Wirth's sudden and confusing recommendation for reversal of a stable Burma policy needs to be quickly clarified. Mr Wirth is a former U.S. senator, with acknowledged expertise on narcotics matters. In an interview with the REUTER news agency last week, he recommended "more dialogue" between Washington and the Rangoon junta. Without providing details, Mr Wirth said such contact would reduce a huge outflow of heroin to the United States and other countries. He recommended ignoring the continuing and massive repression of Burmese in favor of his emphasis on the drugs problem. "I'm thinking of young people on the streets of the United States of America who are directly impacted by that," he told his interviewer. "That should be our priority." Not even our own government's policy of "constructive engagement" is as cynical as Mr Wirth's proposal. The U.S. official's proposal would completely overlook the massive and violent abuses of Burmese citizens; At least the Thai--and ASEAN--approaches to Rangoon aim at reversing repression by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). Mr Wirth, as a former politician, may feel he still must serve an exclusively American population. The only satisfaction we can draw is from a fellow official in the State Department who said Mr Wirth's proposal was "unlikely to be met with much enthusiasm." Available evidence shows SLORC has neither the desire nor the ability to launch an effective anti-narcotics program. SLORC leader Lt Gen Khin Nyunt claimed last January his regime would move against narcotics peddling. The reality has been the opposite. An alleged military attack on warlord Khun Sa evaporated two months ago without a single gain. Opium growing and heroin refining continues to grow in northern Burma. SLORC has shown no commitment to combat such growth. In addition, troubling reports of direct links between narcotics dealers and SLORC officials continue unabated. The proposal to put Rangoon and Washington on an equal diplomatic footing is misguided. Since it took power in 1988 over the bodies of thousands of dead citizens, SLORC has shown few signs of compassion. For five years, it has kept its best-known and most peaceful citizen imprisoned at home. Aung San Suu Kyi said in a recent interview she remains determined to continue her struggle for a democratic Burma. The world's only superpower should do no less. There may be no absolutes in diplomatic affairs. But the lack of goodwill from SLORC is clear. Mr Wirth's proposal to give status to the Rangoon junta in the mere hope it might respond is misguided. SLORC has had many years and opportunities to improve its image through direct action. Instead, it has continued one of the most repressive systems of governments of our day. There are several opinions and policies about how to change this. Mr Wirth's proposal merely to overlook them and to have faith that heroin exports will decline is a major act of faith. Beside this, the Thai government's hope that a slow increase in economic and diplomatic relations will encourage an easing of SLORC's tyranny seems like a paragon. The chief U.S. policy-maker for Asian affairs, Winston Lord, complained last week that U.S.-Asian relations have been sliding for the past six months. The confusing statement from Mr Wirth tends to back up this claim. United States policy towards Burma has been clear, and firm, since 1988. Indeed, Mr Lord himself said a week ago that Washington intended to continue to disagree with ASEAN on the matter. "The United States wants Burma isolated while ASEAN is pursuing a policy of engagement," he said. If Washington is going to change this policy, it owes its allies a clear warning. If, as it should, the U.S. intends to continue to press SLORC for change, it must make this clear. Mr Wirth's statement has caused confusion. The Clinton administration should clear it up quickly.
