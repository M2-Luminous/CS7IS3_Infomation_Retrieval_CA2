This was the first sentence uttered by Abulaiti Abudurexiti, newly elected chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, during an interview with our reporter. His words lead us to believe he is a modest person. Chairman Abulaiti Abudurexiti graduated from Xinjiang Engineering Institute in the 1960's and spent more than a decade at a drawing desk. His leadership and understanding of work concerning the overall situation gradually matured after he held the posts of autonomous regional planning commission chairman and autonomous regional vice chairman. The great trust placed in him by the party and people have made him feel that his responsibility is heavier now. He said: "The burden is heavier, but with the correct leadership of the party Central Committee and the autonomous regional party committee; with support and help from people of all nationalities in Xinjiang and veteran comrades who have accumulated rich experience; with the sound foundation laid and rich experience accumulated by previous governments which governed from the period of the autonomous region's founding to the time when Comrade Tomur Dawamat was in charge; and with the formation last year of the Eighth Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional People's Government -- a good working body which is united, pragmatic, and full of fighting power -- we will be able to fulfill all tasks entrusted to us by the party and people by uniting closely, lending each other support, fully enhancing collective wisdom and functions, being honest in performing official duties, and fulfilling our duties and responsibilities." Chairman Abulaiti Abudurexiti smiled and was full of confidence. After becoming autonomous regional vice chairman, Abulaiti Abudurexiti was put in charge of capital construction in the autonomous region. In the past few years he travelled from the north to south of Tian Shan to capital construction sites. Upon arrival, he would consult with relevant experts and scholars on technical questions concerning the construction projects, conducted inspections and surveys, and provided guidance at the sites. For a few months each year, he was busy rushing about among the grass roots. He therefore has a clear understanding of the extent of development of various undertakings in the autonomous region. He said: "During the transition from an old to a new system, a frontier ethnic minority region like ours, which has a weak foundation, will face some new conflicts and questions and many difficulties in reform, opening up, and economic development. Therefore, we should further emancipate our minds; take into consideration Xinjiang's realities when focusing on the central task of economic construction; fully arouse the enthusiasm of all sectors; enhance our natural resource assets and geographical superiority; consolidate and develop the political situation characterized by stability and unity; complete all tasks awaiting this government with one heart and one mind; and attain the objective of increasing the total annual value of goods and services for the autonomous region 5.66 times by 1997, in order to lay the foundation for increasing the total annual value eight times by the end of this century. In conclusion, Chairman Abulaiti Abudurexiti indicated that he will, as always, use his pragmatic workstyle and do all he can to justify the great trust placed in him by people of all nationalities in the region, and show his gratitude for the people's support by producing actual results.
