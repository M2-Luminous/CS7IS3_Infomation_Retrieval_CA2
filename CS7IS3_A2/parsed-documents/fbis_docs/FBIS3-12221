In its contacts, the Jordanian Government held Israel responsible for the incident and its consequences. It urged the international community to assume its responsibilities toward putting an end to such acts that desecrate holy places, terrorize secure citizens, and escalate violence. In this context, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs, summoned separately the ambassadors of the UN permanent member states -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, and Russia -- the ambassador of Greece, in its capacity as the current chairman of the European Union, and the ambassador of Indonesia, the current chairman of the Nonaligned Movement, to his office in the Foreign Ministry. He conveyed to them the Jordanian Government's condemnation and denunciation of this criminal incident against innocent, defenseless worshipers and the violation of the sanctity of holy places. The Jordanian Government held Israel fully responsible for this massacre and urged it to conduct an immediate investigation, since it provides for the settlers' weapons, freedom of movement, and access to holy places.
