V. Bogdan, A. A. Grom, and A. F. Goncharenko, NPO ``Khimtekstilmash,'' Chernigov; UDC677.021.12] [Abstract] Tire cord is presently still being produced in the classical method which includes filament making, stretching and pre-twisting, twisting, and weaving. The stretching and twisting operations are carried out on type KV-III-250 KA twisting-stretching machines and on the single process KO-228 twisting machine. These obsolete, noisy, and difficult to maintain machines operate at low speeds not exceeding 177 meters per minute with 2.85 kg packets being produced. The NPO ``Khimtekstilmash'' and the Chernigov PO ``Khimvolokno'' developed a new process to produce single wound tire cord. The process includes four sequential operations: forming the filament, stretching, twisting, and weaving it. The stretching and twisting operations are carried out on new high-output machines, winding-stretching machine NV-400-KT24M and twisting machine KD-600-IK. The new process turns out high strength single wound capron filament for production of grade 35KNTS-O tire cord. Figures 2.
