Baysa] [Text] The AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Civil Relations Service (CRS) yesterday revealed the propaganda war between two rival factions in the underground movement. The CRS said the word war is raging between the Stalinist and the breakaway revisionist blocs. The Stalinist group is reportedly controlled by Jose Ma. Sison, self-exiled Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) chairman. The CRS said based on seized CPP documents, the Stalinist bloc has intensified a re-education and indoctrination campaign to counter the headway by the other faction. Sison's followers accused members of the rival faction of involving themselves with "the bourgeoisie proletariat" instead of aligning with peasant workers and masses in the countryside. They assailed the tendency of the revisionists to sympathize with the economic policies of President Ramos as "tantamount to the alliance with the government." In the Southern Tagalog Region, the tug-of-war shows the extent of the schism in the communist movement, the CRS added.
