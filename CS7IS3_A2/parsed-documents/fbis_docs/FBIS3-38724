The ministers reiterated their governments' commitment to regional peace and stability. From this perspective, they examined regional developments, highlighting the overall situation in Iraq, and laying special emphasis on the situation in northern and southern Iraq. The ministers also underscored the extreme importance of safeguarding Iraq's unity and territorial integrity, noting that this is important for peace and stability in the region. They underlined the importance their governments have attached to this issue, something that was reflected in the resolutions passed by the UN Security Council in the aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The ministers stressed the need for Iraq to commit itself to the framework set by the relevant UN resolutions so that it may rejoin the international community. They also urged Iraq to make additional efforts toward that end by extending full cooperation to the United Nations. The ministers examined the situation in northern Iraq, and urged the Iraqi Government to remove all restrictions against Iraqis there. They expressed their strong convictions that the ways and means of normalizing the situation in northern Iraq must be explored in Iraq. This should be done, the ministers maintained, through dialogue and through creating a climate of peace and security for the Iraqis living there. The ministers renewed their determination to resist all attempts to disintegrate Iraq under any pretext. They expressed their strong belief that the future of Iraq must be determined by the free will of the entire Iraqi people on the basis of equality, democracy, and good neighborly ties. Within this context, the statements and activities promoting partition by certain groups in some Western states are unacceptable, and must be halted. The ministers renewed their condemnation of the terrorism targeting their countries, and expressed determination to take all possible measures to achieve peace, stability, and tranquility in the region. The ministers agreed to continue their consultations to safeguard the region's security and stability on the basis of the principles enshrined in the UN Charter, such as according due respect to the territorial integrity of states, nonintervention in the domestic affairs of states, and peaceful resolution of conflicts. The ministers decided to hold their next meeting in Damascus in July 1994. A committee of senior officials will meet one month before the convocation of the foreign ministers' meeting to prepare for this meeting.
