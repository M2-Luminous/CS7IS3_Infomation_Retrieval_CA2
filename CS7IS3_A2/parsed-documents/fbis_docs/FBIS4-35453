[passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] According to what we have announced and as you mentioned, we can say that your present visit is a farewell one to his excellency the president before your blessed journey to Jericho, God willing. What are the certain guarantees which we can talk about in the future when we mention the implementation of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho first as being an effective start for the full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and consequently for the setting up of a free independent Palestinian state on this land? ['Arafat] The sole guarantee is our people and the sole guarantee is our Arab brothers who stand by us and the sole guarantee is our friends in the world who stand by us. It is known that we only get things with difficulty and it is no coincidence that we have been negotiating for more than two and a half years and what for, for a transitional period and we are still negotiating with our Arab brothers and despite that, we have not been able to reach that, and there are still negotiations on the Syrian track, and on the Palestinian track which will continue, and there are also negotiations on the Lebanese and Jordanian tracks until we are able to reach a just and comprehensive solution on all the Arab tracks and not only on the Jordanian, Palestinian, Syrian, or Lebanese tracks [sentence as heard].
