The minister of national defense will present it to the Sejm before the end of the month. [Correspondent] In the document, two options are presented for the division of competences between a civilian minister of national defense and the commanders of the Army. Under the first, the chief commander of the Army--the post has not yet been given a name--is subordinate in military matters to the head of the armed forces, i.e., the president. The civilian minister of national defense will only exert administrative-political control. [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] This option will, I believe, require legalization of this post, constitutional legalization of this post, and making the commander in chief constitutionally responsible for matters like battle readiness, mobilization, drawing up operational plans, and standard of military training. At the moment, the minister of national defense bears this responsibility. [end recording] [Correspondent] The second option aims at the president exerting command through a civilian minister, who works out the tasks for the armed forces and supervises their execution, but without interference in matters of command.
