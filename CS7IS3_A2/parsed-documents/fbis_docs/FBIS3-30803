The Serb aggressor fired heavily with Brovings, antiaircraft guns and M-84 machine guns at the entire defense line of the free Brcko territory. The heaviest fire was directed last night at the central part of the Brcko front, where the enemy pounded our positions with 60-mm and 82-mm mortars from armored combat vehicles. The grouping of the aggressor's forces is continuing, but the enemy has serious problems with his manpower. At 1820 last night a new clash took place and small arms fire was exchanged among chetniks in Spomenik near Brod, the chetniks being those who had previously burned down Muslim houses at Brod.
