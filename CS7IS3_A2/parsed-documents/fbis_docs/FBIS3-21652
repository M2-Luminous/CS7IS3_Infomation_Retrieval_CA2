"We demand an apology from the US government over the involvement of its two diplomatic staff in the crime of drug trafficking," said members of the group, which claims to belong to the Front for Indonesian Youths Saviour. One leader, haranguing the crowd through a megaphone, said the United States was influencing Indonesian youth with what he called a destructive culture, was unfair towards the Moslem world and was always forcing its interests on others. "America, out ... America, AIDS ... America, narcotics ..." the crowd alternately yelled, as well as calling for the hanging of the two embassy staff. The crowd, which according to police estimates numbered 2,000 people, delivered a statement to the US Embassy. The embassy's spokesman was not available for comment. The demonstration leader also blamed the unrealization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's (NATO) threat to launch an airstrike on Serbian positions in Bosnia on pressures from Washington. Washington, he said, was also trying to pressure Indonesia, the world's largest Moslem-populated nation, to open ties with Israel. Indonesia, with about 88 percent of its 186 million population following Islam, is a staunch supporter of the Palestinian and Arab cause, and has no diplomatic ties with Israel. Reading out parts of the statement handed to the embassy, they also accused US diplomats [of] "contempt for Indonesian laws," for sending two embassy staff members, accused last month of drug trafficking, to the United States last week. The embassy has said the men would be court martialed in the United States. The demonstrators demanded that the two Americans, identified as Joseph Bryner and Michael Karajin, be returned to Indonesia for trial and that the embassy apologize for their conduct. The two, one holding diplomatic immunity, were among four foreigners and two Indonesian nabbed by the police here for their alleged involvement in the trade of a dangerous drug, known as Ecstasy. The group, also said Washington needs to be fair and honest in viewing the rise of Islam and its followers and avoid the influence of the Jewish lobby when determining its foreign policy. The group dispersed peacefully by themselves before police made any move to end the demonstration. There were no arrests, witnesses said.
