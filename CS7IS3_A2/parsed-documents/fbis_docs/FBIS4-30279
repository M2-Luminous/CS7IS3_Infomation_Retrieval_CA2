Pakistani Embassy First Secretary Mushtaq Haider Rizvi said last night that Shakil Ahmad was freed without any charges lodged against him. The man was handed over to the embassy on Friday by the Special Branch which said he was not involved in any plot and had done nothing wrong. Mr Rizvi said Ammad was expected to fly home today. Ahmad was apprehended at the Asian Institute of Technology [AIT] on Sunday evening after he and his friend, Mohammad Javed, tried to enter the campus. Police Chief Prathin Santipraphop quoted Ahmad as telling investigators he wanted to enter the AIT to use its telephone to make overseas call. Javed fled in a pickup truck after AIT security guards asked to see the pair's passport. Khlong Luang Police, who apprehended Ahmad, immediately handed him to the Special Branch for questioning on suspicion that he and Javed might have been trying to harm Nepalese Crown Prince Dhirendra Bir Bikram Shah who was taking a short geography course at the institute at the time. The Nepalese and Pakistani embassies have denied there was any plot by Ahmad to harm Crown Prince Shah, who is on an official visit to Thailand after completing his studies at AIT.
