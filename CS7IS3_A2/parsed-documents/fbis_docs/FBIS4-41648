The participants included Vladimir Kazimirov, a plenipotentiary representative of the Russian president and the head of the Russian mediation mission; and Morteza Bank, director general of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry. V. Kazimirov told an ITAR-TASS correspondent after the consultations that they had discussed the proposals to settle the crisis that had been put forward by Russia and within the framework of the Minsk Group of the CSCE. The Iranian representatives assessed Moscow's initiatives as "close to the requirements of reality." For our part, V. Kazimirov noted, we consider the Iranian position to be well considered and marked by an understanding of the objective situation. Iran showed an interest in achieving the swiftest possible settlement and cessation of hostilities. "In the Karabakh conflict there is no side that has not suffered," V. Kazimirov said, "and there can be no winner. Those involved in the conflict have, of course, sustained differing losses. We understand the pain of Azerbaijan, which has lost so much territory and has had to deal with the appearance of such a large number of refugees. Nor, however, have the Armenians gained anything from the war." According to the Russian presidential representative, during the consultations the Iranians did not display any partiality toward any of the sides involved in the conflict. In the course of a news conference in Tehran, Iranian President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani emphasized that the Islamic Republic is ready to do everything it can to halt the bloodshed in the Transcaucasus. Answering a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent, he stated that "Iran considers Azerbaijan to be the injured party." It was agreed that the next round of consultations will be held in Moscow.
