The paper recalls the Security Council resolutions that said disarming Iraq should be part of a process to rid the Middle East of all weapons of mass destruction and to establish a new security order in the region. While acknowledging that the effort to control armaments in the region is primarily linked with an Arab-Israeli settlement, the paper, in its editorial today, adds that the part of these resolutions that has been implemented involves Iraq alone. AL-AHRAM stresses that the Iraqi threat, which some parties used as an excuse in the past, no longer exists. It adds: Further, achieving progress in the efforts to control armaments will necessarily create a better climate for boosting the overall settlement process.
