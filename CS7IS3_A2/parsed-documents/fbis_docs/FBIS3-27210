The municipality's major party and government officials, Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju, saw Deng off at the railway station. A source said Deng Xiaoping's special train was heading northward for Beijing, but he did not rule out the possibility that the train might go to other cities. The schedules of all trains arriving and leaving the Shanghai station this morning were changed unexpectedly. Passengers were given the explanation that the change was due to the departure of a special train from Minhang, Shanghai, carrying a Long March rocket to the Xichang satellite launching base. Deng Xiaoping has spent the Spring Festival in Shanghai in the past few years since 1988. He showed up in public on the Spring Festival this year, which has caused various speculations on his health. According to those who were present at the railway station seeing Deng Xiaoping off, he looked in pretty good shape [jing shen bu cuo 4737 4377 0008 6934] today. And Deng Xiaoping's being able to travel by train may be in itself a reply to people's speculations. Chen Yun, who also passed the Spring Festival and made a public appearance in Shanghai as Deng did, is still in Shanghai.
