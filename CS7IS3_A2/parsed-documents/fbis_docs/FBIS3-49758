If it turns out that the Muslim and the Croatian sides indeed do not want peace, we are prepared to make a different, radical step. We could retracted the concessions. We are prepared for a solution that would lead to the end of the Bosnian crisis, either through war or peace. This was stated for our paper by Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the republic of Srpska, commenting on the assembly's decision to postpone the adoption of the platform until its session in Bijeljina on 17 January, shortly before the meeting in Geneva. Stressing that the deputies at the Pale assembly session adhered to their earlier offer [33.3 percent of the territory for the Muslims], Dr. Koljevic said that the final platform was not adopted this time because of "a possibility of the Muslims and Croats reaching a new agreement." "We certainly want the final settlement of the Bosnian crisis to be achieved peacefully, and we paid too high a price for peace, and yet it has not been established yet," Koljevic said. "This is thanks to the others, primarily to the Muslims. Serbs cannot be asked to do anything more, because while we were making certain concessions, new concessions were demanded, and the concessions that had been made earlier were quickly forgotten. These unjust concessions should finally be stopped." Asked to comment on the latest threats to Serbs with military force, Dr., Koljevic said: "Serbs have had enough of threats. Many responsible people are thinking incorrectly because they do not know Serbs, their history, and aspirations."
