In 1993, China's foreign trade reached $195.7 billion. However, while China's economy and trade are striving to move toward and converge with the outside world, it is troubled by the antidumping policies of foreign countries. Hong Kong's economy is closely linked with that of mainland China and inevitably feels the impact of antidumping moves. Concerned quarters are urging the mainland and Hong Kong to advance or retreat together and join hands to deal with this issue. According to reports from Beijing, Li Lanqing, vice premier of the State Council of China, pointed out a few days ago: The antidumping issue has an important bearing on China's export, and, if it is not properly handled, there will be the danger of complete collapse. In fact, China has been accused by foreign countries of dumping an accumulated total of more than 150 kinds of export products and has been forced to pay antidumping taxes on them. Last year alone, China was accused of dumping goods in nearly 100 cases, which directly involved over $30 billion of its export volume, constituting a considerable threat to China's exports. On 14 April last year, the Mexican Secretary of Commerce and Industrial Development announced at a press conference that Mexico would conduct an antidumping investigation into more than 4,000 types of products under 10 categories from China and, at the same time, would increase antidumping taxes by a large margin. To date, this is the world's biggest antidumping case. If things continue in this vein, the concerned official pointed out, the normal development of China's exports will certainly be adversely affected. Even if China is able to restore its status as a signatory state to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs in the future, the advantages it derives will be offset. Therefore, economic and trade circles from the mainland and Hong Kong have repeatedly called for fighting antidumping accusations. Various quarters have attached importance and have responded to this call. It has been revealed that China will formulate various measures to deal with antidumping accusations and has demanded that the problem be thoroughly solved. These measures include stepping up the formulation of an antidumping law so that there can be guiding principles for antidumping work. At the same time, China will strengthen the position and role of commercial import and export chambers and will authorize these chambers "to be responsible for organizing and coordinating antidumping accusation defense work" and to manage and coordinate the work of various trades. In addition, China will strengthen the management and control of sensitive export commodities. At the same time, China will, by inviting tenders for export quotas, levy export tariffs, implement measures such as temporary active quotas, and exercise quantitative control over some export products. China will set up an antidumping defense foundation to take a stand against antidumping accusations. China will also energetically train antidumping personnel to cope with a large amount of antidumping defense work abroad and investigation on import commodities. The Ministry of Trade and Economic Cooperation will hold an antidumping forum with the United States and the EC this year. China will also maintain close ties with Hong Kong's commercial circles in order to jointly do a good job in antidumping work and to facilitate the smooth development of foreign trade.
