Autonomous Regional Party Committee Secretary Chen Kuiyuan delivered an important speech at the meeting. Autonomous party, government, and military leaders including Guo Jinlong, Basang, (Hu Yongchu), Yang Chuantang, Lieque, (Buqung), (Lu Huimin), Puqung, Pudoje, (Tian Fujing), Baima Duoji, (Cui Jiguo), Cering Sangzhub, (Chai Dan Zhuo Ma), and (Zhou Qishun), and Zhang Zhu, political commissar of the Tibet People's Armed Police Force, attended the meeting. All cadres attending the autonomous regional discipline inspection and supervisory work conference, and leading member cadres from organs at regional, prefectural, and city levels attended the conference. Comrade Chen Kuiyuan's speech consisted of three parts: 1) basic evaluation of the anticorruption drive carried out at an earlier stage, 2) strengthening of anticorruption awareness and further enhancing self-consciousness of the anticorruption struggle, and 3) some opinions on furthering the anticorruption drive this year. Touching on conditions of the anticorruption drive carried out at an earlier stage, Comrade Chen Kuiyuan said: Since the autonomous regional party committee and government launched the anticorruption drive, overall, the attitude of party committees and governments at various levels has been resolute, and their actions have been positive with certain results being achieved. The trend of the anticorruption struggle has been favorable and its development has been healthy. Judging from the present conditions, corrupt phenomena remain very serious. The anticorruption mission has been formidable and should never be allowed to slacken. We should continue to soberly keep track of the situation and unswervingly deepen the fight against corruption so that the party's basic line can be thoroughly carried out in Tibet. Comrade Chen Kuiyuan pointed out: Anticorruption is the fundamental requirement for upholding socialism, the objective demand for developing a socialist market economy, the basic guarantee for making the party the firm leading core in socialist undertakings, and an important aspect in stabilizing the situation. All our work should proceed from reality. When we talk about anticorruption, we should direct ourselves to problems actually existing within the party and among cadres in the region, and firmly oppose them. Corrupt elements, no matter where they are, must be investigated and handled according to law and discipline. On ways to deepen the anticorruption drive this year, Comrade Chen Kuiyuan emphatically pointed out: First, we should uphold the principle of firmness, solidity, and sustainability. In carrying out the anticorruption struggle, party committees, and governments at various levels should be firm in enforcing law and discipline in their investigations and handling of party members and cadres found to be violating law and discipline. Corrupt elements should be penalized seriously. The anticorruption drive should not remain as empty talk and arrangements that have been decided in meetings and entered into documents must all be solidly translated into concrete action. Second, in unfolding anticorruption drive, we should start with the investigations and handling of law and discipline violations. Law and discipline violations committed by leading organs and cadres--which tend to cause more harm, carry far-reaching effects, and are difficult to investigate and handle--have seriously discredited the party and damaged party-masses relations. We should continue to focus the anticorruption drive on investigating and handling law and discipline violations committed by leading organs, cadres, and law enforcement, supervisory, and economic management departments, and their work personnel. Third, we should tighten political discipline and consolidate stability and unity. All members and cadres, particularly leading cadres, must thoroughly implement the party's basic line of "one center and two basic points" and resolutely safeguard the motherland's unification and nationality solidarity. Cadres who oppose the four cardinal principles, promote bourgeois liberalization, and collude with splittist forces in carrying out activities designed to split the motherland should be resolutely investigated and handled one after another. Fourth, we must exercise comprehensive control over the anticorruption drive; constantly educate the broad members and cadres in the party's guiding principles, objectives, ideals, disciplines, and fine work style as well as the correct outlook on life, values, and morality; strengthen their ability in resisting the trend of decadent ideologies, including money worship, hedonism, and ultra individualism; sum up, popularize, and strengthen fine experiences in intensifying building of party work style and clean government; and incessantly carry on the party's fine tradition and style. Fifth, we must effectively strengthen leadership over the anticorruption struggle, making it an important item on the agenda. The principal party and government leaders should personally assume leadership in solving major issues, especially deep-seated ones. Henceforth, leaders shall be made accountable for failures to advance economic work. Likewise, they shall be made responsible for failure to advance anticorruption work, and to bring corruption and unhealthy tendencies under effective control. Organizations, discipline inspection and supervisory organs, and public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments at all levels should coordinate their work in addition to assuming their respective responsibilities. Party committees and governments at all levels must support the work of discipline inspection and supervisory departments. At the same time, these departments should constantly strive to improve themselves, play the key role in the anticorruption drive, and serve Tibet's reform, development, and stability by doing their work outstandingly. At the meeting, Puqung, member of the Standing Committee of the regional party committee and deputy secretary of the regional discipline inspection commission, delivered a report entitled "Unremittingly Combat Corruption, Encourage Honesty, and Implement the Three Tasks in an All-Round Way in Order To Serve Reform, Opening to the Outside World, Economic Development, and Stability."
