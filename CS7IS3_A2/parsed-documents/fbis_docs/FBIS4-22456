Among the participants were Vice President Erik Asanbayev, deputy prime ministers, state advisers and other members of the government, top officials from the National Bank and the National Academy of Sciences, and high-ranking staff of the president's and the Cabinet of Ministers' apparat. In his address at the conference, Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized the urgent need to accelerate the corrections to the government's program of action in reforming the economy, as well as improving the organization of this work and corresponding mechanisms. Since the time of introducing the national currency, the heads of state and the government have issued more than 200 edicts, decrees, and directives of a normative-prescriptive nature on the matters of development and intensification of economic reform. Thereby a number of serious problems of a legislative nature have been resolved, and the normative base considerably updated. However, noted the president, a system approach and purposefulness are still lacking in the implementation of the entire complex of envisaged measures; there is insufficient coordination in the activities of ministries and government apparat offices in the preparation of normative-prescriptive documents and the organization of their implementation in practice. There are also disjointed actions between the National Bank and the Cabinet of Ministers in conducting a single strict financial-credit policy. Nor has the principal task of creating within the framework of the government and its structures an effective executive mechanism been resolved. As a result, the process--from the moment documents are adopted to the point of their practical implementation--is stretched out impermissibly long and most normative acts are left hanging in midair. Moreover, some of them are consciously sabotaged. This is especially typical of those acts that involve changes in the administrative structure in industrial sectors. Operational decisions and measures adopted by ministries and the National Bank often are not correlated with one another or they contradict the program line. For the purpose of streamlining this work, as well as preparing the Program of Anticrisis Measures and Economic Stabilization for 1994-1995, a republic commission was set up by the president's decree in January of this year. However, it still has not completed the draft of this important document and incorporated in it existing alternative proposals, in which there also are healthy kernels. Such procrastination is unacceptable, and it is not accidental that it causes resentment among the economic public and in the mass media. The commission should finally determine, urgently and clearly, which parts of alternative programs may be used for the benefit of the business at hand, and what should be discarded for the lack of constructive contents, and make the results public, thus putting an end to idle talk. Unenviable fate also befell the latest plan of government actions--for the implementation of economic policy in 1944. The control functions had been assigned to the Ministry of the Economy, which itself is not succeeding in the execution of this document. In addition, some ministries, bypassing the Ministry of the Economy, petition the government to move the time frame for the implementation of one or another part, or revise them. This cannot go on any longer, said Nursultan Nazarbayev. In connection with the current situation, he brought up a number of cardinal proposals aimed at accelerating development of a program to intensify the reform. The main emphasis, in the president's opinion, should be placed on increasing authority and dramatically improving the activities of executive power structures and state organs of administration. The measures necessary for this have been outlined; they are to be conducted within several areas. The first is the legal base for the reform. The normative base with respect to main economic spheres and direction of the reform, created by the president's and government's decisions since the introduction of the national currency, should be systematically organized and evaluated: in which parts such a base is sufficient, and where additional development of normative acts is needed. The next area is effective use of aid provided by the world community. All channels of financial aid from international organizations and foreign countries going through the government need to be merged within directions, economic sectors, and the republic's social sphere. It is also important to work out the main principles and mechanisms of its utilization, including program support, state structures and other institutions responsible for project implementation, and the use and repayment of credits and loans received for such use. Next: development of individual spheres of domestic economic policy. In this area it is necessary to fully evaluate the real structural transformations that have been accomplished in the national economy. Large-scale projects of national significance and ones that are ready for implementation need to be selected, and the measures of support in corresponding decisions be drafted. It is also necessary to define economic spheres and sectors that will be developing along the lines of separate programs--entrepreneurship, insurance operations, defense and other complexes--and set strict deadlines, as well as designate those responsible for the preparation of real programs. Among other subjects mentioned were the expedience of drafting five-year plans by indicators, beginning with 1995; further support for privatization processes and holding structures, giving them greater freedom of action; facilitating development of consumer goods production; increasing the volume of processing of agricultural products; reorganizing the work of the state statistics system, which in many respects still operates in the old mode; and other current problems. The decisive factor in achieving the goals set is good organization of the work of state organs and the entire executive apparat. This means that distribution of powers and functions between ministries and other government organs must be analyzed and revised, and as a result the responsibility for implementation of a specific area of economic policy clearly assigned to each. It appears that in this respect it will be necessary to eliminate the still-existing duplication of effort, which will require structural changes with sensible staff reductions. Among those who participated in the subsequent exchange of opinions were First Deputy Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, Deputy Prime Minister Zhanybek Karibzhanov, and the State Anti-Trust Policy Committee Chairman Petr Svoyikh. Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Kulagin reported on the progress of preparation for the spring sowing campaign. It has been decided to complete preparation for the program for activation of implementation of the economic reform within a compressed time frame and to discuss it immediately afterwards. The president also intends to consider in the nearest future the issues associated with denationalization and privatization, adjustments to the program of social protection of the population, housing policy, and intensification of suppression of crime.
