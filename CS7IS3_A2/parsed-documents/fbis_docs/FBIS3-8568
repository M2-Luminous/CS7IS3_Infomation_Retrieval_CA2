"Hungary's internal stability and international relations, drawing a protective net around the country, are insufficient for the security of the country. Nor is it sufficient to keep the Army on a level enabling it to defend the country. For the security of Hungary, appropriate conditions should be guaranteed for the survival of ethnic Hungarian communities abroad," Fur said. The rally was attended by members of the MDF National Presidium and the cabinet.
