Tests conducted on 840 samples of 11 farm products including rice, apples, strawberries, cucumbers and pears from 1990 to 1992 revealed that 55 percent of the samples contained farm chemicals in amounts below the permissible levels, the institute announced on Thursday. No organic chlorine-series chemicals causing chronic poisoning were found in the rice samples produced in 1990, while organic phosphorus- and carbamate-series chemicals, which are easily digested by the human body, were detected in amounts below the permissible levels. In 1992, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration detected, in tests of 5,816 samples of grain, fruit and vegetables produced in the United States, chemicals in 36.8 percent of the samples, with the chemicals in 1.2 percent being in amounts above permissible levels. The institute's director, Yi Kun-chong, said Korean agricultural products were healthy because of farmers' observance of standards for safe use of pesticides established in 1980. In Korea, no pesticides are applied to farm products after they are harvested, while some foreign countries use chemicals on their farm products after the harvest to prevent decomposition or keep them pest-free during storage or shipment for export. Yi said his institute would strive to develop safer agricultural chemicals for safer farm products.
