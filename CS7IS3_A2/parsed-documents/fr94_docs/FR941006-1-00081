FR941006-1-00081 FR941006-1-00015 The Commission welcomes comments on which approach would be preferable. Please note that, if the first approach is adopted, paragraph (A) will be unnecessary, and therefore will not be included in the final rules. If paragraph (A) is adopted, the candidate's repayment ratio will continue to be determined as of the candidate's date of ineligibility, as it is under the current rules. In an effort to improve clarity, the proposed rules would also break this section down in to separate paragraphs. The Commission welcomes comments on the proposed changes to section 9038.2(b)(2). D. Part 9039 Investigations 1. Commission Actions Following Part 9039 Investigations The Commission's review and investigatory authority for administering the matching fund program is set forth at 26 U.S.C. 9039(b). In carrying out these responsibilities, the Commission must perform a continuing review of candidate and committee reports and submissions, and other relevant information. The implementing regulations are found at 11 CFR part 9039. For the most part the Commission's review is routine, carried out in accordance with the eligibility, audit and repayment procedures contained elsewhere in the regulations. 26 U.S.C. 9039(b) and its implementing regulations provide authority to conduct audits and investigations outside of the audits required under 26 U.S.C. 9038 and 11 CFR part 9038. Most of these cases have involved issues relating to a candidate's continuing eligibility or the amount of his or her entitlement during the course of the campaign, although they could also involve a post-election inquiry. Section 9039.3 of the regulations describes how examinations, audits and investigations are conducted in these inquiries. The Commission is considering whether to provide in the final rules a fuller explanation of actions that may be taken at the conclusion of any such action. Please note that there is no specific language in the text of the proposed rules on this point. Under this approach, if the Commission decided to take no further action in a 9039 case, the candidate(s) and committee(s) involved would be so notified. If the Commission decided that there was a sufficient basis to take further action, such action would follow as closely as possible the procedures already in place for comparable situations. See e.g., 11 CFR 9033.10. For example, a post election inquiry could lead to either an additional repayment determination, in which case the procedures set forth at 11 CFR 9038.2 for making and challenging repayment determinations would apply, or a 2 U.S.C. 437g enforcement action. The Commission welcomes comments on these proposed amendments to 11 CFR part 9039. General Elections A. General Election Legal and Accounting Compliance Costs On March 1, 1994, the Commission received a Petition for Rulemaking from the Center for Responsive Politics requesting that the Commission repeal its rules providing for the use of privately-financed general election legal and accounting compliance funds [``GELAC''] in Presidential campaigns. Specifically, the petitioner seeks repeal of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(15) (last two sentences), 106.2(b)(2)(iii) (last sentence), 9002.11(b)(5), 9003.3(a), and 9035.1(c)(1). The petition argues that the Commission's rules undermine the ability of the public financing laws to achieve the objective of reducing the influence of large contributions in Presidential elections. It charges that these regulations permit evasion of the prohibition on accepting contributions to defray qualified campaign expenses established by the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act. 26 U.S.C. 9003(b). Furthermore, the petition claims that the Commission's regulations violate the spending limits established by the FECA. 2 U.S.C. 441a. On March 30, 1994, the Commission published a Notice of Availability seeking statements in support of or in opposition to the petition. 59 FR 14794 (March 30, 1994). In response to the Notice, four statements have been received from the Internal Revenue Service, Public Citizen, Common Cause, and a joint comment from the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee. Two were supportive while one opposed the reversal of the Commission's long standing policies regarding legal and accounting costs. The Internal Revenue Service found no conflict with the Internal Code or the Regulations thereunder.
