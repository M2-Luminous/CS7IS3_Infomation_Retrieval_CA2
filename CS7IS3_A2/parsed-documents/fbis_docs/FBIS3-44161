Special votes will now be cast on April 27. It was also decided to declare Friday, April 29 a public holiday. The council decision to alter the date was based on a recommendation from the seven-member management committee which steers the process. Concerns expressed by some council participants that the change could confuse voters were dismissed. Voters will be able to cast their votes between 7am and 9pm on the polling days. The council further decided to advise President F W de Klerk to proclaim the election date this Friday. Political observers explained parties would have 10 days from Friday, January 28 to register for the election. Friday's proclamation effectively meant the final deadline for a political settlement between the government and the African National Congress [ANC] and the Freedom Alliance could be stretched until the February 7 cut-off date for the registration of parties. The ANC's Mac Maharaj, defending the date change, said the management committee believed the change "will not cause a serious disruption". He said the reason for the recommended change was to coincide with the last weekend in April. A countrywide voter education programme would ensure the new dates "will be firmly imprinted on people's minds".
