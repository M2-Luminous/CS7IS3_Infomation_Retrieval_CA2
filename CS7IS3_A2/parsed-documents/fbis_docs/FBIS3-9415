Was this an invitation? [Komnenic] Of course, the Macedonian issues are first of all issues of those who live in the republic and call themselves Macedonians. We can think whatever we like on this issue, but this is how they feel. We, Serbs, you, Bulgarians, and the Greeks must accept this as a reality. Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia, as neighboring states which are on their way to becoming democracies, are responsible for preventing Macedonia from becoming a second Bosnia. I list only our three countries, because I do not think that Albania will cooperate. We must help Macedonia to find its place within a politically and economically stable framework in Europe. We all are related in this matter, and our interests depend on one another. I am convinced that after the experience in Bosnia there will be no war in Macedonia or Kosovo. However, democratic Serbia is prepared to facilitate the solution of any problem in the Balkans, even the Macedonian one. This is a major issue for Bulgarian policy and you cannot ignore it. Naturally, we respect this. Simultaneously, however, Serbia should not get involved in the Macedonian issue. Greece's decision to impose an embargo on the republic is not prudent at all. On the other hand, Bulgaria's immediate recognition of Macedonia -- I think that this was proposed by your current ambassador to Rome, Stefan Tafrov -- was a very prudent step. The three states must do everything possible in order to preserve the balance in the Balkans and facilitate the withdrawal of the U.S. "Blue Helmets" from Macedonia. I think that we could ensure peace here much easier than U.S. soldiers. [Shkodrova] Do you think that the three states could reach an agreement on Macedonia? [Komnenic] It is not our business to resolve this issue. However, we must manage our relations with Macedonia very prudently -- without any expansion claims. We must be exceptionally careful and restrained, rather than follow an aggressive policy like Papandreou's present one. It is my personal conviction that Serbia will never enter a conflict because of Macedonia. [Shkodrova] Do you really think that Yugoslavia will follow the policy that you outline? [Komnenic] This is the policy of Serbia's democratic opposition. I am not describing to you Belgrade's official position. [Shkodrova] Does Serbian public opinion coincide with yours? [Komnenic] No. Perhaps only that of part of the people. In Serbia there are radical nationalists who consider Macedonia a southern Yugoslav province, precisely as there are Bulgarians who think that not only Pirin, but the entire Macedonia is part of the Bulgarian culture, nation, and territory. The same apples to Greece. I support the idea of a united Europe, in which borders will not be important. We in the Balkans are still prisoners of factors that have already been overcome. I would like to see the day when at Kalotina [Bulgarian-Serbian border checkpoint] I will not have to show my passport, precisely as Frenchmen do not show their passports when they enter Germany. Integrated in such a way the Balkans could join Europe. This is why the Yugoslav issue is so tragic. Yugoslavia should have entered Europe as one entity -- then it would not have been important whether Serbia, Croatia, Serbian Krajina, and Bosnia were parts of it. It does not appear to be important for 21st century Europe how many citizens Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece have. For example, I am very proud of the fact that many young Bulgarian intellectuals from Bosilegrad and Dimitrovgrad are members of my party. Some of them were candidates at the last parliamentary elections. [Shkodrova] Nevertheless, if Milosevic remains in power, which is very probable, do you think that Serbia will have any claims on Macedonia? [Komnenic] No. I do not believe that Milosevic would like to fight on several fronts. [Shkodrova] However, what will happen if the war in Bosnia somehow expands? [Komnenic] The Kosovo issue will certainly emerge -- not a conflict, but the issue. This is the greatest Serbian issue, greater even than the Bosnian one. As you know, Kosovo is not only a territory and its population, but that part of the country where Serbian culture was founded, and where most of our monasteries are. Thus, for us Macedonia is a secondary problem, if it is a problem at all. It only consists of respecting the human rights of the Serbian minority. However, we think that this issue should be resolved in accordance with the Helsinki Agreement. Thus, I do not think that Milosevic has any claims. The only thing I do not know and I cannot say anything with great certainty is whether Milosevic is making a deal with the Greeks. Pure logic compels us to assume the existence of such a possibility.
