Most published risk assessments are based on spousal exposure to ETS. These studies have examined the lung cancer risk in nonsmoking housewives, using spousal smoking as a surrogate for the wife's exposure to ETS. The size of the association between these health effects and ETS exposure in the workplace is expected to be at least as large as the association seen between these health effects and ETS exposure in residential settings or public places. As noted by Meridian Research in their 1988 report, ``.␣.␣. it is the exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and not the environment in which that exposure occurs, that is the important risk factor'' [Ex. 4&hyph;221]. Therefore, health effects observed and the risk estimates calculated from studies of the general population, or of selected subgroups, such as nonsmoking wives of smoking husbands, are relevant to the working nonsmoking population.
