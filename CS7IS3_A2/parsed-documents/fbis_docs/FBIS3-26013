A medium-energy, heavy ion radioactive, singular nuclear secondary beam [zhong neng zhong li zi fang she xing qi yi he ci ji shu liu xian 0022 5174 6850 4418 1311 2397 1410 1840 1142 8381 2702 2945 4787 2631 3177 4848] was recently built in Lanzhou, and the device produced over 30 types of neutron-enriched [feng zhong zi 0023 0022 1311] radioactive singular nuclear beams. The secondary beam was built at the Lanzhou State Laborary of the Heavy Ion Accelerator. The 40 meter-long piece of equipment has more than 20 sets of magnetic lenses, four sets of beam probes, primary and secondary target chambers, and complex probing and identifying equipment. It has 40 expansion parameters [he tiao can shu 0668 6148 0639 2422]. Its main features are primarily those of crushing nuclei with medium-energy [zhong neng dan he sui lie 0022 5174 1734 2702 4295 5933] and transfering response [zhuan yi fan ying 6567 4448 0646 2019]. Scientists can use the Argon-40 beam, with energy of 25 megavolts from each nucleus, generated by the heavy ion accelerator to bombard an aluminum-27 nuclear target and produce more than 30 kinds of radioactive singular nuclear beams, including magnesium-30, carbon-15, and lithium-9. The energy generated by the secondary beams ranges from 15 to 20 megavolts per nucleus, and their atomic numbers are 2 to 14. Chinese scientists will use this secondary beam to study superheavy nuclei, the possibility of synthisizing nuclides, astrophysics, and application of nuclear technology. Knowledge about nuclear physics used to be acquired primarily through the studies of stable nuclei. Since the 1980's, products created through reactions from primary targets have been reused as bullets, or "secondary beams." The use of secondary beams has diversified the combination of "bullets" and "targets," creating unprecedented opportunities for acquiring new knowledge about atom nuclei. Using radioactive, singular secondary beams to discover and identify new nuclides and study new decay modes and decay characters are new means of experimentation in the world, and China is currently the fifth country in the world possessing this advanced means of experimentation. The Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS] has listed the construction of this secondary beam, which is one of the projects China has launched with the aim of catching up with the advanced world level, as a subsidiary project for the Eighth Five-Year Plan period. The construction has been successfully completed as result of the great support and assistance from the State Science and Technology Commission, the CAS, the State Natural Sciences Foundation, and the Lanzhou State Laboratory of Heavy Ion Accelerator.
