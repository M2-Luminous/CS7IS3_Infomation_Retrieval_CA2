Officials dismissed claims by the Welsh secretary, John Redwood, that the reforms had been blunted by too much red tape, and said that much of the growth in senior managerial posts -- up 37 percent in 1990-1, the year the NHS reforms were introduced -- was the result of senior doctors and nurses being reclassified as managers to streamline the running of hospitals and health trusts. The rest of the growth was the result of reforms introduced in the mid-1980's following an investigation by Sir Roy Griffiths which concluded that the NHS was under-managed. However, a department spokesman acknowledged that there had also been growth in administrative staff to run the internal market. Mr. Redwood angered health ministers on Tuesday with his claim that the government reforms had resulted in 1,500 more administrators and managers being appointed in Wales in the past three years, but only 20 more doctors. In England, he said, the number of managers increased from 1,000 to 10,000 in the five years to April 1991 and the salary bill swelled from £11 million to £251 million. Figures published by the health department last month in Health and Personal Social Services Statistics show that the management explosion has, in fact, been greater than Mr. Redwood claimed. The number of senior managers rose from 1,200 in 1988 to 13,300 in 1991, and the salary bill rose from £30 million to £384 million. But the number of nurses fell by 9,000 from its peak of 405,300 in 1989, a drop of 2 percent. A note accompanying the figures says the sharp jump in managers "reflects the extension of the senior manager pay scheme in 1989 to include lower tiers of management ... including nurses." This also explains the fall in the number of nurses. Also, student nurses no longer work on the wards at the start of their training. A spokesman for the health department said senior managers were less than 2 percent of all staff and accounted for 3 percent of the salary bill. Doctors, nurses and other "direct care" staff accounted for 65 percent of the salary bill. However, the figures cover only the first year of the NHS reforms when there were 57 NHS trusts. From next April the number will have grown to 389, with a further substantial increase in the number of managers.
