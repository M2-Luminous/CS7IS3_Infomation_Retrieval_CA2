The Russian president made these remarks while explaining his concept of defense on the Russian border at a frontier force festival here, the ITAR-TASS news agency reported today. Yeltsin pointed out that Russia has no territorial claims over other countries and favors civilized settlements of border disputes. Russia is a young nation and there is still a lot to be done before it completes demarcation of borders with neighboring countries, ITAR-TASS cited him as saying. Yeltsin stressed that Russia's border should become an impassable barrier for terrorists, drug-traffickers, smugglers and illegal immigrants. The priority for frontier guards is to cope with armed provocation, he added. But he stressed that Russia favors peaceful settlements of border disputes and will resort to force only under extraordinary situations. The border should not become an obstacle for international cooperation and exchange, he added. On border defense, he said that because Russia's relations with neighboring countries vary with political situation, Russia should treat different countries with different approaches.
