It was decided to call a warning strike in the first "parliamentary week" -- from 10 to 17 January. Three newspapers disagreed with the decision, including ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA, and also KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (spokesmen for the last newspaper expressed their solidarity with the "strikers"). It soon transpired, however, that Mr. Chernomyrdin is ready to meet with the editors-in-chief today to talk about all the existing disagreements.
