Other Matters I. Purpose and Substantive Description A. Authority and Background 1. Authority Title I, Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301&hyph;5320); 24 CFR part 570, subpart F. 2. Background Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 authorizes the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program. Section 106 of Title I permits the States to elect to assume the administrative responsibility for the CDBG Program for nonentitled areas within their jurisdiction. Section 106 provides that HUD will administer the CDBG Program for nonentitled areas within any State that does not elect to assume the administrative responsibility for the program. Subpart F of 24 CFR part 570 sets out the requirements for HUD's administration of the CDBG Program in nonentitled areas (Small Cities Program). This NOFA supplements subpart F of 24 CFR part 570, which sets out the requirements applicable to the CDBG Program in nonentitled areas. In accordance with 24 CFR 570.420(e) and 570.420(h)(3), and with the requirements of section 102 of the Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act), HUD is issuing this NOFA for New York State's Small Cities Program for Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 to announce the allocation of funds for Single Purpose and Comprehensive grants, and to establish the deadline for filing grant applications. The NOFA explains how HUD will apply the regulatory threshold requirements for funding eligibility, and the selection criteria for rating and scoring applications for Comprehensive grants and for scoring projects in applications for Single Purpose grants. The Department has proposed regulations at 24 CFR 570.420&hyph;32 which govern the HUD-administered Small Cities program in New York. These regulations will modify the HUD-administered Small Cities program to allow for multi-year plans. The multi-year plan competition will permit the Department to select multi-year plans of two or three years in a competition that will allow the first year to be funded. The Department intends to fund future years of the plan on a non-competitive basis, pursuant to acceptable performance, submission of an acceptable application and certifications, the provision of adequate appropriations for the HUD-administered Small Cities program, and publication of a final rule. Section I.A.3 of this NOFA provides a description of certain statutory amendments that apply to the HUD-Administered Small Cities Program, even though conforming regulations have not yet been adopted. The statutory amendments listed in Section I.A.3 require little or no regulatory elaboration. Conforming amendments will be made to 24 CFR part 570, subpart F in future rulemaking. Other information about the Small Cities Program will be provided in the application kit, which will be made available to applicants by HUD's New York Office and Buffalo Office. 3. Statutory Changes Both the National Affordable Housing Act (Pub.L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990) (NAHA) and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub.L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (the 1992 Act) amended Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (the HCD Act). Various amendments made by the two recent statutes are applicable, as described below, to the funds made available under this NOFA.
