You will guess at once that under this name one can infer the formerly named "basic military preparation [NVP]." Employees of the city draft board responsible for educational work consider that it is necessary to resurrect this subject, since the absence of NVP is one of the reaons for the poor results of the callup. The draft board polled the draftees. Twenty percent of those questioned would willingly enter the Army; 15.7 percent intended to avoid it in any way possible; 33 percent would enter service, but without enthusiasm. The rest perferred not to express themselves. Among the motives expressed by the "draft dodgers," the youths' fear for their life if assigned to "hot spots" dominated. Other reasons named were domestic disorder and the low prestige of army service. Therefore, jointly with the city authorities, it is planned to implement a large-scale program for preparing youth for service in the Armed Forces. Military-patriotic education occupies first place in this program. However, in all probability draftees and their parents are more worried about such things as health, security and the possibility of completing their education. Letters read at a press conference held yesterday by acting city draft commissioner Vladimir Davydov attest to this. Despite the fact that 11 draft dodgers were sentenced last year and 177 criminal suits are still ongoing, those subect to callup are not hurrying to the draft board. From the point of view of the city draft board the Army is not at fault. New recruits are sent to "hot spots" only with their agreement. Draftees from the North-West region, particularly married ones, as a rule remain in that region. Mr. Pichikov, a representative of the military-medical commission, vowed that "the Army doesn't need sick men" and none of the youths with medical problems would be forced to serve.
