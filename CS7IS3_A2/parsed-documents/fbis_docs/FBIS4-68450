Baburin, State Duma deputy, member of the Russian Way parliamentary group, and leader of the Russian All-People's Union, by LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA correspondent in Bulgaria Olga Reshetnikova; in Sofia; date not given: "Sergey Baburin: 'Drawing on the Experience of History...' The Balkan Knot and Russia"] [Text] S.N. Baburin visited Yugoslavia (as a member of a State Duma delegation) and Bulgaria together with his colleagues from the Russian Way parliamentary group, S.A. Glotov and A.A. Dolgopolov. As far as their trip to Bulgaria is concerned, it is noteworthy in its own right: Figures of the patriotic movement in Russia of such renown have not visited here yet; the Bulgarian public has a hazy notion about the movement itself, whereas the leading Bulgarian mass media, as a rule, paint it in the "Red-and-Brownshirt" tones and invariably associate it with the name of V.V. Zhirinovskiy. In Sofia, S.N. Baburin gave an interview to this correspondent. [Reshetnikova] Sergey Nikolayevich, what was the purpose of your trip to Yugoslavia? [Baburin] Contrary to the commonplace view of a "brilliant" foreign policy victory of Russia which has succeeded in forestalling the bombing of Serbian positions in Bosnia by NATO forces, we believe that on the whole, the current leaders of the foreign policy establishment are proceeding within the framework of the U.S. strategic plan in resolution of the Yugoslav crisis, having in particular played along with the United States in forming a Croatian-Muslim state association. In the course of developing its specific proposals for the settlement of the Yugoslav conflict, it became necessary for the ROS [Russian All-People's Union], of which I am a leader, to verify the correctness of the analysis of the situation existing there locally, to examine the position of the Russian military contingent in Yugoslavia and the conditions and nature of its activities, and to analyze the consequences of the introduction of Turkish "blue helmets" to Bosnia. We took advantage of a long-standing invitation to visit Yugoslavia which had been confirmed at a recent meeting with R. Karadzic in Moscow. The trip turned out to be very useful. We accumulated many observations, and listened to our Serbian friends and Russian servicemen. All of this has yet to be analyzed and the requisite conclusions have yet to be drawn. Therefore at present it is premature to discuss specific results. However, I can note one point right now: Serious adjustments should be made in the policy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia with regard to the Yugoslav crisis. [Reshetnikova] Do you think that now, when Yugoslavia is the focus of attention for reasons that are easy to understand, other countries of the Balkan region, primarily our traditional partner Bulgaria, have been left out of the field of vision of Russian politicians? Meanwhile, the leadership of Bulgaria has declared the country to be a francophone state to which the imperial ambitions of Russia allegedly pose the main threat. Sofia, the sworn brother of Tel Aviv and Ankara, is knocking on the doors of NATO, and on the day of the national holiday they fly the flag of the European Community here.... [Baburin] While both interested parties share the blame for the current state of Russian-Bulgarian relations, I cannot but acknowledge a serious omission in the foreign policy of Russia. This state of affairs ought to be rectified as soon as possible. This is why we eagerly accepted the invitation to come to Bulgaria issued by deputies of the Bulgarian parliament from the Fatherland Party of Labor, as well as the Zora Political Circle, whose approach to quite a number of key problems is close to that of the ROS: We are in favor of traditionalism, a reverent attitude toward the past, an original national path of development for each country, major economic reforms on the basis of a mixed economy, but without the total annihilation of all things that have proven to be viable and useful. We have come to Bulgaria in order to establish direct interparty and interparliamentary links, to consult, and to discuss problems which are immediate for both Russia and Bulgaria. The spectrum of such problems is very broad: Prospects for the resumption of economic cooperation between our two countries, the role of Russia and Bulgaria in settlement of the Yugoslav crisis and keeping the peace in the Balkans in general, the problem of integration of East European countries in NATO, and so on. A conversation with, for example, Chairman of the National Assembly of Bulgaria A. Yordanov indicated that we do not have mutual understanding on all these problems. We believe that NATO in the form in which it continues to exist is aimed against Russia even now. Yes, we are in favor of a partnership for peace, but a genuine partnership on an equal footing. For now, an attempt to make our states fit its political, economic, military, and cultural standards is obvious in the approach of the United States; meanwhile, both Russia and Bulgaria have paths of their own. We can accomplish a genuine revival only by drawing on our national traditions and our experience of history. We differed with the chairman of the Bulgarian parliament in our assessment of Bulgarian-Soviet relations in the past. Certainly, the imitation of friendship and the uncritical attitude toward each other harmed relations between our peoples. However, it would be incorrect to discard outright the existence of sincere friendly feelings which the Bulgarian people had during those years and, as I have ascertained, retain to this day. Just because we are from Russia, we were very warmly greeted both in Sofia and in the cities of Kazanluk, Shipka, and Kurdzhali. [Reshetnikova] You visited areas which are densely settled by the Turkish and Bulgarian Muslim population in the immediate proximity of Turkey. It is little known in our country that certain external forces are attempting to fuel interethnic and religious conflicts in Bulgaria and encourage pro-Turkish and pro-Macedonian separatist organizations. The American ambassador to Bulgaria openly states that the Bulgarian Constitution which bans the creation of parties and political organizations on an ethnic basis is "imperfect." To your mind, how grave is the danger of the Bosnian scenario being replicated in Bulgaria? [Baburin] This is a very serious problem, and I am profoundly convinced that the leadership of Bulgaria underestimates it, however, like the leadership of Russia. The state must guarantee the rights and liberties of all its citizens; in turn, any attempt to acquire special rights merely along ethnic or religious lines represents a step toward the destruction of not just democracy but also the state itself. At a meeting with the public of the city of Kurdzhali I said frankly: "Look at what is happening in Russia; may this be a warning to you against experiments involving the demand to make your area autonomous." The activities of separatist organizations may result in the splitting up of Bulgaria along ethnic and religious lines, which is tantamount to the death of the Bulgarian state. The separation of the Rhodope [Mountains], which are populated by the Turkish and Bulgarian-Muslim element, will directly connect Turkey to Macedonia (where the proportion of Muslims is growing continuously), and subsequently to Albania and Bosnia. [Reshetnikova] Indeed, the actions of Washington and Ankara in the Balkans reveal an aspiration to create a "Muslim arc" here that will pass through the north of Greece, the south of Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, and Bosnia. The creation of this arc will place an effective means to pressure Europe at the disposal of Washington and, in addition, will isolate the Christian states--Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria--from one another, also separating them from Russia. Bulgarian patriotic forces are seriously concerned about this prospect, and are looking to Russia with hope. As we have learned, the "Worldwide Congress of Slavic Orthodox Christian Nations," of which V.V. Zhirinovskiy became chairman, has just been held in Moscow; the ideas of creating an all-Slavic parliament and army have been voiced. What is your opinion of this? [Baburin] One should receive the eccentric statements of V.V. Zhirinovskiy while keeping it definitely in mind that he is a young politician; this is why excessive attention to his declarations is harmful for him, just as is free advertisement. In general it surprises me that in Bulgaria, Zhirinovskiy is perceived to be a representative of national-patriotic forces. There is nothing for Zhirinovskiy to create. The inseparable bond between Russia and the Balkan nations has been created over millennia. Russia is historically responsible for the countries of the Balkan Peninsula; it was and still is a guarantor of their territorial integrity and independence. We are against the attempt, foisted on us from the outside, to create a pillar of Russian policy in the form of one Balkan state at the expense of others and come out in favor of mutually advantageous relations on an equal footing between Russia and all Balkan states, primarily Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Greece, which are traditionally close to us. To my distress, the chairman of the Bulgarian parliament characterized this task as "not too essential." For ages the enemies of Russia and the Orthodox faith have set the task of the Balkan nations quarreling among themselves. A patriotic Russia sets the task of achieving mutual understanding and cooperation among these nations. We are against the creation of military blocs in this region, including blocs of a pan-Slavic nature. Our victory is not in achieving military superiority but in the victory of the spirit and economics. So far a Russian foreign policy concept for the Balkans has not been apparent. The current leaders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs operate by the trial-and-error method. However, this is a dead end: Ill-conceived steps cause problems whose resolution produces illusory victories, but nobody is held responsible in the process. I am convinced that for Russia it was a mistake to vote in favor of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro and agree to the Turkish military presence in the Balkans under the guise of the "blue helmets." This will unavoidably encourage separatist trends in the Muslim-populated areas of Greece, Bulgaria, and Macedonia, and boost the pressure of Turkey, the United States, and NATO on Belgrade, Sofia, and Athens, which will be unable to effectively resist it, given the unpredictable and inconsistent policy of Russia. However, I believe that the situation will change; Russia will finally follow a far-sighted foreign policy course based first of all on its national-state interests. For this to happen, truly democratic, patriotic forces with a statesmanlike frame of mind, for whom serving the Motherland is above all, should come to power in our country.
