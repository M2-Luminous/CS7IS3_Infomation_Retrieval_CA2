FR940826-0-00146 FR940826-0-00020 (2) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to cure defects specified herein (except for failure to sign the application and to make certifications) and to resubmit a corrected application. Form 175 may be amended or modified to make minor changes or correct minor errors in the application (such as typographical errors). The Commission will classify all amendments as major or minor, pursuant to rules applicable to specific services. An application will be considered to be a newly filed application if it is amended by a major amendment and may not be resubmitted after applicable filing deadlines. (3) Applicants who fail to correct defects in their applications in a timely manner as specified by Public Notice will have their applications dismissed with no opportunity for resubmission. (c) Prohibition of Collusion. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, after the filing of short-form applications, all bidders are prohibited from cooperating, collaborating, discussing or disclosing in any manner the substance of their bids or bidding strategies, or discussing or negotiating settlement agreements, with other bidders until after the high bidder makes the required down payment, unless such bidders are members of a bidding consortium or other joint bidding arrangement identified on the bidder's short-form application pursuant to §1.2105(a)(2)(viii). (2) Applicants may modify their short-form applications to reflect formation of consortia or changes in ownership at any time before or during an auction, provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant, and provided that the parties forming consortia or entering into ownership agreements have not applied for the same license. Such changes will not be considered major modifications of the application. (3) after the filing of short-form applications, applicants may make agreements to bid jointly for licenses, provided the parties to the agreement have not applied for the same license. §1.2106 Submission of upfront payments. (a) The Commission may require applicants for licenses subject to competitive bidding to submit an upfront payment. In that event, the amount of the upfront payment and the procedures for submitting it will be set forth in a Public Notice. No interest will be paid on upfront payments. (b) Upfront payments must be made either by wire transfer or by cashier's check drawn in U.S. dollars from a financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the Federal Communications Commission. (c) If an upfront payment is not in compliance with the Commission's Rules, or if insufficient funds are tendered to constitute a valid upfront payment, the applicant shall have a limited opportunity to correct its submission to bring it up to the minimum valid upfront payment prior to the auction. If the applicant does not submit at least the minimum upfront payment, it will be ineligible to bid, its application will be dismissed and any upfront payment it has made will be returned. (d) The upfront payment(s) of a bidder will be credited toward any down payment required for licenses on which the bidder is the high bidder. Where the upfront payment amount exceeds the required deposit of a winning bidder, the Commission may refund the excess amount after determining that no bid withdrawal penalties are owed by that bidder. (e) In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d), in the event a penalty is assessed pursuant to §1.2104 for bid withdrawal or default, upfront payments or down payments on deposit with the Commission will be used to satisfy the bid withdrawal or default penalty before being applied toward any additional payment obligations that the high bidder may have. §1.2107 Submission of down payment and filing of long-form applications. (a) After bidding has ended, the Commission will identify and notify the high bidder and declare the bidding closed. (b) Within five (5) business days after being notified that it is a high bidder on a particular license(s), a high bidder must submit to the Commission's lockbox bank such additional funds (the ``down payment'') as are necessary to bring its total deposits (not including upfront payments applied to satisfy penalties) up to twenty (20) percent of its high bid(s). (In single round sealed bid auctions conducted under §1.2103, however, bidders may be required to submit their down payments with their bids.) This down payment must be made by wire transfer or cashier's check drawn in U.S. dollars from a financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the Federal Communications Commission. Winning bidders who are qualified designated entities eligible for installment payments under §1.2110(d) are only required to bring their total deposits up to ten (10) percent of their winning bid(s). Such designated entities must pay the remainder of the twenty (20) percent down payment within five (5) business days of grant of their application. See §1.2110(e) (1) and (2). Down payments will be held by the Commission until the high bidder has been awarded the license and has paid the remaining balance due on the license, in which case it will not be returned, or until the winning bidder is found unqualified to be a licensee or has defaulted, in which case it will be returned, less applicable penalties. No interest will be paid on any down payment.
