Yuriy Yarov, deputy chairman of the Russian Government, said this today at a meeting between heads of ministries and services of the social bloc and journalists. In his opinion, the fight against hyperinflation and social stabilization in society should not be set against each other; one should not put financial interests above those common to all people, while at the same time one should not forget that people's lives cannot be improved without improving the economy and reducing inflationary processes. The social policy, Yuriy Yarov said, is the first to be affected by a fall in production. Reduced budget revenues have resulted in a situation whereby the Finance Ministry's debt to the social sphere in 1993 amounted to 228 billion rubles. In addition, although last year's debts are being paid off, non-payments for the first quarter of 1994 are growing: as of today the debt amounts to 500 billion rubles. At the same time, the deputy chairman of the Russian Government said that only 12.4 trillion rubles have been allocated to resolving all social problems, which is 9.5 percent of the budget. In his view, at least 15 per cent of the federal budget's assets are necessary just to resolve the most painful problems in the sphere.
