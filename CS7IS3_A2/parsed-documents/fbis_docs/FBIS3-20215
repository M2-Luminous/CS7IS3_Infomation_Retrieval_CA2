Denktas met with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's assistant special envoy in Cyprus, at 1600 today. [passage omitted] In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side is in favor of continuing the talks on the package. Denktas declared, however, that the UN officials are pressuring the Turkish Cypriot side to accept the package without even allowing it to assess the latest developments. Pointing out that additions have been made to the package, and topics that are not related to the package have been included in it, Denktas remarked that it is impossible to be forced to accept these proposals by a certain date. These proposals include matters concerning the guarantee issue, to which the Turkish Cypriot people are very sensitive, Denktas announced, stressing that it is out of the question for the Turkish Cypriot side to accept them. Denktas explained that the Turkish Cypriot side underlined the flaws and shortcomings of the initial package, which Greek Cypriot Administration leader Glavkos Kliridhis said he would accept at the time. Some of these have since been resolved, Denktas added, noting: They were able to solve some of them. Therefore, we were not wrong. The rest they did not touch because the Greek Cypriot side is not willing to accept them. We do not accept this.
