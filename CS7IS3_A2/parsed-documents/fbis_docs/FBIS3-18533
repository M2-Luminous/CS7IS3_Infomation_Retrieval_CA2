The number of factories set up by the Mafia to refine heroin in Sicily is much larger than first thought. The news was disclosed by the accused in a heroin-processing trial at the fortified courtroom-bunker in Rome's Rebibbia Prison. A heroin refinery in the area near Trapani was the largest ever uncovered in Europe. Gianfranco D'Anna reports. [D'Anna] During the 1980s from Palermo to Trapani every Mafia clan ran a heroin refinery; a flood of drugs was exported to every European capital and to North America. In the underground network of hidden refineries in the areas around Palermo and Trapani, there are at least 40 well-organized clans, but so far only five of these clans have been discovered; four in Palermo and another, which is considered to be the most sophisticated and dangerous, in Alcamo. Totuccio Contorno, Rosario Spatola, Fabio Savone, and all the other informers who are being questioned in the fortified courtroom-bunker in Rebbibia Prison by Trapani judges, have stressed how enourmously important the refinery of death at Virgini in the suburbs of Alcamo is to the Mafia. In its few months of activity, the refinery produced 1,200 kg of heroin and was still carrying on with its processing operations when an additional 400 kg were discovered. [passage omitted]
