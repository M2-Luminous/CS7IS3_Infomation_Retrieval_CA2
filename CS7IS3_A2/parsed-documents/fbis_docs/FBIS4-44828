"Television was invented in Europe, and Europe wants to play a significant role in the digital age too," says the introduction to "Innovation Europe," sponsored for the fourth time by the Central Association of Electrotechnology and Electronics Industries. Television remains a significant factor: in Germany there are 44 million sets in operation. The total is about 160 million for Europe and 670 million worldwide. The world of television is on the verge of emerging into the digital age. During the meeting in Berlin, Dr. Helmut Stein (Nokia) reported in detail that digital technology is now in a position to differentiate image and sound quality, i.e., to divide up the given bit rates as desired. But the price to be paid is some loss of quality. There will be four levels: --Limited Definition Television (LDTV) achieves image and sound quality on the level of previous videorecorders. This requires a data rate of 1.5 to 2 megabits per second. --Standard Definition Television (SDTV) shows TV programs with good PAL quality on a technologically modern receiver. The requirement is a transmission rate of 3 to 4 megabits per second. --Extended Definition Television (EDTV) offers improved image and sound reproduction, sufficient for large screens, including those with a 16:19 height-to-width ratio and for the new PALplus system. Here the data transmission rate is 6 to 8 megabits per second. --High Definition Television (HDTV) for high definition televisions with up to five sound channels is suitable for reproduction on very large screens. This requires a transmission capacity of 20 to 30 megabits. The data streams will consist of 188-byte packets; a byte is equal to eight bits. Thus they are adaptable for the future Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) on the public broad-band networks. The first byte in the packet serves for synchronization, the next three for recognition of the data carried by the following 184 bytes. As is well known, in the recent past over 100 institutions from 14 countries have been working on the technology and strategy of European digital television, and they agreed on the first standard (for satellite TV transmission) in December of 1993. The norms for cable transmission and terrestrial digital transmission will follow. In Berlin, Stein gave the following timetable: digital TV via satellite and cable will begin in 1995. Terrestrial transmission, received with conventional roof antennas, could follow in 1997 and the highest quality level (digital HDTV) could be available beginning in 1999. There is no longer anyone who talks about European HDTV using the HD-Mac transmission process, which was developed at a cost of several hundred million German marks [DM] and given an expensive demonstration. Dr. Herbert Bruch (Grundig) explained what will happen with PALplus, the system which can completely fill the broad picture surfaces of the new 16:9 [as published] sets. ARD plans to offer about 300 PALplus program hours this year, and Baerische Rundfunk an addition 300. The pay-TV broadcaster Premiere is even promising 1,000 hours. But the equipment industry is not braced for this tempo. Originally, they had been counting on PALplus beginning in the summer of 1995. In the meantime, some equipment manufacturers have been making use of ASIC chips. It is true that they are more expensive than the later mass-produced chips, but will be available sooner. In this way the first PALplus-equipped 16:9 [as published] receivers could appear in the stores before Christmas, with a price increase of about DM350. PALplus is also completely compatible with the less advanced PAL standard.
