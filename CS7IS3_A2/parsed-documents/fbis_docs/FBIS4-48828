"We are here to look for solutions, otherwise I wouldn't be here," said the leader of the African National Congress delegation Jacob Zuma. He declined to pre-empt the meeting's outcome, saying it was merely one of many possible meetings, and that it might take some time before a final solution was reached. The joint working group was established on Tuesday by KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose to resolve outstanding differences in the provincial legislature. Disputes surfaced last week over the allocation of ministerial portfolios to the three ANC MECs [member Executive Committee], S'bu Ndebele, Zweli Mkhize and Mr Zuma. The re-allocation of portfolios is believed to be the main issue on the agenda.
