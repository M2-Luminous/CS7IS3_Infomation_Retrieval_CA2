It has successfully achieved saturated oscillation [bao he zhen dang 7394 0735 2182 5616] and passed a technological appraisal conducted by academics Wang Ganchang, Wang Daheng, and Chen Nengkuan today in Beijing. The free electronic laser device is a sophisticated technology developed in recent decades in the world's high-technology field. It is acclaimed by scientists as a "new gold mine" in the scientific and technological circles and is a strategic research topic for the next century. It can produce coherent electromagnetic radiation from infrared to the X spectral regions, can continuously readjust and change wavelengths, and possesses a huge crest value and an extremely large power potential. It will have very broad prospects for application in such areas as condensed state physics, material sciences [cai liao ke xue 2624 2436 4430 1331], photochemistry, bioengineering, military science, controlled thermonuclear fusion, and telecommunications and is particularly attractive in forming the X-ray holographs [guan xi cheng xiang 0356 1873 2052 0288] of large biological molecules. At present, the most widely used of free electronic laser devices in the high-technology field is the infrared free electronic laser device and this is exactly what the High-Energy Physics Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has successfully developed. Of the 10 similar devices being developed in Asia, it was the first to actually lase (on 26 May 1993) and it achieved saturated oscillation the other day, thus enabling China to achieve infrared free electronic laser after the United States and Western Europe. Beijing's free electronic laser device project was first established and initiated in March 1986 and is one of the first research topics in the State 863 high-technology field. The project was successfully developed by 50 scientific research personnel headed by Xie Jialin, academic and research fellow of the High- Energy Physics Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, after eight years of arduos efforts. The appraisal members unanimously held that Beijing's free electronic laser device has successfully achieved saturation and oscillation and confirmed, once again, that China is one of the leaders in this high-tech field. It has been learned that the State 863 laser field has decided to set up key laboratories for free electronic laser devices with Beijing's free electronic laser device as the mainstay, offering a good foundation for China to develop in that field.
