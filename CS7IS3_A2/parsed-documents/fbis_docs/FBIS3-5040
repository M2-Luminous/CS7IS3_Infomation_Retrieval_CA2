Korean People and Students Urged To Turn Out in Anti-War, Anti-Nuke Struggle"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- "Let all the patriotic people from all walks of life, who truly want to enjoy a peaceful life in the territory of 3,000 ri free from nuclear weapons and war, turn out in a nationwide anti-war, anti-nuke struggle to remove the crisis of a nuclear war hanging over the nation and safeguard peace!" A spokesman for the Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front appealed this in a statement on Feb. 25, according to radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul. Drawing attention to the ever-expanding anti-war, anti-nuke struggle of the South Korean people of different strata, the spokesman said: "All the patriotic and democratic forces and activist organizations should raise higher the torch of the anti-war, anti- nuke struggle and expand and develop it into a nationwide struggle involving people of broad strata, one person inspiring ten, ten persons a hundred, and a hundred persons a thousand. "The entire people who set store by the destiny of the nation should rise as one in the anti-U.S. struggle to get the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons withdrawn immediately, decisively oppose the planned deployment of 'Patriot' missiles and categorically frustrate the nuclear war games. "Kim Yong-sam is the first-class traitor to the nation who has unhesitatingly opened the whole rice market, the blood and flesh of the people, flattering and yielding to outside forces, and who does not mind plunging the whole country into the holocaust of a nuclear war. "The entire people should wage an anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle on a nationwide scale, mindful that the nation would be exterminated if his bellicose group is pardoned."
