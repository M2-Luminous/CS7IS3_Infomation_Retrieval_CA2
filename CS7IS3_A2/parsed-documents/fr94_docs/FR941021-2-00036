FR941021-2-00036 FR941021-2-00028 [Docket Nos. CP94&hyph;608&hyph;001, CP94&hyph;608&hyph;002, CP94&hyph;608&hyph;003, CP94&hyph;608&hyph;004] Northern Natural Gas Co.; Notice of Amendment to Application October 17, 1994. Take notice that on October 7, 1994, Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern), 1111 South 103rd Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68124, filed an amendment (Amendment) to its original application in Docket No. CP94&hyph;608&hyph;000 which was filed pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for an order permitting and approving the abandonment by sale to Enron Gathering Company (EGC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Operations Corp., certain compression, dehydrating, delivery point and pipeline facilities, with appurtenances, located in various counties in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Wyoming and Colorado and services rendered thereby. Also, in its original application, Northern requests approval concurrent with the conveyance of the facilities to EGC to abandon certain agreements and services. Northern states that the Amendment: (1) Reflects changes in the Amended and Restated Contract for the Purchase and Sale of Assets, dated September 23, 1994, (Amended Contract); (2) clarifies certain elements of the original application; and (3) updated certain exhibits with additional information, all as more fully set forth in the amendment which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Northern states that it is amending the application to divide it into four parts, identifying the facilities on the basis of geographic production areas and requests that each partial assignment made by EGC to its four affiliates be given a separate subdocket to facilitate review along the geographic lines associated with each affiliate taking assignment from EGC. Northern indicates that, by assignments dated September 23, 1994, EGC has assigned the gathering facilities generally located in: (1) The Anadarko production area to Enron Anadarko Gathering Corp. (EAGC); (2) the Hugoton production area to Enron Gathering Limited Partnership (EGLP); (3) the Permian production area to Enron Permian Gathering Inc. (EPGI), and; (4) the Rocky Mountain region to Enron Mountain Gathering Inc. (EMGI). Northern states that, pursuant to the Amended Contract, EGC has made partial assignments of the gathering facilities to the four separate and distinct regional entities due to expressions of interest by third parties to purchase certain of these assets from EGC. In the Amendment, Northern states that it is also refiling three large scale maps to make changes and clarifications to symbols, locations and functions of facilities identified on the maps. Further, Northern states that it is adding two delivery points on the Brewer system in the Hugoton production area located in Texas County, Oklahoma and the Jackson B # 1 delivery point in the Anadarko production area located in Hansford County, Texas. Also, Northern is deleting the Clinton Oil Company delivery point from its list of delivery points since it is located on a transmission pipeline that is not included in the facilities to be abandoned, it is indicated. Northern states that it is supplementing Exhibit W to replace a notice of termination of Rate Schedule T&hyph;5 with a consent letter to terminate Rate Schedule T&hyph;5 between Northern and Mobil Oil Corporation. Also, Northern states it is amending Exhibit U to delete its request to abandon Northern's Rate Schedule X&hyph;38 since the abandonment authorization has been requested in a separate proceeding. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said amendment should on or before November 7, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. All persons who have heretofore filed need not file again. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26134 Filed 10&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
