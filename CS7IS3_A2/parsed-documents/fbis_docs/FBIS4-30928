FBIS4-30928 "dreeu105_m_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-105 Daily Report 30 May 1994 THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA Minister Expresses Concern About Border Tensions Minister Expresses Concern About Border Tensions AU0106104594 Skopje MIC in English 30 May 94 AU0106104594 Skopje MIC English BFN [Unattributed report: "Macedonian Defense Minister: `Greece Will Not Declare War on Albania -- Tensions on Macedonian-Serb Border'"] [Text] "Greece is not planning to declare war on Albania, which would intensify the relations in the region to an even greater extent," the Macedonian Defense Minister Vlado Popovski told the MIC today on the occasion of the latest Albanian-Greek dispute and the announcement made by Greek Prime Minister Papandreou that his government is prepared to undertake other measures if the diplomatic action fails. As it is known, Greece is accusing Albania of waging a new campaign of persecution of the Greek minority in this country, whose numbers are estimated at 400,000 by Athens, while the Albanian authorities estimate this figure at 60,000. The defense minister of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], which borders with Greece and Albania, and which is following the latest development of events between the two neighboring countries with rapt interest, says: "A Greek demonstration of power can be expected, however, not an armed action, which would not be just an ordinary war. In that event, Macedonia can expect increased activities of the Greek military on its borders, which will add to the already existing tensions on the border between Macedonia and Greece." Popovski also stated that particularly strong tensions were felt in the last two months between the border organs of the Republic of Macedonia and the FRY, which can be characterized as a form of military pressure. "There were nine border incidents in the last two months, which, according to our opinion, were on Macedonian territory, while the FRY border organs believe they took place on their territory. From our aspect, there was a violation of the border of up to 300 meters, and on one occasion, even up to 4 km inside our territory. We are witnesses of untypical activities in the border region which cannot be characterized only as refresher activities of the reserve contingent of this neighboring state. We also do not have any information as to when these activities will end, as they do not talk to us, and such information was also not received by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Commander for Macedonia Brigadier General Tellefsen during his recent visit to Nis." The defense minister also said that the Macedonia border organs received an ultimatum from the FRY, that the Macedonian border watchtower Gasince was on Serbian territory. In addition, the observation post 40 of the UNPROFOR Nordic Battalion on the Macedonian-Serb border was issued a warning by the Yugoslav army on May 24 to leave this place within two weeks. "This way a mechanism is created, which raises tensions that can lead to an incident, and later on even to an escalation, which can be used as a scenario for maintaining high tensions. There are still no announcements by Serbia and Greece of an intention to recognize the statehood of the Republic of Macedonia," Popovski says. "This only stimulates the extremisms in both neighboring countries. The state border between the two countries is called "administrative" by the military organs of the FRY, as if it was not a border between two countries. The Macedonian-Serbian border, according to the Constitution of the former SFRY, is a state border between two republics.
