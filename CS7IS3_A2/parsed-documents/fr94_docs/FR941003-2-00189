FR941003-2-00189 FR941003-2-00066 10. Section 26(a)(2)(C) provides that no payment to the depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered unit investment trust shall be allowed the trustee or custodian as an expense except compensation, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe for performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties normally performed by the trustee or custodian. Section 27(c)(2) prohibits a registered investment company or a depositor or underwriter for such company for selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments on such certificates, other than sales loads, are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the qualifications prescribed in Section 26(a)(1), and are held by such trustee or custodian under an agreement containing substantially the provisions required by Sections 26(a)(2) and 26(a)(3) of the 1940 Act. 11. Sentry, the Sentry Account, and SESI (``Section 6(c) Applicants'') request an order under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act exempting them from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the Sentry Account as provided for by the SILIC Contracts previously issued through the SILIC Account and proposed to be supported by the Sentry Account pursuant to the Proposed Transaction. 12. Sentry represents that the charge of 1.20% for mortality and expense risks is reasonable in relation to the risks undertaken by Sentry and within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. This representation is based upon Sentry's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. Sentry will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of its comparative survey. 13. The Section 6(c) Applicants acknowledge that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be viewed as being offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the sales charge. Sentry has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Sentry Account and SILIC Contractowners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum maintained by the Sentry at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission. 14. Sentry represents that the Sentry Account will invest only in management investment companies that undertake, in the event the company adopts a plan to finance distribution expenses under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act, to have a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, formulate and approve any such plan. Conclusion Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting the Proposed Transaction from the provisions of Section 17(a), to the extent necessary to permit that transfer of assets underlying the SILIC Contracts to the Sentry Account. In addition, the Section 6(c) Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction by Sentry of mortality and expense risk charges from Sentry Account as provided for by the SILIC Contracts previously supported by the Sentry Account pursuant to the Proposed Transaction. Applicants and the Section 6(c) Applicants, as appropriate, submit that, for all of the reasons stated above, granting the relief requested herein is appropriate in the public interest, and consistent with the policy and purposes of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
