The HTGR has a number of superb features, including safety, high thermal efficiency, and nuclear heat use. Both the Fort St. Vrain Reactor, a prototype reactor for power generation in the United States, and the THTR-300, a thorium high-temperature gas-cooled reactor in Germany, have ceased operations for financial and other reasons. However, in addition to these two nations, development plans for high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors are underway in such nations as China, Russia, and Indonesia. In Japan, the high-temperature engineering test reactor (HTTR) is under construction at JAERI's Oarai Research Establishment, and is expected to come on line in 1998. Figure II (2)-1 is a simplified diagram of the HTTR, and Table II (2)-1 summarizes its specifications. As the table illustrates, its operating temperature is higher than that of conventional power reactors, and, therefore, it has been necessary to develop high-temperature materials. In this section, we will discuss the development and testing of graphite (carbon) materials to constitute the core section of the HTTR, the intermediate heat exchanger, heat-proof alloys for the control rod structure, and low alloy steels for the pressure vessel, all of which must operate in a higher temperature range than in the case of light-water reactors. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table II (2)-1.

Graphite and Carbon Materials (1) Core Graphite As illustrated in Figure II (2)-1, graphite is used for both the moderator and the reflector of the HTTR. For instance, it is used in the graphite fuel sleeves, the hexagonal fuel assembly blocks to load the sleeves, the mobile reflector blocks, and in the fixed reflector blocks. These components are equipped with nuclear and thermal capabilities, and are also structural elements. Figure II (2)-2 is a diagram of the core section components. The core supporting graphite structure consists of fixed reflector blocks, high-temperature plenum blocks, and a supporting post, as illustrated in Figure II (2)-1. Although the fuel sleeves and the fuel assembly block of the core graphite structure are replaced every two years, their operational temperature, and their level of neutron irradiation become high because they are in direct contact with the fuel. Therefore, at the time of operation and shutdown, a sufficient safety allowance is necessary considering the stress generated in these components. Evaluation of the stress requires such data as Young's modulus of elasticity, strength, thermal expansion coefficient, and thermal conductivity in particular. Characteristics particular to graphite include dimensional changes and creep caused by irradiation. Based on data about a number of characteristics including the items noted above, selection testing was conducted on several types of candidate graphite materials from Japan and overseas to be used for the HTTR. IG-110 graphite was selected for the core graphite structure. This graphite was originally manufactured as a regular material for various uses, such as particles produced by the rubber press method for pots in which to melt semiconductors. Prior to its use in the HTTR, JAERI and other Japanese organizations developed a database for its physical, chemical, and mechanical properties, including irradiation effects, and conducted research and development on the manufacturing side. This involved, for example, increasing the size of the material, and improving quality control. The plan for the graphite structure of the HTTR is based on this database. The critical factor for a graphite material to be used in a nuclear reactor for the first time is the effect of radiation on it. The data needed to evaluate its soundness in the reactor environment -- including dimensional changes caused by radiation, thermal conductivity, corrosion speed, Young's modulus of elasticity, and strength -- were studied for a range of radiation temperature from 400-1200�C, and a maximum radiation exposure of 3x10[.sup]25[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] (E > 29 fJ). With regard to the effects of radiation, creep caused by radiation is an important characteristic of graphite used in nuclear reactors. A creep phenomenon can be observed in graphite irradiated at low temperatures, where thermal creep does not occur. As thermal stress is relaxed by this phenomenon, understanding creep behavior is an important element in evaluating the soundness of the graphite structure. In order to measure the creep factor of the selected IG-110 graphite under irradiation, JAERI developed an irradiation capsule that is capable of irradiating a graphite test piece under stretch stress, and conducted an irradiation test at the JMTR. Figure II (2)-3 illustrates the results, showing irradiation creep factors (K) in comparison with various graphite samples. The results indicate that IG-110 graphite has the same characteristics as other types of graphite studied overseas. Here (K) can be calculated by the following equation from the data on irradiation creep distortion _e_ c in the case of a relatively high level of irradiation: _e_[.sup]c[/] = _s_/E[.sub]O[/] + K_s_� _s_: load stress, E[.sup]O[/]: Young's modulus of elasticity, �: neutron irradiation dose Part of the irradiation creep research at JAERI has been conducted within the framework of the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor research collaboration between JAERI and the U.S. Department of Energy. American graphite has been used for irradiation. Establishment of a general model for creep damage for international use has been set as a future goal. (2) Core Support Graphite The graphite core support structure is a permanent structure that consists of fixed reflector blocks, high-temperature plenum blocks, plenum lower blocks, low-end blocks (PGX graphite made by UCAR of the United States is used for these items), a supporting post for the core section (made of IG 110 graphite), and carbon blocks for insulation (made of ASR-ORB carbon made by SIGRI of Germany). PGX graphite was selected not only on the basis of an evaluation of its various characteristics, but also because it can be manufactured in sufficient quantities, a stable supply situation, its record of use (at the Fort St. Vrain Reactor reactors), and its price. For PGX graphite, the data necessary to produce the core support graphite design plan were obtained as in the case of IG 110 graphite. ASR-ORB carbon for insulation was considered suitable due to its material size, low thermal transmission factor (about 10 W/mK), and such data as measurement stability under compression stress. It was confirmed that the measurement change was at most 0.1 percent at 1,000�C with a compression stress of 0.3 MPa loaded to reflect real conditions. It was also verified that the thermal transmission factor remained almost the same at 1,000�C for a long time. (3) Future Research Items The supporting post, which is a permanent structure, is important for safety as its function is to support the reactor core. Evaluation of its durability against erosion caused by gaseous impurities in the helium coolant has been conducted in testing and analysis, and to improve corrosion tolerance, research on the gradient materials constituting SiC has been conducted. Experimental production at JAERI is based on chemical reactions using SiO. SiO (gas) + 2C (graphite) SiC + CO At present, the corrosion behavior and strength characteristics of IG-110 graphite made of SiC gradient constituents produced by this method are under study. Figure II (2)-4 is an example of one set of results. It indicates that the corrosion resistance of SiC gradient constituent graphite is improved when maintained in the atmosphere at 550�C. In addition, work on the development of high-performance materials also has been conducted using compound carbon materials reinforced with carbon fibers. Also, the development of high-intensity and high-temperature conductive materials, the production of experimental equipment elements, and the acquisition of irradiation data are in progress with a view to applications in nuclear fusion reactors. With regard to inspection technologies, a method for infrared radiation measurement is being studied. This is in addition to the supersonic method and the regenerative method used for acceptance inspections of HTTR graphite. With regard to design methods, improved and advanced research, such as adding the fracture mechanics method to brittle material structure design, is expected in future. 2. Heat-Resistant Alloy The performance required of heat-resistant alloys for HTGRs includes maintaining the capabilities of these materials above certain standards for a long period of time in the unique environment of nuclear reactors. This is in addition to the common performance requirements of general thermochemical materials. Although there has been significant progress in the development of heat-resistant alloys in recent years, we have almost no experience in using massive amounts of heat-resistance alloy in large-scale structures in an ultra-high-temperature range over 850�C. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new domain that takes into account the specific environment of nuclear reactors from the standpoint of both material engineering and structural engineering. The specific environment of nuclear reactors involves a coolant helium gas atmosphere, and neutron irradiation near the core. Although helium gas is inherently inactive, and does not react chemically with metal materials itself, the helium gas used as a coolant, which passes and circulates through the high-temperature core where there is a large amount of graphite, includes small amounts of CO, CO[.sup]2[/], H[.sub]2[/], H[.sub]2[/]O, and CH[.sup]4[/], which are produced by reactions between absorbents, such as water and air, and high-temperature graphite. Therefore, materials for use in high-temperature structures, such as intermediate heat exchangers, must have long-term durability in a helium gas atmosphere containing small amounts of impurities. Structural materials for control rods used near the core must be highly resistant to deterioration caused by neutron irradiation. (1) Materials for High-Temperature Structures in HTTR A maximum coolant temperature of 950�C is expected at the reactor exit of the HTTR. Structural materials for use in high-temperature sections, such as the heat-transfer pipe of the intermediate heat exchanger, are exposed to coolant helium gas with small amounts of impurities at temperatures above 900�C. Maintaining the protective oxide layer reaction is more difficult in an atmosphere of coolant helium gas containing small amounts of impurities than in a strong oxidizing atmosphere like ordinary air. In fact, research indicates that many heat-resistant Ni-Cr alloys tend to undergo changes, such as internal oxidation and decarburizing, that reflect inferior protective properties of the oxide layer. Therefore, structural materials for high-temperature sections must be adaptable to such an atmosphere. In the HTTR design, the so-called insulated double pipe structure is used. In this structure, a coolant pressure of 4 MPa is supported by a pressure wall made of low alloy steel that is in contact with the returned gas on the low-temperature side, while the high-temperature side takes care of about 0.1 MPa, the differential pressure with the secondary system, without being affected by the direct pressure of the coolant. By introducing such design, the primary stress exerted on the structural materials for the high-temperature section remains below 1 MPa, and the thermal stress is below 40 MPa. The structural material used in the high-temperature section in the HTTR is hastelloy X, a nickel-based alloy. It was selected from among existing heat-resistant alloys after some improvements in adaptability to the atmosphere described above were made. The chemical components of the improved alloy, called hastelloy XR, are presented in Table II (2)-2, and are compared to the standard values for hastelloy X. The improvements made in hastelloy XR are as follows: [1] Improved resistance to corrosion in the coolant helium gas atmosphere. - Control of uniform corrosion by a protective MnCr[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]4[/] spinel oxide layer where the Mn content is optimized. - Improved adhesive properties of the oxide layer using SiO[.sup]2[/] granule formation in the phase boundary between the oxide layer and the metal by optimizing the Si content. - Control of internal oxidation and intergranular corrosion by reducing the amount of Al and Ti. [2] Improved high-temperature strength - Improved creep characteristics using structural improvements such as form control of carbide by optimizing the B content. (This was realized after other improvements were made. Therefore, the alloy with this improvement may sometimes be called hastelloy XR-II to distinguish it from the alloy without an optimized B content.) - Improved creep characteristics using separation control of stringer carbide, and unification of grain size by optimizing the manufacturing process for seamless pipes. [3] Improved nuclear adaptability. - Control of radiation activation of corrosion products by reducing the Co content. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table II (2)-2.

Therefore, various tests related to long-term durability were conducted for hastelloy XR in an atmosphere simulating the primary coolant in a temperature range up to 1,000�C. This made it possible to accumulate considerable data and knowledge. In acquiring test data, standard helium gas components for materials testing was designated based on operational data from high-temperature gas-cooled reactors overseas, as illustrated in Table II (2)-3. Next, various pieces of equipment, such as a system for supplying and continuously circulating the helium gas, a creep testing machine, a fatigue testing machine and corrosion testing equipment were developed for experiments in the intended atmosphere without changing the components of the supplied helium gas. As details of this testing equipment have been published in other issues, only some examples of test results are presented here. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table II (2)-3. Impurities Components in Standard Helium Gas for Material Te-| |sting | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |H[.sup]2 |H[.sub]2 |CO |CO[.sub]2 |CH[.sub]4 |N[.sub]2 | |[/] |[/]O | |[/] |[/] |[/] | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |200 |1 |100 |2 |5 |<5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [1] Creep and rapture properties With regard to the creep properties of hastelloy XR in standard helium gas, data for a total of 5 x 10[.sup]5[/] hours have been acquired, including one experiment currently in progress over the maximum of 47,000 hours in the range of 800-1,000�C (Figure II (2)-5). Data for a total of 4 x 10[.sup]5[/] hours have been acquired, including one experiment that reached the maximum of about 47,000 hours in the same temperature range in the atmosphere. Hastelloy XR has improved adaptability to the coolant helium gas atmosphere, and the results indicate that there is no significant difference between the creep properties in the standard helium gas and those in the atmosphere, as the improvements were intended. The creep properties of hastelloy XR, it was discovered, are affected by the B content in the alloy, as illustrated in Figure II (2)-6. Therefore, the optimized hastelloy XR-II was produced twice on an industrial scale (2 tons) to examine long-term creep properties in the standard helium gas, and in the atmosphere. The extension effect for rapture life time due to optimization of the B content proved to be about five times. Further, it was verified that the accumulation law of damage could be applied to high-temperature structure designs for hastelloy XR by conducting two-step creep tests involving changes in temperature and load, as well as creep tests with short-term excessive load -- to take earthquakes into account -- in addition to creep tests under specific temperatures and loads. In this way, it was demonstrated that hastelloy XR could display excellent characteristics for long periods of time in the standard helium gas. Its characteristics in helium gas with changing amounts of impurities were also examined. It turned out that, although its creep rapture properties in carburized helium gas were equivalent to those in the standard helium gas, creep rapture life time in decarburized helium gas was shorter than that in the standard helium gas, and that it was possible to forecast decarburizing behavior by regulating the impurities in the helium gas through carbon activity, and oxygen partial pressure. From the standpoint of maintaining the excellent properties of this alloy, as well as ensuring the soundness of the structure, it is important to be able to control the coolant in nuclear reactors. [2] Properties under fatigue and creep-fatigue interaction Characteristics of low cycle fatigue were examined across a broad temperature range from room temperature to 950�C. Under the standard condition for ordinary materials testing (complete alternating distortion fatigue testing by triangular waves at a distortion speed of 0.1 percent/second), fatigue life time in the standard helium gas was at least as long as that in the atmosphere. The effects of both distortion speed and holding distortion were examined to evaluate material properties under creep-fatigue interaction. It was confirmed in the standard helium gas that holding on the extracting side produced the most serious effects, and that, as the temperature rose, the saturation of life time reduction as a result of introducing distortion holding moved toward a shorter life time (Figure II (2)-7). In evaluating damage caused by fatigue and creep-fatigue interaction based on such data, the principle value for damage prevention was designated by restricting the addition of the creep damage factor, and the fatigue damage factor under 1. The effects of material change produced by aging on low cycle fatigue properties were also examined, and it was discovered that a reduction of fatigue life time due to aging occurred when the test temperature was below 700�C. This tendency became prominent under conditions of high distortion. [3] Corrosion tolerance To determine its corrosion tolerance in the standard helium gas, corrosion testing, where a thermal cycle is added between the room temperature and the test temperature, was conducted, and data for 30,000 hours at 900�C and 20,000 hours at 1,000�C were obtained. The effects of improvements in hastelloy XR for corrosion tolerance in the coolant helium gas atmosphere were maintained for a long period of time. It was also confirmed that partial corrosion did not occur, and that progress in dechromation by oxidation took place as predicted by the parabolic speed principle (Figure II (2)-8). As illustrated above, sufficient data and knowledge about the hastelloy XR base material were accumulated through comprehensive verification testing. Maintaining the performance of the welded section -- an important problem to be solved in constructing a structure with metal materials -- was also examined. A filler metal for welding was developed in order to obtain a stretching ductility, creep rapture strength, creep rapture ductility, and fatigue strength equivalent to or greater than those of the base material. By optimizing the filler metal production process, and by adjusting the chemical components through alloy design based on heavy regression analysis, a filler metal with a performance far higher than that of conventional filler materials was developed. It was confirmed that this filler metal sufficiently satisfied the specifications for welding sections of the thick structure of 50 to 60mm, which was difficult to work on, as well as the thin structure of about 15mm. Figure II (2)-9 illustrates the results of creep rapture testing as an example of its performance. (2) Materials for Control Rod Structure for HTTR Because the coolant temperature at the reactor exit reaches a maximum of 950�C in the HTTR, most parts of the constituent elements of the core and reactor structure consist of carbon and graphite materials. The metal structure in the reactor is designed not to exceed the maximum temperature of the materials. This is accomplished by restricting the location of use, or by introducing an insulating structure. Heat-resistant materials used in the core section are limited to covering pipes for the control rod, connecting rods, shock absorbers, etc. In general, nickel-based alloys have high levels of heat and corrosion resistance, but it has been discovered that they are sensitive to the helium stiffening phenomenon, wherein He is created in the structure by nuclear transformation reactions between thermal neutrons and Ni or B. Therefore, an iron-based alloy, 800 H, has been used as a control rod structure material for the HTTR. When the HTTR is shut down, a two-step insertion method is adopted: First, the reactor is made subcritical by inserting a control rod into the relatively low-temperature reflector domain. Second, the control rod is inserted to the fuel domain after the core temperature is reduced to the designated temperature. In this way, the temperature of the control rod covering pipe is prevented from becoming too high. The introduction of this method has made it possible to reduce the temperature of the control rod covering pipe to about 400�C during ordinary operation. However, since the temperature of the control rod covering pipe rises to 900�C, and because thermal stress is generated at the time of reactor scram, the creep properties of alloy 800 H after neutron irradiation become important. Therefore, the creep rapture properties of alloy 800 H after neutron irradiation were examined. For the HTTR, life time of the control rod is designed to be five years, and the rod is to be replaced when the temperature of the control rod covering pipe exceeds 900�C. (This occurs when a gas circulator of the supplementary cooling facility fails to operate after reactor scram due to a loss of commercial power.) Creep rapture testing was implemented up to the maximum of 900�C to simulate irradiation of the material in real conditions equivalent to the end of control rod life time (amount of thermal neutron radiation: 2.3 x 10[.sup]24[/]n/m[.sup]2[/]), and of the irradiation material in accelerated conditions (amount of thermal neutron radiation: 1.2 x 10[.sup]25[/]n/m[.sup]2[/]). Figure II (2)-10 illustrates the results of radiation testing designed to simulate real conditions. Creep rapture life time of the material after neutron irradiation proved to be 10-30 percent that of the unradiated material. In this way, neutron radiation reduces creep rapture life time, but creep rapture life time after irradiation up to 1.2 x 10[.sup]25[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] is not significantly different from the data of irradiation to 2.3 x 10[.sup]24[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] in Figure II (2)-10. In other words, reduction of creep rapture life time by neutron radiation is almost saturated at 2.3 x 10[.sup]24[/]n/m[.sup]2[/]. The effects of the simulated helium gas atmosphere of the primary coolant, and the effects of its aging on the creep properties of alloy 800 H, were examined using materials in the absence of radiation. It was confirmed that the creep properties of the alloy in the simulated helium gas atmosphere of the primary coolant are not significantly different from those in the ordinary atmosphere, and that the effects of aging could be ignored within the range of assumed conditions of use due to the fact that the control rod has a shorter designed life time than the thermal heat exchangers. Based on these results, the design allowance for the stress value was determined using data based on atmospheric testing, of which there is a considerable body, as well as from separate tests on the effects of neutron irradiation. (3) Ultra-Heat-Resistant Alloy To Improve Intermediate Heat Exchangers One of the characteristics of the HTGR is that its nuclear heat will be used directly in industrial processes. Therefore, the higher the temperature of the helium gas extracted from the reactor, the greater its industrial value. To achieve these higher temperatures, it is necessary to further improve the performance of the heat-resistance alloy used for the high-temperature structure. The development of materials for the high-temperature structure of high-temperature gas-cooled reactors where the coolant temperatures reaches 1,000�C at the reactor exit began with a large project directed by the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. This project, entitled "Research and Development of Direct Iron-Making Technology Using High-Temperature Reduced Gas," began in 1973, and was completed in May 1981. The conclusion was that two types of heat-resistant alloys, SSS 113 MA and KSN, which were capable of achieving the goal of a creep rapture life time over 50,000 hours at 1,000�C, were possible candidates for ultra-heat-resistant alloys that could be used as high-temperature structural materials for high-temperature gas-cooled reactors where the coolant temperature reached 1,000�C at the reactor exit. It was decided that these results be adopted and further developed by JAERI. Therefore, in 1982 JAERI established the Ultra-Heat-Resistant Alloy Special Committee (led by Ryohei Tanaka, Professor Emeritus of the Tokyo Institute of Technology) consisting of experts from the industrial, governmental, and academic sectors in Japan, and pursued ultra-heat-resistant alloy development in consultation with the committee. In the development program at JAERI, the methods of alloy development were examined first. Because the two types of heat-resistant alloys, SSS 113 MA and KSN, were both NiCrW-based alloys, it was decided to pursue alloy development so as to improve corrosion resistance and manufacturing capability as much as possible, while increasing high-temperature durability, an advantage of this type of alloy. In the development of ultra-heat-resistant alloys, the major specifications were set as follows: [1] Creep rapture strength at 1,000�C for 1 x 10[.sup]5[/] hours is to be 9.8 MPa (equivalent to or above the development goal for AIST's large project plans). [2] The level of internal oxidation and intergranular corrosion is low after heat is applied at 1,000�C for 1 x 10[.sup]5[/] hours in the standard helium gas simulating the primary coolant in high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (equivalent to or above hastelloy XR). [3] Work on heat transmission pipes (external diameter of 32mm, thickness of 4-5mm, and length over 7 m) for heat exchangers of the reactor is possible. [4] Secondary working and welding needed to produce heat exchangers can be done. The goal of this development program was to develop ultra-heat-resistant alloys that would satisfy such specifications simultaneously, and in a balanced manner. As the first step, because both SSS 113 MA and KSN have a composition featuring a boundary where separation of the _a_[.sup]2[/]-W phase occurs as illustrated in Figure II (2)-11, an examination of the hot working conditions, tractive characteristics, creep rapture characteristics, and corrosion tolerance in the standard helium gas of alloys in this domain was conducted to take advantage of this mechanism to improve high-temperature strength by this separation. It was concluded, as a result of this examination, that the optimum ratio for a NiCrW composite was Ni-18-19 mass% Cr-20-22 mass%-W. In the second step, hot working conditions, tractive characteristics at the approximate time of aging, and creep rapture characteristics of the alloy with this optimum NiCrW composition, as well as the effects of additional accessory elements such as C, Nb, Fe, Mn, Si, B, T, and Ti on corrosion in the standard helium gas were examined systematically. Figure II (2)-12 illustrates the relationship between the predicted creep rapture strength, based on multiple regression analysis between creep rapture strength and accessory elements, and extrapolated values from the test data among other results obtained in this examination process. Forecast values based on multiple regression analysis test values coincided well for any characteristics as in this example. Based on these results, the chemical composition for the new alloy, whose high-temperature strength and corrosion resistance would be improved by adding small amounts of B and Y, was proposed. Figure II (2)-13 illustrates the characteristics of both the new alloy and the conventional heat-resistant alloys in a semi-quantitative mode. It clearly shows that the new alloy developed in this program has well-balanced characteristics in terms of high-temperature durability. In the third step, this newly developed alloy was made on an industrial scale (two tons), which was then used to produce seamless pipes to be used as the heat transmission pipes of heat exchangers on an experimental basis. It was confirmed that the alloy had sufficient properties, in both hot and cold working conditions, for the production of seamless pipes. Current plans call for the energetic implementation of the following tasks leading to the successful application of the new alloy: [1] Research for establishing welding technology, including the development of filler metals. [2] Evaluation of the various characteristics of base materials and welding sections by tests conducted over long periods of time. 3. Low-Alloy Steel Materials for Pressure Vessels Pressure-resistant low alloys are used for the coolant pressure boundary (such as copper and pipes for pressure vessels and intermediate heat exchangers), and for the core support structure (such as support plates) (see Figure II (2)-1). This section covers research and development efforts aimed at the application of low-alloy steel to pressure vessels, which requires the highest degree of reliability. (1) Use of 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo Steel The temperature of the pressure vessel of the HTTR is 400�C during ordinary operation, and it is designed for 440�C considering abnormal situations caused by transient changes. Therefore, instead of using Mn-Mo-based SA 533 B steel, 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo Steel (JIS SCMV 4-2 ASTMA 387 Gr.22) was adopted, although it lacked a record of use in nuclear reactor vessels. The design conditions for the pressure section of the HTTR are a temperature of 440�C, a pressure of about 4.75 MPa, and a radiation level of 1 x 10[.sup]22[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] (E > 0.1 MeV). About 1 x 10[.sup]5[/] hours of operation are planned. Because this steel has virtually no established track record, it will be necessary how its brittleness characteristics are affected by heat, stress, and radiation, as well as forecast of material deterioration by evaluating such high-temperature characteristics as fatigue. Concerning the production of the material, the normalized and tempered steel (NT) used for the heat exchangers in fast-breeder reactors and chemical plants was adopted instead of annealed steel (AN), which was included in the ASME design code. This was because (1) NT has good hardening properties, and the normalizing and tempering process improves the designed stress at high temperatures, and (2) it has a high level of tenacity at room temperature or less. Based on the data about the relationships among the various brittleness factors noted above and the composition, the low-Si and high-purity NT steel was considered appropriate. What was taken into consideration is the following parameter of so-called temper brittleness: J = (Si + Mn) (P + S) x 10[.sup]4[/] < 100 Here, element symbols indicate mass%. It is noted that not only P and S, but also Si and Mn have large effects. An example of the compositions of forged materials is presented in Table II (2)-4. Table II (2)-4.

With regard to brittleness at high-temperatures, for instance, it was confirmed that a sufficient level could be maintained after an aging process at 450�C for over 50,000 hours. Figure II (2)-14 illustrates the effect of test temperature on Charpy impact strength in the cases of isothermal aging, stress aging, and step-cool processing simulating the temperature change for a high-purity material (see Table II (2)-4) at 450�C for up to 3,000 hours. The diagram indicates that both ductility brittleness transient temperature and upper-shelf energy are not affected by such processes. (3) Recent Research and Future Directions Figure II (2)-15 illustrates the results of recent research on the soundness of pressure vessels. The idea was to compare the fracture toughness (J[.sup]IC[/]) of the welded metal, the heat-affected zone (HAZ), and the base metal after irradiation at 450�C up to about 1 x 10[.sup]23[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] (E > 1 MeV) against those not subjected to irradiation. The results show that, although HAZ shows the lowest J[.sup]IC[/] value before irradiation, there is no difference among the welded metal, the heat-affected zone, and the base metal after irradiation. Figure II (2)-16 illustrates the interrelationship between irradiation embrittlement and thermal embrittlement. In the diagram, the vertical axis represents the J[.sup]IC[/] value, J[.sup]iep[/] (J value at the start of cracking by the potentiometric method), T[.sup]mat[/] (tearing modulus), and variation by upper-shelf energy (USE) radiation as functions of irradiation temperature. White symbols in the diagram indicate samples subjected to thermal aging for 10,000 hours at 450�C. Reduction rates for the values mentioned above become smaller for temperatures up to 350�C, but they become larger at higher temperatures. The trends below 350�C are believed to correspond to a reduction of radiation hardening as a result of increases in the irradiation temperature. In addition to the efforts described above, research to evaluate the strength, tenacity, and ductility-brashiness transient properties using micro-test-piece technology, and electrochemical methods, have been conducted as part of the overall program of research and development of an evaluation technology for material deterioration.
