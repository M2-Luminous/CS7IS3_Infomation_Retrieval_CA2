Alejandro Solorzano, chairman of the Diplomatic Committee of the National Assembly of Nicaragua, pointed out that Japan is shipping in a huge amount of plutonium. "The nuclear armament stepped up by Japan is a big stumbling-block in the way of the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula," he said. He urged Japan to give up the foolish desire to become a nuclear power. The Swedish paper SEVENSKA DAGBLADET said Japan is possessed of all that are needed for the production of nuclear weapons such as plutonium, electronic destructive device and technical personnel and has already manufactured nuclear warheads which only need appropriate amount of plutonium. "Japan is not only capable of reprocessing plutonium but also has signed contracts with Britain and France for the purchase of plutonium. And it is possessed of space satellite technology with which it can establish a system of nuclear-tipped medium and long-range missiles, the paper said. The Japanese magazine BUNGEI SHUNSHU said Japan has stockpiled 26 tons of plutonium far surpassing the amount needed for peaceful purposes. The Tanzanian paper DAILY NEWS said the production capacity of the reprocessing plant of Japan is 800 tons topping the world list and Japan's nuclear armament has reached a danger line. While stepping up its own nuclear armament, Japan is joining the United States and South Korea in crying over "nuclear suspicion" against North Korea, added the paper. The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement said that Japan is feverishly promoting its nuclear armament, taking advantage of the situation that has got strained over the fictitious "nuclear issue" of Korea, and called for an immediate halt to it.
