FR941206-1-00090 FR941206-1-00007 While the majority of the approximately 11,000 wood furniture operations are small businesses, the vast majority of the smaller operations would not be directly affected by this proposed standard. Only approximately 7 percent of the 11,000 manufacturers are expected to be directly impacted. The estimate of 7 percent is based on EPA's estimate of the number of sources that are major based on actual emissions. It is anticipated that the remainder of the industry will take a Federally enforceable limit on their emissions. As discussed under the summary of impacts (section IV.C of the preamble), the economic analysis predicted a slight increase in wood furniture prices. Therefore, the vast majority of small manufacturers, which will not be subject to the proposed rule may benefit from these slightly increased prices. If these costs are not offset by newer, less expensive technologies in the future, this benefit may be sustained. For the smaller facilities that would be directly impacted by implementation of the proposed standards, an analysis of the potential impact of this proposed standard by plant size was performed. The results from this analysis indicate that implementation of this proposed rule would generally have a small impact on the net revenues of facilities of all size groups and that smaller plants would not be systematically impacted more severely than larger operations. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities. F. Miscellaneous In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this proposal was preceded by consultation with appropriate advisory committees, independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies within the framework of a regulatory negotiation. The Administrator will welcome comments on all aspects of the proposed regulation, including health, economic and technological issues, and on the proposed test methods. This regulation will be reviewed 8 years from the date of promulgation. This review will include an assessment of such factors as evaluation of the residual health risks, any overlap with other programs, the existence of alternative methods, enforceability, improvements in emission control technology and health data, and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements. G. Statutory Authority The statutory authority for this proposal is provided by sections 101, 112, 114, 116, and 301 of the Clean Air Act, as amended; 42 U.S.C. 7401, 7412, 7414, 7416, and 7601.
