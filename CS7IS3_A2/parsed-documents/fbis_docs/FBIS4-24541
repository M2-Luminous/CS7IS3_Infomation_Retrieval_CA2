Jiang Zemin made a speech, the full text of which is as follows: Time flies like an arrow, and the sun and the moon move back and forth like shuttles. Today is only three years away from China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and many urgent things remain to be done. The central authorities have already formulated a series of important principles and polices toward the management of Hong Kong after 1997. Ten years ago, Deng Xiaoping said to us earnestly: We must believe that the Chinese in Hong Kong can properly manage Hong Kong. Not believing that the Chinese have the ability to manage Hong Kong properly is a type of thinking left behind by old colonialism. We are fully confident that the Hong Kong people can manage Hong Kong well. He said that Hong Kong's current economic stability and prosperity is inseparable from the Hong Kong people's diligence and creative spirit. It was like this in the past, it is like this today, and the Hong Kong people are certainly able to create a good future for Hong Kong tomorrow. There is an old saying which goes: "Bone is linked to muscle," that is, Hong Kong's stability and prosperity is closely linked to and inseparable from the economic development on our mainland and interior, and I am afraid that the mainland still must give great support to the many economic activities in Hong Kong. But Hong Kong will remain different from the mainland in the years to come, and Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy and will be different from the 30 provinces and municipalities on the mainland. We must also realize, however, that the mainland, with its socialism with Chinese characteristics, gives great support to Hong Kong's one country, two systems, to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, and to Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy. In the next three years, the British Hong Kong authorities will still be in charge. But the Hong Kong people must begin participating today. One of the important reasons why we have founded the PWC and have appointed Hong Kong affairs advisers is to provide opportunities and channels for the Hong Kong people to participate in the undertaking of Hong Kong's return and smooth transition, and to lay a foundation for "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong" after 1997. He [as published] expressed the hope that the Hong Kong people would care about the matter of China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and would care about Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, for these are closely linked to the interests of the Hong Kong people. He [as published] hoped that the Hong Kong affairs advisers and the members of the PWC would strengthen ties with the interior through various channels and do a better job in involving the Hong Kong people in the process of making full preparations for the approach of 1997. I wish everyone trouble-free work and good health.
