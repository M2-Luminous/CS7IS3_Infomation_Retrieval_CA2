[Kovacsova] How do you view the status of the small democratic countries in Central Europe at a time when a new strategic balance is being sought on the U.S.-Russia-NATO level? Is there any future for a joint course of action by these small countries? [Goncz] Economic and political integration, as well as integration in the security policy sphere, is not only in the common interest of the Central European countries, but is also in the interest of West Europe. This contributes to stability in the region. We are aware that all four states are coping with more or less the same problems in the economic and, to a certain extent, social spheres. Integration could alleviate the negative impact of transformation. It is also important for our states to infiltrate West European markets, something that is becoming more and more difficult due to the current economic recession affecting our partners there. If we are successful in this, we can reckon with the modernization and development of our own economies. In my opinion, this would also improve our market's importing capability. The Visegrad Four states together represent a 100-million-strong, demanding, and unsaturated market. We are situated conveniently close to West Europe. We can also participate in developing partnership relations between other states in Central, East, and West Europe. Cooperation among our four states is always more advantageous than an individual course of action. We have countless opportunities for mutual integration. Despite the different geographic location of the individual countries, the region forms a coherent unit. A community involving the Visegrad Four states is far more attractive for the West than each state is individually. When integrating with Europe, it is unnecessary to proceed in the same way and enter into the organizations there at the same time. We tried this before, and I would prefer not to talk about the outcome. We face similar tasks in the integration processes, but we are at various stages of development, whether this involves legislation, economic relations, or national security policies. We are also keen on cooperation in human rights issues, environmental protection, and guaranteeing social stability. The essence lies in not formalizing our relations, but in keeping each other informed and -- where possible -- in coordinating our points of view together and bilaterally and not throwing spanners in each others works. I am always glad if Prague succeeds in doing something first and I would be pleased if Prague were to express its pleasure at something we succeed in first. [Kovacsova] We would be interested in hearing Hungary's point of view regarding the United States and Russia and also regarding relations between the Hungarians and the Americans and between the Hungarians and the Russians in the political, cultural, economic, or other spheres. [Goncz] Apart from the United States and Russia, Germany is no less an important partner for Hungary. In my opinion, it will be important to forge close economic ties in parallel with all three of the aforementioned states. To date, U.S. investments in Hungary amount to around $3 billion. Influential American-Hungarians, who play a similar role in cultural relations with the United States, have been of assistance in the influx of U.S. capital. There are numerous experts of Hungarian origin at U.S. universities who can partially influence public opinion and ferment ideas together. Germany is an important and traditional economic partner and it is -- as it is to you -- favorably inclined toward us. This stems from German knowledge of the conditions in our region. As far as our relationship with Russia is concerned, since the last Soviet soldier withdrew from our country, there have been no obstacles preventing the formation of friendly -- I emphasize friendly -- relations. Our political contacts are perfect. I have met three times with President Yeltsin and our meetings have always led to specific and matter-of-fact agreements. Although our foreign trade with Russia now only amounts to 20-25 percent of its former volume, this country is still a vitally important trading partner for us. It purchases agricultural products, including apples and wine, from northern Hungary; Russia is one of the largest importers of wheat, medical supplies, and Ikarus buses. Therefore, it is in Hungary's interest to ensure not only that the Russian market is open but also that it is sufficiently solvent. Undoubtedly, it is in Hungary's crucial interest to ensure that the democratization process in Russia is not halted. We are keen for the United States to assist and support this process. We have the same view regarding Russia's incorporation into the system of European cooperation and organizations. [Kovacsova] Regarding European security, what is your country's stance toward the Balladur plan, a plan aimed at greater stability? [Goncz] The plan appeals to me very much. I think it can be further adapted. I consider the goal to improve this region's internal stability to be extraordinarily important. The issue of ethnic minorities -- one of the priorities of Hungarian foreign policy -- is of particular concern to us. Hungary is not striving for unilateral advantages for the Hungarian minorities, but for all the minorities living in the states in our region, which is like an ethnic mosaic. Ethnic minorities are a problem for every state and, therefore, we have to seek standard principles and a common denominator that would define equal commitments. Ethnic Hungarians have been living since 1920 in more states under various circumstances and have different experiences. Such minorities always bear a dual responsibility. They should assist the overall development of the majority state where they will enjoy success only if they are loyal to it. However, they also have moral ties to their own community and to their mother state with which they have cultural and linguistic links. The two states involved can always assist in this. This reasoning is purely positive, and is definitely not directed against anyone. Implementing it could help a great deal in the interest of an internal settlement for this region. That is, at least until the common borders are absolutely permeable. [Kovacsova] In your opinion, in what way could mutual relations between Hungary and Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic, or Hungary and Poland change following the Prague meeting with President Clinton? [Goncz] At the moment, we do not know exactly what the talks on 12 January will concern, because we do not know the conclusions to be reached at the NATO summit from where President Clinton will travel to Prague. Afterwards, he will hold talks in Russia. Independently of this, it is important for the Visegrad Four states to consider the development of their economic relations. We have a free trade zone agreement. This is an important plus. The problem is that the Visegrad Four states have virtually the same deformed economic structure. I think, however, that it is possible to find together the means of expanding mutual trade. It is pointless to compete with each other on third markets. I attach no less importance to a systematic exchange of political information and to coordination. We could quite easily slip up without them. We do not have conflicting interests, our friendship has not been impaired by anything, and our cultural traditions and ways of thinking are similar. We also speak the same language politically and the development in our societies is identical. It is essential to expand and intensify regional cooperation and I emphasize that we will get by without establishing administrative structures. If the need arises, the foreign ministers, the prime ministers, and even the heads of state can contact each other for a personal exchange of views. If a certain issue becomes acute or if a difficulty crops up in the system of relations, it is sometimes enough merely to life the telephone. [Kovacsova] What kind of role could the endeavor to become a full-fledged partner for the advanced parts of Europe and the United States play for our region? [Goncz] Our integration with Europe will be considered at the end of the century. I think it could be sooner. Perhaps not for all of us at the same time. It could happen that we will dispatch the Czech Republic as our avantgarde. Or, it will send us into Europe as a vanguard. Whoever is first will reserve a place for the second. It is essential that he does not slam the door in the other's face. We perceive the significance of Euro-Atlantic cooperation as our incorporation into the European security system on a pancontinental scale. At the moment, I cannot say what role the reformed NATO and the Western European Union will play and I cannot say at what pace we will proceed in modernizing our economies. I consider these three elements to be the most important, while I reckon that they can be intensified at a different pace. I propose that we think about which of them we want to cooperate in and how, even without written treaties. After all, we are one family. If we do not realize this, then we are real dimwits.
