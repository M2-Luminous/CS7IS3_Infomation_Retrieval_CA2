He said that Israel was now seriously considering implementing an early withdrawal from the Gaza Strip even before the negotiations were fully completed. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen interviewed the foreign minister a short while ago. [Begin recording] [Peres] I think that both sides want to extricate themselves from this confusing situation and achieve results. The time is ripe for decisions and an interim period may only invite further trouble. [Rosen] Sir, you are about to send armed Palestinian policemen and an multinational force into the powder keg that is Hebron. When will the government finally make the decision it is constantly discussing and inching toward to evacuate some of the Jewish settlers from Hebron? [Peres] First of all, I would like to make things perfectly clear. The Jewish residents of Hebron are not in charge of the Cave of the Patriarchs. The Israeli Government, through the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], is responsible for the Cave of Patriarchs and for guaranteeing freedom of access and worship at the site. As for Jewish settlers residing in Hebron, the government has to reach a decision. There is no point in ministers, including myself, making premature statements. The appropriate place for discussions is in the cabinet, not the media. Clearly, we are facing a very difficult problem. It is not a problem of rights but a problem of relations. [Rosen] Is Israel ready to consider starting its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip even before the negotiations are completed in order to meet the target date of 13 April? [Peres] I believe that any reasonable proposal will be examined on an individual basis. I do not want to make any generalizations, but the Palestinians are not the only ones who want to enter the Gaza Strip quickly. We also want to transfer authority to them quickly. There is no point in gaining another week or two of riots. We have no interest in this. All the violent confrontations which took place recently cause all of us pain, and we have no interest in seeing any further bloodshed, not of Arabs and certainly not of Jews. [end recording]
