Indeed, the Assembly notes that the internal stability in these countries depends to a large extent on modernising their structures and transformation in economic, industrial and technological domains, domains where it believes it is possible and desirable to improve Western assistance for these countries. The Assembly insists on the creation of a European information system, as currently initiatives often have a double use, and calls on WEU member countries to give all their political and economic support to Moscow's International Centre for Science and Technology, whose aim is to prevent the proliferation of technologies of mass destruction. Noting that Ukraine and Kazakhstan had not yet acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Assembly called on the WEU Council to try to obtain this accession.
