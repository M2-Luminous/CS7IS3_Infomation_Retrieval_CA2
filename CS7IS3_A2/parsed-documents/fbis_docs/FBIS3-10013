That the constitutional president of the republic and commander general of the Army has preserved the apolitical nature of the armed institution since the start of this mandate on 6 June 1993. 2. That, consequently, the president of Guatemala has never tried to involve the Army in political-electoral activities such as the recent popular consultation, and has thus fully respected the duties that the Constitution of the republic assigned to the Armed Forces. 3. That, in the same way there has been no presidential attempt to manipulate the Army, the president has not issued orders to influence the Civilian Self-Defense Voluntary Committees either. 4. That, in rejecting any claim contrary to the aforementioned, the Army is reaffirming its absolute respect for the country's institutions and its support for the current constitutional government of the Republic headed by Ramiro De Leon Carpio. 5. That, in view of the need to promote the highest degree of well-being for the Guatemalan people, the Army urges all segments of the population to intensify efforts in favor of harmony, peace, and national reconciliation. [Issued] Guatemala City, 27 February 1994. "Fiftieth anniversary of the revolution of 20 October 1944."
