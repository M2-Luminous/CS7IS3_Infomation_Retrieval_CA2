C. Comparison to Earlier Proposed Rule The 1990 proposed rule estimated the cost for central treatment to be $65 million (excluding monitoring costs). There were assumed to be 1350 systems which would need to treat for sulfate. For this reproposal EPA updated the cost to $139 million (excluding State and monitoring costs). The increase in cost is due to: (1) The increase in projected number of systems that would exceed the sulfate MCL from 1350 to 1950, (2) change in the interest rate from 3% to 7%, and (3) updating for 1991 dollars. Although the new occurrence information was taken primarily from the National Inorganics and Radionuclides Survey (NIRS), EPA complemented that information with sampling data from New York, Utah, South Dakota, North Dakota and New Jersey. Because of the new occurrence information, the number of systems has gone up from 1350 to 1950. Another reason for the increase is EPA's modification, as a result of research for the upcoming regulation concerning the control of radionuclides in drinking water, of the number of treatment sites per ground water system. Ground water systems frequently contain more than one site requiring treatment because wells are typically not piped to a central source. EPA has incorporated this estimation method for all systems served by ground water. D. Annual Burden to PWSS and States EPA estimates that the cost of sulfate regulation to State programs will be $7 million per year. Table 11 illustrates the 18-year average annual national burden hours, responses and costs to PWSs and States. Sulfate testing does not require special laboratory equipment. Therefore, it is assumed that laboratory expansion undertaken to implement the Phase II and Phase V regulations will largely satisfy the monitoring needs of this rule. On the other hand, EPA recognizes that States are likely to provide more technical assistance to systems than for an average contaminant because of the unique nature of Option 1. Total annual costs are estimated to be $10.6 million. The additional public reporting burden on PWSs for this collection of information is estimated to average 8.6 hours per response.
