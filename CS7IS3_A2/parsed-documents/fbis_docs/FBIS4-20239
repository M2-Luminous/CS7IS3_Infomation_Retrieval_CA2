Spain in particular is pressing the other EU states to make the Maghreb, which consists of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania a priority for a co-ordinated EU initiative, warning that the Union could otherwise receive some nasty shocks. The turmoil in North Africa has grown dramatically since last November when, under the Maastricht Treaty, a list of common foreign policy "joint actions" was defined. Even so most EU states, preoccupied with ex-Yugoslavia and the issue of Central and East Europe, remain reluctant to bring their weight behind attempts to solve the violence. The latest ominous development is in Algeria, where most of France's remaining 2,000 nationals are fleeing a virtual civil war. Islamic fundamentalism, rooted in economic deprivation, is cutting a swathe right across North Africa. Algeria is the tinder box. If the fundamentalists win in Algeria, a bush fire could sweep away the other relatively stable governments of the Maghreb. The Europe Union faces the threat of mass migration and the transplantation of terrorism on to European soil as well as the destruction of trading and political relations. That is why stability and prosperity in the Maghreb are vital for security, not just in the Mediterranean region, but throughout the EU. When the European governments decided on their priorities for the common foreign and security policy inaugurated by the Maastricht Treaty, they decided to concentrate on the former Yugoslavia, Russia, the Middle East, South Africa and Somalia. The Maghreb was too close to home, and too many special national interests were involved. Five years ago things looked more promising. A serious attempt was made by the European Commission to create a free trade area with the Maghreb, backed up by political ties. It was sparked by a letter from King Hassan of Morocco to the EC proposing Moroccan membership. The Commission said that the request could not be considered as Morocco was not a European country. However, the idea took root that North Africa should be helped. In addition to providing aid for development efforts were to be made to build the economies of North African societies through small businesses in the hope of building a middle class. There was also to be help for debt repayments through a new development bank. Two years ago, in its first formal declaration dealing with north Africa, the European Community at the Lisbon summit expressed its determination to foster "partnership" with the Maghreb. But the free trade initiative has fizzled out, and nothing has come of the Lisbon declaration. The economic downturn in Europe led EU countries which had economic interests that conflicted with those of the Maghreb to pursue their own short-term advantage. Spain was the first to ignore attempts towards free trade when it decided to protect its fishermen rather than agree to a fisheries pact with Morocco. Spain, concerned about its Canary Islands produce, then followed France in the GATT talks in forcing the EU to agree to a minimum entry price for vegetables and fruit at the Maghreb's expense. Attempts are now under way to compensate Morocco, but Germany and Britain are opposing Spain's proposal to grant extra EU funds to support Morocco's balance of payments. A bloc-to-bloc approach with the Maghreb Union, an economic group formed to negotiate trade agreements, is in any case impossible. Libya is excluded from any EU initiatives, because it is the target of sanctions resulting from the bombing of the Pan Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people died. Moreover, Colonel al-Qadhdhafi seems to be losing his grip, leading to the fascinating idea that Europe might find itself bolstering his regime on the grounds that anything is preferable to anti-Western Islamic fundamentalism. Mauritania is also ineligible for any deals with the EU because it gets separate benefits from the Lome Convention, which gives preferential trading terms with the EC to former colonies. But it is the most fragile country of all Algeria -- which is the case study of how the interests of individual EU nations continue to take precedence over a common EU foreign policy. The EU is split over Algeria. France, which as the former colonial power has most to gain from a return to stability, is pressing for a loan of $1billion to Algeria to help solve the balance of payments crisis. But Germany and Britain are sceptical about a loan they believe would delay economic reforms. Tunisia has been struggling to make something meaningful out of the Maghreb Union. But even Tunisia will not be strong enough to be able to offer fully free trade with the EU until around 2010. There are still hopes of finalising partnership deals with Morocco and Tunisia by the end of the year, and with Algeria later, unless that country falls into a political abyss. But this will not be enough. The EU's policy towards the Maghreb consists of a fatal combination of good intent accompanied by narrow national self-interest. As member states argue over where the money should come from, events might well overtake them.
