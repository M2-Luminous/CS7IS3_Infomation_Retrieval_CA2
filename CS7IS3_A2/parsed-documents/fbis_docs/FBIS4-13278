After having ordered the closure of the occupied territories for 10 days following the latest round of massacres, the government in Jerusalem has decided to allow some 20,000 Palestinians involved in social and humanitarian work to be allowed back in. Prime Minister Rabin has also announced a plan for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan Heights. Our correspondent Giovanni Bocco interviewed Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres: [Begin recording] [Bocco, in English, translating his own question into Italian] The Cairo peace negotiations have restarted: When do you think an agreement over Gaza and Jericho will be reached? [Peres, in English, with correspondent providing Italian translation] It appears to me that both ourselves and the PLO are respecting the agreements. I believe that the most difficult part of the negotiations has been overcome. The majority of the workload is behind us. If all goes well, then in two or three weeks time we will leave the Gaza Strip. [Bocco] The international observers are arriving in Hebron. There are 35 Italians among these observers: What do you think about this? [Peres] I believe that this is an important contribution to the peace process. The international presence is truly welcome, at least on our part, because it is important in bringing normal living conditions to Hebron and for preventing acts of violence. This welcome extends to the Italian contingent. [Bocco] What do you think of the arrival of the Palestinian police force? [Peres] I think that the Palestinians can and must provide security measures. They must police themselves. We cannot be the policemen of the Palestinians who have every right to have their own security force. We are happy that the police force is on its way. You cannot imagine how truthful my words are. [end recording]
