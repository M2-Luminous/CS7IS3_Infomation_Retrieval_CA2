FR941206-1-00142 FR941206-1-00015 International Trade Impact Statement In accordance with the Office of Management and Budget memorandum dated March 1983, federal agencies engaged in rulemaking activities are required to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. The FAA finds that this proposed rule would not have an adverse impact on trade opportunities for either U.S. firms doing business overseas or foreign firms doing business in the United States. The proposed rule would impose no costs on both domestic and foreign air carriers, so neither would have a trade advantage over the other. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' There is no cost associated with this proposed rule; therefore, this proposal does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Federalism Impact This proposal will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511), there are no requirements for information collection associated with this proposed rule. Conclusion For the reasons discussed above, and based on the findings in the initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade Impact Statement, the FAA certifies that this proposed regulation will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866 and is not considered significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979).
