In the wake of the announcement, al-Bid said: The new country will be one according to the present constitution in the north. He added: Elections will be held in the country within a period of one year. The news related to the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has been published at a time when the Yemeni Government in Sanaa called for the implementation of a three-day cease-fire in the civil war in that country late Friday [20 May]. Meanwhile incoming reports say that the southern forces have withdrawn from the strategic al-Anad base which has fallen to the northern forces. Though according to informed sources the forces of the north are advancing toward Aden, the capital of the south, but the resistance being put up by the southern forces will not make it so easy for the northern forces to capture Aden, the main headquarters of the Socialist Party. At any rate, Yemen's present situation and its redivision speak of the fact that with the passage of four years since the unification of the two northern and southern sectors, in May 1990, the trend adopted by the Yemeni leaders had neither been logical nor in line with the basic principle of unity. The Socialist Party's concern over its limited role in running the country's affairs and the resulting dissension over the division of power, which surfaced openly after the parliamentary elections in April last year, laid the foundation for the present deep differences. This is so because, despite the reunification of the northern and southern sectors, as the Congress Party and the Socialist Party were considered opponents in the past due to their different ideologies, the tension between them deepened following the weakening of the Socialist Party after the parliamentary elections -- so much so that al-Bid stopped taking part in political activities 10 months ago. In this connection he offered an 18-point plan for running the country on the basis of a federal system calling for a far more serious role for the Socialist Party. However considering it as being a threat against the unity, the Yemeni president rejected the plan. This led to the deepening of differences and the fear that the Yemeni crisis may assume regional proportions. So certain regional countries mediated in the matter and a reconciliation accord was signed in Amman, but these efforts did not yield any result. According to political analysts, the two rival parties had assumed that with the failure of political efforts military means could have proved effective in reducing the tension or that it would at least secure the interests of one of the two sides. But it is war, bloodshed, and the loss of natural and financial resources that Yemen is currently witnessing. Further, in view of the fact that unity had been the goal of the nation and even the state officials, the outcome of the independence announced by the southerners as the final solution to the deep ongoing crisis will not encompass the national will and may plunge Yemen in yet deeper turmoil.
