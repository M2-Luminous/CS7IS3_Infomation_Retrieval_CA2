Slyusarevska: "How to `Cure' Inflation"; place and date not given] [Text] Professor Doctor of Economic Sciences Volodymyr Chernyak, the outstanding scientist and politician, talks with journalist S. Slyusarevska about his conception of anti-inflation policy. [Slyusarevska] Our economy is badly ailing. One of its ailments is inflation. Various ways to "cure it" have been proposed. In your opinion, Volodymyr Kyrylovych, what is the distinguishing feature of a method of "curing" inflation? [Chernyak] The nature of the inflation. A particular set of "cures" should be used depending on the nature of the inflation. Spending inflation requires one kind, demand inflation requires another. In our case, spending inflation has combined with demand inflation, although spending inflation predominates. In Ukraine, inflation is of a monetary, structural, and institutional character. Hence, the Ukrainian version of inflation has a very complex nature. Hence, the "cure" for inflation has to be integrated, consistent, and specific. The situation requires a combination of "cures." Ukraine's anti-inflation policy has to combine monetary and nonmonetary methods (with emphasis on the latter, I believe). There has been too little effort to limit the amount of money in circulation (to restrain monetary and credit emissions and uncontrolled wages), and in any case that is not the decisive condition for curbing inflation. It would be sufficient if inflation was merely a monetary process. Hence, the ineffectiveness of purely monetary methods of curbing inflation in Ukraine is an objective fact. [Slyusarevska] By the way, what is the level of inflation in Ukraine right now, and what tendencies are apparent? [Chernyak] Inflation in 1993 added up to 4619 percent. In that regard, Ukraine ranked second in the world after Yugoslavia. Toward the end of last year, inflation ran as high as 80 to 100 percent per month. Starting early this year, however, the rate dropped substantially: retail prices rose by 19.2 percent in January, 12.6 percent in February, and 5.7 percent in March. That effect was gained through purely monetary methods--stopping the issuance of bank notes (as a result of which wages were not paid regularly) and implementing a tough credit policy (as a result of which mutual settlements between enterprises practically halted). Naturally, it is impossible to go on for long not paying wages and not extending credit, and as soon as the taboo is lifted the inflation spiral begins anew. Monetary measures produce an effect swiftly, but it vanishes just as quickly. We need nonstandard, nontraditional solutions. In particular, nonmonetary methods of curbing inflation--more specifically, a combination of monetary and nonmonetary methods. Monetary methods alone tend to suppress demand and paralyze the incentive to work and invest. [Slyusarevska] Now let's find out what the causes of inflation in Ukraine are. [Chernyak] Indeed, in order to cure an illness you have to treat its causes, not its symptoms. The basic culprits of inflation in our country are not rising wages or even monetary and credit emissions but rather the shortage of goods, declining productivity, the lack of effective incentives to work, structural distortions of the economy, monopolism and corruption. Although, to be sure, we cannot discount monetary and credit emissions, subsidies and indexation of earnings. [Slyusarevska] In your view, what has been our government's biggest mistake in anti-inflation policy in the past few years? [Chernyak] If we can talk about any anti-inflation policy of our government at all, we must point out that over the past two years it has been oriented toward freezing wages and controlling enterprise consumption funds--hence, restraining effective demand. This is definitely in conflict with our realities. [Slyusarevska] What would the right thing be? [Chernyak] As I have said, spending inflation predominates here. Yet the policy which the government and the National Bank have been conducting is more suitable to demand inflation. An element of anti-inflation policy such as suppressing effective demand works effectively only where there is a market, and not just a market but a buyer's rather than a producer's market. But conditions here are quite otherwise today. Therefore, suppressing demand as an element of anti-inflation policy must be relegated to the background. Let me emphasize that while I do not deny its importance overall, I am merely pointing out that the emphasis has to be placed correctly. In our situation, prices on goods are not going down despite weak demand. Depressed demand is one of the causes of declining production. All countries having a developed market economy try to stimulate rather than suppress demand. So we will have to apply different tools of anti-inflation policy. [Slyusarevska] Which, specifically? [Chernyak] The development of the production of goods and services must serve as the foundation of anti-inflation policy. We face the necessity of simultaneously stopping the decline in production and rising prices. As a rule, just one thing happens in the world--either prices go up, or production volumes go down. In our case, however, there is an ominous combination of processes which economic scientists call "stagflation" (that is, a combination of stagnation and inflation). Therefore, the most effective anti-inflation measure today would be to boost the production of consumer goods. The main thing is to saturate the market with goods, and everything else will follow. [Slyusarevska] But how is that to be done? As they say, the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.... [Chernyak] By designing effective incentives to work and invest. This is possible on the basis of privatization in various forms, the creation of an environment fostering the development of entrepreneurship, liberalization of foreign economic activities, as well as promoting stabilization--that is, establishing a finance system--all of which requires changes in monetary, budget, tax, and credit policies. Primarily, anti-inflation measures are those which foster the development of the production of goods, making it more effective and competitive. [Slyusarevska] This question would seem to merit more elaboration. [Chernyak] Our main problem is production (to which, owing to disastrous anti-inflation policies, we must also add the problem of sales) rather than inflation. The development of production is closely linked to transformations in ownership relations, including ownership of the means of production, land, and property, the formation of market mechanisms and the development of entrepreneurship, and restructuring of the economy (eliminating structural disproportions on the macro-level and streamlining [sanatsiya] enterprises on the micro-level). Any anti-inflation policy can be successful only on the basis of privatization. Privatization is an anti-inflation measure because, first of all, it fosters the designing of effective incentives to work and invest, and, second, it serves as a source of revenue for local and state budgets. It is possible to balance money and goods only on the basis of structural shifts in favor of the production of consumer goods rather than by raising prices and freezing wages. Incidentally, the only inflation that is dangerous is the kind that doesn't work to effect restructuring of the economy. [Slyusarevska] Hence, structural policy also requires the rethinking of certain changes. What ones, specifically? [Chernyak] We're talking about changes in structural policy which must include these basic directions: the releasing of energy, raw materials, financial, and labor resources from the extractive sectors and the military-industrial complex and channeling them into the production of food and other consumer goods in order to bring the economy's consumption sector out of its crisis; instituting of a complex of measures to supply the economy with fuel and energy resources (expanding exploration work, creating joint stock companies to boost the output of petroleum on our own territory and in the oil and gas regions of other countries, the construction of a tanker fleet and oil terminals, rebuilding of oil refineries, making use of alternative energy sources, and implementing an active energy and resource conservation policy). I would also include these things among necessary changes in structural policy: the development of science-intensive and ecologically clean industries and the enhancement of our export potential and production of goods to trade for imports. Any structural policy can be effective only on the basis of activating innovation and investment activity, the material basis of which is the development of investment machine-building, which has been badly neglected. Imported equipment can improve the technological structure of capital investments. To the foregoing we must add the following: measures that are anti-inflationary are those linked to the creation of a competitive environment. Hence, anti-monopoly policies are anti-inflationary at the same time. [Slyusarevska] Among measures of anti-inflation policy, what importance do you assign to the streamlining of production? [Chernyak] High priority. What is needed is a scalpel in a firm hand, and let's not forget that there must be trust in that hand. And let's not forget the anesthesia. It is obvious that we have to give up on supporting inefficient enterprises and design a mechanism for financial bankruptcy. The longer we avoid dealing with this problem the worse things get. Applying the financial and credit system to the process of supporting enterprises' artificial solvency only serves to foster inflation swings. Let me emphasize that bankruptcy may constitute retribution, but under our conditions enterprises frequently go bankrupt as a result of depreciation of their own reserves, a shortage of circulating capital, excessive interest on their loans, and nonpayments (a nonpayment crisis provokes inflation). When instituting streamlining, of course, we need to see to it that its negative social consequences are neutralized as far as possible (in particular, unemployment). One essential condition for enterprise streamlining is the abolition of state orders as interpreted by the Cabinet of Ministers. The only thing that should be preserved is the state contract between enterprises and state clients which pay for orders from state resources (or credits). We need to allow banks to accept state property as collateral, so that if the enterprise is unable to pay, the banks can sell the property for the market price. The problem of streamlining is closely linked to privatization (bankruptcy is a form of privatization). To overcome inflation we need to bring the main elements of the national wealth into commodity circulation--the means of production, state property, and land. [Slyusarevska] What role is assigned to reducing the state budget deficit in implementing anti-inflation policy? [Chernyak] In 1993, the budget deficit stood at 25 percent of the gross domestic product, which is higher than in any of the neighboring post-socialist countries. Ukraine has a chance to wind up in the "Guinness Book of World Records." And because the budget deficit is a cause of inflation, reducing it and balancing revenues and expenditures constitute a vital direction in anti-inflation policy. State budget revenues can be increased by formulating and implementing an effective new taxation system, liquidating unjustified tax breaks and changing tax rates in order to stimulate business, also improving the work of the tax inspectorate; introducing land taxes and fees for natural resources; revising taxes on citizens' property and individual income which are not invested in production; converting to settlements for exported goods in world market prices; introducing economically justified tariffs on foreign goods transported over Ukrainian territory; and introducing state securities to make up for the budget deficit. In order to reduce the expenditure portion of the budget it is necessary to liquidate budget loans and subsidies to losing enterprises, reduce the number and size of sectorial ministries and their departments and local agencies, abolish budget loans and financing of capital investments of enterprises, revise certain social programs, restrict migration into Ukraine by pensioners from other countries, and include the pension fund and social insurance fund in the budget. Under present conditions, it is useful to draw up the budget quarterly, because the financial system is virtually destroyed. [Slyusarevska] What about wages? Rising wages are also a cause of inflation. [Chernyak] Yes, but not the main one. Rising wages are a cause of inflation when they are paid for by means of monetary emissions--that is, when the wage dynamic is divorced from the production dynamic. Hence, we need a correlation between the size of wages and the dynamic of production as well as the dynamic of prices. One mechanism for slowing wages can be taxation. Therefore, wages need to be indexed, and control over enterprises' consumption funds must be abolished. [Slyusarevska] Let's discuss the controversial question of credit. Should credit be cheap or costly? [Chernyak] It is hard to give an unequivocal answer. In order to provide sufficient credit to the economy, of course, we need to increase rather than reduce credit resources. What I have in mind is mobilizing real credit resources. Credit should be granted primarily on the basis of collateral, which will require the institution of a lien law. The national economy can be restructured only on the basis of credit and tax breaks. Hence, we need to combine a tough financial policy with respect to existing production facilities, on the one hand, and a policy of cheap credit for the restructuring of the economy, on the other. Generally, demand inflation is generally "treated" with costly credit, but what we have, keep in mind, is spending inflation. I would say that the essence of the problem is not excessive credit emissions but rather the ineffective application of the credit mechanism. Credit can be both inflationary and deflationary (if it fosters restructuring, renovation of the production apparatus, acceleration of capital circulation, and plentiful goods in the market). It is obvious that credit should not be extended fanwise but along the chain of producers. It is urgently necessary to change the system of refinancing, having created a market of credit resources so that each bank can buy them and invest them in profitable projects. [Slyusarevska] A final question: What should we do with traditional--monetary--"cures?" [Chernyak] Apply them in definite doses and certain combinations with other "cures." Any effort to curb inflation requires substantially limiting amounts of money in circulation. The general rule is this: the amount of money in circulation must not increase faster than production. Excess money in circulation leads to increased prices. The essence of the question is what means to use to limit the amount of money in circulation. We need to replace direct monetary emission by National Bank credits. It is possible to limit money in circulation by issuing securities (stocks, bonds, and so on), and also through the circulation of notes as a form of mutual settlements. The most reliable form of securities is the issuance of earmarked loans for projects which can be put into operation swiftly (for example, the production of food products, medical equipment, education, and so forth), also the issuance of municipal loans for specific programs.
