Shells were fired from tanks, howitzers, and mortar-launchers. There is no peace on the front lines either. Since early this morning shell explosions and small-arms fire can be heard from this direction. Fighters of the Bosnian Army's V Corps and members of the Internal Affairs Ministry and the Croat Defense Council are successfully repelling all attacks by aggressors who have been trying to break through our fighters' defense lines for over a month without success. By the time of this report we have not received information on any casualties in this morning's attack. The shelling of the town and the suburbs stopped when NATO planes were seen flying above. The same happened during the night when NATO planes were swarming the skies above Bihac. Muhamed Mulic reporting from Bihac for Bosnian Radio and TV.
