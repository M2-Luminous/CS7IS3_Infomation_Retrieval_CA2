The experts are to visit the airport, which Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said Tuesday in Moscow they had agreed to reopen after almost two year's closure. Under the agreement, Russian observers are to guarantee the airport is not used to bring military supplies into the northeastern city. The Russian delegation held talks at UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) headquarters after their arrival in the Croatian capital, an UNPROFOR spokesman said. The delegation includes officials from the Russian Ministry for Emergencies and is headed by Sergey Kudinov [name as received], the spokesman added. UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi said Thursday [3 March] however that the Moscow agreement was not enough since it had not been approved by the Moslem-led Bosnian Government. Akashi said the UN wanted all parties to agree before the airport was opened, but that the UN was determined to open it "even without an agreement, if necessary."
