The Netherlands has embassies in 87 countries, whereas Luxembourg has representations in only 19 countries. That is why Netherlands diplomats act on behalf of Luxembourg if that is convenient. They prepare visits by political and trade missions, and Luxembourg subjects can turn to Netherlands embassies if they need help. This is a unique form of diplomatic cooperation which, according to Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques F. Poos, would serve as "a good example" for other member states of the European Union to combine their powers. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dismantling of the Soviet Union, some 20 new states have already been created in Europe alone. It is very expensive to open diplomatic posts in all these countries. That is why the small- and medium-sized member states of the European Union would be well-advised to open joint representations in the future, Poos said. The diplomatic cooperation between Luxembourg and the Netherlands stretches back to the last century when Luxembourg was made a Grand Duchy in personal union with the Netherlands under the terms of the Vienna Congress. The first of April will mark the 30th anniversary of the conclusion of an official cooperation treaty between the two countries. In order to celebrate the anniversary, Minister Poos today opened -- together with Prime Minister Santer (who is also minister of culture) and in the presence of Foreign Minister Kooijmans -- an exhibition of Netherlands and Luxembourg artists at the Musee National d'Art et d'Histoire. The exhibition will travel to our country in May. Poos' desire to have the Luxembourg-Netherlands example imitated contrasted sharply with the humiliating experience the minister had earlier this week in Brussels during the enlargement negotiations for the EU. Norway's accession looked like it was going to be blocked by 7,000 tonnes of cod. In addition, the membership of Sweden, Finland, and Austria was seriously jeopardized by the frontal assault which Great Britain and Spain launched against the position of the smaller member states in particular in the Council of Ministers. To the rage of most of the EU member states, London and Madrid refused to raise the threshold of the blocking minority from 23 to 27 votes. By taking this hard-line position, both governments put a heavy advance burden on the intergovernmental conference to be held in 1996 on the future structure of the EU. During that conference the administrative coherence of the EU is to be reinforced to such a degree that by the end of the decade the following step -- the inclusion of countries from Central and East Europe -- can be made flawlessly. The 58-year-old Poos is clearly disappointed. "Nobody understands the attitude taken by Spain and Great Britain which provoked this discussion and jeopardized the current enlargement. Everyone is guessing at the underlying considerations," he said. "Naturally, the Union will have a different geographical configuration after the enlargement. The weight of northern Europe and the weight of Germany -- through the adhesion of Austria -- will be reinforced. But surely that is nothing new? That was already known a year and a half ago when, at the European summit in Lisbon, we decided that enlargement should take place quickly and that this accession would still fit in with the existing institutional relations. The Spanish and British prime ministers were there and said `yes.' Now the time has come for a signature, and they are saying `no.' They have assumed a serious responsibility in doing so, but I have not yet given up hope that this crisis can still be overcome in the coming days." [Netherlands] State Secretary Piet Dankert said this week that the debate on the voting position must be taken up at the intergovernmental conference in 1996, when all institutional changes must be put on the agenda. "I am not saying that in 1996 the Netherlands will definitely agree with 23 votes," Dankert said. Poos agrees completely with this position. "Nobody currently has a clear blueprint" for the future structure of the Union, he said. However, "everyone does agree that the EU must remain efficient, and the fundamental principle of equality of the countries must not disappear," Poos stated Luxembourg's position. His government is not looking forward to an institutional revolution. After 1996, too, the maintenance of Luxembourg's national identity as a founding father of the united Europe is a priority. This implies, among other things, that the Grand Duchy is firmly committed to having a representative in the European Commission. The suggestion of appointing, say, one commissioner for the Benelux countries -- once the EU has been enlarged -- in order to keep the size of the European Commission under control is unthinkable for the Luxembourg Government. "No, no, no. That would be unacceptable to the Luxembourg parliament, and also for the Netherlands parliament. We are not yet that far advanced with the federal Europe," Poos said. According to him, "it is up to the Commission, and not the member states" to find a meaningful distribution of work. According to Poos, there should also be talk of things besides the expansion of the powers of the European Parliament. "I am convinced that the national parliaments will claim their share of powers in the European decisionmaking process. The role of the national parliaments at the European level has only grown in recent years. Europe's democratic legitimacy has two pillars: one in Strasbourg and one in the national parliaments." When speaking of national identity you inevitably come to the status of Luxembourg as a financial center. Germany, which will take over the EU presidency this summer, has already hinted it will submit plans for a European tax on interest income. Bonn hopes to curb capital flight to neighboring Luxembourg in this way, but the Luxembourg Government will not cooperate, Poos announced. Such a proposal is "not acceptable" because that would start off a capital flight not only from Luxembourg but from the entire European Union to financial centers outside the Community. "We will not move as long as gaps inside and outside the Community remain unplugged," Poos said. He can say that easily because decisions in this area must be made unanimously and not with a majority of the votes. "We therefore do not need a blocking minority. We have a veto, but we do not stand alone here. The British, too, do not favor this, nor do other countries, such as the Netherlands." Poos the economist is optimistic that the majority of EU member states can move on to the third phase of economic and monetary union [EMU] in 1997, and that "the ECU will become the currency of Luxembourg." Last year, when the Belgian franc dropped sharply, there were even rumors that Luxembourg wanted to break off the monetary union with Belgium. However, said Poos, that would be "a catastrophic option, which we do not even want to think about seriously." He simply said that Belgium would be in a position to move on to EMU along with Luxembourg in 1997. Poos' optimism was further strengthened with the visit by Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski to Luxembourg this week. The economic recovery is already under way in the United States, as well as in several East European countries. Economic growth in Poland is now around 4 percent, according to Olechowski. That offers hope. Poos is counting on countries like Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to become members of the European Union before the end of the century. "We have no alternative. If we say `no,' we will send them back into chaos. Then we would perhaps be responsible if the democratic governments in these countries were overthrown. That is why we must say `yes,' and why we have already said `yes.' The only thing is we cannot yet give an exact date."
