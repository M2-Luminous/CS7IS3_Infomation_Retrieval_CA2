[Diaz] "This is not an Indian uprising. In the past few days various Indian and peasant communities in the four municipalities have rejected and taken action against this armed group." She said the armed group is comprised of two different elements. [Diaz] "There is a professional leadership, expert in leading violent and terrorist acts, well-educated, made up of both Mexicans and foreigners. The leadership has high-powered weapons and uses sophisticated communications equipment. The others are Indians and peasants, many no older than 14 or 15, with deficient education and training, armed with machetes, shotguns, or small caliber weapons." She explained that the four municipal capitals are now secure, but the radical group continues harassing the Army. This is why security measures are being reinforced. [Diaz] "The government is making an enormous effort to assure that the effect on civilians of these attacks be an minimal as possible." She spoke of specific instructions for civilian defense. [Diaz] "There will be no arbitrary actions or violations of rights. Those who violate these principles will be punished according to law." Socorro Diaz explained that the government has publicly accepted the call by the Chiapas bishops and the Evangelical Church asking that the violence end and that human life be respected. [Diaz] "The armed aggressor group has said nothing; their reply has been to continue the violence. The Army is fulfilling its constitutional obligation of preserving peace, ensuring domestic security, and protecting the population in their villages." Diaz reiterated the government's recognition of backward conditions and a history of abuses and neglect in Chiapas. For this reason the government was forced to be extremely prudenct. [Diaz] "The government did all it could to avoid violence." She said that in 1993 there were clashes between the Army and the radical group on three occasions, but the Army's preventive measures were discontinued at the request of non-government organizations. Increased dialogue was then pursued, as were social and economic solutions for the area.
