FR940727-1-00007 FR940727-1-00002 7 CFR Part 906 [Docket No. FV94&hyph;906&hyph;2PR] Oranges and Grapefruit Grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas; Revision of Special Purpose Exemption Provisions AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule invites comments on revising the administrative rules and regulations in effect under the Texas citrus marketing order. The revision would eliminate the provision which exempts fruit handled for home use from the order's grade, size, pack, container, inspection and assessment requirements. This proposed rule would help prevent unauthorized shipments of uninspected citrus from being shipped out of the production area. Individuals would continue to be able to handle up to 400 pounds of citrus per day exempt from order requirements which should be sufficient for fruit purchased for home use. DATES: Comments must be received by August 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this proposed rule. Comments must be sent in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, D.C. 20090&hyph;6456. Fax # (202) 720&hyph;5698. Comments should reference the docket number and the date and page number of this issue of the Federal Register and will be available for public inspection in the Office of the Docket Clerk during regular business hours.
