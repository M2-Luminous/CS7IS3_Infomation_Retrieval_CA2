Brother Abu-'Ammar said the meeting addressed the UN Security Council debate on the al-Ibrahmi Mosque massacre in Hebron. Brother Abu-'Ammar, who was speaking after the session, said he had briefed the Tunisian president on the contents of the message he received from the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. He told him that the message pressed home the need for keeping the peace process going. Abu-'Ammar reiterated the Palestinian position on the need for the Security Council to pass a strong resolution that takes into account the question of Jerusalem and condemns the attack on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and decides on immediate measures to protect our Palestinian people. Brother Abu-'Ammar criticized the council's inability thus far to pass a resolution on the appaling massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. Cited by the French daily LE FIGARO, he said the council is not debating a draft resolution submitted by the Palestinians and the Arab and nonaligned group at the United Nations, but one proposed by the U.S. Administration itself. The Americans, he added, are opposed to any resolution that includes Jerusalem as part of the occupied territory, despite the fact that Resolution 799 on the fourth Geneva Convention states just that. Abu-'Ammar demanded that Israel honor the Declaration of Principles agreement which Israel and the PLO signed in Washington on 13 September, 1993. 'Arafat said he will give Israel until 12 April to implement the Gaza-Jericho First Accord. If the Declaration of Priniciples fails to be honestly and accurately implemented, I will then have the right to put the facts before my people, added Abu-'Ammar. As to why he set the 12 April date, brother Abu-'Ammar explained that it is the day fixed by the Declaration of Principles for a completion of the Israeli withdrawal. If that does not happen this means the Israeli Government has decided not to honor agreements it signed. The responsibility then shifts to the international community, particularly the U.S. and Russian sponsors of the peace process, brother Abu-'Ammar said.
