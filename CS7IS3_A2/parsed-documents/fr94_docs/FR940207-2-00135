Relating to the Listing of Options on American Depositary Receipts January 31, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on December 2, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc., (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 1 The proposal was amended on December 28, 1993 to clarify the procedure the PSE would use to determine whether 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market. Letter from Michael D. Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, to Richard Zack, Branch Chief, Office of Derivatives Regulation, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated December 28, 1993 (``Amendment No. 1''). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The PSE proposes to amend Rules 3.6 and 3.7 to provide for the listing and trading of options on American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') where 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, PSE and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change On November 27, 1992, the Commission approved a PSE proposal to list and trade ADR options where the underlying foreign security is subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement and the underlying ADR meets or exceeds the Exchange's established uniform options listing standards. 2 First, the ADR Approval Order provides that for ADR options to be eligible for listing and continued trading, the PSE must have comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements in place with the foreign exchanges that serve as the primary markets for the foreign securities underlying the ADRs, unless the Commission otherwise approves the options' listing without an agreement. Second, the PSE's initial listing standards require that the ADRs underlying the Exchange-listed options have a ``float'' of 7,000,000 ADRs outstanding, 2,000 shareholders, trading volume of at least 2,400,000 over the prior twelve month period, and a minimum price of $71/2 for a majority of the business days during the preceding three month period. Moreover, options on ADRs must meet or exceed the maintenance criteria for continued listing under the PSE rules. Those criteria require that the ADRs underlying Exchange-listed options maintain a ``float'' of 6,300,000 ADRs, 1,600 shareholders, trading volume of at least 1,800,000 over the prior twelve month period, and a minimum price of $5 on a majority of the business days during the preceding six month period. Additionally, the ADR Approval Order requires the PSE to make reasonable inquiry to evaluate the securities underlying the ADRs to ensure that these securities are generally consistent with the above-noted listing requirements. 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31530 (November 27, 1992), 57 FR 57262 (December 3, 1992) (``ADR Approval Order''). A comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement provides, among other things, for the exchange of market trading activity, clearing activity, and the identity of the ultimate purchaser or seller of the securities traded. Furthermore, the PSE options initial listing standards require that the ADR underlying an ADR option be registered and listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of a national securities association and be reported as a national market system security. The issuers of the ADRs also must be in compliance with any other applicable requirements of the Act.
