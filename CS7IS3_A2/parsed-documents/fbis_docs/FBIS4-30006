The origin of that statement was Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ozawa who is considered to be the scenario writer of the series of political events. On the evening of 25 May amidst the controversy created by the withdrawal of the SDPJ, it was Ozawa who said, "What difference does it make as to which woman we sleep with?" in connection with the formation of the new faction called "Kaishin" [Innovation]. As usual, he issued a denial via his secretary, stating, "I do not recall making the statement," but the truth of the statement is considered reliable in that several of the mass media have quoted the same words. Several female legislators protested the statement as being disrespectful of women and repercussions extended to foreign nations as reports on the incident were circulated internationally. Some of the mass media did not cover the incident on the day the statement was made. It appears that they felt the statement was so unbecoming of a politician in a leadership position that they felt it would be inappropriate to mention it in a newspaper. However, an immutable rule is that statements made by people of importance are invariably quoted verbatim. Needless to say, the Ozawa statement's impact was not limited to one of being disrespectful to women. Not only was his manner of speech so vulgar as to cause alarm as being like the poisonous words of a hooligan in the ghettos, but more importantly of concern is the political atmosphere that is so conducive to such expressions and the current situation under which Japanese politics is controlled by politicians who make complacent use of such language. These are issues which are of more importance than policies or political techniques. Such utterances are tantamount to publicly confessing to the low quality and shabbiness of Japanese politics and they distance Japan from qualifying as a "dignified nation." If we were to refer to Mr. Ozawa's favorite term, "international contributions," there is no other conceivable deed that could do greater damage to Japan's honor or detract from international contributions. The reason I decry so much Mr. Ozawa's utterance is that an individual's statements and manner of expression, on an empirical basis, serve to exemplify an individual's ideas and routine behavior. As an example, former Prime Minister Nakasone liked to use military terms for statements and fables, and some prime ministers referred immediately to the price when paintings were mentioned. In terms of the status of politicians before considering any policy matters, there have been instances that we cannot help but question. It was just one month earlier that Mr. Kakizawa, as a representative of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, had demanded the resignation of the Hosokawa government, when suddenly he was appointed as the foreign minister of the Hata government. Then, on the other hand, one day suddenly, Chairman Ouchi of the Democratic Socialist Party--who had allied himself with the Social Democrataic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger]--criticized the leadership style of Shinseito's Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Ichikawa as being strong-armed, and betrayed Mr. Ozawa and became the ringleader in the SDPJ's withdrawal from the coalition government. Observing such events reminds one of the turbulent days of the feudal age, but many individual politicians, in reality, assess the current confusion arising from political change as a time of turbulence and try to navigate the rough waters in an effort to survive or further their careers. Needless to say, politicians seek power in surviving the political carnage, but they also seem to find appeal in the authority that they display ostentatiously. Announcements on the imperial awards issued in the spring were given only quiet coverage in the newspapers because they coincided with the installation of the Hata cabinet, but it was alarming that former Prime Minister Uno, who had resigned from his position after only three months because of a notorious womanizing incident, was being awarded a Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun Paulownia, First Class. It is not unusual for an individual with experience as a prime minister to receive a medal of the highest class, because awards are based on the rank of the public or private organizational position held and the length of service, but Prime Minister Uno's award looks awfully strange and even comical from a mundane perspective. Political scandals of the past were normally concerned with dirty money or womanizing. However, the recent series of scandals have broken with past rules and common sense and are symptomatic of major changes in the political world and indicate that a process of self-destruction is currently in progress. When one thinks of the truly irresponsible manner in which former Prime Minister Hosokawa resigned from office and Mr. Michio Watanabe's repeated contradictions of prior statements and threatened departure from the LDP, despite being a faction leader and former deputy prime minister, he can only conclude that there is a complete absence of or a radical change taking place among political leaders. The idea of a political reorganization is a good one, but there's no way that such a goal can be achieved in the absence of qualified key personnel.
