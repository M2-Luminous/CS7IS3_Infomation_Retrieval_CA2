Shanghai has set 12 percent for this year's GNP growth rate and the total industrial output value will have a growth rate of over 15 percent at least. In January this year, the industrial output value totalled RMB 19 billion, 13 percent up over the same period of last year. Experts in Shanghai consider the reason for the rise in industrial production there was that the impact of macro-control and relevant reform measures adopted by the central government had eased in Shanghai and the economy there had started to operate as expected. In addition, achievements in the utilization of funds, market development and reform of state-owned enterprises were also part of the reason. Production and marketing of Shanghai's industry increased at the same pace from January to April this year. The total industrial output value from January to April increased by 14.6 percent over the same period of last year and the total sales value was 15.1 percent up. The ratio of production to sales was 95.74 percent and in April this ratio reached 97.5 percent. Experts, however, warned that the tasks of curbing inflation and reducing enterprise losses remained arduous. Shanghai Mayor Mr. Huang Ju said recently that pushing forward sales was the principal task. Meanwhile, arrangements for funds, utilization of foreign capital, and municipal engineering projects should also be well handled while certain reform measures would be implemented at the proper time.
