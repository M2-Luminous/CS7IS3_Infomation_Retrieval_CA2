Leader of the Mongolian Democratic Union has remained T. Elbegdorj who has been relieved recently of the duties of a member of the parliament according to his own request. After April's political hunger strike being arranged with the purpose of having the government (?resign) according to a number of members of the union, the prestige of the organization has undermined and there is necessity for renewing the activities of the organization. For this aim there has been set up a group for renovation of the activities of the Mongolian Democratic Union. Apparently the initiative group and its supporters failed to have T. Elbegdorj and some other members of the board having been viewed to be the major instigators of the hunger strike entailing the undermining of the authority of the Mongolian Democratic Union, replaced during the work of the conference.
