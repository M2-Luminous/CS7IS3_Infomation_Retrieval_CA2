He hopes for comprise to be achieved. Ukraine's statehood and integrity is the drawing line which no one including Crimea is allowed to cross, Kravchuk said. He called for a status quo that existed before last Friday when the Crimean parliament passed a resolution to restore the republic's constitution of May 6, 1992 which provides for greater regional autonomy and dual citizenship to the Crimeans. IF Note: On the same day, the Ukrainian parliament vetoed down the decision by Crimean legislators who had in turn suspended Kiev's resolution a day after. For his own part, Kravchuk said Kiev's decision would automatically become null and void as soon as the Crimean parliament suspended its resolution of May 20. The Crimean delegation flying out to Kiev on Tuesday wants three main issues to be put on the agenda of talks there -- dual citizenship, economic and financial matters (a banking union between Crimea and Russia) and armed forces, one source close to the Crimean parliament told Interfax. He said that although Simferopol did not bank on a complete breakthrough in the talks, it was sending a delegation to Kiev to avoid further confrontation and build up bridges with Ukraine. In the meantime, Speaker of the Crimean Parliament Sergey Tsekov is convinced that the Supreme Soviet had to restore the 1992 constitution as the only and softest option for regulating Simferopol's relations with Ukraine. He admitted that the ruling Russia alliance's final goal was to gain independence from Ukraine and unify with Russia. Tsekov does not rule out the possibility of reunification with Russia together with Ukraine. Tsekov hopes that more sensible Ukrainian leaders will not allow a souring of relations with Crimea. Asked if the Crimean parliament had gone a bit too far in its demands for greater autonomy, Kravchuk said it would have to toe the line. IF Note: Chief presidential advisor for domestic policies Nikolay Mikhalchenko said Kravchuk may ask parliament for appropriate powers to ensure the country's sovereignty and integrity as guarantor of the constitution if Simferopol failed to rescind its decision. However, he declined to say whether this meant the imposition of presidential rule or declaration of a state of emergency in Crimea. Kravchuk said that Kiev's position outlined by Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko's appeal to other countries "has found full understanding throughout the world". This also includes Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev whom he quoted as saying recently that "Russia will never raise the question of Ukraine's integrity". Kravchuk said the country's integrity was laid down in a bilateral agreement between Kiev and Moscow as well as a joint statement signed by the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and U.S. Russian and Ukrainian Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yefim Zvyagilsky meet in Moscow on Monday to discuss the situation around Crimea and how to defuse tension between Kiev and Simferopol. The meeting follows last Friday's telephone conversation between Presidents Yeltsin and Kravchuk. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev says that the talks in Moscow must focus on respect for human rights (above all, the right to a peaceful life) as well as for self-determination but with understanding that "Crimea is a sovereign republic within Ukraine". IF Note: Yeltsin spoke of receiving assurances from the Ukrainian leader during last Friday's telephone conversation that Kiev would refrain from using force to try to resolve the dispute. But a senior member of Kravchuk's office in an interview with Interfax criticized Yeltsin's statement. He said that "Ukraine is an independent state and the methods it chooses to use for resolving internal conflicts depend exclusively on the will of its people and parliament. Undoubtedly, these will be in line with the Ukrainian constitution and laws. Ukraine will always go by international law". The official spoke of being surprised at Yeltsin's statement saying that "it is important that neither Russia nor Ukraine meddle in Crimean affairs". He said that one may well infer that Russia wanted the same status in relations with Crimea as Ukraine of which Crimea was part. Some reports say Prime Minister Zvyagilsky may meet the Russian leader if he and his Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin have made a breakthrough in Monday's talks in Moscow.
