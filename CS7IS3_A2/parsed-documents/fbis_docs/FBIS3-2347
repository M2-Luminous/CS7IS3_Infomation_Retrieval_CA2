The gain comes from a consistent policy of protecting farmland and an active approach to reclaiming wasteland. He said that since 1989 about 33,367 ha of farmland had been taken over for non-agriculture construction in the province, while 46,953 ha of wasteland had been reclaimed. Though its per capita possession of farmland is 0.16 ha, about one third higher than the national average, expanding cities and towns had been nibbling away cultivated area by some 20,000 ha -- almost a mid-sized county -- a year in the early 1980s. To arrest the decrease in its cultivated area, the provincial government issued a series of laws and policies, according to which, taking any land for construction purpose had to be approved by, and only by, the land administration. The provincial government also ruled that performance in land administration would be an important aspect of assessing the work of local governments. The more than 60 development areas of the province were subjected to a review, and those with scant investment were declassified, so that the land could be cultivated again. Over the years, the province also uncovered 1,494 cases in which construction projects had gone ahead without proper approval for use of land. Meanwhile, the province has been encouraging farmers to reclaim wild land. Newly-developed farmland is used by the reclaimer and is immune from agricultural tax for the first three years. In another development, 57 counties in the province have completed the setting up of "farmland protection areas," a program aimed to subject to protection those farmlands that are considered essential to its grain production, the official added.
