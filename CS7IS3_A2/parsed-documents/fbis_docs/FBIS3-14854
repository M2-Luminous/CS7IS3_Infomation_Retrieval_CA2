However, Ames was the last of the Mohicans -- a leftover who miraculously survived the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the former Soviet secret services. This is Oleg Kalugin's opinion, a former KGB man who no doubt is knowledgeable on the subject of spies, not only in his capacity as one of Moscow's former agents in the United States, but also because from 1973 to 1980 he was the head of the KGB's counterintelligence section. [Cucurnia] Do you really believe, General Kalugin, that someone here in Moscow, perhaps among Primakov's deputies, betrayed Ames? [Kalugin] It is difficult to name or point my finger at anyone in particular. However, I certainly cannot rule out the possibility that someone within our services passed on the information to the Americans, also because, clearly, only very few people, at the highest level within our services, have any knowledge of these matters. As soon as you consider this business you are immediately led to think that there might be a traitor among this very small group of people. [Cucurnia] You do not seem to be all that surprised by what has happened. [Kalugin] On the contrary, I was rather surprised by it because, frankly speaking, I believed that our network of agents in the West had been definitively routed. You must take into account that, between 1980 and 1991, the KGB experienced the most difficult period in its history, not only due to the fact that its officials were fleeing to the West, but also due to the many arrests among those of our agents who had gone over to work for the United States. [Cucurnia] Yet the Ames case shows that some important outposts survived. [Kalugin] As I was telling you, I was the first to be surprised. Let us not forget, however, that Ames was apparently recruited in 1985, when perestroyka was in its infancy, and the radical change in United States-Soviet relations was still to come. Clearly, Ames was one of the last remnants of an epoch that is now coming to a close. [Cucurnia] Do you think that Gorbachev first, and later Yeltsin, knew that they could rely on such a high-placed agent? [Kalugin] When I worked for the intelligence service, we used to make regular reports to Brezhnev on our agents in the West. We always indicated the duties they fulfilled and their rank, but we never mentioned any names. I believe this practice has not changed. It makes no sense to fill the president's head with names which, in themselves, mean nothing to him. [Cucurnia] However, over the last few years the United States and Russia have repeatedly exchanged friendly declarations. Do you think that it is proper to use the citizens of another country for intelligence purposes, or perhaps, as Clinton says, it would be best to limit recruitment to your own fellow nationals? [Kalugin] Let us leave hypocrisy to one side. The United States has never renounced espionage, much less so in Russia. I see no reason why Russia should. However, the fact remains that, unlike what used to happen in the past, nowadays intelligence operations do not pursue subversive objectives. Nobody today can assert that the CIA wants to weaken Yeltsin's position. Rather, the contrary may be true. Espionage, however, has always existed and always will, even between friendly countries.
