[Begin recording] [Papoulias] The measures we have adopted are adequate. It was a message, if you will, to [Macedonian President Kiro] Gligorov that Greece is not playing. As I have told our allies and partners, it is an issue of the Greek people. It is not an issue of a single government, but an issue of the Greek people. When there is an issue that affects the Greek people so much, the Greek Government cannot pull back. [Unidentified correspondent] Did the partners pressure the Greek Government in Athens? [Papoulias] Look, the partners are of course interested in our having good relations with Gligorov because they know very well that Greece is the only country that can support the state's security and viability. The partners should not think about this after the shock of the embargo. They should have thought about that when we told them that we are [words indistinct] of the Greek people. The Greek Government cannot pull back. [end recording]
