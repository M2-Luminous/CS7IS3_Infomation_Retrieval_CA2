In reply to an SEF letter inviting a suitable ARATS official to visit Taiwan for a "face-to-face consultation on SEF-ARATS affairs," ARATS on 20 December sent a letter to the SEF, expressing consent. However, in its second letter to ARATS dated 23 December, the SEF said it was unable to go proceed with the invitation and expressed the hope that a responsible SEF official might visit Beijing for consultations. In today's reply letter to SEF, ARATS said: The talks on the basis of the "ARATS-SEF Agreement on the System of Mutual Contact and Talks" held between responsible ARATS and SEF officials are conducive to further expanding ARATS-SEF cooperation, to implementing the results of the Wang-Gu meeting, and to promoting the development of cross-strait relations. Therefore, it is appropriate to hold the talks in either Taibei [Taipei] or Beijing. In view of the fact that it is inconvenient for SEF to proceed with its invitation, ARATS is willing to adhere to its original plan to welcome Mr. Jiao Renhe to Beijing after 15 January at a time to be agreed by both sides, to hold face-to-face consultations on a meeting between Chairman Wang Daohan and Mr. Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] and on ARATS-SEF affairs, and to exchange views on matters of mutual interest.
