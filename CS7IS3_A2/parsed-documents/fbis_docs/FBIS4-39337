This was said today in an interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent by Sui Tsin, minister-counsellor at the Chinese embassy in Moscow. He described reports in the Hong Kong press about the possibility of China joining the sanctions as untrustworthy. China has limited influence on the DPRK, the diplomat added, and it depends on the Koreans themselves whether North Korea finally accepts the IAEA's demands concerning its nuclear program. The Chinese diplomat spoke in favor of continuing negotiations and looking for compromises.
