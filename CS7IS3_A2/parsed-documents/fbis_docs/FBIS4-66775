We multiply the acreage of cultivated land. What is required of the peasants, as they are the crucial factor in the success of any agricultural plan? While Iraqi peasants have their decreed national role, what is the role of the General Federation of Peasant Cooperative Societies? Is it a merely guiding role, or does it have special executive aspects in its serious endeavor to implement agricultural plans in a manner suited to our present circumstances, in which we are contending with the criminal sanctions? These are the questions AL-'IRAQ posed to Mr. Sajir Zubayr Ja'atah, the federation's president. We had a dialogue, with responses that may shed light and provide indications that we hope may play a broad role in implementation. The president of the federation said, at the outset of our interview with him: "Throughout its long career, our federation has had an effective and influential role in the production process, in propelling the agricultural sector forward. At the present time, as a result of the difficult circumstances and the effect of the unjust sanctions on the scarcity of agricultural and productive necessities, everyone is forced to search for other means and alternatives in order for the production process to continue in the agricultural sector, without interruption. We are acting to increase agricultural production at rates surpassing those of past years. I can confirm that our country is capable of food self-sufficiency, using the same cultivated areas, if we use ideal scientific methods in cultivation. We can raise production standards on the basis of increased yield per acreage unit, in terms of plants, and per production unit, in terms of livestock. The 1994 plan focused on our federation's total action and activity by carrying out the tasks entrusted to us and departing from traditional formats of work and searching out innovative methods, with the instructions of President Commander Saddam Husayn, God preserve him, as the guide for our daily work. The federation's plan relied upon an emphasis on field work--productive work." The president of the federation added that the federation's working plan for 1994 is founded upon the following bases: "Reliance upon the sayings and instructions of President Commander Saddam Husayn, God preserve him, considering them the guide for our labor, and a permanent program for all our rural activities, as well as in our political and agricultural work as the Peasant Cooperative Societies take up their effective and influential role in mobilizing their energies in the political and productive fields, and as we make field visits to the governorates, hold symposiums with the peasants in their workplaces to explain the dimensions of the current phase and the economic conditions our combatant country is experiencing, the importance of the honorable role of the peasantry in confronting threats and all types of agression, and thwarting the criminal sanctions." The Organizational Aspect "From the organizational standpoint, the plan emphasizes the development of the local and branch federations and the peasant cooperative societies. Each local federation selects one peasant cooperative society for each region, and makes it into a model society that can be the core of cooperative and advanced action. We are working to mobilize the peasantry and get them involved in their societies, training qualified and active persons for the membership of the administrative boards, and concentrating on some societies noted for their growth." The Production Aspect Turning to the productive (economic) aspect, the president of the federation says that "our federation's working plan confirms our pricing policy, which was set by the leadership, and the unlimited support of the President Commander that the agricultural sector has enjoyed. That has been one of the most important direct means of increasing and developing production, and getting into the production process in a practical way. It takes into consideration the reality of production and the yields realized for various crops, with a study of decreasing yields and the search for methods available to boost productivity in the agricultural sector, confirming the importance of exploiting arable land in a studied and systematic way. Part of this is the method of farming and the use of types of seeds, fertilization, pest control, and the monitoring of yield during the harvest, marketing, and storage phases to increase agricultural production on one hand, and to put an end to losses and waste on the other. In addition, we work with all relevant agencies in the agricultural sector to develop our work, offer better services, and supply agricultural needs. Steps will be taken and actions taken toward a fair procedure for distributing water in the major and branch waterways in order to provide the water needed for all cultivated areas, especially in the summer season, rationalizing consumption through reduced direct outlays; economizing in the use of primary materials and resources needed in production; setting up a comprehensive plan for field monitoring and supervision of actual agricultural work; identifying its problems, finding suitable solutions for them, and working together with related agricultural companies in the agricultural sector." Boosting Yields "The General Federation of Peasant Cooperative Societies accords this field special importance, and is coordinating with research and scientific agencies in the agricultural sector, and the universities, to achieve an advanced agricultural state based on what is present and available, to boost yields and improve them. One of the chief causes of the drop in crop yields is the weakness and decline of types of seeds used: the seeds currently in use have been used for years without bringing in a new strain or type. This has led to the overuse and decline of the yield of these types. Thus we must reaffirm the need for the agricultural scientific research agencies to invent new types of the strains and varieties now in use in the cultivation of wheat, barley, rise, and other crops, that will achieve higher yields. This is also the case as relates to the invention of varieties with a high resistance to salinity. This is a dangerous pest that has spread in many regions of the country. We will also study the causes of the deterioration of grain yields in farming, seeds, the use of fertilizers, irrigation, and the effect of other factors on that, such as the rise in salinity, agricultural pests, and other things." The president of the federation concluded the interview by saying: "There are other matters relating to the plan, related to marketing and credit, and making the best use of animal resources. The General Federation's plan emphasizes these bases in its work and it is up to the relevant offices and local federations to undertake the monitoring of detailed plans and their details with the aim of having them implemented by the relevant office and local federations, in coordination with the relevant ministries and offices, each in accordance with its jurisdiction."
