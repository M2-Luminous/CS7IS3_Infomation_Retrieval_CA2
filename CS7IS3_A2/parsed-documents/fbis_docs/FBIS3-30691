The conference, organized by the Washington-based Centre for International and Strategic Studies, was attended by the German Minister of Defence Volker Ruehe, Member of the European Commission Sir Leon Brittan, representatives of Polish political and economic circles, including Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, Janusz Lewandowski, Janusz Onyszkiewicz, and many other Polish and West European politicians and businessmen. Pawlak said that trade concessions offered Poland by Western European nations were fine in theory but that in practice enormous administrative and bureaucratic obstacles remained. He declared a staunch defence of the Polish interests and reiterated the firm will of Poland to fully integrate with the European Union. The Prime Minister spoke in high terms of the Polish economic situation, mentioning this year's targets of 4.5 percent growth in the GDP and an inflation rate of ca. 25 per cent. But he said the days of easy profits from investments in Poland were over and that his government was now looking "to do business which is good for both sides."
