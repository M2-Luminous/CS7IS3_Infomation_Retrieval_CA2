He said this today at a mourning ceremony of farewell that took place outside the national parliament building. The Tajik leader stressed that, by this terrorist act, committed on the night of 10-11 March, certain extremist forces had reckoned on causing fear and confusion among the people of the republic, and on frustrating the peace efforts of the country's leadership to attain civil peace and national reconciliation. But they miscalculated, Emomali Rakhmanov declared. Meanwhile, ITAR-TASS reported, citing trustworthy sources, two persons have been arrested on suspicion of the murder of the deputy prime minister of Tajikistan.
