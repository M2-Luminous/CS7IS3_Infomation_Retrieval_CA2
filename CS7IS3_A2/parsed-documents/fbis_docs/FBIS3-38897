Garcia Vargas says he understands the need for firm action on the international community's behalf because of the very serious situation in Sarajevo. However, the minister admits that for various military and technical reasons a possible NATO air strike will not be enough to lift the siege of the city. [Begin Garcia Vargas recording] There is a request formulated by the international community asking for the siege to be lifted. The possibility exists that force may be used in a very selective and specific way. That is to say that lifting the siege without deploying ground forces would be very difficult. Why? Because the mortar sites cannot be attacked from the air, the planes cannot see them from the air. So, air strikes would be a warning and an expression of the international community's will to put pressure on the areas that right now have the most responsibility in the conflict, and specially on those who are carrying out these unacceptable massacres in the city of Sarajevo.
