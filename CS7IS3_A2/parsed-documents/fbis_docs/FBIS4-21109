Police and those working in the field of drug addiction have long been reluctant to announce the arrival of crack cocaine in France due to their fear of generating devastating publicity. Opting for the ostrich approach, they were convinced that Europe would not be invaded by the type of cocaine used by the homeless, accompanied by the ills resulting from immediate dependency that spread like wildfire in the United States starting in 1986. Exposing the futility of such an approach, the first French study of its type is now sounding the alarm, stating that "the production and use of crack cocaine in France is a major event on the illegal drug scene." [passage omitted] Police in France first began to mention crack in 1989, referring to "pebbles" or "Antillean crack" made, not from "paste" (cocaine base containing chemical additives), but from the purified product and theoretically less harmful than American crack. In June 1993, Paris Police Chief Philippe Massoni admitted it: "It is true; we are finding crack in the capital. Don't expect me to tell you where; I don't want it to spread." (FRANCE SOIR interview) In Marmottan Hospital's annual report published in February, Dr. Olievenstein observed "an obvious spread of the crack market." The French study published today confirms the gravity of the phenomenon. Completed on behalf of IREP [.sup]1[/] for the Medical and Psychology Association and directed by Dr. Ingold, the study immediately confirms that "pebbles" and crack are in fact one and the same substance. The ambiguity was used as a sales pitch by dealers, which "certainly made it easier for the product to enter France initially." From the French Antilles, trafficking in crack spread to the Parisian region, appearing first of all in the "squats" located in the 18th and 19th arrondissements around Line 9 of the Metro between the Republique and Nation stops. It then progressed to the area near the Ourcq Canal at Stalingrad and in 1992 and 1993 "spread considerably, with hundreds of users." By 1993, crack had already been found in 14 departments around the capital. While recognizing the difficulty of estimating the number of users, the study states that in Paris "it is reasonable to say that by 1993 they easily exceeded the thousand figure." Unlike the majority of the cocaine users, crack addicts are often from among the hard-core fringe elements of society. In Paris, "a large part of them--although fewer and fewer--are Antilleans and Africans. Men clearly comprise the majority and the women are generally involved in prostitution. It takes about a month for these individuals to go from the experimental stage to complete dependency with all its consequences: weight loss, pallor, exhaustion, confusion." In addition, more and more are former heroin addicts who have switched and they are sometimes very young. "Their main drug has changed, even if they continue to use heroin in order to tolerate `coming down' better." The IREP study notes "a formidable acceleration in the social dropout process" of crack users and points to their essentially nocturnal way of life. "The stimulating and anxiety-producing effects of crack are seemingly incompatible with daytime use. `It's too much speed.'" While warning of the risk of crack spreading to the suburbs and larger provincial cities, Ingold pessimistically concludes: "It is far too late for any kind of an "information" campaign. Users will have to see for themselves that crack is an infinitely more destructive drug than heroin or other substances." Footnote 1.
