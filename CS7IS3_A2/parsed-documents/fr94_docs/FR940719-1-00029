FR940719-1-00029 FR940719-1-00009 A number of comments on the proposed rule addressed Alaska's wetland regulatory approach and its relation to identifying and protecting high-value wetlands. A majority of comments indicated that the regulatory approach should not be integrated into a final rule, most citing that they did not want issuance of the final rule delayed until the State effort could be completed. Other comments provided a different perspective. One comment indicated that the State's approach is unworkable and that the hydrogeomorphic data required in the approach is lacking for most areas and will be expensive to obtain. Another comment stated that a final rule should directly address the protection of high-value wetlands as identified in the State effort and through designation by the USFWS, although no recommendation was made as to how this might be accomplished. EPA supports the State of Alaska in their effort to develop a Statewide wetlands management and conservation strategy, including development of methodologies to evaluate and document wetlands functions and values. However, EPA has concluded that the infeasibility of conducting a priori wetlands categorization for the entire State, coupled with the status of the State approach, means that the State's efforts could not be used to formulate an environmentally acceptable final rule. However, EPA anticipates that, when completed, the management and conservation strategy will serve as a key resource in measuring wetlands values for permit decisions in the State. Clinton Administration Wetlands Plan and Withdrawal of Proposed Rule On August 24, 1993, the Clinton Administration issued a plan for protecting America's wetlands that consists of a comprehensive package of regulatory improvements and non-regulatory policies. The package supports: the interim goal of no overall net loss of the Nation's remaining wetlands; an efficient, fair, flexible, and predictable regulatory program; non-regulatory programs such as advance planning, wetlands restoration, and public-private cooperative efforts; partnerships with State, Tribal, and local governments; and policies based upon the best scientific information available. Of more than forty actions and recommendations applicable nationally, many of which are of value in improving or clarifying wetlands efforts in Alaska, the Administration plan contains two provisions pertaining exclusively to the State. The Administration announced that the proposed rule would be withdrawn. However, recognizing the need to address Alaska-specific concerns in a fair, flexible, and efficient manner, the Administration plan committed EPA and the Corps to meet with Federal resource agencies, State and local governments, representatives of Native villages, industry groups including oil and fishing interests, and environmental groups to consider other environmentally appropriate means to assure regulatory flexibility and the feasibility of alternative permitting procedures in Alaska. On October 12, 1993, the Federal agencies in Alaska announced the Alaska Wetlands Initiative and invited a diverse and comprehensive group of stakeholders to participate in a series of independently facilitated meetings in Juneau, Bethel, Fairbanks, and Anchorage in late October and early November. The two-day meetings offered the opportunity for stakeholders to make uninterrupted presentations, as well as to discuss concerns in a roundtable format. In addition, the public was invited to attend these meetings, make an oral statement at the close of each, to submit written comments, and to participate in a Statewide teleconference linking 20 locations throughout Alaska. Furthermore, approximately 1,500 letters were mailed to Alaskans who over the last several years had applied for Section 404 permits, to survey their opinion of their experience with the regulatory program. The number and variety of opportunities for public comment were provided to ensure that the process would consider the individual opinions of Alaskans who wished to express themselves independent of a particular stakeholder. As a result of the meetings and public comments received, a series of 11 draft issue papers for public review was developed by EPA and the Corps, in conjunction with USFWS and NMFS. Each draft issue paper included a general background discussion of that issue, a summary of the stakeholder and public comments received, an analysis, and a set of proposed recommendations for discussion. This series of draft issue papers, which was distributed on December 17, 1993, served as the focus of discussion at a final set of stakeholder meetings that was convened in January 1994. At that time the Corps and EPA sought further, more focussed input from the stakeholders on how well the draft issue papers characterized their concerns and how well the proposed recommendations for discussion responded to those concerns. The public was again invited to these meetings, provided with an open microphone opportunity at the conclusion of each meeting, and encouraged to comment in writing on the draft issue papers.
