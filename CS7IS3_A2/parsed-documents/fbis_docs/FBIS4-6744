FBIS4-6744 "dreas078_d_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 South Korea Background of Resignation Noted Background of Resignation Noted SK2204114994 Seoul YONHAP in English 1129 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204114994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam wasted no time as it took him only about 20 minutes to appoint Deputy Premier Yi Yong-tok as Yi Hoe-chang's successor. Unsurprisingly, both the prime minister's office and the National Unification Board were apparently stunned by the swift change and expressed concern over its repercussions. -- Returning to his office with slightly-reddened face from a 40-minute talks with the president, Yi told Government Administration Minister Hwang Yong-ha his intention to resign and asked him to take necessary steps. He then called his chief secretary Yi Hung-chu and administrative coordinator Kim Si-hyong and praised them for their hard work. "I'm sorry to have worked you too hard," he told them. Officials at the prime minister's Secretariat found the announcement as a shock. "Today was like every other day," one official said, "I can't believe he would be leaving so suddenly." Premier-designate Yi Yong-tok said that when the president called him to inform the appointment around 4:40 p.m., he had no time to think twice because he first thought the president was trying to tell him to better help the prime minister. Yi, a devout Christian, at first found no words to say when he met reporters. "I am afraid I have no sufficient wisdom and knowledge. But, I think it is god's dictate," he said. "When President Kim told me to take the premier's post, I only understood what he really meant when the president started talking about National Assembly approval," he told reporters. -- Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang reportedly explained about the statement he made on the Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council to chief presidential secretary Pak Kwan-yong Thursday night. Yi had pointed out problems about the council from the legal point of view, a Chongwadae [presidential office] official said, adding Yi must have explained the same thing to the president when he met him earlier in the day. But President Kim must have not accepted Yi's explanation as diplomatic and security matters fall under the exclusive authority of the president and since the council was formed at the president's instruction after all, the official said. He said that the Chongwadae secretariat with the duty of assisting the president, have to consult government offices regarding various policies, but Premier Yi kept ministers from making reports directly to Chongwadae, thus posing substantial problems to the business of Chongwadae secretaries. Not a few ministers and other government officials had been reproached by premier Yi for going directly to Chongwadae in breach of his instructions, he said. A senior government official said President Kim thought of reshuffling the premier from Thursday when Yi demanded his advance approval of unification- and security-related policies.
