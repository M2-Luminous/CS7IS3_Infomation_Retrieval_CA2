In it, the new structure for the Cuban tourism sector was announced. When I say structure, I mean tourism's managerial system and its operational concepts. Osmany Cienfuegos, vice president of the Council of Ministers, who has for years directed this strategic endeavor, explained the gradual functioning of this sector from now on -- specifically, from 1 April on. I want to discuss the operational principles -- the ideas upon which these tourism enterprises are based: The highest quality hotels -- four- and five-star hotels -- are grouped in the Gran Caribe chain; three-star hotels belong to the Horizonte chain; and those for Cuban tourism to the Isla Azul chain. The interesting thing is that these chains are merely hotel chains. In other words, they are specialized in the operation of their hotels, and if they need rental cars, will contact Transtur; if supplies, Abatur; if advertising, Plublicitur; and so on. Thus, they can direct all their energies to manage the hotels without having to manage ancillary services, which on many occasions affect their profits and efficiency. Every region, perhaps every province, on the basis of its tourism facilities, excluding hotels, will create a recreation and tourism enterprise to exploit every resource in the region for the entertainment of visitors: for example, restaurants, parks, fishing or hunting preserves, museums, theaters, et cetera. Something I have yet to mention, although it is inferred, is that the new Cuban tourism structure will be guided by a new ministry. However, as Osmany Cienfuegos said: It will be a small ministry, perhaps 50 or 60 people, not responsible for the management of anything, but in charge of setting the pace to improve performance. Cienfuegos stated that if, for example, it is necessary to have ministry representation in a province, it will consist of only three people: the delegate, a secretary, a driver, and nothing else because nothing else is needed to guide or set the pace. This has to be this way because if we minimize personnel at the root level -- the hotels and tourism services -- we are not then going to create a super ministry full of people. Tourism, as Cuba's strategic front, remains thus in the forefront.
