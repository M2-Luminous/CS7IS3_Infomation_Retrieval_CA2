Gallucci began consultations on possible sanction against the DPRK with a South Korean special envoy and Japanese officials in Washington on Friday [3 June] and Saturday. "We've had useful and productive consultations so far with officials from Japan and the Republic of Korea," said Christine Shelly, State Department spokeswoman, at a regular news briefing. "All sides had agreed to consult closely as the U.N. Security Council considers its next steps on the North Korean nuclear issue," Shelly said. "We are also continuing our exchanges up in New York, via the Security Council mechanisms and discussions in that context," she added. "I think there's a very full range of exchanges on this right now," she claimed, but "at this point, no draft resolution has been circulated or distributed in the council." Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff will be traveling to Japan and South Korea this week for more discussions, Shelly said.
