We have to decide at that time whether we need to enact emergency laws." In this way, he explained his understanding that emergency laws will be needed depending on the contents of the Security Council's sanctions. Regarding a possible case of preventing, as part of the sanctions, people from sending money from Japan to North Korea, Takatoshi Koto, director of the Ministry of Finance's [MOF] International Finance Bureau, said: "We treated cases in the past in line with the contents of the [UN] resolutions by issuing MOF notifications on the basis of the Foreign Exchange Control Order." In this way, he suggested that the MOF will deal with the issue of remitting money to North Korea by issuing its notifications. They made these remarks in response to questions asked by Shozo Kusakawa (of Komeito) and Hidenao Nakagawa (of the Liberal Democratic Party).
