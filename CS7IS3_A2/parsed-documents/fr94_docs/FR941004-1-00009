FR941004-1-00009 FR941004-1-00001 Thermal Annealing Rule (10 CFR 50.66) The proposed thermal annealing rule would establish new requirements with respect to applications for thermal annealing. However, the Commission has determined that the proposed rule would not impose a ``backfit'' as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). The proposed thermal annealing rule would not require any licensee to perform thermal annealing. Under existing requirements, all licensees are required to evaluate whether they exceed the PTS screening limits in 10 CFR 50.61 and the Charpy upper shelf screening limits in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G. However, these rules provide an alternative means to meet these screening limits, viz. , performing thermal annealing. No licensee currently has pending before the NRC an application for thermal annealing, nor has any current licensee been granted permission to conduct thermal annealing. In addition, the proposed rule does not reflect any new or different Staff position which conflicts with a prior Staff position or Commission rule. Thus, the proposed rule would have a purely prospective effect on future applications for thermal annealing. The Commission has stated in other rulemakings establishing prospective requirements, e.g. , 10 CFR Part 52 and the License Renewal Rule, 10 CFR Part 54, that the Backfit Rule was not intended to protect the future applicant from current changes in Commission requirements when there are no prior NRC positions upon which the ``substantial increase in overall protection'' can be measured. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the proposed rule does not impose backfits and a backfit analysis need not be prepared for the proposed thermal annealing rule. 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix G The restructuring of Sections IV and V of this appendix, referencing of the thermal annealing rule, changing the reference from Appendix G of Section III of the ASME Code to Appendix G of Section XI of the ASME Code, and deleting the ``design to permit annealing'' requirement do not impose any backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1), because they are either prospective in nature or of a clarifying nature. The explicit prohibition on core criticality before the completion of pressure and leak tests can be construed as a backfit, although NRC staff intent was never to permit such a procedure (letter from J. M. Taylor, NRC, to N. S. Reynolds and D. F. Stenger, NUBARG, dated February 2, 1990). The Commission has concluded that any backfit requirements in this amendment are necessary to bring the facilities into compliance with licenses, or the rules and orders of the Commission, or into conformance with written commitments by the licensees. Therefore, a backfit analysis is not required pursuant to 10 CFR 50.109(a)(4)(i). This amendment underscores the prior intent of the Commission to prohibit the use of nuclear heat before the completion of leak and pressure tests that is implicit in 10 CFR 50.55a and Section XI of the ASME Code. The Commission's intent in this regard is demonstrated by the fact that only a very small minority of licensees actually used nuclear heat to conduct pressure and leak tests required by the ASME Code. 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix H The amendments to Appendix H of 10 CFR Part 50 are either prospective in nature or of a clarifying nature, and hence do not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). Criminal Penalties For purposes of Section 223 of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA), the Commission proposes to issue the proposed rule under one or more of Sections 161b, 161i or 161o of the AEA. Willful violations of the rule would be subject to criminal enforcement.
