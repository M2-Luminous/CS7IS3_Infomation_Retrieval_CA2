Brigadier Lagos Henriques Lidimo was appointed for the government's side, while the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] appointed Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo. The two generals named to the FADM Supreme Command still have to be confirmed by the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC]. The main task of government Brig. Lagos Henriques Lidimo and Renamo Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonhamo will be to guide and lead the troops of the future single and nonpartisan army until the new government, which will emerge from the general elections scheduled for October, is sworn in. Brig. Lagos Lidimo, 44, was born in Mueda, Cabo Delgado, and joined the Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique [FPLM] in June 1966, having attended a commander course on weapons at Vistrel Military Academy. From 1970 to 1974, he was deputy security and operations chief for Cabo Delgado Province. Between 1975 and 1994, he was head of the Senior Official Security Directorate; Protection Regiment commander; Military Counterintelligence, CIM, director; military commander for Zambezia Province; commander of the Maputo Military Garrison; and commander of the border security troops. In turn, Renamo Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonhamo, aged 30, was born in Dombe District, Manica Province. He told the press he joined the ranks of the armed movement in 1978 as a soldier and rose to lieutenant general in 1992 after commanding the Renamo forces in the southern region, with a base was located in Chibuto District, Gaza District. We received reports saying that, as well as presenting names for the FADM Supreme Command generals, the government and Renamo also presented lists containing the names of 62 officers who will attend a leadership training course on 7 February, with each side bringing in 31 men. Those officers will join the General Staff as well as some of the main commands, which will be part of the FADM structure. With regard to training the infantry forces, special forces, marines, and mine removal personnel, NOTICIAS has learned from General Tobia Dai, head of the government team to the CCFADM, that all courses are to begin in the first half of February.
