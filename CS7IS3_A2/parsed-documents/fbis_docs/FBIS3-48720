The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: By thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary strategy during the adjustment period for socialist economic construction, we must consolidate the self-reliant economic foundation of the country rock-firm, more smoothly ensure the people's lives in keeping with the socialist demand, and secure a new position of attack to conquer higher peaks of socialism. In his New Year's address the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song presented strategic tasks to implement the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and foreign trade-first policy, give top priority to the coal industry, the power industry, and railway transportation, the leading sectors of the people's economy, and continuously develop the metallurgical industry during the three year adjustment period. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is the most just policy on economic construction that was presented based on its scientific insights into the current state of the development of our country's people's economy, lawful requirements of socialist economic construction, and the changing situation at home and abroad. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is just because it will significantly increase the people's standard of living in the next few years and more highly display the superiority and vitality of socialism of our own style. Material lives are an important part of social lives and one of the important features that show the superiority of the socialist system. How one improves the people's material lives is closely related to agriculture, the light industry, and foreign trade. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is to further consolidate the strong basis of the heavy industry, rapidly develop the light industry and agriculture and develop foreign trade, and, thus, significantly improve the people's lives. Toward that end, we must exert great efforts to develop agriculture. Then, we can satisfactorily solve the problem of food, the most important thing in the people's lives, and rapidly develop the overall people's economy. Only when we give priority to the light industry and rapidly develop on a high level, can we smoothly distribute goods, ensure expanded reproduction at a high speed, and, thus, decisively increase the production of people's consumer goods. Only when we extensively develop foreign trade, can we satisfactorily solve problems in further strengthening the basis of the self-reliant economy and improving the people's lives. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is just also because it enables us to further consolidate the self-reliant basis of our economy to ensure that we can live on our own strength in the changed new environment. For us to defend the honor and dignity of socialism and live on our own strength in any environment is our party's unchanging, firm principle. An important thing in living on our own strength is to more reasonably restructure the country's economic structure to comply with the changed environment and actual demands. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy calls not only for giving top priority to production of agriculture, the light industry, and export goods, but also for continuously developing the coal and power industries and the metallurgical industry, more satisfactorily solving the railway transportation problem, and strengthening the independence and self-reliance of our economy, thus providing a firm guarantee for our people to live on their own strength in any condition. When our people eat rice and meat soup, wear silk clothes, and live in tile-roofed house by thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary economic strategy, the enemies' plot to isolate, blockade, and suffocate [chilsik] our country cannot succeed no matter how hard it may strengthen. Even bourgeois ideology and literature cannot infiltrate into our country. Also, the justness of our party's revolutionary economic strategy enables us to firmly build a new launching base to occupy the higher socialist hill. In general, a strategy presents a guideline for the prospect of development in the near future, as well as the development of the next stage. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is a practical and prospective blueprint to open a bright prospect for the future development of our economy, which has been greatly advanced during the Third Seven-Year Plan. Our party has set three years as a period for an adjustment. This is very appropriate and correct. During this period, our people are urged to concentrate their efforts on agriculture, light industry, and external trade. This becomes the wisest policy to prepare for a new attack [saeroun konggyok chunbirul kachugiwihan]. When we vigorously struggle to consummate the task of rural theses, effect an upturn in the people's consumer goods production, correct the structure and method of the external trade, and largely expand and develop it during the period for an adjustment, our people's economy will be more vigorously strengthened and developed. By so doing, we can firmly build the new launching base and boldly embark upon the road of the grand march to occupy the higher hill in the socialist construction. Truly, the presentation of the revolutionary economic strategy is a clear demonstration of the wisdom of the leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who have always an extraordinary wisdom and far-sighted scientific insight and who are victoriously leading the economic construction battle. All party members and working people must uphold and thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary economic strategy. As a result, they must glorify socialism of our own style more highly.
