This improvement can be achieved primarily through the completion of the division of "the small percentage of remaining common property," Kukan said. "It is in the interests of Slovakia to do its utmost so that Slovak-Czech relations also develop positively in the future, Kukan said. [no closing quotation marks as received] He said that the current priorities of the Slovak foreign policy remained unchanged. They were first of all orientation towards an integration into European structures, including security ones, and the improvement of relations with neighboring countries, especially with Hungary. Here there exists a certain tension, Kukan said. Slovakia is naturally interested in maintaining good relations with Russia, Ukraine and other East European countries. "These are important countries, they have their indisputable importance in the whole mosaic of international relations. I intend to attach considerable importance to relations with these countries given the traditions and economic weight of these countries," Kukan said. Asked by CTK whether he intended to try to ensure that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Slovakia, which was recently postponed, took place as soon as possible, Kukan said that "given its interest in promoting good relations with Russia, Slovak diplomacy will take necessary initiative for Kozyrev's visit to take place. "We should strive for Slovakia to be perceived by the world objectively, much more objectively than before," Kukan said, adding that the U.S. press, for example, writes about Slovakia largely negatively. Kukan confirmed the United Nations' interest in sending further Slovak troops to the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in the former Yugoslavia. He said this would contribute to improving Slovakia's image abroad, but said that in the opinion of the Slovak Defense Ministry the "current 606 Slovak soldiers in Bosnia was the maximum that Slovakia could currently provide. Kukan denied that the current change of government had harmed Slovakia's reputation abroad. Changing a cabinet which had lost its majority in parliament was a "normal phenomenon" in the advanced world, he said. International political circles in fact saw the approach of the Slovak parliament and President Michal Kovac to ending the power of Premier Vladimir Meciar's government as proof of the fact that democratic institutions and principles were working in Slovakia, Kukan said.
