It would make no sense. The United States is mistaken if it thinks that through pressure and coercion it can bring us to our knees. The above was said by DPRK President Kim Il-song in an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA at the Government Palace. In a lengthy two-hour interview, Kim talked about the tense situation currently experienced in the DPRK, its relations with China and other countries, foreign investments, and the perspectives for the reunification of the country. Kim also spoke fondly of the DPRK's relations with Cuba and President Fidel Castro. In Pyongyang, one can sense calm. The tall and modern buildings and the wide avenues welcome a sunny spring. Taking care of the flowers, the April Festival, and the celebrations to mark the 82d birthday of the "great leader," as the Koreans call Kim Il-song, mark the spirit of these days in Pyongyang. In the countryside, one does not sense a warlike atmosphere. The peasants work the land, grow rice, and the industries continue operating. An energetic and calm speaker, the president greets us in the august dignity of the Great Hall of the Government Palace. Kim Il-song answers our questions openly and very lucidly. "We have no intentions, nor are we capable of producing nuclear weapons. We do not need to produce them, and even if we did produce one or two, that would make no sense [eso no tendria ningun sentido]. Our government invariably makes efforts to ensure the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," Kim said. Kim explained that this problem began with the introduction of nuclear weapons in South Korea by the United States. The United States deployed a large number of these weapons to maintain the southern part of the country under its control, to confront our country, and to implement its aggressive strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. Kim Il-song believes the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula began with the United States' hostile policy toward his country, and, therefore, it must be resolved in bilateral negotiations. The president said there is no justification for Washington to maintain its nuclear weapons on the peninsula because the Cold War has ended worldwide, and because nonaggression agreements and the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Peninsula have been signed by North and South Korea. The veteran Korean leader led the anti-Japanese struggle in the 1930's, which culminated with the antifascist victory after the monumental battles of 1945. Years later, from 1950 to 1953, he confronted the invasion of Korean territory by the United States and its allies. Fierce battles were waged and the country was left virtually destroyed. The 38th parallel and Panmunjom were established in the name of humanity, and the North Americans portrayed themselves as defenders of noble ideals by way of their persistent anticommunist propaganda. Later, the reconstruction of the country began under the leadership of Kim Il-song. Cities were rebuilt, including Pyongyang which had been razed. Industry was constructed and agriculture was reestablished. Today Korea is a country of 23 million inhabitants which has eradicated poverty. That same man explains that "in order not to lose the control they now have over South Korea and to crush our republic, the North Americans are seeking another pretext and spreading groundless nuclear insinuations to intentionally worsen the situation." According to him, the South Korean authorities have joined this campaign and are acting hysterically to provoke a new war. The United States has distorted what was agreed with us, he said. It provoked the break in the talks and, by mobilizing international organizations to exert pressure on Korea, it worsened the situation to the extreme, he added. Kim Il-song firmly stated that pressure can never be the method to resolve problems. "The United States is mistaken if it thinks that through pressure and coercion it can bring our people to their knees, because they value independence as they value their own lives," he said. He added that if Washington becomes obstinate and persists in pressuring the DPKR, the nation will be forced to adopt self-defense measures to safeguard its dignity and sovereignty. In the interview with PRENSA LATINA, the paramount Korean leader reiterated that the unwavering position of Democratic Korea is to resolve the nuclear problem through dialogue. Whether it can be resolved through peaceful means depends entirely on the United States, which must cease its clumsy international pressure against our Republic and adopt a trustworthy position, he added. International organizations should not support the unjust demands of this world power, and they should endorse solutions the problem, Kim Il-song stressed.
