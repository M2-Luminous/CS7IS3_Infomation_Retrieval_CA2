In 1993, the handling capacity of Tianjin port topped 37 million tons, up 27 percent over the previous year, or eight million tons more than in 1992. More than 22 million tons of it, or some 60 percent, was for imports and exports, a rise of 15 percent from a year earlier, the highest increase rate among the country's large ports. Latest statistics show that foreign trade through Tianjin port were worth 12.5 billion U.S. dollars last year, and about 70 percent of the trade volume resulted from imports and exports via the port by other parts of the country. [sentence as received] The port now has business ties with all the provinces and regions of the country, as well as more than 160 countries and regions across the world. Situated on Bohai Bay, Tianjin is economically important to north China, whose imports and exports are conducted mainly through the port. But the port's annual volume of two-way trade remained at around seven million tons before the country's drive of reform and opening-up was launched 15 years ago, owing to the lack of berths and limited storage capacity. This year, Tianjin port became one of the first in China to exercise autonomy in collecting funds and expanding cooperation with overseas. The port's infrastructure has consequently much improved. The port has built the country's largest wharf for containers, with annual handling capacity reaching 700,000 standard containers. Tianjin port has also introduced advanced loading and unloading equipment to enable it to handle 3.5 million and 3.2 million tons of bulk grain and salt a year, respectively. Meanwhile, the installation of some modern packing equipment has helped Tianjin port become one of China's three largest centres for packing bulk fertilizers. Tianjin port is also home to the country's first 10,000-ton three-sided freight berth and the first oil berth exclusively for shipping oil from southern Xinjiang, a remote region in northwest China. Tianjin port now has more than 130 berths, 44 of which are 10,000-ton ones. Tianjin has now ten ports engaged in foreign trade. The expanded Tianjin airport has an apron of 155,000 square meters, capable of accommodating the parking of 17 large and medium-sized planes at the same time. The 3,200-meter-long and 50-meter-wide runway allows landing and taking-off of all sorts of planes below 300 tons. Designed to allow 90,000 landings and take-offs a year, the airport is among China's six largest. It saw a throughput of 380,000 passengers and 270,000 tons of cargo in 1993. Tianjin has also built China's first port for the shipment of liquefied sulphur and set up the country's first cross-border truck transportation corps. Sources said that the annual handling capacity of Tianjin has increased by 30 million tons in the past 15 years. During that period, the port city handled a total of 290 million tons of cargo, worth more than 100 billion U.S. dollars.
