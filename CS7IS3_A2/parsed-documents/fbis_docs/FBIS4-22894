To this end, the Brevibacterium sp. culture cultivated in 750 ml bulbs containing 25-30 ml of nutrient medium in a circular rocker spinning at a 220-240 RPM speed for 24-72 h was used. The experimental procedure is outlined. The quantity of lysine forming during fermentation was measured by thin layer chromatography. The carbohydrate composition of the fruit and vegetable media, the outcome of lysine biosynthesis in media with various carbohydrate concentrations, and a comparative characterization of the lysine development process in media from fresh and long-stored raw materials (apples, carrots, beats, cabbage, and various combinations thereof) are summarized. The study demonstrates that various types of such raw materials may indeed be used as the substrate for microbial synthesis of lysine from the Brevibacterium sp. culture and shows that bioconversion occurs at a varying degree of effectiveness. Complex media ensuring a high level of substrate conversion into lysine are selected. An analysis confirms that any plant raw material can be used successfully for producing lysine. The new method makes it possible to solve the problem of fruit and vegetable waste utilization, reduce environmental pollution, and supply a valuable animal feed supplement.
