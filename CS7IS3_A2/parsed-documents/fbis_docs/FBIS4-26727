The circular stated: This year has seen a growing number of crimes relating to cultural relics in various cities and counties across the province. The situation has even become very serious in a few areas where organized criminals dig up and steal valuables from a large number of ancient tombs in a planned way. The circular urged the province's public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs as well as cultural, cultural relics protection, industrial, commercial, and customs departments to strengthen cooperation with one another in the on-going struggle against crimes relating to cultural relics and further improve the province's cultural relics protection work. The public security organs should, the circular stated, immediately organize competent personnel to investigate and crack cases of stealing or smuggling cultural relics; severely punish criminals involved in such cases; tighten control over the cultural relics market; and ban the black market on which cultural relics are sold against the law. The circular emphatically noted: The party committees, people's governments, and departments and units concerned across the province should further understand the importance of cultural relics protection work and be fully aware of the harmfulness of crimes relating to cultural relics so as to place state cultural relics protection high on the agenda; earnestly organize people to severely and frequently crack down on crimes relating to cultural relics; resolutely put an end to and crack down on crimes relating to cultural relics; and strive to bring about a fundamental turn for the better in the province's cultural relics protection work.
