On the one hand "they attack us for having trusted" the former Civil Guard director general, but on the other "their only arguments are those given them by somebody who is fleeing justice." During his speech at the opening of the Spanish Socialist Youth (JSE) Federal Committee meeting, held in l'Hospitalet yesterday, the deputy prime minister acknowledged that the trust placed in Roldan was "a grave mistake," and reaffirmed the government's pledge to place the former Civil Guard chief "in the hands of justice." Narcis Serra, who again denied the truth of all the accusations leveled against him by Luis Roldan through statements made to the newspaper EL MUNDO, warned that "we will not flinch from criticizing the PP whenever it uses unethical methods, insults, or threatens." "We will not follow them on that path," he stressed, "because we will never perform actions that could damage the democratic institutions' credibility." Answering journalists' questions, Narcis Serra specified that "Mr. Roldan's false assertions were the central feature of Mr. Aznar's speech in last week's parliamentary debate, and also of the questions that the PP put to me in the Congress last Wednesday [18 May]." The deputy prime minister expressed regret that the PP, "instead of preparing a strategy of political debate on the matters worrying citizens, on how to combat corruption, should formulate a strategy of using this matter for partisan ends and attacking the government." "It is clear," Serra stressed, "that there are two stances: Some of us wish to resolve the problem of corruption for society's sake, while others are using this problem as a political weapon." The deputy prime minister tried to hearten the Socialist Youth with promises of a 12 June election victory over the People's Party. He also tried to convey a hopeful view of the current political and economic situation with the emphatic assertion that "we are emerging from the tunnel" of corruption and crisis. Serra asserted that, despite the grave existing difficulties, we are experiencing "an interesting time," when the "need to defend ethical principles in politics" is particularly relevant. "The present time," the Catalan Socialist leader said, "requires of us a political response that had perhaps gotten rusty because we did not need it too much." Serra asserted that the government and the Socialist Party are "correcting past mistakes, making up for lost time, and, above all, laying the foundations for greater openness and effectiveness in the struggle against corruption." The consequence of all this is that "we are going to win the battle against the corrupt, whoever may fall, even while knowing that this does not interest our political opponents because for them the struggle is not against corruption but against the Socialists." The deputy prime minister criticized the PP's aim of "making the European elections a link in its campaign to demand Felipe Gonzalez' departure," and took the liberty of delivering a warning to his political rivals: "There are two ways to attain power: to win a general election, or to submit and win a censure motion; but until this is done the European elections are just that -- European elections."
