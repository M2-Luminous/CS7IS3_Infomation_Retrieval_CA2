FR940930-2-00212 FR940930-2-00071 The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register . The Commission believes that accelerated approval of the extension of the pilot program furthers the protection of investors and the public interest because it allows the Exchange additional time to evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot program on an uninterrupted basis during the Commission's consideration of the Exchange's request for permanent approval of its rules for reviewing proposed specialist combinations and because the BSE's concentration policy may result in higher quality markets and improved standards of specialist performance. Further, the substance of the proposal has been noticed previously in the Federal Register for the full statutory period and the Commission did not receive any comments on it. 13 13 See supra note 3. It Is Therefore Ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) 14 that SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;94&hyph;10 is hereby approved on a pilot basis through August 13, 1995. 14 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 15 15 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1991). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
