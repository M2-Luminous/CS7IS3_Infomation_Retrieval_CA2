Under the law, the federal government offers a lump sum of up to 25,000 U.S. dollars as a buyout to each of those who resign or retire provided he or she has completed 12 months of continuous service. The U.S. President signed the legislation while vacationing in southern California. The new law is part of the effort of the White House to slim the federal government which employs more than two million people. The law will help reduce the federal government workforce by 12 percent, bringing the figure below the two-million mark for the first time since 1966 and to the lowest level since 1950. In a statement released by the White House, Clinton said that the law would help the government achieve goals of making government work better and cost less. In a related development, White House Budget Director Leon Panetta announced that the Clinton administration had eliminated 284 federal advisory committees, which are required by law, saving 17 million U.S. dollars a year. Clinton had ordered a year ago that the 801 advisory committees that are not required by law be trimmed by a third to 267.
