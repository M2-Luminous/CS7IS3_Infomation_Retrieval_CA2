The party's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region chairman, Mr. Tony Leon, narrowly escaped injury after he abandoned a lunch-hour meeting. The SABC's cameraman, Ezra Zweli, was slightly injured while trying to film the event. Gerhard Grobler has the story. [Begin recording] [Grobler] It started off peacefully, but it soon became apparent that the large crowd would not afford Mr. Leon the opportunity to speak. SASCO [South African Students' Congress] President Nale Mashapa stepped in. He appealed for calm. He was followed by the university's rector, Prof. Jaques Gerwel, and ANC NEC [National Executive Committee] member Kader Asmal. [Asmal] Wave your flags, ask your questions, hold up your banners, but we must allow every voice that is entitled in the elections to be heard, to be heard in this university. [Grobler] An uneasy calm descended over the meeting, before students continued to disrupt Mr. Leon's speech. The DP decided to call the meeting off. Mr. Leon and security men moved out of the building to a waiting car. They sped off. They were forced to reverse across an open stretch of grass with hundreds of students chasing them. Stones, cans, and other objects smashed into the car as they fled to safety. This is undoubtedly one of the worst instances of political intolerance that we've seen in the Western Cape up to now. There was a very real possibility that Mr. Leon could have been seriously injured. Will the DP return to the UWC campus for the umpteenth time to try and practice their democratic right? It seems unlikely. [end recording]
