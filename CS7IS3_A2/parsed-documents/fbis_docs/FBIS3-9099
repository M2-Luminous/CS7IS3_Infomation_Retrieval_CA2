The meetings with relatives and friends (?who waited for them anxiously) are difficult to describe. In the first group, this afternoon, 178 former inmates arrived [in the Muslim-held part of Mostar]. Twenty-two persons, in accordance with their own wishes, were sent to the right bank [as heard] of the city, which is under the control of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council], while 12 of those freed went to Jablanica. At any moment a second group of prisoners should arrive, so that the agreement on their release can be fully implemented. [passage omitted]
