FBIS TRENDS-O5APR94-RUSSIA Zhirinovskiy Gains Firm Control Over LDPR Zhirinovskiy Gains Firm Control Over LDPR Vladimir Zhirinovskiy demonstrated his firm grip over the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) at the party's 2 April congress, persuading the gathering to alter the party's rules to formally give him virtually unchallengeable powers. Reportedly at his behest, the congress voted to extend his powers as party chairman until 2004. Previously the party charter stipulated that the chairman's term lasted three years. The congress also granted him the power to personally appoint and dismiss members of the party's Supreme Council and to assume its powers in the newly approved three-year interim between congresses. Previously, the Supreme Council and the chairman "jointly" served as the LDPR's "supreme" governing body between congresses, held on an annual basis. Finally, the congress confirmed Zhirinovskiy as the LDPR candidate in future presidential elections (LDPR Press Release, December 1993; ITAR- TASS, Interfax, 2 April). The congress was extensively covered by the independent news agency Interfax and the state-run ITAR- TASS agency as well as the two main television news programs "Vesti" and "Novosti" (ITAR-TASS, Interfax, Russian TV, Ostankino TV, 2 April). Although Zhirinovskiy now has the power single-handedly to expel party members, the State Duma has so far thwarted his efforts to introduce an amendment into its draft rules that would allow him to expel party heretics from the LDPR's parliamentary faction and replace them with loyalists. Known as the "imperative mandate," this rule would allow parties to take away a rebellious deputy's credentials and substitute the next member on the party's election list (ITAR-TASS, 18 March). Zhirinovskiy has proposed the imperative mandate amendment for adoption at least twice in the Duma, prompted by high-level defections from the LDPR in mid- February. At that time deputies Viktor Kobelev, the party's administrator, and Aleksandr Pronin, a leading official in the LDPR's Moscow organization, announced their resignation from the party after denouncing Zhirinovskiy's extremist foreign policy statements (Trends of 16 February 1994, page 33). More recently, Vyacheslav Marychev--the party's number two candidate on its election list behind Kobelev and a highly visible deputy in the Duma--announced that he had been expelled from the LDPR because of his opposition to the imperative mandate (Interfax, 4 April).
