The artillery and infantry, and tank and infantry attacks and attempts to break through on the Grmuski part of the front have continued today, as have attacks on (Hasino Brdo) and the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, where the chetniks have again directed most of their forces. They have been using a new method of shelling the town. Probably because of the increasingly frequent overflights of NATO aircraft, they have rescheduled their shelling of Cazin and Bihac with howitzers, tanks, and mortars from the hills surrounding Bihac to mornings and nights. The defenders -- the heroes of the 5th Corps -- have been courageously resisting the attacks, defending with their bodies every inch of this blood-soaked land. Today they have repulsed several attempts at tank and infantry breakthroughs. Today there have again been provocations along the demarcation lines with the remnants of the paramilitary of the so-called Kladusa autonomy, and the 5th Corps Command has lodged a strong protest with the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], since the commander of the UN French Battalion promised to mediate and to take on responsibility for the observance of the latest cease-fire. All in all, the [words indistinct] is continuing with a new uncertainty.
