Aldomiro Vaz da Conceicao said this when commenting on the instructions the president of the Republic gave the government negotiating team to respond positively to proposals made by the mediators in the peace talks in Lusaka. The spokesman of the Presidency of the Republic said peace accords will allow UNITA elements to hold government posts, but that will not mean power sharing. [Begin Conceicao recording] We can only speak of power sharing when there is a coalition government where all political forces are on an equal footing and charged with the task of implementing a joint political and economic program, resulting from an agreement between the various forces. That is not the case here in Angola and as such that situation will not be observed. UNITA elements will hold government posts at the central and local levels, but they will have to implement the program of the government of the party that won legislative elections. [end recording]
