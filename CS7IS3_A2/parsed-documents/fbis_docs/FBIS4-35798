The situation is no longer restricted to bloodshed and the annihilation of lives; destruction has now extended to economic institutions and oil foundations. This involves dire risks that undermine the interests of the Yemeni people, both in the north and south, and further complicates the regional situation. It is strange that this regrettable escalation should occur in spite of the numerous assurances Egypt has received from the Yemeni leadership, which pledged not to touch the oil foundations or economic institutions. These institutions belong to the Yemeni people and are crucial to secure their livelihood and develop their present and future resources. Accordingly, no one has the right to tamper with them or use them as a bargaining chip or instrument to put pressure. Egypt regrets the continued and intensified bloodshed in spite of the Arab League appeals, the efforts it exerted, and the issuance of UN Security Council Resolution 924 which calls for an immediate cease-fire. Appealing to officials in sister Yemen to avert further deterioration and to sincerely comply with the resolutions of the Arab household and the international legitimacy, Egypt denounces any action that would lead to the continuation or escalation of warfare.
