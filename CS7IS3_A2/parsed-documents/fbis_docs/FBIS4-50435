Wei Liqun, a spokesman for the commission, said at a news conference that the gross domestic product (GDP) -- the value of goods and services produced nationwide -- shot up 12.7 percent during the first quarter of 1994, compared with the same quarter a year ago. "Agricultural production is rising steadily," he said. Localities have encouraged farmers to grow grain crops and cotton on acreages as planned by the government, have increased funding in support of the farming sector and have stepped up the construction of vegetable and non-staple food production centers in major cities, he said. "Meanwhile, industrial production has scored a sustained and fast growth," he said. The increased value of China's industrial production rose 16.4 percent in the first four months of 1994, compared with the same period last year. More importantly, industrial production of state-owned factories has begun to pick up, he said. For example, the production value of such factories rose five percent in April over the same month in 1993, up nearly three percentage points from the first quarter of this year. According to Wei, China's financial situation has been stable since the beginning of the year. For instance, all newly-printed money put into circulation between New Year's Day and the Spring Festival in mid-February had been withdrawn from circulation by March 28. Savings deposits in urban and rural areas soared by 130 billion yuan during the January-April period than the same period a year ago, Wei said. Furthermore, 50 percent of the quota for the issue of this year's treasury bonds had been met by May 10, he added. The excessive increase in fixed asset investments has been curtailed, he said, noting that such investments by state-owned companies and institutions climbed 38.4 percent in the first four months of 1994, 30.5 percentage points lower than in the same period a year ago. "Basically, the domestic market is stable," Wei said. For example, the country's retail sales grew 4.2 percent in real terms during the January-April period. At least 90 percent of commodities are either in a near balance between supply and demand or with a surplus of supplies. The spokesman said that China's exports soared 22 percent in the first four months of 1994 to 28.04 billion U.S. dollars, while its imports shot up 20.3 percent to 29.79 billion dollars. "The tendency towards an over-rapid increase in prices has been brought under initial control," he told the news conference. The increase in the retail price index in March fell to 0.9 percent from three percent in both January and February, he added. He forecast that in the first half of this year, the GDP is expected to rise by around 12 percent, industrial output value by about 18 percent, fixed asset investments by state-owned companies and institutions by 30 percent and retail sales by 22 percent. The spokesman also anticipated a further fall in the increase in prices during the second quarter of the year. He noted that some deep-rooted and structural problems in China's economy are yet to be solved and warned against relaxing efforts to control inflation.
