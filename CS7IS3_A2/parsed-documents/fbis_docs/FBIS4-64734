Boo: "U.S. President Forced To Insist on Resolute Foreign Policy"] [Text] New York -- Worried by continual drops in opinion polls, President Clinton started a campaign to convince U.S. citizens and the rest of the world that his foreign policy is resolute and transparent. The Americans are complaining about growing confusion with regard to Bosnia, Haiti, North Korea, China, and Rwanda.... Over the past weeks, there have been numerous -- though inefficient -- attempts to present the new Defense Secretary William Perry as an expert on the world's situation, while Christopher is still waiting for a brilliant move to gain prestige as secretary of state. Quite often the State Department and the Pentagon announce divergent positions. Support for Clinton's foreign policy has been continually dropping since January. Two weeks ago the alarm went off, when the negative score (41 percent) was higher than the positive one (40 percent). After months of contradictory statements on Bosnia and North Korea, public opinion has become infected with the same skepticism about Clinton's leadership in foreign policy that is already dominating many foreign capitals. During a special news conference by satellite with correspondents of different countries, the President tried to restore his image before his allies and enemies, but the meeting served more to vent personal frustration about the attacks than to reassure foreign capitals with regard to the firmness of the U.S. leader. Visibly irritated by a question from a CNN correspondent in Sarajevo, Clinton stated that "there are no continuous about-faces in my policy on Bosnia, and I have been much more active in this area than my predecessor." He admitted though that he "had underestimated the difficulty of creating a coalition and reaching agreements within NATO," but he found comfort in remembering that John F. Kennedy, his favorite predecessor, had also discovered that "international problems are more difficult than they seem." On the domestic level, Clinton's problem is that the Americans want results and, too often, fast results. Under these circumstances, the humiliations accumulated in Bosnia, the incapability to subdue the military in Haiti, and the absolute passivity with regard to the crisis in Rwanda are being translated into deep discomfort with regard to the tenant of the White House.
