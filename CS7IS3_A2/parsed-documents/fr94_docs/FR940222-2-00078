Applicants request an exemption on behalf of themselves, the portfolios of PFAMCo Funds, and any other open-end investment company, or portfolio thereof, that may be established in the future that is advised or administered by PFAMCo (or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with PFAMCo) or for which the Distributor (or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Distributor) serves as principal underwriter and that becomes part of the same ``group of investment companies,'' as that term is defined in rule 11a&hyph;3 (collectively, the ``Funds''). Pursuant to the requested exemption, each Fund would be able to offer multiple classes of shares that would be identical in all respects to shares of the other classes of shares of the Fund, except for class designation, the allocation of certain expenses, voting rights, and exchange privileges. 4. Applicants propose that each Fund would enter into an agreement (the ``Administration Agreement'') with its administrator, which may be PFAMCo or another person, for the provision or procurement of the administrative and other services necessary for the ordinary operation of the Fund. These services would include transfer agency, custodian, recordkeeping, dividend disbursing, auditing, and ordinary legal services. The administrator would provide or procure such services for a fee (the ``Administration Fee'') to be agreed upon by the administrator and the Fund. The Administration Agreement will provide that the services that are rendered to the Fund will be rendered to each class of the Fund, and each such class will be obligated to pay the applicable Administration Fee. 5. Any services required for the operation of a class in addition to those provided in the Administration Agreement would be provided for in a separate agreement or addendum (the ``Class Addendum''). Under the Class Addendum, the Fund's administrator would provide or procure the services contracted for in the Class Addendum for a specified fee (the ``Class Addendum Fee''). The services rendered under the Class Addendum will relate only to the class or classes specified in that Class Addendum, and only such class or classes shall be obligated to pay the Class Addendum Fee. Different classes may have different Class Addenda, each of which would reflect the different servicing needs of those classes that require service beyond that provided in the Administration Agreement. If a class is offered in connection with a 12b&hyph;1 plan, the expenses payable for distribution services would not be included in a Class Addendum, but would be payable under a separate 12b&hyph;1 agreement. A class could have a 12b&hyph;1 plan and a Class Addendum. 6. Each Fund could offer one class (the ``Institutional Class'') solely to pension and profit sharing plans, employee benefit trusts, endowments, foundations, corporations, other institutions, and high net worth individuals. The Institutional Class would be similar or identical to the shares currently offered by PFAMCo Funds. There would be no sales charge imposed on the purchase and redemption of shares of the Institutional Class, and no 12b&hyph;1 fees. There would be a significant minimum initial investment, which currently is $200,000 for PFAMCo Funds. Applicants anticipate that the Institutional Class will be the only class without a Class Addendum; all of the administrative services for the Institutional Class would be provided under the Administration Agreement.
