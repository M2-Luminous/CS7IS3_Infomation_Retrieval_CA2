Application kits may be obtained from and must be submitted to either HUD's New York Office or Buffalo Office. Applications, if mailed, must be postmarked no later than midnight on February 21, 1995. If an application is hand-delivered to the New York or the Buffalo Office, the application must be delivered to the appropriate office no later than 4:00 p.m. on the deadline date. Application kits will be made available by a date that affords applicants no fewer than 30 days to respond to this NOFA. The above-stated application deadline is firm as to date and hour. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is not received by 4:00 p.m. on, or postmarked by, February 21, 1995.
