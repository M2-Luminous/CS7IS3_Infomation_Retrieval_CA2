SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Chapter Nineteen of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism for replacing judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations involving imports from Canada, Mexico, or the United States with review by independent binational panels. If requested, these panels will expeditiously review final determinations to determine whether they are consistent with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the importing country. In instances in which one of the Parties to the Agreement alleges, pursuant to Article 1905.1 of the Agreement, that the application of another Party's domestic law (a) has prevented the establishment of a panel; (b) has prevented a panel from rendering a final decision; (c) has prevented the implementation of a panel's decision or denied it binding force and effect; or (d) has resulted in a failure to provide opportunity for proper review of a final determination by a panel or a court of competent jurisdiction, that Party may request the establishment of a special committee. Title IV of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993, Public Law No. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057, amends United States law to implement Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement. The Article 1905 Special Committee Rules are intended to give effect to the special committee provisions of Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement by setting forth the procedures for commencing, conducting, and completing special committee proceedings. These rules are the result of negotiations among Canada, Mexico, and the United States in compliance with the terms of the Agreement.
