"It would not add to the image, and in a while there will be a lot of ruckus and I will be blamed for all sins." Masol believes economic management over the past two years has led to a great many irreparable losses. He stressed that his only motive was "being unable to remain on the sidelines after the Kuchma government has made, alas, so many ill-considered moves." Masol said he had seen the report by Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz, who will present his proposals on overcoming Ukraine's economic crisis at the parliament session on 15 June. He denied having drawn up Moroz's "main guidelines" himself, but said that a lot of it had been borrowed by the speaker from Masol's own book.
