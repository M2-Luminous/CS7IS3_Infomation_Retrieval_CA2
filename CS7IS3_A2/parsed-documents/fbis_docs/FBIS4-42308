However, there are considerable differences regarding the necessary therapy. This became obvious at the annual meeting of the Federal Association of German Industry [BDI] in Bonn. BDI President Tyll Necker pointed out that his association had warned of the dangers for Germany as an economic center since 1987, and called for a major reduction of costs, deregulation, and for flexibility. Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl regards more part-time jobs as an essential opportunity to reduce unemployment. Apart from that, he called on the credit sector to think about possibilities to mobilize more equity capital and improve the financing situation in general. Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], admitted that industry, which continues to constitute the basis of prosperity, had sometimes been badly treated. The minister accused the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] of preventing in the Bundesrat the necessary reforms for improving the quality of Germany as an economic center. However, he appeared to be optimistic believing that Germany had already embarked on the path out of the crisis. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping threw cold water on Rexrodt's optimism when he said that the German economy was still far away from a real upswing. Scharping warned against an unrealistic assessment of economic developments only because of the upcoming election and against presenting the economy as being sounder than it really is. The federal chancellor said he was optimistic about economic developments. Kohl delivered his speech at the dinner at night, which is why he did not meet his challenger, who addressed the meeting in the morning. Rexrodt said that the Germans had understood that they have to make efforts themselves and that they could not always come up with demands. In that respect, people understand the necessity to consolidate the state finances. The minister resolutely rejected the creation of new subsidies. He gave assurance that the coalition would before long present the tax policy concept for the next legislative term as demanded by the business community. Moreover, the coalition was thinking of ways and means of introducing tax concessions for private risk capital that goes to the new laender. The coalition had picked up this proposal from Necker. In the medium term, tax on revenues must be cut. Moreover, the solidarity surcharge, due to be reintroduced in January 1995, must be phased out again as quickly as possible. The essential thing is not only to reduce high unemployment but to return to full employment. This will mean that the labor market has to be reorganized and made more flexible. All measures must be geared toward strengthening industry decisively, because economic developments are essentially dependent on industry and not on the service sector, as many people now claim. Rexrodt said that the strong growth rates in the east German production sector confirm his assessment that, deep inside, German industry is sound and vital. Yet, according to Scharping, the growth rates on the foreign markets are not sufficient when hardly anything or nothing at all is happening on the domestic markets, which are decisive for 75 percent of the economy. Enterprise incomes in east Germany are only the result of transfers. Investments are being "blown up" through special depreciation. The SPD chancellor candidate repeated the promise that if they were to win the election in October, the SPD would under no circumstances increase the burden of taxes and rates beyond the 1995 level. The more than 52 percent of state share in the national product would be reduced in the same way as net new borrowing, once the overall developments of the economy permitted. At the same time, Scharping promised the continuation of investment promotion for 1995. The minister president of Rhineland- Palatinate was worried that the share of research and development funds in the federal budget sank by almost one-third. This must change, because aviation and space technology, environmental and gene technology must be strengthened again in Germany. Therefore one must think how participations in risk capital can be effectively promoted through regulations in the sphere of income and corporation tax laws. At the same time, a reform of the trade tax was necessary, too. Having said that, Scharping once more outlined his ideas of a supplementary tax for high income earners. It is to be expected that private consumption would significantly decrease as a result of a burden caused by the contributions to the nursing care insurance and the solidarity surcharge. This would make moderate wage agreements more difficult. Since this was bad for the economy, the state should no longer attack the pockets of the employees and increase taxes only for the top 20 percent of income-earners. "Everybody has the moral duty to contribute to the well-being of the community as a whole," Scharping said. [passage omitted]
