FR940628-1-00082 FR940628-1-00014 Critical sliding velocity, in kilometers per hour, is determined from the equation: E:GRAPHICSEP28JN94.000 where, E:GRAPHICSEP28JN94.001 and I xx = roll mass moment of inertia of the vehicle, in kilogram-kilometers2 g = gravitational constant, in kilometers/hour2 M = mass of the vehicle, loaded, in kilograms h cg = center of gravity height of the vehicle, in kilometers TW = the average of the front and rear track width of the vehicle, in kilometers. Calculation of critical sliding velocity requires knowledge of the vehicle's mass, track width, center of gravity height, and roll moment of inertia. NHTSA agrees with commenters that the center of gravity height and roll moment of inertia are complicated measurements. To address comments on the repeatability of center of gravity height measurement, NHTSA reviewed two reports.
