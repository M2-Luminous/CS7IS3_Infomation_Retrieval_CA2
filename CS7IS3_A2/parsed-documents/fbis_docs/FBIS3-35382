The talks covered a wide range of bilateral relations and international and regional issues. The Chinese side was led by Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Mr. Qian Qichen and Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali headed the Pakistan delegation. The Kashmir dispute came under detailed discussion. Both sides expressed their concern over the gross human rights violations in Indian-held Kashmir and were of the opinion that tension in the region would further escalate if a peaceful solution to the problem is not found. Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali drew the attention of his Chinese counterpart to the persistent violations of human rights in the occupied valley. He said because of the recalcitrant attitude of India, the foreign secretaries talks could not make any progress. He said Pakistan would be willing to hold talks with India only if they were ready to improve the human rights situation in Kashmir. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali apprised Mr. Qian of the rationale behind the tabling of the resolution at the current session of the commission of human rights. He said the resolution only requested sending a fact-finding mission to the Indian-held Kashmir. The Chinese vice premier said Pakistan and China should closely coordinate on the Kashmir issue. On the question of trade imbalances, China and Pakistan agreed that efforts should be made to rectify the adverse trade balance against Pakistan. Experts of the two countries would consult each other in this regard. In-depth discussions were also held on issues concerning security in South Asia and nuclear nonproliferation. China appreciated Pakistan's principled position on the question of nuclear nonproliferation. The vice premier underlined the need for close coordination between China and Pakistan on issues relating to regional security. The Chinese vice premier and foreign minister called on the chairman, Senate, Mr. Wasim Sajjad, in Islamabad today. The chairman, Senate, briefed the Chinese vice premier about Pakistan's principled stand on Kashmir and the nuclear nonproliferation issue. He said it would be quite unreasonable to sign any nonproliferation treaty unilaterally when India has a huge nuclear arms buildup. He said Kashmir problem should be resolved through implementation of UN resolutions. Mr. Qian Qichen also called on the speaker, National Assembly, Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani, in Islamabad today. The speaker expressed satisfaction over the traditional and time-tested friendship between Pakistan and China. The Chinese vice premier extended an invitation to the speaker, National Assembly, to visit China at the head of a parliamentary delegation.
