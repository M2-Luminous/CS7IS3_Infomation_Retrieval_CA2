FR940203-2-00122 FR940203-2-00068 Changes: None. Subgrants to Local Partnerships Comment: One commenter recommended that ``currently applicable Federal laws'' that would allow States to fund local partnerships should be specified in the final notice. The commenter noted that without this specific information, States would be unable to award grant funds to local partnerships. Discussion: Authority for States to award subgrants to local partnerships is now contained in the 1994 Department of Education Appropriation Act. Accordingly, the notice clearly provides that States receiving School-to-Work Opportunities implementation grants must distribute to local partnerships 65 percent of the amounts received in the first year, 75 percent of the amount received in the second year, and 85 percent of the amount received in each year thereafter. Changes: The notice has been modified to reflect the subgrant award authority provided in the 1994 Department of Education Appropriation Act. Peer Review Comment: Two commenters made suggestions regarding peer reviewers for this competition. One commenter said that the notice should require peer reviewers to represent all the entities that could be members of partnerships at the State level for development and administration of School-to-Work Opportunities systems, including representatives from secondary education, postsecondary education, employment, job training, and economic development. The second commenter recommended that the Secretaries include either individuals with disabilities or members of their families on the review panels. Discussion: The Secretaries wish to assure the commenters that they plan to select peer reviewers carefully, based on experience, education, training, and expertise in areas relevant to School-to-Work Opportunities systems, and will seek to have as broad a representation as possible on the review panels. However, specific requirements or criteria for the selection of peer reviewers is outside the purpose and scope of this notice. Changes: None. Definitions_``All Students'' Comment: One commenter expressed confusion about the meaning of the term ``all students,'' as defined in the October 14, 1993 notice. The commenter recommended that, if the Secretaries intended the term to mean all students rather than a representative sub-sample of students, the definition should be clarified by using the phrase ``all students from the broad range of backgrounds'' in lieu of the phrase ``students from the broad range of backgrounds.'' Discussion: The Secretaries intend the definition of ``all students'' to be broadly inclusive of diverse groups within the Nation's student population, including youth who have dropped out of school. The definition in the notice should not be interpreted as meaning a representative sub-sample of students. Change: None. Comment: One commenter noted that the term ``all students'' does not appear to include out-of-school youth. The commenter stated that excluding dropouts from the definition will result in the exclusion of millions of young people from eligibility to participate in the School-to-Work Opportunities program, including, for example, over one-third of Hispanic youth of high school age. Discussion: The Secretaries agree with the commenter that the definition of the term ``All students'' should include youth who are high school dropouts. Similarly, the Secretaries anticipate that, in the final version of the School-to-Work Opportunities legislation, this term will be defined as including students who have dropped out of school. Changes: The definition of the term ``All students'' has been changed to include students who have dropped out of school. Comment: Two commenters expressed concern with the extent to which States would be required to provide for the participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds in their School-to-Work Opportunities programs. One commenter expressed the view that if ``all students'' are intended to be successful in the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative, the notice should require or acknowledge the need for considerably more effort and resources to be devoted to female students and to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Another commenter felt that the notice should include language emphasizing inclusive projects, that is, that the school-to-work needs of all students should be addressed, not simply the needs of mainstream children without special needs.
