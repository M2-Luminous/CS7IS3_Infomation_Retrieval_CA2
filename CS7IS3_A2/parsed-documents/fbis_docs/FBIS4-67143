In response to the concern expressed by several sectors regarding the alleged interference by foreign agents or organizations in domestic affairs, the president explained: "We are getting the DEA to work in a coordinated manner with the Bolivian institutions, abiding by the national laws." The chief of state said that at a personal and diplomatic level he clearly stated that the orders must come from Bolivia, as we are waging a great joint struggle against drug trafficking and for this need U.S. support. The president said: "We need U.S. assistance, but it should be granted within a framework of mutual respect and the effectiveness that stems from adequate coordination." In Sanchez de Lozada's opinion, the DEA has heard the criticisms from various sectors of the country, and he believes it has understood the rules of the game. He stated, however, that as a result of these criticisms he is not going to adopt a chauvinist attitude nor seek to easily gain popularity by criticizing the United States for what has happened. The DEA's work in Bolivia is being questioned by political and social sectors, among them the Church, which believe that the DEA is violating Bolivian sovereignty. U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia Charles Bower was the first U.S. Government authority to answer these expressions of concern, stating that there are no signs of interference in domestic affairs.
