Alhaji A.B. Ziblim, general secretary of the National Convention Party of Ghana, in a statement June 7 expressed deep apprehensions over the pressure campaign of the United States and some other countries, saying the "presidential statement" published by the UN Security Council recently cannot be construed otherwise than part of the sinister political plot to destroy socialist Korea. He contended that the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the UN Security Council should abide by the principles of justice and impartiality, instead of complying with the unreasonable demand of the United States. E. Balanandan, Politburo member of the C.C. [Central Committee], Communist Party of India (Marxist), in his statement June 5 referred to the U.S. act of inveigling even the UN Security Council and the IAEA in its campaign against the DPRK, ignoring the unique status of the DPRK after it temporarily suspended the effectuation of its declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty. He demanded that the United Nations renounce the double-standard policy and approach the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula on the principles of respect for sovereignty and impartiality. E.K. Ganguli, director of the Asia-Pacific regional office of the World Federation of Trade Unions, in an interview with the KCNA correspondent in India June 5, denounced the anti-DPRK campaign of the United States and its followers and strongly urged that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should be solved fairly through talks between the DPRK and the United States. D.P. Maheshwari, chairman of the Indian Federation for World Cooperation and Cultural Relations, in an interview with the KCNA correspondent in New Delhi June 6 condemned as dastardly the acts of the United States in refusing to come out to third-round talks with the DPRK, kicking up a clamorous row for pressure against the DPRK on the basis of a unilateral and biased report submitted by some members of the IAEA Secretariat without so much as a study of the Korean-style method of reactor core refueling at the experimental atomic power plant. A tough measure cannot be a solution to the issue, he said, adding that the U.S. imperialists should draw a proper lesson from the ignominious defeat it sustained in the Korean war and act with discretion.
