I. Introduction The Commission is adopting amendments to facilitate registration and reporting by foreign private issuers by allowing flexibility in the selection of the reporting currency used in filings with the Commission and by streamlining financial statement reconciliation requirements for foreign private issuers with operations in countries with hyperinflationary economies. Under the amended rules, a foreign private issuer can state amounts in its financial statements in any currency which it deems appropriate. In addition, a foreign private issuer that accounts in its primary financial statements for its operations in a hyperinflationary economy in accordance with International Accounting Standards No. 21 , ``The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates,'' as amended in 1993 (``IAS 21''), using the historical cost/constant currency method would not need to reconcile the differences that would result from application of the U.S. standard, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 , ``Foreign Currency Translation'' (``SFAS 52''). The amendments adopted today were proposed by the Commission on April 19, 1994. 5 5 See Securities Act Release No. 7054 (April 19, 1994) (59 FR 21644) (the ``Proposing Release'').
