Each region in southern Italy will have its science park and Campania will have two. Another two science parks will be established in the Lazio and Marche regions. In the coming months, work will begin on the construction of a total of 10 new parks that will join the two already in existence at Tecnopolis in Bari, and at Val Basento in Basilicata. The map of research centers in the central southern regions has been drawn up by the Ministry of Scientific Research, which has been assigned the task of enacting the interministerial agreement signed with the Ministry for Southern Italy and the Budget in 1990. Under the agreement 1.1 trillion lire will be spent on scientific parks in southern Italy. The commission of experts at the ministry has chosen 10 of the 31 proposed projects for science parks that were presented in July 1992 plus two proposals that concern the development of initiatives already in existence. A plan per region, not only for those that are late developers, which come under the first goal, but also for areas of industrial decline such as Lazio and Marche, which come under the second goal. "The decision to give each region its own structure may be a valid one," says Gianfranco Dioguardi, president of the science park Tecnopolis Novus Ortus in Puglia, "but I think it is necessary to have a sort of regulating plan. In short, when faced with the formation of so many parks, it is necessary to single out complementary areas of activity and create forms of coordination. It would be a serious error if, instead of making use of synergies, competition was to arise between the science poles." He added: "The job of coordinating scientific and research activities could be entrusted to one of the parks. We will have young structures and other more consolidated structures that could be the driving force." Meanwhile the ministry has invited the bodies whose proposed projects have been selected to partly revise their plans, to correct them on the basis of precise guidelines, and to return them in the form of outline projects by 31 December. The rules to be followed were clear: To direct efforts toward applied research or toward the transfer of technologies to small and medium-sized companies and to establish close links with local businesses. And the restrictions were just as categoric: There will be no funding for basic research or for the purchase of machinery since other laws already provide incentives for this, or for the construction of megastructures. "We want to avoid funding more concrete," explains Giuseppe D'Addona, general manager of the science and technology department at the ministry, "instead we need to create links between the research structures that are already in existence and intensify relationships with companies." The bodies whose proposals were selected have already delivered the outline projects, which have been revised and corrected as requested, to the ministry for its approval. In other words, the ministry will allocate the funding to carry out the plans. The ministry has undertaken to start the program during the first three months of this year. This means that after a long wait, the coming months will probably be decisive for the go-ahead to the parks. APSTI (Association of Italian Science and Technology Parks) Secretary General Bruno Bottiglieri has said: "It is the ministry's turn. We have waited a long time, now is the moment to make up for lost time. But to tell the truth, the commission of experts that was set up by minister Colombo is finally working well and fast." Meanwhile however, financial resources have become thinner. Of the 1.1 trillion lire that were initially planned for, only 600 billion lire remain, the amount that should have been appropriated by the Ministry of Scientific Research under the 1990 interministerial agreement, while funding for southern Italy has fallen through. In fact, the Ministry of Scientific Research has also had to work to identify the sources from which to draw the necessary resources: The first 300 billion will be salvaged from the fund for applied research under Articles 10 and 3 of Law 46/1982, articles that have not been exploited to date. The first norm provides for the realization of research contracts based on projects submitted by companies, public bodies, and the public administration that will be stipulated by the IMI (Italian Institute for Financing Real and Personal Property). The other norm, Article 3, entrusts the Ministry of Scientific Research with the preparation of programs for the transfer of know-how and technologies to small and medium-sized industries. In recent years there has been a growing interest in science parks all over Italy. Technology poles in all the other regions have been added to the science towns, Tecnopolis and the Lingotto, that have now become part of history. Today APSTI has 17 members (see table), many of which have been established during the last three years and some of which are not yet operational. "If the agreement between the three ministries has been a driving force for the South," added Bottiglieri, "in the North the knowledge of the fact that parks are an efficient instrument for creating innovation, and perhaps the only really valid one, has undoubtedly become more diffused over recent years." ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |All The Science Parks | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Park |Location |Year Established | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Area Science Park |Trieste |1982 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Tecnopolis |Bari |1984 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Lingotto Pole |Turin |1984 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Science Park RAI |Milan 2 |1992 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Milano-Bicocca Po-|Milan |1986 | | |le | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Emilia Romagna Pa-|Bologna |1990 | | |rk | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Genoa Park |West of Genoa |1989 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Umbria Food, Agri-|Todi (Perugia) |1989 | | |culture Park | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Sardinia Park |Cagliari, Alghero,|1991 | | | | Nuoro, Oristano | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Piacenza Pole |East Piacenza |1990 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Naples Metropolit-|Naples |1992 | | |an Area Park | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Parma Park, Innov-|Parma |1991 | | |ation Center | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Agripolis Park |Legnaro (Padua) |1984 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Pro.ge.Tec. |Naples |1992 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Multipolar Park, |Padua, Venice, Ve-|1992 | | |Venice Region |rona | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |SPI |Rome |1984 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Calabria Park |Cosenza, Crotone, |1993 | | | |Reggio Calabria, | | | | |Catanzaro, Vibo V-| | | | |alentia | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Source: APSTI) | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
