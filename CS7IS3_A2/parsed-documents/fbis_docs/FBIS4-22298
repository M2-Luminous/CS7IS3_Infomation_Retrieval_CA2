So in this article we shall talk about democratic parties and movements. No matter what they are--"dishevelled or clumsy" like all of Russia--they already mean quite a lot in real life. Let us take a look at how the future of the largest of them, the Democratic Russia (DR) movement, is taking shape. DR is the only all-Russia, mass, democratic political organization that was not created by a leader, but was organized from below by uniting many initiative groups in nearly every region of Russia. This is why its policy toward reform is stable, a policy that has survived two sets of deputies, several governments, and several policies of the President of Russia. During the 1989 and 1990 elections, the predecessors of Democratic Russia won the elections, and during the presidential elections and the April 1993 referendum the DR policy won out in Moscow and in the largest cities. DR is the only democratic organization capable of calling for a mass meeting. The most important work of DR, however, is practically unknown to the public. This work included the very difficult and thankless task of DR factions opposing the majority in former Soviets; conducting deputy activities in okrugs; formulating a law on privatization, struggling for privatization with the directing staff of the Supreme Soviet, and achieving a compromise on privatization; struggling with officials for civilized privatization, instead of the one which is often harsh and leads to court cases; and fighting much more effectively than many other parties that are keen on privatization. Naturally this is why political opponents have directed their fire on Democratic Russia. Some "buried" us, not noticing the true state of affairs, effusively described splits (Wouldn't we be great if we had not parted with Travkin, Aksyuchits, and Astafyev!). Others called us the ruling party and held us responsible for all past misfortunes. They placed us in the same ranks with extremists. They blamed us for reckless support of the government. Does DR still exist and whom does it represent? Is Democratic Russia's participation in the Vybor Rossii (VR) [Russia's Choice] bloc an error or a necessity? How should DR approach the very necessary union of democratic forces? What should DR's position be with regard to the Russia's Choice bloc and to the party organized by its leadership? In May 1993, A. Murashev, A. Golovkov, and member of the Coordinating Council (CC) of Democratic Russia P. Fillipov conducted a campaign out in the regions against the cochairmen and the CC of Democratic Russia. They spread rumors about DR's degradation, but embraced its organizational structure with all their hearts. Everything would have been normal if they had been guided by the charter on reelections within DR. However, they won over people and entire organizations to their side, tempting them with promises of assistance from the directors of administration and the President's representatives. June. The inevitability of early elections was obvious and the unity of democrats was essential. Upon the initiative of DR's cochairmen, the formation of "Russia's Choice" bloc was proclaimed. Those who had been talking against Democratic Russia turned up as well, not in leading positions, but nonetheless in key positions. However, there was still hope that common sense would prevail, as would the authority of the bloc leaders: Ye. Gaydar and S. Kovalev. Does this mean that Democratic Russia should have gone out on its own, by itself? No! Accusations of fomenting a split would have poured in. October had already come. Less than two months remained before the elections. Democratic Russia organizations in Moscow and Petersburg stood their ground. In many other regions they fell apart, and organizations of Russia's Choice movement--with large losses of members--were formed out of what was left. In some regions, Russia's Choice and Democratic Russia movements organized Democratic Russia blocs; in others (Chelyabinsk and Novosibirsk), they were fighting each other. The organizers of the founding congress of Russia's Choice bloc, using apparatchiks' methods, secured a majority for themselves and demonstratively tried to squeeze Democratic Russia out of the bloc. They were still in a state of euphoria from their October "victory" and from the pre-election polls. A mixture of snobbery and unprofessionalism is deadly for politicians and prevented them from understanding that Democratic Russia's scandalous departure would lead to the defeat of not only DR, but the rest of the bloc as well. DR, however, understood this, absorbed the degradation, and did not leave the bloc. Representatives of Democratic Russia made a two-hour stand at the front entrance of the congress hall and "participated" in the work of the congress using guest passes.... As was to be expected, the federal list of the bloc did not leave any spaces for DR leaders. Many people in DR still remember that congress as the most degrading experience in their lives. November. Candidates were being selected in the majority okrugs. Of course, the executive committee of the bloc was obliged to take into consideration the interests of all bloc participants. But, for the sake of satisfying them, can regional organizations be saddled with deliberately unacceptable candidates and provoke these organizations into a fight with the bloc? It is true that there is one objective justification to the arbitrariness of the bloc's leadership--the most terrible time factor. December. The majority of Democratic Russia's territorial organizations, knowing the true situation within the bloc, were still pressing for DR candidates, because the alternative would have been defeat for the democrats. Also, many candidates were still our own people, and many who had been "let go from up above" were not bad at all. As always, fresh forces joined DR organizations during the critical moments and saved its ability to function. People who were hit the hardest by reforms, who bore the brunt of the disintegration of science and industry, and who did not receive any pay for months at a time were the ones who agitated for reforms, passed out leaflets, and volunteered as observers at polling places. Small businessmen, crushed by racketeers and taxes, and who long ago parted with their illusions of a "democratic" administration, contributed funds in support of Russia's Choice. Now these are the real intelligentsia, the gold reserve of democracy! As long as people like this exist, Democratic Russia will exist and will have the honor to represent them! On the eve of the elections, however, A. Murashev, wasted his journalistic fire not against Zhirinovskiy or Zyuganov, but against the people who were his allies in the bloc: "Actually, DR has already completely degenerated. It consists of marginal groups without any local support whatsoever.... The people who have remained there are not wanted by anyone else; they are inadequate and useless. Incidentally, many of them had been in important organizations, but were removed either for malfeasance, poor work, or unprofessionalism" (NOVOYE VREMYA No. 46, November 1993). There is no doubt that personnel in Democratic Russia are very varied not only in the different regions, but also in the different districts of Moscow. There are "marginal" people. But are we going to give them to Zhirinovskiy? No one has the right to offend people, especially the "removed" chief of Moscow's Main Directorate of Internal Affairs and failed candidate for cochairmanship of DR. The executive committee and the leaders of Russia's Choice bloc, however, have not found the time to tell him "fie on you," not even very softly. Yavlinskiy, Shakhray, as well as Popov, are like the generals in the film about Fanfan the Tulip who turned their backs to the enemy. So is it any wonder that in leaving DR, the participants of the movement did not go to Murashev? Or that leaving Gaydar, the voters did not go to Yavlinskiy, Shakhray, or Popov? The humbled and the insulted: Some with their professional unwantedness and poverty that contradict all common sense, and others with their cynicism and demogoguery of democrats. Some wandered over to Zhirinovskiy, others sent everyone to .... In the post-election hysterics, everyone is silent about the fact that in Moscow and Petersburg and other large cities the democrats won again. In Moscow, the Russia's Choice slate won 34 percent of the votes and all the democratic slates won 54 percent, while the red-brown candidates won 24. In elections to the State Duma, Russia's Choice won in 11 majority okrugs out of 15 in the capital; to the municipal Duma--19 out of 35; and in those okrugs where Russia's Choice lost, democrats still won nearly everywhere. Moscow voters have nothing to be sorry about. But now that the elections are over, shouldn't Democratic Russia leave the bloc? No! Factions in the State and Moscow Dumas cannot be destroyed. The romantic times are over when we divided people into bad bolsheviks and good democrats. Russia's Choice movement is our ally not because of the personal attributes of the leaders, but because of the political niche Russia's Choice occupies. As long as Ye. Gaydar determined the government's policy, his actions responded to the strategic interests of the country. In the present situation, government actions respond mainly to the interests of large monopoly capital emanating from officialdom and "directors'" circles. These are also the interests of Russia's Choice movement, perhaps with great support from officialdom. If Russia's Choice bloc had won the elections and formed the government, Democratic Russia would probably have distanced itself from Russia's Choice, in order to defend anti-monopoly measures and the interests of the intelligentsia and small and medium-sized business. The difference between social support of Russia's Choice and Democratic Russia has washed away and is not always realized; it feeds the disagreements between them. But now the government is inclined to lean on the huge capital that comes from the CPSU, monopolies, and "red landowners." Both Russia's Choice and Democratic Russia showed up in their roles of opposition, and they are trying not to give the government totally away to left radicals. One important result of the past electoral campaign: The rank-and-file members of Democratic Russia showed a conscious need for better organization. The word "party" still causes some to have an allergic reaction, but the essence, after all, does not lie in the word itself. The uncertainty existing within DR with regard to membership is already recognized as an anachronism. It has become clear that it is weakening the movement, and at the same time does not lead to democracy within the movement (as it seemed to do earlier), but on the contrary, gives free play to apparatchik games. Let us say that a chairman is elected by an organization with an undetermined number of members by random (or selected) members during a meeting. If the organization has a fixed membership, a real majority elects him. Membership dues are also considered necessary. The time for Democratic Russia's reorganization has come. On February 19th the plenum of Democratic Russia's Council of Representatives approved these recommendations for the regional organizations. It is possible that this action, and not the arguments about forming a party, was the main result of this plenum. The attitude of Democratic Russia's plenum toward the proposal of Russia's Choice parliamentary faction to create a united party was not monosemantic. No one denied the necessity, in principle, of forming a party. But how does one do it? The way is direct and obvious: Dissolve Democratic Russia and Russia's Choice, and charter a party. The authority of Russia's Choice leadership, however, was undermined by a feeble pre-election campaign, and the crushing of Democratic Russia in the regions, and insulting it at the congress. Apprehensions are strong that local officials--on whom Russia's Choice now depends and with whom there is now a tough struggle prior to elections to local organs of power--will crush Democratic Russia and furthermore, will compromise the organization to the voters. Should a party be formed without Democratic Russia or Russia's Choice? Such a party would draw the activists out of Democratic Russia, totally tie it up with a neo-nomenklatura and quickly degenerate. Democratic Russia, then, devoid of activist members, would also quickly disintegrate. If, however, the activists would simultaneously remain in Democratic Russia, its fate would be the same as that of a trade union led by the CPSU. Either of these choices, and even raising questions about them, are fraught with the danger of splits and losses of members. It is simply unprofessional to try to create a mass organization from above. Futile are the hopes for a new personal party that would be free of the usual shortcomings. Therefore, my esteemed gentlemen, if you think of yourselves as candidates for political leadership positions, work in your existing organizations, reorganize, attract new people into it, and play on your team and win. At the same time, in my opinion, no leader has yet grown up in the Russian political elite who would be capable of heading a mass democratic organization in a professional manner. The last several months have shown this especially clearly. The present leading politicians have become too accustomed to being locked into a tight circle. Democratic Russia scares them with real and imagined shortcomings and a somewhat scandalous image. If, however, they are ready to join Democratic Russia, they try to gain leadership positions without having done anything either in Democratic Russia or for Democratic Russia. They are characterized by their inability to obtain support of mass organizations (not only at critical times, but every day, constantly), make use of the extensive information these organizations have, respect their opinions, and show concern for their material and intellectual resources, and their authority. In my view, if a party is to be formed, it should be formed within Democratic Russia but, of course, not repulse those who do not want to join. This would not require large organizational efforts and would not disrupt Democratic Russia's present political work in the regions. Unfortunately, a large part of Democratic Russia's leadership does not want this. The possible reason is that now, after a lack of success during the elections and in relations with Russia's Choice, the majority of the members of the Coordinating Council and the cochairmen would probably be replaced, regardless of whether they were personally at fault. These are smart and active people who cannot go into the shadows and who are already tied into forming a parallel party. In other words, they are behaving in the same way as the founders of Russia's Choice movement behaved only recently. Democratic Russia also has many other vitally important problems. It is time, finally, to acquire buildings, finances, and a newspaper. We need working groups and seminars to develop programs, tactics, solutions to regional problems, reforms, etc. At one time we relied on an interregional group, then on councils, and then on the President and the government. It is now clear that without a material and intellectual economic base, Democratic Russia will remain an errand boy for whoever will condescend to go down to the poverty-stricken movement. Money is needed for all this, not only three days before elections, but constantly. Money can be given only by businessmen who are interested in stability, a normal social climate, an open market for real estate, and control over racketeering by officials. Businessmen's specialty is to make money, not politics. Politicians whom they trust should decide which organization should get the money. Resolving these problems will also have an influence on whether Democratic Russia will be able to form blocs with others without self-destructing (and it is necessary to form blocs) and whether it can, in an extreme case, go into the next All-Russia elections independently. To enter into blocs and alliances either as a strong unified force or as a scattered force and lose half your people are the only alternatives, not only for Democratic Russia, but for the entire democratic movement. The time of revolutionary romanticism has ended. We no longer idealize each other, the deputies, the government, the President, or Russia. At the same time it has become clear that the opportunities for state power in a democratic society are limited. No one can or should have "all the power." This is bad. After all, one really wants to win elections and improve society with one swoop! This is good and necessary because it excludes cataclysms and abuse of power even by legitimate authorities. What government cannot and should not do can be done by society itself within the possibilities granted it by organizations from below. In our country, however, democratic limitations of power have been imposed by degrading authoritative and power organizations, due to corruption, unprofessional conduct, and poverty. All hopes rest on bringing reforms down to the ordinary citizen, and on his interest and active work, for attaining a structured society. All this, notwithstanding our tiredness and poverty.
