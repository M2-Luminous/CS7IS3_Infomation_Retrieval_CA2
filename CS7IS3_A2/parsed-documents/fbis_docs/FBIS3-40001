It has no legal identity, no agreed budget, and no executive powers. But, according to Jurgen Storbeck, German caretaker co-ordinator of Europol, the European Drugs Intelligence Unit, it's going to work. The official launch this month of Europol, in a leafy Hague suburb with a residence for Jesuit priests on one side and a high-school playground on the other, was more an act of faith than a warning to international drugs traders. But Storbeck believes it can still justify its existence as a symbol of Europe's yearning for a common security policy. "A lot will depend on the leeway we are given by justice and other European Union ministers, who will ultimately decide where Europol is going at their convention later this year," maintains Storbeck. His biggest fear, he told The European, is of "over-restrictive rules and regulations" which would "take the teeth out of the mouth of the tiger before he was even grown from a cub." Storbeck's vision is of a strongly federalist Europol drugs unit with a wide brief so that "international task forces under the authority of member states, but supported by Europol, could be formed to fight drug trafficking, money laundering and other investigations into organised crime. "I believe that in time the politicians will agree to a much more federal role for Europol. It might have been unthinkable ten years ago, but drugs and other forms of crime are creating such major problems now that this will in time be seen as essential," says Storbeck, an Interpol veteran. Storbeck recognises that Europol is facing weighty bureaucratic and technical obstacles, not least of which is its "cart before the horse" status. It does not have a legal identity yet and depends on a maze of national and bilateral agreements and goodwill rather than the compulsory sharing of intelligence between its partners. It cannot prove itself until a draft treaty setting out its powers and duties is drawn up, agreed and ratified by the 12 states in October. Its non-executive nature means that Europol cannot establish a formal relationship with Interpol and other key crime-fighting organisations or look to a future crime-busting role beyond its current limited horizons. The only employees so far are the skeleton staff of 19 liaison officers seconded from the 12 member states spread out around the huge building which once housed the Dutch Intelligence service. Contacts with their own national police force are maintained by telephone and fax, although some countries expect computer access to their national criminal files shortly. Recruitment of Europol's administrative staff and the provision of the required 24-hour ring of steel depends on the member states eventually agreeing on a budget. Getting the unit running will cost in the region of 35 million guilders ($18m), according to Europol chiefs. The available budget of 4 million guilders this year falls far short of that. Storbeck claims that Europol is already proving that it can offer a "much faster service" than Interpol. Even without executive powers, the liaison officers (by the year's end 50 will be based in The Hague) are demonstrating the commitment of member states to co-operate fully with each other's requests for help in co-ordinating information and eventually developing an intelligence network, he reports. Storbeck says: "I would like it to be obligatory for member states to assist each other in gathering information and swapping intelligence within the new structure. But that is for the politicians to decide."
