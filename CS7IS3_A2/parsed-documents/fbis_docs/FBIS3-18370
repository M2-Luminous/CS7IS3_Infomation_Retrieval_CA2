Frau Olbrich worked for the FDP [Free Democratic Party] in various posts, and spied on the party for the former GDR for 16 years until 1985, under the codename Sonja Lueneburg. She worked, among other things, for Martin Bangemann, the former German economics minister and present EC Commissioner. Before the verdict was pronounced, Frau Olbrich said she expected to get a prison sentence. "Those who get involved in work of this nature have to take the consequences," she told journalists with obvious calm.
