Referring to the treacheries committed by Kim Yong-sam against the fellow countrymen, hand in glove with foreign forces, the message said the present regime had tried hard to strengthen an "international cooperation system" designed to stifle the North, where fellow countrymen live, and made the Korean peninsula a theatre of scramble of nuclear powers by taking the unfounded "nuclear issue" of the North even to the United Nations, regarding the "system of cooperation with the U.S. and Japan" as the main axis. Criticizing the traitor Kim Yong-sam's perfidious acts of reversing the North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation and racing headlong along the road of nuclear armament, the message said the present "civilian" regime is not only extracting a large amount of nuclear materials from the Wolsong heavy water reactor and Taedok multi-purpose research reactor, plutonium-yielding reactors built by the preceding military regimes, but also promoting even the development of a fast breeder reactor, openly crying for "nuclear sovereignty" to justify its development of nuclear weapons. Kim Yong-sam's criminal acts to stifle the fellow countrymen and throw the people into a "nuclear hell" cannot be tolerated any longer, the message said, and added: In case one of the nine atomic reactors operating in South Korea and nuclear waste accumulated there should explode in actuality, they would emit radioactivity that may cause a hideous pollution more than 10,000 times as great as the total pollution at the time of A-bomb dropping on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
