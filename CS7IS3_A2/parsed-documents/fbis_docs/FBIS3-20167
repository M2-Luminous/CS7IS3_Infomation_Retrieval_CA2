The Greeks have broken the EU's economic legislation with their trade embargo on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. But Athens is to be given a maximum of two months respite to lift the embargo; otherwise a trial will take place in Luxembourg. Legal action against Greece became more probable after 11 European foreign ministers meeting in the Greek town of Ioannina on Sunday [27 March] unanimously condemned Athens's actions against FYROM. The European Commission (EC) had asked the ministers to give a political judgement before the Commission took action against Greece. Commission President Jacques Delors said that the crisis between Greece and FYROM had too many political aspects for the issue to be written off as simply an infringement of European law. The ministers have now given the judgement asked of them. Only Luxembourg Minister Jacques Poos tried to reach a compromize during the informal European ministerial council meeting in Ioannina. He suggested that Greece should lift the embargo, and in exchange the EU would negotiate with FYROM about the sticking points between Greece and FYROM. The Greeks want FYROM to remove the "Star of Vergina" from its flag, because it is regarded by Athens as a Greek symbol. The Greeks also feel that FYROM's Constitution calls for the absorption of the Greek province of Macedonia. Greece, a member of NATO, apparently feels threatened by FYROM's 6,000-strong Army. Poos's compromise was unacceptable for German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in particular. The proposal would mean that the EU fully identified with the Greek demands. The foreign ministers rejected the defense of Greek Foreign Minister Theo Pangalos that Athens had announced the embargo for security reasons. An EU member state is allowed to take measures which restrict trade if its external security is threatened, according to European rules. Pangalos believes that the European treaty also allows the rules to be diverged from if there is a danger to domestic security. The violent demonstrations in Thessaloniki, Athens, and elsewhere against FYROM are claimed as proof that Greece's domestic security is at stake. Pangalos's arguments were found wanting by Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans. Now that the 11 foreign ministers are sticking by their condemnation of Greece, the Commission, as the guardian of European economic legislation, can no longer hold off from legal action. European Foreign Affairs Commissioner Van den Broek said on Sunday in Ioannina that a distinction would be made between the EU's legal case against Greece on the one hand and the continuation of the search for a political solution on the other. Right from the start the Commission has tried to convince Greece politically to lift the embargo against FYROM. At the end of February, Van den Broek shuttled between Athens and FYROM. He looked into the possibilities of an agreement between the two countries. His conclusion was that the lifting of the embargo would free the way for negotiations with FYROM. On Sunday in Ioannina, Van den Broek once again called for a political solution. However, it is not the EU which is playing the main role in this respect, but the UN American mediator Cyrus Vance.
