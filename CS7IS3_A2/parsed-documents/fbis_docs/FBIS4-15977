But Even More Problems. Situation in Far Northern Regions Is Becoming Critical"] [Text] TRUD has already published a report on the hunger strike by women from the "Tokhomo" Geological Exploration Enterprise in the Evenki Autonomous Okrug. The reason for the hunger strike is that the workers have not been paid since last summer. The money due for the work they have completed was finally "wrung out" of the enterprise by means of tears and a strike. But the enterprise's future remains in question. The state used to invest considerable sums in organizing the Evenki oil exploration expedition. Highly skilled specialists have been assembled here. If "Tokhomo" goes bankrupt, the result will be further losses for the state. No sooner was the hunger strike by the women of Baykit brought to an end than the "protest relay" was taken up by six representatives of the "Norilskstroy" Association's trade union committee. We learned recently that a three-day hunger strike was declared from 1 April in Igarka by six workers at the geological exploration expedition. The reason was the same: Work was no longer being financed and people were not getting paid. The problems being experienced by the working people of the North have not cropped up overnight or even in the recent past. Four years ago the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia held a conference in Murmansk at which the region's social and economic problems were discussed. Incidentally, the region provides the state with 75 percent of its oil, 92 percent of its gas, 100 percent of its gold and diamonds, and 70 percent of its timber. According to calculations by specialists, every worker in the northern expanses provides the country with revenue which is three times that generated by the average Russian worker. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to live here. At the Murmansk conference the trade unions stated: "The North is sick, disaster is approaching. Contradictions between production and social amenities have driven people to despair. The pathetic incentives on offer have lost their attractiveness given the chronic lack of food and basic necessities." Last year, under pressure from the trade unions, the Congress of People's Deputies adopted the Law "On State Guarantees and Compensation Payments for Northerners," and presidential edicts and government decrees aimed to stabilize the social and economic situation in the Far Northern regions. Nevertheless the situation in the region during recent years has not only failed to improve but has actually reached the critical level. Another trade union conference on the problems of the North -- the fourth -- was held in Moscow at the end of March. In addition to delegates from 18 territorial trade union associations, deputies from the State Duma and Federation Council, members of the government, and representatives of ministries and departments took part in its work. Following Russian tradition, the leitmotiv at this conference was encapsulated by two questions: Who is to blame? And what can be done? Whereas practically every speech contained the answer to the first question -- the government -- few had anything definite to say about the second. The absurdity of the situation is that the present government cannot act within the framework of the laws adopted in the state even if it wants to. Dmitriy Lukashenko, chairman of the Komi Republic Trade Union Federation, gave the following example. Deputy Finance Minister Vyacheslav Korolev stated bluntly at parliamentary hearings that we have not implemented the Law on the North and we do not intend to do so. "What do you mean?" the astonished parliamentarians demanded. It seemed like nonsense to hear this sort of thing directly from a ranking state official. And then, without any embarrassment whatsoever, V. Korolev hit back with the assertion that there is simply no money to implement the law! Indeed, to fully implement this law would, according to various assessments, require an appropriation of 35-80 trillion rubles from the state budget. It is abundantly clear that the government cannot manage this and is obliged to maneuver between two extremes: Either it must pay the northerners the amount laid down by the law and thereby stoke up hyperinflation, or it must secure major amendments to the law from the State Duma. Which, incidentally, is already being done. A report leaked to the press, stating that the government has prepared a draft decree on abolishing some of the benefits payable to northerners, has provoked a negative reaction. A strike committee has been formed in the Komi Republic. "If the benefits stipulated by the law are cut," Dmitriy Lukashenko stated at the conference, "products from our republic will stop arriving in the Russian center. We will block railroads and highways. Oil and gas wells will only `operate' insofar as is necessary to satisfy the region's internal needs. We will only send what is left over to consumers in other regions in order to avoid shutting down the wells altogether. We will stop transferring taxes to the federal budget...." This menacing ultimatum is unlikely to be adopted. In my view, the trade union leader's resoluteness contained more in the way of emotional charge than considered appraisal. It is not hard to conjecture what the consequences of such a step would be: They would hit working people first and foremost. At the same time we should bear in mind that the pursuit of a policy based on the postulate that "the Russian peasant will endure anything" is becoming extremely dangerous. It seems the power structures are well aware of this. The representative branch, at any rate. The State Duma and Federation Council are planning to review the blueprint determining state policy in the northern regions. Whatever transpires, it remains a fact that the North always was and continues to be Russia's principal "storehouse" of raw materials. Without the preservation and development of the economy of these regions, which, incidentally, comprise approximately 65 percent of our state's total area, it becomes impossible to envision the rebirth of Russia, a topic which political leaders love to talk about. Polls that have been carried out show that over 50 percent of the workers currently employed in the Northern regions would be prepared to leave the area at the present time. The only thing holding them back is the lack of money to pay their travel costs and the dim prospect of finding somewhere to live in another area. Attempts by individual "desperate souls" to overcome these obstacles often come to a sorry end. Gennadiy Loginov, director of the Kola Scientific Center attached to the Russian Academy of Sciences, gave this example. Some 200 families left Zelenogorsk, he said. They sold everything they had, their apartments and furniture. They scraped together the money to make the journey. They simply trundled around the central oblasts and came back again. It was practically impossible for them to find work to match their skills, and they had no place to live. Apartment rental prices are crazy. You can imagine the situation they are in now.... It is not hard to imagine. It is far harder to answer the question: How can these people be helped? After all, most of them did not come here as a result of any romantic delusions. Some were sent here after training, others sincerely responded to party and government appeals. The main point is that through their labor they have helped us to live more or less tolerably by pulling the whole country along, so to speak. And now they have become captives of this "white and silent expanse," it would simply be inhuman to abandon them to the mercy of fate. However, let us analyze factors that are more tangible -- economic reasons. We know that a significant proportion of state budget revenue comes from the gold extraction industry. It would seem that the government should pay most attention to this sector. But alas no! Judging by the situation that has developed in Magadan Oblast, nobody cares too much about federal budget revenue. Many gold extraction enterprises in this region, according to Valentin Tsvetkov, deputy chairman of the Federation Council Budget and Finance Committee, are currently being forced to cut production. The extraction artels are only working sites where precious metal can be obtained without significant expenditure. In other words, they are "siphoning off the cream." In this respect the state is incurring enormous losses. Enterprises which are fulfilling state orders for gold and diamond extraction are not being paid on time for their output. They have been obliged to take out loans with commercial banks and pay interest rates at the expense of their profits. This is how the "collapse" of the foreign currency sector is proceeding. You will agree that it is very hard to understand the logic of these actions by the government. The economic problems of the northern territories, like those of the whole of our country, cannot be explained or justified merely by the hardships that have resulted from the changeover in the sociopolitical structures of society, the switch, so to speak, from developed socialism to insufficiently developed capitalism. Many of these problems have been generated by the mistakes that were made as reforms progressed. But mistakes, as we well know, are committed by specialists whose skills do not match up to the tasks they have undertaken to tackle. In my view, this encapsulates one of the reasons for the tragedy which our society is enduring. The future of these people who find themselves in extreme economic and climatic conditions cannot leave us indifferent. The appeals to the president and the prime minister adopted at the conference that has just been held basically contain a single call: Ensure strict compliance with the law regarding social guarantees for northerners. Only time will tell whether this call will be heeded in the Kremlin and the White House....
