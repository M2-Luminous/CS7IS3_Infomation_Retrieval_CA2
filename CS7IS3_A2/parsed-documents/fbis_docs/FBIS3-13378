Dr. Ja'ja' said: The first thing that caught my attention in the security developments concerning Ghidras and the headquarters of the Lebanese Forces is that a security source accused me of cheap public posturing. I would like to ask this source, in all cordiality, why is he afraid to identify himself? First of all, who is this security source? Secondly, in what self-respecting country in the world do security personnel dabble into political matters and accuse politicians, ministers, and deputies. A security man's job is to gather security information and report them to the legal authorities and political officials, who may take the necessary action and, if need be, file charges. Today, for example U.S. President Bill Clinton is facing accusations. The attorney general, a Washington Court judge, the secretary of the interior, and the attorney general are the ones who may comment on whether the President of the United States is to face charges or not. But things are different here. I find it totally unacceptable that a security official should make statements or leak news at will. The second remark that I found interesting is the claim that the Lebanese authorities are currently examining the possibility of liquidating the Lebanese Forces. This is the first time I have heard of such a thing. I call on the anonymous individual who spread such rumors to identify himself. For example, is he the interior minister, who has the legal right to bring up that matter, or the defense minister, or the president, or the prime minister, or the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies? I, for one, have not heard any official proposing the disbanding of the Lebanese Forces. Not one official has even come close to expressing such a notion. It is evident that we have to live according to the country's laws, but we refuse to live according to the law of the jungle. Dr. Ja'ja' was asked: Returning to the security source, we would like answers to the accusations the he made, particularly the charge that the Lebanese Forces are not interested in politics, but are an intelligence service that is still in operation. Dr. Ja'ja' answered by saying: If I wanted to respond to some of the points made by anonymous security sources -- for example, the claim that I do not want to engage in politics -- I would ask this: What am I involved in, then? I am specifically involved in politics. It is because I am involved in politics that they [not further specified] deal with us in the way that we have seen of late. According to them, we do not want to participate in political life, but indulge in intelligence work. This is a serious accusation. The individual making such allegations is not weighing his statements carefully. If he has evidence but is still silent, then he is remiss in his security duties. If he has no evidence and is not sure of what he is saying, he is committing a serious offense against political and public freedoms in this country. No official is entitled to make random accusations against any political party or individual. Ja'ja' added: What I do not understand is why every time an incident occurs, accusations are leveled against us. For two years or more the authorities have been saying that I detain people at will. I still remember the uproar that arose after the Israeli attack last July or August in the south. At that time, the authorities made large-scale sweeps and searched the homes of Lebanese Forces' officials. They just use the Lebanese Forces as a whipping boy. Ja'ja' said: If an attack happens in the south, it is the Lebanese Forces. If an explosion happens in the American University of Beirut, it is the Lebanese Forces. If the Phalangist Headquarters is blown up, it is the Lebanese Forces. The bombing in Sayyidat al-Najat Church: The Lebanese Forces. If a citizen beats up his neighbor in Ba'labakk: The Lebanese Forces. All these accusations are groundless. It is clear that we are up against a deliberate smear campaign. What I want to say is that they have repeatedly made accusations against the Lebanese Forces. They prejudge us and then carry out searches and arrests. What good did the arrest of thousands of young Lebanese Forces' supporters do after the Israeli attack in the south? The pretext for these campaigns -- if I remember right -- was that there was another Israeli attack on the home front. Did I call for an Israeli attack against the south? They claimed to be making preparations to confront Israeli attacks? Fine. What have they found out? They have made big accusations, serious accusations. This is how we see it. They made serious and untrue accusations against us. Had such charges been made against any other individual or party in Lebanon, we would have found them unacceptable, particularly because they were designed to mislead. Underlying these accusations is a scheme to bully the Lebanese Forces. Dr. Ja'ja' said: Some people wonder why all this uproar over the Ghidras issue. The state has two stories it is trying to propagate. According to a statement issued by the Lebanese state, the first story is that the recent security measures are part of the general security plan in Lebanon. If this is the case, why is the state angry? Is the Army not entitled to set up roadblocks on any road? According to the state's second version, there are fugitives and wanted people; hence they are confusing things. Officials say that there are fugitives, wanted people, explosives experts, and suspects, and that all those are in Ghidras. I will respond to each claim. As for the first version, Dr. Ja'ja' said: First of all, the state cannot just level accusations against anyone, because there is a judiciary in Lebanon. As long as there is a judiciary system in Lebanon, the current events are impermissible. Accordingly, why is the state not naming the defendants, listing all the incidents incriminating the defendants, and bringing them to trial? As you know, when such steps are taken, the families of the defendants will appoint a defense lawyer and the state will appoint a public prosecutor. This is a procedure applicable throughout the entire world. Dr. Ja'ja' said that all that the state has said is absolutely impractical and inconclusive. As for the second version, Dr. Ja'ja' answered: All the accusations leveled by the state as a pretext for its security deployment in Ghidras are, in my opinion, not true. All these accusations are aimed at curbing the political activities in Ghidras. Some officials say that there are wanted people in Ghidras. If, for the sake of argument, we do have wanted people here, let the state send the police here. How can a wanted person be told that he is wanted? If the state thinks that I have wanted people here and if it knows their names, let the state send me a list of names. Dr. Ja'ja' added: Nobody has talked to us about this issue. I dare say that no official, regardless of his level, had talked to me or to any official in the Lebanese Forces about the wanted people. Therefore, this issue is not under discussion. In answer to a question of whether Dr. Ja'ja' believes that there is both a political authority and a military authority in Lebanon, he said: I do not want to get involved in such issues. But the responsibility for the approach the state is currently taking should be shouldered by the political authority. I consider this authority responsible for what is taking place in Ghidras. I urge the interior minister, who is responsible for internal security, to take charge of this issue. We also demand that this minister behave as an interior minister should, because he is directly concerned with the issue. The days of militias are over and no one is allowed to behave as a militiaman. Mirhij must behave as an interior minister. He must tell us what is required, or else we have the right to ask him about all these measures around Ghidras. In response to a question about the extent of the current measures, Dr. Ja'ja' said: I have no idea. But Lebanon will not remain without political liberties. I urge the state politicians to understand the magnitude of what happened. I urge them to resolve it in the best possible way, or else they will be held historically responsible for Lebanon's decline. Asked about rumors that Samir Ja'ja' will end up in exile abroad, he said: No, this is absolutely not true. Our political stand will not change. There is no reason for anyone to worry, because the current rumors will backfire on those who spread them. They may not care about public opinion, but we do care a lot about it. To another question of whether he and Patriarch Sfayr share the same stand and whether he expects that pressures will be brought to bear on the patriarch, Dr. Ja'ja' said: I hope the opposite will occur and that no pressures will be put on him. I also hope that all the pressures on us will end as soon as possible, because the pressures will destroy Lebanon. Lebanon will only be built by every word that is expressed under the canopy of freedom.
