Over the last week and more, the two sessions have concentrated on discussing the main topics of reform, development, and stability as well as the general task of "seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability." They have fully displayed the superiority of the people's congress system and the political consultation system in actively discussing the important issues of Tibet. Entrusted by the people of all nationalities and all walks of life in Tibet, the people's congress deputies and the CPPCC committee members, with a high degree of sense of responsibility, have realistically appraised last year's government work, seriously examined and discussed this year's government work plans, put forward many valuable comments and suggestions, and placed ardent expectations on governments at all levels. We must treasure very much the encouragement given to all government functionaries by the people's congress deputies and the CPPCC committee members. We must treat the people's demands and aspirations in a very responsible way and live up to their expectations. We must take the current opportunity to enhance vigor, work diligently and conscientiously, and do even better government work to make the 2.3 million people of all nationalities in Tibet rest assured and satisfied. In the work of stabilizing the situation and the antisplittist struggle, our situation is more special, our struggle is more complex, and our tasks are more arduous than other parts of the country. The work of stabilizing the situation is an important task shared by the party committees, the public security and judicial departments, and governments at all levels. Although our reform and development tasks are particularly arduous this year, we must not attend to one thing only and lose sight of another. We must attach equal importance to both the work of maintaining stability and the work of promoting reform and development, attend to both constantly and unremittingly, and ensure social stability. Next, I will discuss several points of view regarding the economic work. 1. The present economic situation Since the beginning of this year, governments at various levels, seriously adhering to the guidelines of the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and the regional economic work conference, have achieved initial success in deepening reforms, opening the region wider to the outside, and developing the economy. While striving for the overall progress of reform, the governments have taken the crucial step to formulate comprehensive reform plans. All productive and business activities are proceeding smoothly, and the economic operation as a whole is basically normal. Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Rural Economy -- In this year, various localities are continuing to strengthen leadership over the work in rural and pastoral areas, formulating and implementing productive measures, continuing to readjust the production structure, and increasing the ratio of cash crops and fodder crops in grain-producing areas. The autonomous region is growing 3.23 million mu of crops, up 2 percent from last year. Of the crops, grain occupies an area of 2.82 million mu, the same as last year; rape accounts for 240,000 mu, up 33 percent from last year; and fodder crops cover 170,000 mu, up 70 percent. Since last summer, some localities have suffered droughts due to less rainfall, and other localities have experienced storms and snow storms. However, the loss in animal husbandry was less than anticipated thanks to efforts to combat natural disasters and protect livestock. Of 2.38 million newborn animals in the region this year, 1,794,000 had survived as of the end of March; and the survival rate was 76.1 percent, slightly lower than last year's corresponding period. In the same period, 850,000 full-grown animals died; and the death rate was 3.7 percent, slightly higher than last year's corresponding period. Industrial Production and Transport Service -- The region's total industrial output value in the first four months was 113 million yuan, up 2.4 percent from the same period of last year. The outputs of all major products increased during the period as compared with last year's corresponding period, except those of timber and cement which decreased somewhat. Electric power generation increased by 7.7 percent; chromium ores, 82.5 percent; boromagnesite, 65.2 percent; leather, 108.8 percent; wool, 25.9 percent; and flour, 28.3 percent. State-owned transport service handled 152,900 tonnes of cargo, up 14.8 percent from last year's corresponding period. Of the cargo transported, inbound goods increased by 22.6 percent, outbound goods rose 10.6 percent, and [unintelligible word -- possibly Tibetan Language] [fen yun 0433 6663] increased by 10.9 percent. Capital Construction -- Projects under construction and continued from the previous year proceeded fairly smoothly. A total of 230 million yuan was invested in capital construction in the period from January through April, accounting for 11.42 percent of this year's investment target and slightly higher than the figure in the same period last year. There were 16 above-norm projects continued from the previous year and 10 above-norm projects being newly launched. Foreign Trade and Tourism -- During the period from January to April, the value of contracts for imports across the border reached about $333,900 and the export turnover amounted to $1.36 million; both grew 100 percent over the same period last year. The value of contracts for imports via shipping service amounted to about $20.69 million, $20.09 million more than the same period last year; exports were valued at $31,400, up 100 percent from the same period last year. Travel agencies received 1,972 foreign tourists, with a business income of 19,573,300 yuan and $374,600 in foreign exchange earnings. The Situation of Revenue -- Tibet collected a total of 52.877 million yuan in taxes from January through April; this includes 29.233 million yuan in industrial and business taxes, up 16.7 percent from the same period last year. Banking Conditions -- By the end of April, Tibet had issued a total of 3.553 billion yuan in various kinds of loans, and savings totalled 3.837 billion yuan, 831 million yuan and 764 million yuan more than the figures in the same period last year, respectively. Savings deposits in urban and rural areas reached 986 million yuan by the end of April, 29.2 million yuan more than the same period last year. The issuance of state bonds has been completely successfully. There are still some problems that must not be left unattended in the current economic work: 1. some pastoral areas hit by storms and blizzards are having a hard time fighting disasters and keeping their livestock; 2. due to price hikes and other reasons, enterprises' production cost has risen and operation are difficult; 3. the financial and taxation situation is not promising; prefectures, cities, and units are crying loudly for a supplementary budget; collection of some categories of taxes is not satisfactory, even declining; 4. affected by the price readjustment in the hinterland, prices for the basic necessities of life and means of production in Tibet are rising rapidly; many residents and people living in agricultural and pastoral areas have strong resentment because their lives are conspicuously harsh. 2. Conscientiously Organize and Implement Reform Programs Since the beginning of this year, we have made the establishment of a new socialist market economic structure our goal and, in light of the state's reform arrangements, concentrated our efforts to work out a series of reform programs which have taken Tibet's situation into consideration. In the second half of this year, we will successively issue reform programs for the oil industry, foreign trade, and others as well as policies aiming at properly solving the wage problem in some enterprises. The reform for this year requires greater effort, involves a wider scope, sets higher demands, poses more difficulties, and creates more hard work. Judging from the current situation, our principal problems are that the reform has not been carried out satisfactorily and has proceeded slowly. To make sure all reform programs will be carried out smoothly, we must pay attention to the following aspects at present: First, we must enhance our steadfastness in reform. Tibet's rapid economic development in recent years should, in the final analysis, attribute to reform and opening up. The practice has proven that without reform and opening up, there will be no way for Tibet to develop its economy. Reform will certainly involve readjustment in the structure of interests and even affect the temporary interests of some areas and people in a certain period; thus a variety of serious difficulties arise. There are many problems, particularly those concerning the economic field, that must be resolved through deepening reform and accelerating development. We cannot waver in our resolve in reform and consider resuming the old path of a planned economy whenever we meet difficulties. Reform is like a boat sailing against the current; it must forge ahead, or it will be driven back. We should be aware that people of all nationalities in Tibet, particularly leaders at various levels, are on the same boat of reform; only by helping each other, unifying their minds, and braving the wind and the waves can they successfully reach the opposite bank. In the midst of torrents and rapids, all the pessimism, disappointment, complaints, and censures will be of no avail. Therefore, on the issue of reform, we must strengthen our belief, take the overall situation into consideration, and set our eyes on the future; leaders at and above county level, particularly, must unify their thinking and paces; press forward and be brave in taking risks in the face of difficulties; actively guide and organize the people to come up with methods, countermeasures, and answers with the new ideas of the development of a socialist market economy; and fulfill their responsibilities as leaders. Only by doing so can we truly put the overall situation of reform under control. Second, we should fully understand the contents of the reform. The reform plans to be implemented this year consist of a wide range of things and new concepts; therefore, study of these reform plans is arduous work, especially at a time when we are still quite unfamiliar with the basic theory of the socialist market economy. Currently, the pressing task is for leading cadres at all levels to gain a good understanding as soon as possible of the basic contents of all reform plans, the applicability of the established policies, and specific skills for implementing these policies; to ensure training of specialized personnel; to ensure that the established policies are not interpreted one-sidedly; and to see that implementation of these policies is not delayed and the reform plans are carried out faithfully. Third, we should ensure a good job in conducting propaganda and in explaining the reform plans to the masses. Reform is an undertaking for all the people. We can achieve nothing if we solely rely on the efforts of leaders and specialized personnel and if we lack the masses' understanding, support, and participation. Therefore, we should focus propaganda work on the grassroots. We should publish popular and easy-to-understand propaganda materials to meet the needs of peoples at various educational levels; we should hold radio and television lectures, publish special columns in newspapers and magazines, and organize lectures by specialized personnel to conduct elaborate propaganda to enable the masses to understand the basic contents of reforms. In addition, we should clearly define the established policies, defuse the masses' misgivings and misunderstanding, and encourage them to actively and self-consciously devote themselves to carrying out reform. Fourth, we should quicken the pace of implementing the reform plans. In laying down the general demand of the whole party's work, central leaders begin with "Seize the Opportunity To Deepen Reform." Therefore, we must not miss the current good opportunity for reform. Judging from the developments in the last few months, the slower reform is carried out, the more problems are accumulated and the more difficult it becomes to solve them. Therefore, we must quicken the pace of our work. On the one hand, general affairs departments and departments in charge should concentrate their efforts on formulating feasible relevant measures to support reform and implement these measures as soon as possible. On the other hand, as clearly stated in the policy of reform, we should address ourselves to implementing those measures that are more complete. Problems common to reforms in various fields may be referred to the next higher authorities. But, no one is allowed to change established measures and invent their own. 3. Ensure a Good Job in Current Production Work and Properly Arrange the Masses' Daily Life This year's economic work was set forth in detail at the economic work conference early this year and at the current people's congress meeting, and it is being carried out in all localities. Here I would like to stress work in five of the many fields. The first is agricultural and animal husbandry production. While strengthening field management, doing work to prevent natural disasters, and restoring production work in disaster-stricken areas, we should build capital water projects in a timely manner for farmlands and grasslands. The second is that, industrial and transportation enterprises should increase their vitality through deepening reform, should strive to improve their profitablity, and should improve their efficiency by improving management. The third is to properly carry out construction of key projects. We should ensure that construction is carried out as scheduled, ensure construction quality, and ensure that the annual construction plans are fulfilled. The fourth is to do a good financial and taxation job. This year's financial budget has been examined by the people's congress. We should do our work strictly according to the budget to uphold the budget's solemnness. In principle, no extra budgets will be granted, barring special situations. Regarding taxation work, localities experiencing shrinking tax revenues should seriously look into the causes and take measures to ensure that their tax revenue plans are fulfilled. [no fifth point as published] Here, I would like particularly to mention the problem in people's livelihood. Generally speaking, we have achieved positive results in improving the living standards of the people in the agricultural and pastoral areas of our region. But we should not be too optimistic about the work of helping people get rid of poverty and become rich. We should not overestimate the income standard of peasants and herdsmen. It should be noted that there are many people who have not yet solved the problem of having enough food to eat and clothing to wear. With the introduction of the state's reform policy and price readjustment in the hinterland, our region is experiencing an excessive growth in commodity prices. On top of that, some areas in our region witnessed natural disasters last year. At present, people in our region have many problems in their livelihood. In accordance with the investigations conducted by the regional government in various localities and opinions expressed at the sessions of the regional people's congress and the regional committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, all localities are experiencing grain shortages to some extent. Some households have even run out of grain. Some workers and staff members of enterprises are also experiencing hardship in their daily life. These are problems deserving our great attention. Areas with grain shortages should take care to transport grain and ensure the supply of the people's food. Meanwhile, all localities should work hard to raise funds for helping the poor and relieving disasters. They should ensure provision of aid to the people in a timely fashion. Efforts should be made to organize people in Ali [7093 6849] and other areas severely affected by the natural disasters to provide for and help themselves by engaging in production. At the same time, we should pay attention to the prevention and cure of epidemic diseases. People are strongly complaining about unwarranted price hikes and arbitrary exaction of fees. Price control is an urgent and heavy responsibility for the government. Some other problems are likely to occur if we fail to adopt effective measures. To effectively control the excessive growth of commodity prices and stabilize the people's livelihood, it is necessary to strengthen macroeconomic control; conscientiously improve price and market control by comprehensively using legal, economic, and administrative means; carry out the practice of showing the price for each commodity; resolutely stop the illegal practice of driving up prices; and strengthen the supervision of prices of people's daily necessities. In the near future, the Planning Commission will carry out measures for supervising the prices of 19 basic necessities including grain, edible oil, and tea as well as prices in the service industry. This is an effort to control prices within a limit that most of the people can bear. To check the excessive growth of prices and combat unfair trade practices, it is advisable to formulate regulations for combating price cheating and exorbitant profits. Such regulations can be formulated by the Price Bureau with the help of departments in charge of industrial and commercial affairs and taxation. It is necessary to carry out this year's price inspection in a thoroughgoing manner. Active efforts should be made to raise funds and establish a reserve system for important materials such as grain, tea, and salt so as to strengthen our ability to control commodity prices. Further efforts should be made to control the charging of various fees. Last year, 87 kinds of fees were abolished after consolidation. As a result, the phenomena of arbitrary exaction of fees was under control. But such phenomena cropped up again in recent months, particularly in Lhasa city. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to consolidate administrative fees and business charges. Resolute efforts should be made to ban any fees that are unreasonable, without proper authorization, or not within the proper scope. With the help of the Economic Planning Commission, the Finance Department should work harder to carry out this work. 4. Pay Close Attention To Making Proper Preparations for the Construction Projects To Be Carried Out as a Tribute to the Grand Celebration [of Tibet's 30th Founding Anniversary] The central authorities are very concerned about Tibet's economic development and social progress. Earlier, the central authorities sent special working teams to Tibet to survey and study projects in a bid to help it map out a long-term development program. After conducting on-site surveys, they basically reached a consensus with the autonomous region. Preparations are in full swing now; the projects reported to the higher authorities are under consideration; and arrangements for these projects are being made. These projects requested by Tibet center on agriculture, animal husbandry, infrastructure, and social development. They proceed from the interests of the whole region and take into consideration the need for the construction and development in the future. A portion of the preliminary work has been completed already. As regards those projects whose conditions are ripe for the commencement of construction, we must pay close attention to ensuring that funds are channelled to their proper recipients so that construction may commence at an early date. As regards those projects that need to be reported to the higher authorities for approval later on, we must make whatever readjustments are necessary and give as much priority to important projects as possible on the basis of the suggestions made by the working teams. If preliminary work is found to be inadequate, we must make the best use of time available to make careful calculations, to prepare an accurate list of materials in detail, and to report them promptly to higher authorities. As there is only a little more than a year left before the time for our grand celebration arrives, we face heavy tasks and are pressed for time. All prefectures, cities, and departments certainly must organize competent teams to make proper preparations for commencement of construction. They must make concerted efforts and closely coordinate with each other under the unified command of Tibet's leading group for projects so that construction may commence immediately after projects are approved and a guaranteed number of projects may be completed with guranteed construction quality. Those construction projects which have been included in the autonomous region's plan and are scheduled for completion around the time of next year's grand celebration must be treated as the 61 projects which are to be carried out as a tribute to the grand celebration. They must be placed under unified management. All quarters must guarantee that their construction jobs are completed on schedule to pay tribute to Tibet's 30th founding anniversary. 5. Change Work Style and Pay Close Attention to Implementation Generally speaking, the work style of organs and leadership in Tibet is good. However, lax enforcement of discipline, dilatory work style, low efficiency in handling official business, shifting responsibility to others, and arguing back and forth do exist in some departments and units. Some leading cadres confuse themselves with ordinary citizens. Instead of positively devising ways to solve problems that have cropped up in carrying out work, they blame others, grumble, and complain as if they were bystanders. Some individual departments and leaders even show out-and-out disregard for orders and bans. They adopt an attitude of overtly complying with but covertly opposing the decisions made by party committees and governments. As a result, some important decisions cannot be implememted even after stalling for a long time, thus producing undesirable influences. This year's tasks on reform, development, and stability are very heavy. Under such circumstances, leaders at all levels and all government functionaries must show a strong sense of devotion and responsibility, and redouble their efforts in a spirit of seizing every moment. Our power is given by the people. Our government is called a people's government mainly because it serves the people in a down-to-earth manner. This is a fundamental difference from a nonpeople's government. Hence, we must further change our work style and mental attitude, mingle with the masses, plunge into the thick of reform, and go to the frontline of production to study new circumstances, solve new problems, spread new experiences, and raise various areas of work to a new level. The authorities of Qamdo, Xigaze, and Shannan recently sent work groups of various sizes to farming and pastoral areas to conduct investigations and studies and to provide work guidance. It is hoped that all autonomous regional departments and all prefectures and cities will take active measures to send competent work groups to the grass roots to implement the guidelines of the "two sessions." I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate family planning work. It is our country's long-term basic policy to practice family planning, control population growth, and improve the quality of its population. The "Decision on Strengthening Family Planning Work and Strictly Controlling Population Growth" promulgated by the party Central Committee and the State Council noted explicitly: "Family planning should be practiced among minority nationalities to raise the economic and cultural levels of minority areas and to improve national quality." The State Family Planning Commission and the State Nationalities Affairs Commission last year specifically convened a national conference on family planning among minority nationalities, and formulated relevant policies and measures. Our region still experiences rather rapid population growth. According to the fourth national census, the national birth rate stood at 21.06 per thousand, whereas the birth rate of our region was a high 27.6 per thousand. The region's population growth over the past 10 years has averaged 38,000 people each year, resulting in a total population of 2.318 million people at the end of 1993. Failure to exercise due control will not only make it difficult to improve the overall quality of the population and to effectively improve living standards, but will also only sharpen the contradiction between population and economic development, resource utilization, and environmental protection. Therefore, an urgent task confronting us is to carry out family planning work and allow the population to grow in a planned way. We must now focus on three tasks. 1) we should improve our understanding and unify our thinking. The regional party committee and government take family planning work seriously. They have incorporated birth control into the overall plan for regional economic and social development, and laid down the guiding thought for family planning, which states clearly: We should regard family planning as a fundamental plan for developing the economy and improving national quality. Keeping in mind the need to facilitate economic construction, the fight against poverty to promote prosperity, the improvement of living standards, and gradual national economic growth, we should devote great efforts to improving the quality of the population so that Tibet's population will grow in coordination with the development of various economic and social services. Leaders at all levels should seriously study documents and regulations regarding family planning, gain a profound understanding of the guidelines of those documents and regulations, enhance their understanding, and improve family planning work along with economic construction. 2) We should stabilize the family planning policies currently in force. The family planning policies which our region currently implement were formulated according to popular wishes and the practical experiences of many years. We should seriously study, master, and correctly implement those policies. In farming and pastoral areas, we should firmly follow the principle of "stressing five main aspects," without loosening or tightening it at will. Moreover, we should gain a timely understanding and grasp of new circumstances and sum them up, with the aim of improving our region's family planning policies. 3) We should strive to provide good services. Aside from vigorously publicizing policies and information about family planning and maternity and child care, family planning, medical, and health care departments should improve the training of relevant personnel, raise technological levels, provide all kinds of good services, and fulfill people's needs. Comrades: This year is crucial to our region's efforts to speed up the pace of establishing a socialist market economic structure, deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, and quicken the pace of development. The new situation has set even stricter demands for various tasks. We must live up to the high expectations of the party and people, implement the guidelines of the "two sessions" in a motivational spirit with a rigorous approach and through solid work, and usher in the 30th anniversary of the autonomous region's founding with remarkable achievements.
