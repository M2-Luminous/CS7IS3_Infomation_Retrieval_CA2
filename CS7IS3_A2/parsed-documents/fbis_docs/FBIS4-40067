Before his departure, Boris Yeltsin gave an interview to journalists at the airport. In particular, he spoke about his telephone conversation with U.S. President Clinton a day before. [Begin Yeltsin recording] We discussed several issues. First, the North Korean nuclear issue. And we agreed, or rather it was our proposal, to put forward to the Security Council a question about an international conference and, simultaneously, about sanctions -- phased-in ones. It is a very serious matter. So there you are. Later, Kozyrev and Christopher are to meet tomorrow or the day after in Brussels, where they are to agree the text. [end recording] The presidents also discussed the question of Boris Yeltsin's visit to the United States in September this year. As for his visit to the Far East and Siberia, the Russian president noted the regions' specific features and abundance of mineral resources there. [Begin Yeltsin recording] We have now somehow concentrated on the foreign countries in the east, and I think it is from there that an inflow of investment can be expected. This is something we are now lacking. I refer to China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. [end recording]
