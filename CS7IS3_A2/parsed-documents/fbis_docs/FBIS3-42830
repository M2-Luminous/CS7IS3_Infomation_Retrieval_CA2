Sydoruk, Engineer, Kiev] [Text] 1. Interesting Geography A map can be a wonderful thing. Different color intensities can be used to show the depths of seas, while different colors can be used to display the geographical disposition of various nationalities. But we lack one map! One that would depict the economic balance sheet of the various areas of Ukraine, i.e., which areas are operating at a profit and which are a drain on the Ukrainian economy. The Crimean peninsula clearly falls into the latter category. 2. A Cause of Discord It is only natural that for a person who is conscious of being a Ukrainian the Crimean question does not exist. What exists is the universally accepted principle of inviolability of borders. But the peculiar nature of our northern neighbor does not allow her to concentrate on her own problems and decrepitude, which she regards as trivial, but to fixate with maniacal persistence on Sevastopil, "The City of Russian Glory!" But this is just one of a number of fixations. For example, what about Port Arthur? St. Gotthard ("The Zenith of Russian Fame!") and, finally, Auzterlitz ("the village of Russian humiliation")? To get things in perspective let us briefly recapitulate some facts on Crimea without recourse to boring statistics. Crimea is a former Soviet health resort with tremendous recreational resources, numerous sanatoria and state-owned dachas for which the major and minor members of the Moscow nomenklatura have developed such a strong sense of longing. Nevermind the largely deplorable service--by international standards, of course--which could satisfy only a Soviet hick, and the huge investments that would be required for upkeep and improvements. Agriculture in Crimea has some promise, provided enough water is supplied by the Dnieper, despite having been ruined by the collective farm mentality that still pervades all of the post-communist territories. Its enough to mention the recent destruction of unique vineyards there because of the predominant culture of inebriation to give a feeling of what we mean. Retirees accounted for a higher percentage of the Crimean population than elsewhere in the former USSR, reaching 61 percent in Sevastopil alone. And, finally, Crimea has the Tatar Question and one of the most popular fleets in the world, existing solely for the purpose of lining the pockets of corrupt admirals and businessmen. 3. The Homeless Fleet For many years the Black Sea Fleet served as "powerful protector of the peaceful Soviet people against the treacherous intrusions of world imperialism" at the southern frontiers of the former superstate. It allegedly served a similar function in the Mediterranean Sea and in the Atlantic Ocean--wherever world imperialism posed a threat. The fact that Turkey and NATO could block the Bosphorus and the Dardenelles and bottle up the fleet went unmentioned. After all, the coddled sons of highly-placed bureaucrats and admirals couldn't risk their delicate organisms in the Arctic Ocean or the northern reaches of the Pacific, but still they had to mark time somewhere. And then the superstate fell apart, imaginary treacherous imperialistic intrusions disappeared, and all that was left to protect was the status quo with all of its perks, economic benefits, advantages and rich rewards. The orphan fleet was left with two fathers who compete for the "right" to take care of it just to look good, while not assuming any serious responsibilities. All the Yaltas, Massandras, St. Andrew's standards and Russian vouchers will change nothing. The fleet will age, turn to rust, disintegrate and the sailors will go home. The officers will make out somehow with other occupations and, besides, Russia still has many fleets with job openings. 4. Nothing New Under the Sun Having shed a tear for the sad fate of the Black Sea Fleet, let's look at some appropriate precedents as English jurists are wont to do. After Salazar's death the first thing the Portuguese parliament did was get rid of their colonial burden to stop Portugal's financial exsanguination. Mozambique and Angola were set free to swim or sink. Another example. Puerto Rico has been an autonomous territory of the US since 1917 and its politicians have tried on numerous occasions to gain statehood, but have always encountered congressional opposition. In distinction to Hawaii, statehood for Puerto Rico could derail the American national budget. Nevertheless, the island remains effectively under American economic control thanks to tourism. 5. Status Quo As part of Ukraine Crimea gets water, electricity, and food, along with financing of the fleet and the retirements of vast number of military retirees. Still, the Ukrainian status is unacceptable to them. There is longing for the good old days of unlimited privileges, a time when the Ukrainian "Banderites" knew their place, all these feelings compounded by geriatric hostility to change. Maybe, just maybe, there are guilty feelings for taking over the empty houses of deported Tatars with their gardens and flower fields. What if the Tatars come and say "Give it back!"? The empire would never have even tolerated such a possibility. 6. Necrophilia Present-day Russia--where you can no longer tell who is a genuine ethnic Russian (Russkiy) and who merely a non-Russian resident of Russia (Rossiyanin)--is shocked to have her stiffling embrace repelled in the name of self-determination. But she still loves her prodigal son--Crimea. This tender example of Oedipus complex comes up against economic realities. Yes, Russia is big (so far), but it also has big problems and does it need yet another enclave? And if the Kuban region settled by ethnic Ukrainians decamps from Russia, Russia--or what's left of it--will be even farther away from Crimea. Ukraine could stand to gain financially from the Crimean situation. In addition to oil prices, which for Ukraine exceed the so-called world prices, Ukraine could charge Crimea for water from the Dnieper at the going rate of some four billion dollars, as well as for transits right across its territory to Crimea. Failure to pay will make more water available for Ukraine, improve the ecologic situation in the Dnieper basin, and take care of dearth of water in Southern Ukraine. The health resorts will continue to thrive on people with convertible currencies, so any referendum to remove the Crimean appendix may not be such a bad idea! 7. A New Hong Kong The Russian writer Aksenov raised hopes of a horn-of-plenty with his fictional work The Island of Crimea, which is easy enough to do with Homo Sovieticus. But, in fundamental terms, there is only one solid basis for self-determination in the world, and that is the will of the indigenous population. In a conglomerate country you are up against a situation where the spiders at the center of the web order everyone else around. In Crimea you simply cannot ignore an Islamic (Tatar) factor, jihads, and so forth. Yet the allure of foreign investments and the creation of another Hong Kong is quite appealing as an easy solution to a rather unsettling reality. How are the pensioners going to be supported? From rental fees for Sevatopil if anybody wants to rent the port? Ukraine would be better off keeping its compact fleet elsewhere. What about water? Energy? Food supplies? But those will be the problems of an independent Crimea and not Ukraine and, of course, we can assume that the separatists have anticipated and provided for these facts of life. A final thought. The waters surrounding Hong Kong have been become so polluted as to render them unfit for swimming; just something else to think about. To date, the Ukrainian community has been remarkably passive in all this and it voice disproportionately low-keyed in this international sing-song. The work of such organizations as "Crimea with Ukraine" and the regional centers of political parties--which have been rendered largely meaningless by the passage of the Crimean constitution--are, nevertheless, slowly permeating into the Ukrainian consciousness. Ukrainian passivity is to a large extent due to an information blockade posed by absence of Ukrainian schools and exclusion of the Ukrainian language from the mass media and community organizations. In the face of this, the persistent efforts of the Tatars are worthy of admiration. 8. Two Suitors and a Girl Christ often spoke in parables, which might offer a convenient vehicle to address the Crimean issue. Once upon a time there was once a clever girl who encouraged two suitors, counting on getting gifts and attention from both of them. Things got heated between the rivals, but the wiser one came to his senses, realized what the score was, and took off. The girl panicked and attempted to lock-in on the remaining suitor, who came to think that she might not be such a treasure after all if no one else would have her. The upshot is that her intrigues risk making her lonely for life. This brings to mind a Russian anecdote where a husband holding his wife out of a tenth-floor window tells her how lucky she is [in Russian]: My grandfather stabbed his wife, my dad shot his, and I'm letting you go free! This has obviously been an anecdotal and a light-humored look at the Crimean question, but every bit of humor has a particle of truth in it...
