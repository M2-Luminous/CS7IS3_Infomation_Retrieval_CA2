FBIS4-4744 "dreas065_a_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-065 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Consultant Makes New Allegation About Hosokawa Consultant Makes New Allegation About Hosokawa OW0504063494 Tokyo KYODO in English 0601 GMT 5 Apr 94 OW0504063494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- A former aide to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had asked an investment consultant who allegedly arranged Hosokawa's 1986 purchase of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) shares not to identify Hosokawa as a client in his firm's tax returns, the consultant said Tuesday [5 April]. "When I received 10 million yen as a consulting fee from the prime minister's former secretary Masatoshi Miyama, he asked me to conceal the transaction," Shuzo Fujiki, president of the Tokyo-based consulting firm Random Walk, said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. Fujiki, 60, said Miyama made the request after Hosokawa made a profit of 50 million yen by selling off 199 out of the 300 NTT shares, for whose purchase Fujiki said he had helped Hosokawa secure a loan. Fujiki complied with Miyama's request by refraining from reporting to the tax authorities the consulting fee as an income of his consulting firm, thereby avoiding the identification of Hosokawa as the payer of the fee. Hosokawa told reporters Tuesday morning he "does not know" whether Miyama asked Fujiki to conceal the exact details of the transaction. "I do not know it," the premier said. "I have to ask (Miyama)." At a news conference last Wednesday, Fujiki quoted Miyama as asking him in 1986, "Mr. Miyama asked...`Because Hosokawa is the incumbent Kumamoto governor, may he use the name of another person for this transaction?'" In the subsequent 1987 conversation with Miyama, Fujiki said, he took Miyama's remark as implying a request not to report to tax authorities the name of Hosokawa as the payer of the consulting fee, as publicity on such a deal might undercut Hosokawa's reputation as governor. According to Fujiki, Miyama had promised to pay 10 percent of net proceeds from any selloffs of the NTT shares as a "reward," while allowing Fujiki to dictate the timing of the selloffs. However, Miyama reneged on the promise and sold off the 199 shares in February and March of 1987 without any consultations with Fujiki, Fujiki said. Later, Miyama asked for Fujiki's consent to lower the sum of the reward to 10 million yen, he said, adding that he accepted the request. Out of the total, 7 million yen were handed over to Fujiki from Miyama in a few installations, while the remaining 3 million yen was remitted to Fujiki's bank account, he said. Fujiki said he is willing to testify on the NTT share transaction at a Diet session if the governing coalition complied with an opposition demand to summon him as a witness. Diet business over the fiscal 1994 state budget has been stalled over the witness demand. Fujiki earlier told reporters that Hosokawa "lied" to the Diet when Hosokawa said his father-in-law, but not himself, asked Fujiki to act as an intermediary to facilitate the share purchase. Hosokawa denied the allegations on the Diet floor, saying that Shohei Ueda, the father of his wife, Kayoko, asked for the share purchase, asking Hosokawa for help in securing a loan to finance the purchase. Hosokawa said he pledged his condominium in Tokyo's Moto-Azabu as collateral to take out the 418 million yen loan from a stock investment financing firm and offered the money to his father-in-law. Hosokawa's father-in-law died last May. In a related development, a well-placed government source told reporters Fujiki "appears to have received the 10 million yen" from Miyama. However, the source denied the allegations that Miyama asked Fujiki to conceal the details of the transaction. Hosokawa earlier told the Diet he purchased the condominium he offered as collateral with part of a 100 million yen loan he borrowed in 1982 from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking group, a company at the center of a money-and-mob scandal. NTT listed tenders for its shares from corporate and large-lot individual investors willing to purchase more than 100 shares on October 4, 1986, before offering the shares for smaller-lot public subscription. Hosokawa succeeded in acquiring all 300 NTT shares for which he had submitted bids on advice from Fujiki, Fujiki said. Even after Hosokawa repaid the funds borrowed for the share purchase, he ended up securing a net investment profit of about 50 million yen, he said.
