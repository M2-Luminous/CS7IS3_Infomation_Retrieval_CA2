Bonner's view is that the legal proceedings violate the legal rules, which means that human rights continue to be a hollow concept in Russia. The problem raised by Mirzoyanov is becoming public knowledge and more details are now emerging. Aleksey Kondulukov reports: Kondulukov: The chemical scandal in Russia is assuming ever broader dimensions. Vil Mirzoyanov, the chemical expert who disclosed to the public that new types of chemical weapons are under development and undergoing testing is already under lock and key in the Matrosskaya Tishina prison. The Moscow City Court has already held its first session devoted to this case. There have already been first appeals and first public petitions to the president. Now yet another letter to Yeltsin has emerged, this time from Uglev, another chemical expert who is also threatened with arrest. Uglev says that Russia is not currently equipped to destroy the stockpiles of chemical weapons in our country, and this is the reason why these weapons are being destroyed by the most primitive of means, without any regard to observing ecological norms. Uglev says that chemical weapons are being destroyed at the Shikhany range in Saratov Oblast as though they are ordinary ammunition. Uglev: "In individual cases it is poured directly into the ground. That is all, that is what it is all about. Or they explode shells filled with... [pauses] with chemical substances." Announcer: The soil, the subsoil and the atmosphere are becoming contaminated. The incidence of cancer among the population living nearby has increased. Uglev's view is that this is a direct consequence of ecological infringements, and he should know, because he himself participated in the development of chemical weapons, and his knowledge of their disabling factors is second to none. In his letter to the president, Uglev stated that if the country's leadership fails to focus attention on these problems, he will, on 4 February, make public the formula of a new type of chemical weapon. The ultimatum was effective, and Uglev recently met with Baturin, the president's national security aide. Uglev says that the authorities have at long last become interested in this subject matter. Uglev: "It seems there will be no sensation on 4 February, because there is a definite accord with the presidential aide and, when all is said and done, I think that the main aim has been reached. I am satisfied, to a considerable extent, although the Mirzoyanov case has so far remained deadlocked, generally speaking. I said to Mr. Baturin literally what follows: If the president issued orders to fire on the White House, there is no need to fire on the Moscow City Court -- it is sufficient, as it were, to articulate your point of view to the judges." Announcer: Whatever happens, the court's next session in the Mirzoyanov's case is tomorrow, and tomorrow we will know for sure how events have unfolded.
