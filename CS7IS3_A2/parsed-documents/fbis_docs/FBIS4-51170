Li made these remarks while meeting with 95 national labor models here. On the occasion of the upcoming 1 May International Labor Day, Li Ruihuan, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State Council, extended his festive greetings to Chinese workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the laboring masses of all nationalities. For various reasons, he said, living standards of the staff and masses of some departments have not improved remarkably. Some have even encountered temporary difficulties. It is quite natural for the party and government to show concern for them. Li Ruihuan stated that the trade union serves as a bridge linking the CPC with the masses of workers. Trade unions should regard as their own duties safeguarding the interests of the masses and helping workers resolve difficulties in livelihood, frequently go deep into the realities of life, maintain close ties with the masses, enthusiastically listen to the voice of the masses, know what the masses are thinking, accurately and promptly report the situation to the local party and government departments, do their utmost to resolve difficulties for the masses, meticulously do ideological work well, mitigate contradictions, dispel sulky moods, and win the understanding and support of the masses. Li Ruihuan once again stressed that China's reform, opening up, and modernization program has entered a new stage. China's overall situation is characterized by "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability." He called on China's working class, the CPC, and the Chinese Government to share a common fate, serve this overall situation, do their own work well in a down-to-earth manner, and give full play to their role as a "vital force" in economic construction.
