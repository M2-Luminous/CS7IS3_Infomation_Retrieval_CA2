The incident took place yesterday 22 February at a place called Gasata on the outskirts of Kigali. The RPF leaders who had been on their way to Kigali decided to turn back after reaching Ngondole because of the worsening security situation in Kigali. The RPF escort unit, together with UNAMIR troops, decided to continue to Kigali, but were stopped by an abrupt roadblock at Gasata, near Kigali, and before the vehicles could stop they were spread with bullets from the nearby houses. The two vehicles, that of RPF soldiers and UNAMIR overturned, seriously injuring one RPF soldier. The injured soldier was rushed to King Faysal in Kigali which is used by the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda. President Habyarimana's intention to kill RPF leaders (?just) after the assassination of PSD [Social Democatic Party] secretary general, the late Felicien Gatabazi, intended to deal a blow to the opposition parties and to the implementation of the Arusha agreement.
