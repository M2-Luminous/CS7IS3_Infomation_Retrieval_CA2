Over the past two years, China's scientific and technological undertakings have advanced by leaps and bounds. While a stable contingent of scientists are devoting themselves to basic science and high-tech research and are tackling key scientific and technological projects, a large number of research institutes and academies have sent talented scientific and technical personnel to various national economic sectors to contribute to China's economic construction and to push the country to the forefront of international science and technology. The prosperity of the nation and the enhancement of the overall national strength hinge on scientific and technological progress. High tech, represented by electronic information technology, new energy technology, biotechnology, and new materials technology, is one of the mankind's greatest accomplishments in science and technology in the 20th century. In recent years, a number of high- tech research projects based on the latest scientific achievements have flourished and have been quickly transformed into practical productive forces, exerting a profound influence on economic and social development and becoming the core of overall national strength and the focus of international competition. Whoever has an edge in high-tech industries holds the initiative in political, economic, military, and social development. Because China is currently at the crucial stage of developing new and high-tech industries, how to develop new industries and energetically nurture modern enterprises has become an especially pressing issue. The industrialization of new and high technology and the application of advanced science and technology in traditional industries are the two major trends in economic development today. The establishment of a socialist market system will create a very favorable environment for the industrialization of new and high technology. Many of China's high-tech enterprises have been founded and developed through the support of domestic and international markets. The science and technology market, which is a major component of the socialist market system, includes technology markets, markets of scientific and technical personnel, and markets of high-tech products. We should cultivate and promote in a selective way the science and technology market, which can play a comprehensive role in traditional industry, and we should make the market become the "incubator" of high-tech enterprises and industries. In developing new industries and nurturing modern enterprises, we should use scientific and technological advances to tackle difficult and pressing problems in various national economic sectors. We should combine overall plans with breakthroughs in key areas, closely combine the science and technology development plans of the central and local governments as well as departments, and concentrate funds and talented personnel to tackle key scientific and technological engineering projects. We should nurture a new industrial pattern before the year 2000 by selecting and concentrating efforts on several projects from the "863 Program" which can become leading industries and which can exert a significant influence on the national economy. In developing new industries and nurturing modern enterprises, we should conduct preliminary studies and verification of leading new industries targeted by China for the next century, so that science and technology can play a visible role in readjusting the industrial structure, improving product quality, increasing value added, strengthening market competitiveness, and raising enterprise efficiency. We should attach importance to cultivating several points of growth for modern enterprises, such as high-definition television, digital-sound broadcasting, optical-fiber visual communication, and superintegrated circuits. Science and technology departments should adopt various measures to promote the commercialization, industrialization, and internationalization of high-tech research results by doing everything within their capability to introduce new and high technology to large and medium enterprises as soon as possible. In view of the formation of new industries and the emergence of a growing number of high-tech enterprises with modern mechanisms, we should expedite the reform of the science and technology management system, strengthen the intensity of the reform of scientific research departments, and accelerate the implementation of the strategic plan of "holding fast to one end and leaving the whole field open." Meanwhile, we should attract talented personnel, capital, and key technology and equipment; expand scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries; and nurture a group of young scientists. Seizing the opportunity to catch up with the advancing pace of high tech in the world is a pressing task of China's economic development, as well as the inevitable choice for the Chinese nation to become stronger in the world.
