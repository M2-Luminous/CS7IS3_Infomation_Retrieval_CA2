Perhaps the 68 victims of the indiscriminate shell that crashed into a Sarajevo market on Saturday [5 February] did not die in vain. France, at least, has done everything in its power to ensure that this bloody absurdity does not happen again. By threatening to withdraw its UN troops from Bosnia, Paris has literally backed NATO up against the wall. NATO cannot withdraw any further and the Americans, who are its spearhead and its main strength, have had to stop hesitating and humming and hawing in order to come into line with the "French fury" suddenly revealed by Alain Juppe on TV Tuesday evening. The foreign minister has taken up the harsh saying used by French soldiers in Sarajevo: "Either we shoot or we get out." After warning our allies on Monday and Tuesday, neither the United States nor NATO could agree to let the French "get out," since people are not exactly lining up to take over. Alain Juppe, who was personally shocked by Saturday's massacre, has certainly been sensitive to the indignation of public opinion, which itself has been shocked by the unbearable images shown on TV. This is a public opinion that clearly no longer understands how the safety of the UN troops in Sarajevo can serve as an excuse for a policy of non-intervention. By bringing pressure to bear on the allies, the French foreign minister, in total agreement with the French president and prime minister, is aware of the risks being run -- both those run by the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] soldiers in Bosnia, and the risk that both the attempt or any action may result in a failure. That is what is called a calculated risk, and even if mentioning such a risk might seem uncalled-for in the tragic context of Bosnia, the French Government should benefit politically from it. This is all the more true since, for the time being, French firmness seems to be bearing its first fruits: both in Brussels, where the NATO Council ambassadors met yesterday, and on the ground, where Serbs and Muslims yesterday signed an agreement on the withdrawal of Serb heavy weapons to keep them out of reach of Sarajevo and the placing of Muslim heavy weapons under supervision. Of course, this agreement -- which in itself is merely the application of UN Security Council resolution 820 passed on 18 April 1993, must be considered with the utmost caution. So many others that have preceded it have gone unheeded! All we can do is hope that this time reason will win the day and make it possible to curb the dangerous escalation represented by the destruction of these weapons with air strikes. This would be merely adding more war to the war. Yet, the very mention of reason in Bosnia is already an aberration, given the madness that was unleashed there almost two years ago now.
