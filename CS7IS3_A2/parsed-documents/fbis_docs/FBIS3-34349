He said: Such an expectation is possible and this is what made us leave the doors of the council open. In another statement published by the daily EL WATAN, Dr. El Khatib affirmed that the national dialogue will continue under the leadership of the new authority in the country, and at the same time he confirmed reports that the national dialogue committee has held contacts with personalities representing the dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. Mourad Medaoui gives us the details: [Medaoui] The chairman of the National Dialogue Committee today announced that the task of the committee has ended and that the question of organizing dialogue is now a matter for the new authority. In a statement to the daily EL WATAN Dr. Youcef El Khatib said that the committee has indeed held contacts with personalities representing the dissolved FIS, and he pointed out that these personalities had secured the blessing of the FIS leaders in Blida prison. He stressed that these personalities were from inside the country and that there was no contact at all with leaders now abroad. Dr. El Khatib considered these contacts as positive for two reasons: First, the fact that this tendency has accepted the principle of dialogue, and second the fact that this tendency has expressed its readiness to contribute to taking the country out of the crisis by helping to bring an end to bloodshed. Dr. El Khatib expects national dialogue to be easy now because of the existence of a platform that defines everything including relations between the various parties to the dialogue.
