The minister said that soon this problem of the Russian economy will be solved with the help of the presidential decree "On Responsibility for Payment Delays." Shafranik said that the draft decree envisages responsibility, even criminal, to be born by the leaders of businesses for non-payments. The minister said that Siberian enterprises have lower rates of decline in production than those elsewhere in Russia (7% against 17% over Russia). Currently 60 Mn tons of unrequired coal have amassed in Siberia. Speakers at the conference also talked about a program forseeing the closure of loss-making pits and about the creation of a bank for servicing the fuel and energy complex.
