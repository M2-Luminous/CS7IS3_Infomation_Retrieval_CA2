SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations governing the ocean salmon fisheries at 50 CFR 661.21(a)(1) state that: When a quota for the commercial or the recreational fishery, or both, for any salmon species in any portion of the fishery management area is projected by the Regional Director to be reached on or by a certain date, the Secretary will, by notice issued under §661.23, close the commercial or recreational fishery, or both, for all salmon species in the portion of the fishery management area to which the quota applies as of the date the quota is projected to be reached. In the annual management measures for ocean salmon fisheries (59 FR 22999, May 4, 1994), NMFS announced that the 1994 recreational fishery in the area between Humbug Mountain, OR, and Horse Mountain, CA, would be open May 1 through June 30, 1994, or attainment of the 10,300 chinook salmon quota, whichever occurs first. The best available information on June 6, 1994, indicated that recreational catches in the area totaled 10,570 chinook salmon through June 5, 1994. To provide public notice of at least 24 hours, the determination was made to close the fishery at 12 midnight, June␣7, 1994. The Regional Director consulted with representatives of the Pacific Fishery Management Council, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the California Department of Fish and Game regarding this closure. The States of Oregon and California will manage the recreational fishery in state waters adjacent to this area of the exclusive economic zone in accordance with this Federal action. In accordance with the inseason notice procedures of 50 CFR 661.23, actual notice to fishermen of this action was given prior to 2400 hours local time, June 7, 1994, by telephone hotline number (206) 526&hyph;6667 or (800) 662&hyph;9825 and by U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariners broadcasts on channel 16 VHF-FM and 2182 kHz. Because of the need for immediate action, the Secretary of Commerce has determined that good cause exists for this document to be issued without affording a prior opportunity for public comment. Classification This action is authorized by 50 CFR 661.21 and 661.23 and has been determined to be exempt from OMB review under E.O.␣12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: June 13, 1994.
