These results are the focus of great attention, amid positive expectations. Arab and international circles have described the results as a basic and important juncture in the Middle East peace process. These circles note that President al-Asad has gained support for the Arab position by insisting on the peace of the brave, implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy, and achieving Israeli withdrawal from the south and western al-Biqa'. Positive reactions to the results of the Geneva summit are continuing. Deputy Amin al-Hafiz [chairman of parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee] said that the results of this summit indicate that the time of separate agreements has ended. The attention given to the Lebanese situation at the summit talks is very important. President Clinton's statement that the United States supports the implementation of the al-Ta'if agreement, which gives priority to Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon through the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425, is of particular importance. Al- Hafiz affirmed that President al-Asad had expressed the Arabs' good intentions, and the ball is now in the Israeli court. Al-Hafiz also drew attention to the role the Vatican can play in support of Lebanese rights. Deputy Wajih al-Ba'rini maintained that the Syrian-U.S. summit represents the start of a new era of peace based on justice and equality, the restoration of the rights of oppressed peoples led by the Palestinian people, and the implementation of the UN resolutions pertaining to countries whose land is under occupation, including Lebanon and Syria. Al-Ba'rini added that the principled positions adopted by President al-Asad are a source of pride for our Arab nation. We hope that the results of this summit will benefit the peoples of the area and mark the end of conflicts in the Middle East.
