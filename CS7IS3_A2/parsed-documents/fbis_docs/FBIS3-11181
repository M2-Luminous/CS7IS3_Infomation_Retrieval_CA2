We received no immediate replies. The righteousness of our struggle was getting lost amid slander and mistrust. Only one reply reached us at the time and it was that of our brothers in the Civic Action National Coordinating Board for National Liberation (CONAC-LN), who offered the support of their legal commission. We stated our thanks for this gesture, and we gave these people our trust. They will do everything within their power to legally support us. Our needs are great. We welcome the devotion and selflessness of our brothers in the CONAC-LN, and we address the Mexican people to ratify what we recently told these brothers: All the legal affairs of the EZLN will be entrusted to the CONAC-LN's legal commission. Liberty! Justice! Democracy! Respectfully yours, from the Mexican Southeast. [Signed] CCRI-CG of the EZLN [Dated] Mexico, March 1994
