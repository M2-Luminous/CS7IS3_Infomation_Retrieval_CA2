Despite last year's recession and the fall in demand, the 1993 consumer price index released by the National Statistics Institute (INE) yesterday totaled 4.9 percent -- 0.4 percent above the government's latest target. In December alone, prices rose by 0.5 percent -- the largest increase recorded in that month in the past five years. "It is a bad figure," according to the experts, who forecast a revival of inflation in 1994 if Spain finally succeeds in emerging from the recession. The considerable increase in prices in December -- 0.5 percent, as against the 0.3 percent recorded in the same month last year -- was clearly due to the poor performance of foods. The food price index rose by a spectacular 1.5 percent last month, more than in the 12 months of 1992 put together, when it rose by 1.2 percent. "The performance of unprocessed foods was surprising, and clearly reflects the devaluations suffered by the peseta," according to Belen Mateos, head of International Financial Analysts' economic trends department. The only moderately good figure among the figures that became known yesterday is the performance of underlying inflation -- that is, excluding unprocessed foods and energy products -- which rose by 0.2 percent in December. This figure is the same as the one recorded in December 1992, and leaves the annual rate at 5 percent. Reduction of Underlying Inflation "The only interesting thing about inflation in 1993 is that underlying inflation is on a par with the general rate," according to economist Jose Antonio Herce of the Fedea foundation. For instance, in 1992, underlying inflation (6.9 percent) ended 1.5 percent above the general rate (5.4 percent). "The fall with respect to last year is perhaps not very much, in the context of the present recession," Mateos reflected with respect to underlying inflation, "but it shows some flexibility in the services sector, something we did not see very clearly at the beginning of the year."
