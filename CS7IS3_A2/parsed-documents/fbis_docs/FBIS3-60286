Danilov-Danilyan, minister of environmental protection and natural resources, by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent D. Frolov under the rubric "Opinion. ZELENYY MIR Files"; place and date not given: "Russia in an Ecological Zugzwang"] [Text] Minister V.I. Danilov-Danilyan told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent D. Frolov: "We and the West alike need Western aid." Danilov-Danilyan: ...Dozens of cities in Russia have absolutely impermissible indicators of air pollution. If we omit the word "absolutely," the number of such cities will come...to 110. These are not some kind of provincial towns but rather large industrial and administrative centers, including the capital city. In many places, pollutants are superimposed over one another in a way: transportation generates nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide, the iron and steel industry generates sulfur dioxide and benzopyrene; the chemical industry generates formaldehyde, phenol, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The cumulative effect of this cocktail is menacing, and the residents of cities such as Kemerovo, Nizhniy Tagil, Sverdlovsk, Perm, Chelyabinsk, and Saratov suffer incredibly because of this. Most bodies of water are in an impermissible condition. The Volga is no longer a great Russian river but, by analogy with the Danube, which is called "Europe's cesspool," it fully merits the name of "Russia's cesspool." The Ladoga, Omega, Neva, North Dvina, and virtually all rivers of the Urals are polluted.... The Bering and Kara Seas have become a cemetery for decommissioned nuclear reactors; a favorable situation in regard to radiation is out of the question there. In general, radioactive contamination is our worst ecological problem: There are Chernobyl, Kyshtym, and dozens of oblasts with poorly controlled storage facilities. Frolov: It would appear that the list of our ecological troubles could go on forever. As you see it, what kind of resources will be needed in order to contain, if not eliminate all of this? Danilov-Danilyan: If monetary terms are at issue, it is very hard to make this assessment. For example, how can we appraise the extinction of a biological species or the damage done to a genetic pool? Of course, it is possible to count the dead forests, sick leave, and losses caused by the corrosion of metal. However, the result will be far from the truth. As far as containment is concerned, this is a major problem indeed, because we are increasingly posing a danger to our neighbors. This is not necessarily a catastrophe on the scale of Chernobyl during which dozens of foreign radiation control stations recorded a leap in the radiation background. For example, our Pechenganikel and Severonikel combines are the main source of air pollution with sulfur dioxide in Scandinavia which affects Norway, Finland, and to a lesser degree Sweden. There is a draft to retrofit the combines by the Finnish company Outokumpo which will cost $640 million. Of this, Finland and Norway are prepared to pay $100 million and to extend credit for the rest which will be repaid with the products of the combine. Economic calculations have shown that the combine will not be recouped on such terms either. I raised the issue of looking for additional sources of financing with the ministers of ecology of these countries, and by all signs, they are prepared to do it. Frolov: Therefore, previously it was customary to refer to international ecological cooperation, whereas at present it makes sense to talk about Western ecological aid. What could it be about? Danilov-Danilyan: First of all, investment, technology, and know-how, and, to a lesser degree, consultation and training. Most unfortunately, everything happens the other way around. At present, Russia lacks money rather than brains. Large investment into major transformations at a multitude of enterprises is needed to improve the situation because expenditures at the early stages of technological processes are the most effective. It is necessary for ecological programs to cooperate with other commercial activities of foreign companies in our territory. We should grant all manner of preferences if they are prepared to finance such programs, and not at their own facility which is simply mandatory under the contracts, but in other areas not directly associated with the facility. Not only we, but the West itself needs for us to receive Western aid. At present, they are discussing in earnest, and justifiably so, the prospects of global warming which does not promise humanity anything good. It develops because of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily carbonic acid which is generated in the process of combustion of energy resources. It turns out that it is profitable for all developed countries to invest funds in...planting forests in Russia rather than retrofitting their quite clean industry. Forests are a powerful drain on carbonic acid. One hectare will eliminate an amount of it which could not be cut back by investing the same funds in retrofitting any of the worst enterprises in any developed country. Besides, there is nowhere else to plant forests but in Russia.... Frolov: Will we be able to rescue our ecosphere ourselves if aid is not provided for one reason or another? Danilov-Danilyan: All data obtained in recent years prompt me to respond in the negative: Perhaps, we will not be able to. Irreversible changes in natural systems and the gene pool will occur faster than the economy developing without Western aid can become strong enough to restore nature. Nature cannot wait, and if things develop at the same pace, one generation from now there just will not be anyone to pull this weight. We have faced an ecological zugzwang, and have been dealt a blow which is the hardest to deflect from a direction that we have thought about the least.
