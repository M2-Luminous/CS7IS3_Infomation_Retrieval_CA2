"They have been overtaken by events," Livio Caputo, Forza Italia senator responsible for foreign affairs, explained. "The federative Republic of Yugoslavia no longer exists: Slovenia and Croatia's claim to inherit the Osimo treaty without any amendments is countered by the fact that they already breached the treaty themselves by splitting the Italian community in Istria and setting up a border along the Dragonja river." [IL GIORNALE] Is this the only violation? [Caputo] Another violation is the failure to pay eleven-thirteenths of the compensation for property seized from the exiles, which, in our view, must be returned. [IL GIORNALE] The Italian Government has begun negotiations... [Caputo] Yes, but by tolerating that this [blank space in original] bounce back and would next day take back the -- actually very small -- concessions made the previous day. These delaying tactics aimed at burying the problem must be stopped. The new government will look at [Slovenian President] Kucan and [Croatian President] Tudjman's maps. [IL GIORNALE] Today Italian exiles cannot even buy back their homes... [Caputo] We must review those laws on real estate which prevent the victims of that early ethnic cleansing from recovering their property, even if this involves paying. It is perfectly legitimate for Italy to make use of its chance to block Slovenia's and Croatia's application for membership in the European Union until they decide to behave like good Europeans instead of maintaining the practices of a Communist regime that no longer exists and that they have disowned [blank space in original]. [IL GIORNALE] Are the borders untouchable or not? [Caputo] The border issue is a real one. One part of the territories which we had to give up at the end of the war is historically Italian, just as Alsace-Lorraine remained French even when it belonged to Germany, or eastern Prussia is historically German even though it now belongs to Russia. There are no immutable borders in history, especially in frontier areas like Istria and Dalmatia. Even international law allows for borders to be reviewed through diplomatic channels with the agreement of the parties involved. [IL GIORNALE] But there is no such agreement. Alsace-Lorraine and eastern Prussia's borders were changed by the war... [Caputo] The future majority [blank space in original] problem, clearly it will only be solved in the context of peace, possibly though the creation of cross-border regional structures, or perhaps through self-determination procedures. [IL GIORNALE] Self-determination by Serbian Krajina, in Croatia, led to war. [Caputo] Italy is simply doing the same as Japan, which is refusing to fully reestablish normal relations with Russia until a satisfactory solution can be found to the Kuril islands problem. [IL GIORNALE] Should Osimo be annulled? [Caputo] I believe we missed the train. The request for annulment should have been made when Slovenia and Croatia were recognized. We must take one step at a time.
