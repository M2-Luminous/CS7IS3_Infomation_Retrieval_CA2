But at the same time, some problems and contradictions in economic life have emerged in another area, which is mainly manifested in the rising contradiction caused by market restraints. Problems such as operating under capacity, sluggish sales, increasing stocks and debts, and decreasing returns have once again plagued enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises, while the number of enterprises where production has stopped or who are operating at half capacity has markedly increased. Judged superficially, these new problems, which have emerged during economic operations, are mainly attributable to the marked shrinkage of the supply of capital in society, and to the fact that enterprises are far from being able to fund themselves; on the other hand, the "two-way squeeze" resulting in a rapid increase in imports and the contraction of medium-term demand has intensified the difficult situation in which enterprises produce and operate. However, judged from a deeper angle, at a time when the macro environment is becoming easier, the repeated occurrence of big increases in losses incurred by enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises, is attributable to the fact that enterprises have not yet formed a bankruptcy mechanism which gets rid of poor performers and allows only the fittest to survive, and this is the crux. Because the process of structural adjustment of assets in stock is rather slow, resource allocation cannot be promptly optimized, and the result is that the state has to support both loss-making and profitable enterprises, leading to the irrational situation in which bad enterprises tie down good enterprises and both good and bad enterprises compete for limited resources. This kind of mechanism, which allows both bad and good enterprises to survive, will inevitably cause a conflict in which resources in society are always in short supply and problems in the market are always acute. So long as this kind of mechanism exists, it is difficult to cast off the currently existing condition in which state-owned enterprises lack adequate vitality and a large number of them are making losses. If we merely increase the money supply in order to solve the conflicts, what follows will be price increase, and eventually we will have to strictly control the total quantity in order to eliminate the problem of inflation. Therefore, forming a mechanism as soon as possible which allows enterprises to go bankrupt is an indispensable link in reducing restraints on the market and resources. Otherwise, if the cause of the illness is not removed, inflation and debt chains will take their turn to enter and leave the stage, and this will inevitably affect the stable development of the economy and could even cause us lose the opportunity for development. Judging from the current situation, although the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law has been implemented for five years, it has often been difficult to shut down enterprises. There are many reasons for the failure to form a mechanism allowing enterprises to go bankrupt. Among the main obstacles, one is restraints due to traditional concepts. Due to a lack of proper understanding of the need to allow good state-owned enterprises to survive and bad ones to disappear, as well as the need to form a bankruptcy mechanism, in practice, a whole set of policies and measures protecting backwardness and allowing both good and bad enterprises to exist has been implemented, and this has insulated state-owned enterprises from the bankruptcy mechanism. Second, restraints from the old system. On the one hand, the ownership of enterprises is ambiguous; superficially they are owned by the whole people, but actually no one is responsible for them, and the operators of enterprises can hardly promptly handle the assets of enterprises according to objective needs, bad enterprises cannot be sold, and good enterprises cannot be purchased, and this inevitably affects enterprise bankruptcy. On the other hand, there are barriers between higher and lower levels, between regions, and between ownership systems, everyone has a say in deciding whether a state-owned enterprise should live or die, and they refuse to allow it to change its ancillary relations easily. In addition, inequalities in taxation and pricing policies often lead to a situation where state-owned enterprises shoulder many burdens of a state policy nature, and there are no common bench marks for enterprises which are not subject to the restraints of the state's mandatory policies, and this has made it impossible for enterprises' returns to really reflect good or bad operational conditions in enterprises. Third, restraints from social security. For a long time, we have not admitted the existence of an unemployment problem under socialist conditions, therefore, we have not established a series of social security systems, such as unemployment insurance, old age insurance, and medical insurance. As a result, burdens in these areas have to be shouldered mainly by enterprises themselves. It is often very difficult to solve this kind of problem, which is caused by history. At present, the country is still not in a comfortable financial condition, and, for a short period to come, cannot completely shoulder the social security obligations if enterprises go bankrupt. Fourth, restraints from the production structure. At present, among enterprises which really have to go bankrupt according to the law of our country, many are producing excess products, and their ability to change production capacity is low. For example, although many military enterprises need readjustment, their production capacity cannot be easily transformed into a capacity which is badly needed in society, therefore, there is no way they can go bankrupt. In addition, the overdevelopment of the processing industry is another problem, because many enterprises are duplicating low-standard construction; in fact, their assets have lost value in society, and, after going bankrupt, they cannot spare effective resources. On the contrary, society has to spend a portion of new resources to protect them. Since the input-output process has low returns, it is better to keep them rather than to close them. Fifth, restraints from the legal system. Enterprise bankruptcy involves transferring assets and debts, but, at present, the asset assessment and transaction order and the debt settlement order are not standardized, and sound protection by the legal system is not in place. Therefore, it is still difficult to perform various tasks relating to enterprise bankruptcy in a prompt and orderly fashion. To conclude, at present, there are many factors restraining the bankruptcy of state-owned enterprises, but the most important ones are obstacles in terms of concepts and systems. Therefore, to form a mechanism as soon as possible which allows enterprises to go bankrupt, we must proceed from reform and realize and perfect it during reform. First, we must change the functions of government as soon as possible and realize the running of society by the government. Only when we can grasp the building of a social security system and a reemployment mechanism, remove various unequal policies and conditions as soon as possible, and return the duties and functions of running society from enterprises to the government so as to allow state-owned enterprises to unload their burdens, can we then make it possible for enterprise to go bankrupt. Second, we must firmly grasp innovation in the enterprise system to make it suit the needs of the market economy. To establish a modern enterprise system and practice corporatization, the crux is to straighten out property rights relations and cast off a situation where the government is not separated from enterprises, and only by doing so can we really form a mechanism allowing enterprises to go bankrupt. Third, we must build an assets transaction market as soon as possible and create conditions for the flow of enterprise assets after they go bankrupt. When enterprises go bankrupt, there has to be an assets transaction market as protection, for it would be difficult to effectively promote enterprise bankruptcy if only the government's actions are relied on; we must also use the strength of market and rely on market rules to carry out fair competition and transactions to enable bankruptcy to become a natural phenomenon. For this reason, we must step up work in formulating standardized market transaction regulations to safeguard orderly transaction behavior, protect legal interests, and crack down on illegal phenomena. Fourth, we must properly direct public opinion, publicize the objective necessity of enterprise bankruptcy through the mass media, and change the influence of traditional concepts. A correct direction for public opinion is the "catalyst" for correct psychological expectations and behavioral norms, and doing this job well is helpful to the smooth promulgation of various reform measures. Fifth, we must adhere to the principle of active and steady work and solidly promote an enterprise bankruptcy system. Because the direct reason for enterprise bankruptcy in our country at this time when the system is changing track is very different from the reasons for enterprise bankruptcy under the conditions of a typical market economy, therefore, bankruptcy has to embody the principle of the market economy on one hand, and suit China's conditions on the other hand, and we must operate prudently when handling bankruptcy, design scientifically, and reduce various negative effects to the minimum. We can study whether we can build an early warning system for bankruptcy, and by so doing we may, on the one hand, cause bankruptcy pressures on enterprises so they will build self- restraining mechanisms and quicken their pace toward the market, and, on the other hand, enable the state to have a general idea of the quantity of losses which have been incurred by enterprises over the years and which have to be handled by way of bankruptcy to provide scientific data for macroregulation and control on the restrained release of the negative effects to society of enterprise bankruptcy.
