This is stated in a letter from Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali which was distributed here today as a Security Council document. "The situation in Abkhazia and in the Republic of Georgia remains very tense and there is a continuing threat of fresh bloodshed. The fact that there are still over 250,000 refugees and displaced persons there means that no eventuality can be ruled out. This includes the possibility that elements which are not under the control of either side could destabilize the situation," A. Kozyrev noted. The minister pointed out that although the international community realizes that a peace-keeping operation in the Abkhaz region "is indispensable," it has been reluctant to adopt a decision on forming a UN force for peacekeeping in Abkhazia, on the grounds that "conditions are not ripe" yet. "However, as far as the peacekeeping operation is concerned, the time factor has now become critical if peace is to be secured and the necessary conditions created for further progress toward a political settlement," A. Kozyrev stressed. He recalled that in the agreement on a cease-fire and disengagement of forces, which was signed in Moscow on 14 May, the Georgian and Abkhaz sides appealed to the Council of CIS Heads of State to adopt a decision on the use of collective peacekeeping forces in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. Furthermore, the parties sent a special appeal to President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, who is chairman of the Council. "Acting on the basis of Chapter XIII of the UN Charter, the commonwealth decided to send collective forces to the conflict zone for a period of six months. An advance party, consisting of Russian forces already stationed in Abkhazia, is being deployed right away," the document says. It points out: "The commonwealth is not seeking to take the place of UN efforts, but to help create the best possible conditions for them to work. Therefore, it is important to establish, right from the outset, close cooperation between the peace-keeping forces and the UN observer mission in Georgia. We hope the Security Council will decide to increase the strength of this mission and to expand and clarify its mandate." Russia expressed hope that the establishment under UN auspices of a special voluntary fund to finance peacekeeping operations in Abkhazia "will help to attract a wide range of states to peacekeeping work."
