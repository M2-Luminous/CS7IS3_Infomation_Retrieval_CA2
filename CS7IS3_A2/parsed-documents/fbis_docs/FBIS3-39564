On 29 September the Commission presented a proposal, on the initiative of Mr. Marin, for a negotiating mandate aimed at concluding a new agreement to take the place of the more limited cooperation agreement concluded in 1975 as part of the European Community's overall Mediterranean policy. This proposal reflected a desire to upgrade EC-Israel relations to take account of new developments in international relations: The single market, the treaty on European Union, the creation of the European Economic Area [EEA] and the new partnership agreements the community has proposed to the Maghreb countries. This process was given fresh impetus by the signing on 13 September of the declaration of principles between Israel and the PLO. On 21 December the Council of the European Union formally approved the negotiating mandate which Mr. Marin has today presented to the Israeli authorities. Following the meeting on 17 February with Israeli Foreign Minister Mr. Shimon Peres, Mr. Marin said: "The negotiations that have got under way today mark a new departure which will bolster the measures to bring about peace in the region and help forge closer links between the European Union and Israel." In the wake of Mr. Marin's visit the technical negotiations on the new agreement between the two sides are to start with a view to concluding it as soon as possible in 1994. The salient points of the new negotiating mandate approved by the Council are: - protection of human rights and democracy to be an essential element of the agreement; - extension of free trade to services, making for a better balance of trade between the Community and Israel; - liberalization of public procurement, with reciprocal access; - the possibility of associating Israel with the Community's framework research and development program, an area in which cooperation has been under way since 1983 and one of considerable interest to both sides; - community support for cooperation projects involving Israel and other countries in the region; - a wider and more structured political dialogue between the European Union and Israel; - a raft of other cooperation measures in areas such as energy, the environment and curbing drug trafficking. The new agreement with Israel is also important for the contribution it will make to the union's backing for the Middle East peace process. The Commission presented its new overall approach on the Middle East in its communication of 8 September 1993. A balanced approach by the Union to the countries of this region will also be reflected in efforts to create conditions for a satisfactory level of economic development in the Occupied Territories and foster economic development in the region as a whole. Support for regional cooperation between all partners in the Middle East will be complemented by stepping up the dialogue between the Union and each of the countries concerned.
