The government's door for negotiations is open. They should talk to the minister of state for finance to remove differences, doubts, and suspicion as he is in charge of the budget. Talking to newsmen in Islamabad today, the prime minister said the people's government does not want to burden the poor and the middle class and it is for this reasons that taxes have been imposed on the upper class. She said the business community should take into account various incentives and concessions given in the budget. In this connection, she referred to withdrawal of import duty and reduction in tariff rates. However, she declared, the government will not succumb to any pressure or blackmail. She said the government has taken measures aimed at reducing dependence on bank loans. She said for the 1993-94 budget, 60 billion rupees were borrowed from the State Bank. In the new budget, bank borrowing has been curtailed to 15 billion rupees only. This will reduce the budget deficit and enhance industrialization. The prime minister said the business community is not opposed to the budgetary measures, rather they are averse to the government's decision to file wealth tax returns along with income tax returns. She said in the United Kingdom, India, and other countries, if someone is found concealing his income he has to pay 10 times the evaded amount. If the business community comes to the negotiations, then we can start with penalties four times of the amount evaded and would gradually increase it to 10 times. But, if they carry on with their strike call, then we will enforce penalties 10 times the amount at once. The prime minister said the government wants everybody to pay tax according to capacity because the prevalent system taxes the poor but does not bring the rich into the tax net. She said the government has initiated a moral crusade against tax evasion. She said: [Begin Bhutto recording] I do not believe the community's strike is to going to be effective. I believe that they are going to strike and it will peter out. And I believe that the reforms that we have introduced are necessary for transforming Pakistan into a modern nation state. We cannot be a nation of borrowers. We cannot be a nation which lives beyond our means. We cannot be a nation that goes on increasing our deficit and paying our government salaries through borrowing. (?It has) to stop. And what we have to do is generate employment and reduce inflation for which we have taken steps. [end recording] The minister of state for finance, Makhdum Shahabuddin, has said the claim of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry [FPCCI] that the government will suffer a loss of 18 billion rupees per day if the federation's demands are not met resulting in a two-day strike is false, exaggerated, and alarmist. In a statement issued in Islamabad today, Makhdum Shahabuddin said it is clear that the strike, the success of which is questionable, will not affect agriculture, the principal productive sector of the economy, or energy or mining. He said even if it is assumed that the entire manufacturing and trade sector shuts down, which is virtually impossible, the loss to the economy would not amount to around 1.5 billion rupees per day. These irresponsible estimates of the FPCCI are meant to alarm the public, cause panic, and pressurize the government into taking action which may not be in the best interest of the country. Makhdum Shahabuddin said the federation is not serving the true interests of its constituents or the country by resorting to confrontation, alarmist predictions, campaign to break the law, and obstructing constructive dialogue on the budget between the government and trade and industry.
