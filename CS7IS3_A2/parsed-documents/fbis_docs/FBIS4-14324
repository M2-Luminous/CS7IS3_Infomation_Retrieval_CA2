The proposal suggests that during the first stage, Syria be given sovereignty and control over the four Druze settlements on the Golan Heights. Our correspondents Nati Zilberman and Hayim Hecht report that the Druze villagers on the Golan Heights are already preparing for such a possibility. Officials at the Prime Minister's Office, at the Foreign Ministry, and in the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] denied any plans for a withdrawal from Majdal Shams first. Our correspondents nevertheless report that the maps prepared by the General Staff contain several possible options for the transfer of the Druze villages to Syrian control.
