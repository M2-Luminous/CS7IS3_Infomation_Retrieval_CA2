FR941121-0-00132 FR941121-0-00014 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 931199&hyph;4042; I.D. 111094A] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Modification of a closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is opening directed fishing for Pacific cod in the Western Regulatory Area in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) by vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component. This action is necessary to fully utilize the allocation of the total allowable catch (TAC) of Pacific cod in the Western Regulatory Area specified for vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), November 19, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. In accordance with ยง672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B) the allocation of Pacific cod in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA for vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component was established by the 1994 specifications of groundfish harvest (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) as 14,967 metric tons (mt). The directed fishery for Pacific cod by the inshore component closed on March 8, 1994 (59 FR 11209, March 10, 1994). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that, as of October 22, 1994, 500 mt of the TAC of Pacific cod for the inshore component in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA remains unharvested. This amount is in excess of the amount necessary as incidental catch by vessels using pot or jig gear in other groundfish fisheries. Directed fishing for groundfish by vessels using hook-and-line or trawl gear is prohibited, because the allocations of Pacific halibut bycatch mortality for those gears have been reached. Therefore, NMFS is terminating the closure and is opening directed fishing for Pacific cod in the Western GOA by vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component effective at 12 noon, A.l.t., November 19, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. All other closures remain in full force and effect. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: November 15, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
