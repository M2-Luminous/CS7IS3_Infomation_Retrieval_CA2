We spoke to Augustin Kontchous, spokesman for the Cameroon Government and communications minister: [Begin Kontchous recording] We on the Cameroonian side do not want to see the crisis escalate, but we do not control all the factors. We cannot do anything about the Nigerian position. The Nigerians came and occupied a part of Cameroonian territory. The Cameroonian Armed Forces are on the ground to prevent the Nigerians from going any further. We cannot see in what way the French could complicate the situation. For a start, the French are not present in the theater of operations, they are far from the theater of operations. It is in case the Nigerians were to make the situation worse that perhaps the French would [word indistinct], not perhaps, certainly. France would implement the defense accords that exist between Cameroon and France. None of this is very good in the current world context. Like yesterday, we do not see what would be the use of bellicose spirits, of war. Perhaps this bellicose mobilization has aims other than war itself. We do not know. [end recording]
