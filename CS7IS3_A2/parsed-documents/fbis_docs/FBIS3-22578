This incident took place two months before the international AIDS day when the media were informing people all around the world about this fatal disease. The effort of this Karachi patient to commit suicide is considered an example of the lack of education in Pakistan. Both people and AIDS patients are careless about this deadly disease. The Karachi lady was found by a relative who had come there by chance for a visit and saved her life. This woman had seen two members of her family die. The bad luck of this woman began when her drug addict husband learned he had the deadly virus. In 1986 it was confirmed that this woman's husband had that poisonous virus, and he finally died of it. He had transferred the deadly virus to his wife and eight-year-old son before he died. A bigger problem than this is that our society does not accept AIDS patients, and the public attitude toward AIDS patients is very hostile and deplorable. Mr. Shaukat Ali, a social worker helping AIDS patients, said that it is important to look after AIDS patients; however, no attention is given to them. The people do not know much about the HIV positive condition; although, it is very dangerous. According to Dr. Sayyed Abdulmajib, the tendency to commit suicide by AIDS patients is the same around the world, and to reduce their suicide rate we must pay attention to them. People should change their attitude. They should know that the AIDS virus is not transferred by shaking hands or kissing, and AIDS patients cannot transfer this sickness to another. No part of the world is safe from this peril and its only solution is education. There is no cure for it. This disease came to Pakistan seven years ago. The number of patients is increasing continuously here, and it has tripled now. The number of HIV patients has reached 251 now, while in 1991 there were only 90 patients.
