The key questions, in our view, are the following: Why was it deemed both possible and necessary to include President William Clinton directly in the propaganda campaign immediately launched by Washington? It is possible to recall a fair number of spy scandals which have erupted in the United States in recent decades, including the affair of the Walkers, father and son, for working with whom Oleg Kalugin, if you believe the former general of Soviet intelligence, was handsomely decorated. But not one of these affairs was advertised at such a high level as the presidency. Even Ronald Reagan, who never missed an opportunity to have a fling at the intrigues of the "Evil Empire," was not actively involved in the public exposure and condemnation of the Walker family, who inflicted extremely ample damage on the United States. So why was Clinton dragged in, although it was perfectly possible to restrict things to a statement by the director of the FBI or the bureau's direct chief, the attorney general? Was it not in order to stress with especial authority Washington's dissatisfaction with Moscow's actions? Probably this is so. But surely Moscow, in carrying out intelligence operations against the United States, was not doing anything different to what the United States engages in in Russia? Surely Washington will not really try to prove that it does not recruit its own intelligence agents, or that, in doing so, it places a special premium on holders of secrets of extreme importance, and consequently, on our intelligence and counterintelligence agents? IZVESTIYA has already carried a brief report on the recent arrest of a certain Russian citizen who inflicted the same sort of damage on our interests as Penkovskiy once inflicted on the Soviet Union. According to the information at our disposal, either the Americans or their traditional intelligence partners, the British, had been working with the new "Penkovskiy" -- it was the British, let us recall, who recruited the original Penkovskiy, and later wooed him together with the CIA. Competent sources clearly intimate that they see a direct link between the arrest of the neo-Penkovskiy and the exposure of the CIA official: It is a sort of retaliatory action, they told me. An action all the more serious, let me stress, for the U.S. President's being directly involved. What lies behind this? Theories are being voiced that the arrest of Ames is a response not only to the arrest of the spy in Russia, but also to the boldness displayed by Moscow in the Balkans, a boldness which for the first time in recent years cast the United States into a secondary role in world politics. By the sensationalism of the Ames affair, by direct hints that very swift and sincere apologies are expected from Moscow, as if spying were an exclusively Russian activity, we are pretty clearly given to understand: Just you know your place. There is, however, some hope in Russian intelligence sources that the Ames affair will not cancel out all the productive and useful elements that have developed in recent years in relations between the Russian and U.S. special services. It would be a pity, my sources told me, if these relations were now undermined. And a final point. However you look at it, the main credit for exposing Ames belongs to American-style Pavel Morozovs [Soviet archetype of someone who informs against his own relatives]. After all, it was Ames' neighbors, staggered by the inordinate expenses of this civil servant on an ordinary salary, who drew him to the attention of the "competent organs." And after that it was all a matter of technology, with which the U.S. counterintelligence agency is handsomely equipped. One cannot fail to mention that, in the previous sensational affair -- that of the Walker family -- the role of exposer belonged to the mother and former wife of the spying duo. State interest transcend personal and even family interests; this is roughly how she explained to reporters the motives of her action, which, it must be said, was absolutely typical of the realities of American society.
