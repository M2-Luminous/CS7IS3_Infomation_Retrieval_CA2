The enemy opened tank, howitzer, and machine gun fire from his military base in (Garadash) in Tauzskiy Rayon on Movses and Aygepar and the defensive positions around these villages in Tavushskiy Rayon between 1830-2030. There are injured among the peaceful population. The Azerbaijani armed formations at Dhzafarli military base in Kazakhskiy Rayon opened intensive artillery fire on Aygehovit and Vazashen in Idzhevanskiy Rayon at around 1900. Half an hour later, a large enemy infantry formation, supported by tanks, tried to break through the Armenian defensive lines and invade Aygehovit. Following fierce battles, the Armenia's border guards managed to halt and then repulse the enemy's surprise tank attack. There are losses on both sides, and material destruction in Aygehovit and Vazashen. Two Azerbaijani bombers flying low over Karabakh airspace intruded on the Armenian Republic's airspace at around 2228. Azerbaijani planes dropped two bombs on Goris and another two on Kapan. They flew off over southern part of Karabakh. The Armenian air-defense forces could not retaliate effectively because the planes were flying low. We have not yet received any information on today's situation on borders and in Nagorno-Karabakh.
