In Lusaka, there is much expectation on the debate regarding the installation of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and its high officials. Despite the fact that their differences have been narrowed, the government and UNITA negotiators are still meeting alone in the search for a solution for accommodations for Jonas Savimbi's organization and its senior leaders. This afternoon's meeting began at 1700 and has not yet been concluded. That is why there is great expectation about the meeting. We may give more details about the meeting soon. Meanwhile, UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye and members of the troika of observers are ready to leave for Cape Town, South Africa. They will leave the Zambian capital early morning tomorrow. In South Africa, the special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola and his team will request assistance from President Nelson Mandela with the Angolan peace talks, taking advantage of his influence and the prestige enjoyed by the new president of that country.
