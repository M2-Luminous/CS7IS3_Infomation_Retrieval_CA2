The explosion occurred when the train was passing the Georgian Marneuli region mainly populated by the Azeris. The statement says trains and engineering railroad facilities have been blasted 20 times and the gas pipeline - 12 times in the area since last year. Acts of sabotage staged against Armenia on territory of that region and terrorist acts against civilians, this time against train passengers, leave no doubts as regards the aims and forces organizing the actions, stresses the document. Violating all international legal norms, the Azeri side chose the Georgian region populated by Azeris for fulfilment of its goals in order to involve Armenia and Georgia in the conflict, says the statement. In the opinion of the Armenian side, international terrorism, which has grown into barbarity, must be stopped. At the same time, the Armenian Government will take all measures to ensure safety of its citizens and protect national interests. In that case all the responsibility for further aggravation of the situation will rest on the Azeri side, says the statement. The Armenian Government hopes the Georgian authorities will take measures to ensure safety of communications to Armenia via Georgian territory.
