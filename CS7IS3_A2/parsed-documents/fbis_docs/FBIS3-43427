The government negotiating team and the group of observers in the peace process are already present in the Zambian capital on the date set for the resumption of talks -- 5 January. There is no confirmation of the presence in Lusaka of the UNITA negotiating team, however. Faustino Muteka from the government delegation who left for Lusaka yesterday, accompanied by his colleagues, said on departure that the government delegation has powers to negotiate everything. UN special representative Alioune Blondin Beye has concluded his visits to some African countries and left for the Zambian capital today. Zimbabwe, Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, Gabon, and Zaire are the countries whose presidents were contacted by Alioune Blondin Beye during the break in the peace talks. Before leaving for Lusaka, Alioune Blondin Beye gave assurances that the peace talks would begin this afternoon. Alioune Blondin Beye focused his statements, however, on contacts he held in the countries mentioned above. [Begin Beye recording] The objective was as usual aimed at making use of the exceptional advantages that these countries possess. As you know, the delegations from the government and UNITA are already in Lusaka. I am very happy with this situation because the news media organs gave other reasons for the break in the peace talks. Fortunately, the government and UNITA acted differently. I have, therefore, held contacts with the heads of state of Zimbabwe, Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, Gabon, and Zaire. There were two objectives for these visits -- first to brief them on [words indistinct] support for the peace talks. [end recording]
