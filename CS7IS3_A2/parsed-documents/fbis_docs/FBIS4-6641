FBIS4-6641 "dreas077_a_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-077 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Watanabe Views Ozawa, Conservative Coalition Watanabe Views Ozawa, Conservative Coalition OW2004015194 Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese 1010 GMT 19 Apr 94 OW2004015194 Tokyo NHK General Television Network Japanese BFN [Interview with former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe by NHK Political News Department correspondent Koike; place and date not given -- recorded] [Text] [Watanabe] I believe that the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] alone cannot take power. Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the Japan New Party [JNP] alone also cannot take power. I am in agreement with the policies of Shinseito and the Japan New Party, and Komeito [Clean Government Party] appears to be agreeing with their policies. My agreement with those policies can pave the way for forging a conservative coalition, and this is the best option under the present political situation. Forging such a conservative coalition will serve the interests of our nation. The coalition partners so far have placed importance on making a distinction between the LDP and the non-LDP, and their attitude has stood in the way of forging such a conservative coalition. I have intended to play a role in rallying conservative political parties that share the same political beliefs. I have thought that this is an ideal approach. To play such a role, I have to form a new political party after quitting the LDP. Political parties that share the same policies should forge an alliance after putting aside their past grudges and ill feelings. I still believe that this is the best way. [Koike] Mr. Watanabe, there is a belief that you may have ridden the wave of Ozawa's strategy. [Watanabe] I do not think that I have ridden the wave of his strategy. I have acted in accordance with my own beliefs. [Koike] Mr. Watanabe, in recent days you have made twists and turns. How do you assess Mr. Ozawa? [Watanabe] Mr. Ozawa and I share completely identical policies, and I trust him. [Koike] Would you comment on his artifice [chibo]? [Watanabe] Artifice and the way of getting things done differ from person to person. I think that Mr. Ozawa is a decisive man and a man of action. He is a wonderful man. If he relies excessively on his artifice, this would cause problems. I am an old man. I value relationships with other people as much as possible. I always hope to get along well with other people. Mr. Ozawa and I do not necessarily share the same artifice. [Koike] Do you still have the desire to become prime minister? [Watanabe] I intend to fulfill my desire as long as I serve as a politician. I will keep the desire in mind.
