This was seventh of such escapes involving 187 tourists from China since last September. In the first and largest group escape, 115 Chinese participating in a group tour organized by the Aju Travel Co. fled their hotel in group on Sept. 6 last year. Of the 187 who had fled, only 29 were caught in Suwon and forcibly flown back to China, with the whereabouts of the remainders having been unknown. A police source said the latest 19 escapees were part of the 24 Chinese of a group tour organized by the Tongbo Travel Co. in the Jilin Province, part of the ethnic Koreans' autonomous area in northeastern China. The remaining five of the group were deported on two occasions by Tuesday. After group escapes by Korean-Chinese were reported often late last year, the government has been controlling group visits by ethnic Koreans from China. In the latest case, the 24 visitors produced passports that described them as ethnic Chinese and spoke Chinese only. Immigration officials suspect they were in effect ethnic Koreans who somehow forged their papers to make themselves appear to be ethnic Chinese so as to get entry into Korea.
