FBIS3-10022 "drlat040__a94006" FBIS-LAT-94-040-A Document Type:Daily Report 1 March 1994 ANNEX Brazil Sao Paulo Governor's Presidential Aspirations Viewed PY2202140894 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 21 Feb 94 p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY2202140894 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Language: Portuguese Article Type:BFN [Excerpts] Sao Paulo -- Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury will boycott today's meeting of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] state Executive Board, at which former Governor Orestes Quercia intends to request the party's support for his candidacy for the presidency. Fleury is not a member of the Executive Board and therefore his presence at the meeting is not mandatory. Executive Board Chairman Roberto Rollemberg wanted to take advantage of this meeting to ask Quercia and Fleury to make up their minds about their candidacies. Fleury's strategy is to stall for time so as to avoid giving an answer to Quercia's request to endorse his candidacy. Fleury still dreams about the possibility of being chosen by the PMDB to run for the presidency. He feels his name could be an alternative for the party in light of the rejection of Quercia's candidacy by national leaders and [Deputy] Antonio Britto's [PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul] refusal to stand as a PMDB candidate. [passage omitted] Deputy Luiz Carlos Santos [PMDB-Sao Paulo] -- government leader in the Chamber of Deputies and anti-Quercia -- is a member of the PMDB state Executive Board, but on 20 February did not know whether he would attend the meeting. Santos is scheduled to go to Bandeirantes Palace [Sao Paulo Government House], but he argues that prior commitments in Brasilia will prevent him from participating in both meetings. From the PMDB bloc in the Chamber of Deputies, Luiz Carlos Santos, Jorge Tadeu Mudalen, Ari Kara, Roberto Rollemberg, Wagner Rossi, Walter Nory, and Maurici Mariano are considered faithful to Fleury, whereas Alberto Goldman, Marcelo Barbieri, Paulo Novaes, Carlos Nelson, and Manoel Moreira are considered pro-Quercia. Quercia has a large majority on the executive boards of the interior and in nearly 300 municipalities.
