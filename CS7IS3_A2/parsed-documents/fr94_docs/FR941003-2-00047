FR941003-2-00047 FR941003-2-00032 Education and Service Linkage As part of its long-range planning, HRSA will be targeting its efforts to strengthening linkages between U.S. Public Health Service education programs and programs which provide comprehensive primary care services to the underserved. Smoke-Free Workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. Other Considerations In addition, funding factors may be applied in determining funding of approved applications. A funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other categories or groups of approved applications in a discretionary program, or favorable adjustment of the formula which determines the grant award in a formula grant program. It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. Statutory General Preference All of the Family Medicine Training grant programs are subject to the statutory general preference. As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, statutory preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ (A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This statutory preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of proposals recommended for approval by the peer review group. For Grants for Predoctoral Training in Family Medicine, the following definitions apply: High rate is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates of the medical school in academic year 1989&hyph;90 or 1990&hyph;91. Significant increase in the rate means that the rate of placing academic year 1990&hyph;91 graduates in the specified settings is at least 50 percent higher than the rate of placing academic year 1989&hyph;90 graduates in such settings and that not less than 15 percent of academic year 1990&hyph;91 graduates are working in these areas. Academic years 1989&hyph;90 and 1990&hyph;91 are used because they are the two most recent years that medical school graduates would have entered practice following the completion of residency training. For Grants for Graduate Training in Family Medicine, the following definitions apply: High rate is defined as a minimum of 25 percent of combined graduates of the residency training program in academic years 1991&hyph;92 through 1993&hyph;94. Significant increase in the rate means that, between academic years 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94, the rate of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in these areas. For Grants for Family Medicine Faculty Development, the following definitions apply: High rate is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of faculty development/fellowship program graduates in academic year 1992&hyph;93 or academic year 1993&hyph;94, whichever is greater, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in the specified settings. Significant increase in the rate means that, between academic years 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94, the rate of placing faculty development/fellowship program graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of the academic year 1993&hyph;1994 graduates are working in these areas.
