I am strongly convinced of that," Belarusian Foreign Minister Pyotr Krawchenko, currently here on an official visit, told ITAR-TASS today. Speaking of results of his Bonn negotiations, Krawchenko said "the visit has been prepared for over a year and very thoroughly. We have signed two very important documents in Bonn, including the memorandum on interaction in overcoming Chernobyl consequences. "Belarus is the first state to conclude such an agreement with a leading European nation. Paradoxically, many countries avoided cooperation on the issue at the interstate level. This memorandum is the first document of the sort. In fact, charity exceeded the assistance Belarus received through state channels. Germany is the leader in this respect, 40 per cent of charity aid is its." Asked about 1994 meetings between German and Belarusian leaders, Krawchenko stressed "we have discussed a possibility of German visit of Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. I hope the visit will be held in 1994. Its precise date has not been specified as Germany is expected to have 19 elections, including parliamentary, this year. It will be hard to find time for the visit in the near future."
