According to data supplied by the China Materials Information Center, as of the third quarter, the following adjustments had been made with the approval of the state departments concerned. State Determines Scope of Fixed Price Commodities In 1993 state fixed prices were retained for approximately 33 product categories. 1. Coal: Raw coal, mixed coal, bitumenite, and powdered coal (including washed coal and washed refined coal) produced by mines under central control and local mines brought under central control. 2. Electric Power: State unified fixed price electric net and locally produced electricity. Thermoelectricity produced by thermoelectric plants under state controlled investment. 3. Petroleum: Natural crude oil, natural gas, oilfield liquified gas, gasoline (including central first class station adjusted allocated price and 73 centrally managed market sale priced), kerosene, diesel, heavy oil, and refinery gaseous naphtha. 4. Chemical Industry: Dimethylbenzene and urea and agricultural use nitroammonium produced by designated enterprises (including the portion under unified selling price). Special Railroad Use Steel Material Adjusted Price The State Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the State Planning Commission from 1 August determined the adjusted state unified producer price of such steel materials for special railroad use as heavy rails, wheels, tires, and fish-tail [switching] panels. The price after adjustment is implemented without distinguishing between products in the plan and those outside the plan. The adjusted per ton prices of heavy rails (GB2585-81) are: 38 kilogram/meter: U71, 3,450 yuan; U74, 3,480 yuan; U71Mn, 3,570 yuan; U70MnSi, 3,680 yuan; 43 kilogram/meter: U71, 3,420 yuan; U74, 3,450 yuan; U71Mn, 3,540 yuan; U70MnSi, 3,650 yuan; and 50 kilogram/meter: U71, 3,380 yuan; U74, 3,410 yuan; U71Mn, 3,500 yuan; U70MnSi, 3,600 yuan. The producer prices for each wheel with external diameters of 840mm, 915mm, and 950mm are 1,580 yuan, 1,840 yuan, and 1,920 yuan, respectively. The per ton producer prices of tires with external diameters of 660-1,400mm and above are 1,030 yuan, 1,150 yuan, 1,420 yuan, 1,750 yuan, and 1,880 yuan, respectively. The per ton price for fish-tail [switching] panels with specifications of 22, 38, 43, and 50 kilograms per meter is adjusted to 3,500 yuan. All Lead and Zinc Mines Float Up the Prices of Zinc Ore Concentrate in the Plan The producer price of zinc ore concentrate in the plan has been lowered because of the effect of market supply and demand. Also the effects of rising prices for electric power and railroad transportation and higher bank loan interest rates have caused the mines' economic performance to seriously decline. To ensure that the task of turning over zinc ore concentrate is completed for 1993, with the agreement of the State Planning Commission Pricing Department, in 1993 the price of zinc ore concentrate in the plan can be floated up 5 percent on the basis of the [1993] number 169 jiagong [price and label;0116 1562] fixed price. The price of zinc ore concentrate produced by other zinc ore concentrate enterprises within the plan also can be implemented based on the stipulations given above. This was implemented from 1 August 1993. Jilin Papermill Adjusts Up the Price of Newsprint Outside the Plan Beginning this year, the production costs of a series of newsprint products outside the plan has greatly increased because of such factors as the constantly rising price of lumber and upward adjustment in energy and railroad transportation fees and it is difficult for the enterprises to absorb them. To maintain newsprint enterprises' normal production of newsprint, the Jilin papermill, from 10 July, adjusted the producer price of a series of newsprint products in accordance with relevant regulations. From 10 July 1993, 51 gram common newsprint is 3,800 yuan per ton; 49 gram offset print newsprint is 4,000 yuan per ton; special class-A offset print newsprint is 4,150 yuan per ton; and 45 gram offset print newsprint is 4,250 yuan per ton. State Tax Rate on Finished Oil and Some Chemical Industry Products To adapt to new reforms in crude oil prices, the Ministry of Finance has decided to adjust current tax rates and methods of levying taxes on finished oil and some chemical industry products. Generally product taxes are levied on finished oil produced by petrochemical enterprises in accordance with actual sales income. Finished oil product tax rates have been adjusted to 10 percent for gasoline, kerosene, lubricating oil, and solvent oil; 8 percent for diesel, tar, and other refined oils; and 3 percent for heavy oil, naphtha, and chemical industry light oil and other unfinished oils. The product tax levy on gasoline, kerosene, and diesel produced from crude oil not in the unified plan is temporarily lowered to 5 percent in 1993, and the product tax on solid paraffin, liquid paraffin, pitch, petroleum tar, petroleum benzene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, butadiene rubber, acrylonitrite rubber, and nylon 66 has been temporarily reduced to 10 percent. The State Has Decided To Temporarily Reduce the Levy on Caustic Soda Products In recent year, costs have increased for caustic soda producing enterprises because of the rising prices of raw and auxiliary materials, leading to a rather large number of enterprises experiencing losses. Out of concern for the actual difficulties of caustic soda enterprises and to support the development of their production, after study by the State Tax Bureau and relevant departments, on 9 June of this year, a notice was issued determining a temporary reduction of the tax rate on caustic soda products to 12 percent (formerly set at 15 percent). The notice also stipulated that after the temporary reduction of the tax rate to 12 percent, no localities could further open up tax reductions or exemptions.
