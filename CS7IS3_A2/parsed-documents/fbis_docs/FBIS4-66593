At the time of the Raphel controversy, the official aide memoire had not only characterised the American position as being a "qualitative shift" but "an excessively negative policy assertion." If an assistant secretary's remarks had occasioned such strong language, it is indeed surprising that the American president's own record of insensitivity to Indian concerns are meriting such polite responses. The press statement issued in New Delhi on Wednesday, in fact, goes out of its way to signal to the United States that while something has to be said about President Clinton's tendency to appear to be rooting for Pakistan, the United States need not take it amiss because as it notes "India shares President Clinton's strong interest in reducing tension in South Asia ..." In the light of the comfort that anti-Indian elements in Kashmir and Punjab have got from the president's remarks beginning with his lumping Kashmir as an area where civil war was taking place, to his expression of common concern over human rights in that state with the country which has supplied the insurgents there with direction, training and weapons, South Block's pussilanimity is bound to encourage rather than discourage the White House in persisting with its tilt. There can be no doubt of the encouragement that the remarks will give to sundry terrorists, insurgents and nations like Pakistan who have a grouse against India. Remarkably, the Indian response has failed to highlight the major gap in President Clinton's remarks as well as what ought to be the major thrust of its own policy pinpointing the role of Pakistan as an abettor of state-sponsored terrorism. New Delhi's failure in convincing America, and indeed the world, of this is not because it lacks evidence of Pakistani actions, but that it is unable to find courage to express its outrage at events like the Bombay blasts, or the continued support for cross-border terrorism from Pakistan. Though 1993, especially after a series of statements and actions from Washington D.C., began to indicate that a pro-Pakistan tilt was emerging, officials in New Delhi have been advocating that India turn the other check so as to move ahead on an agenda which benefits India such as trade, investment, technology transfer and even a dialogue on non-proliferation issues. Unfortunately, they have permitted the United States to push its own skewed agenda which is being perceived by many to be inimical to India's sovereignty. Instead of finessing India's most important, and in a sense, difficult relationship, South Block seems to be responding in a confused and ad hoc fashion which is only likely to see increased American meddling since no one has bothered to spell out any Indian bottom line in its relationship with the United States till now. A major weakness of the Indian response has been its excessively defensive tone. In the world of realpolitik it signifies that either India is weak or that its case is. Considering the access being given to foreign diplomats, and most recently the International Red Cross to visit Kashmir, such a posture towards Washington appears strange. India is involved in fighting a difficult battle in Kashmir. Foreigners, including Americans who have seen the difficulties faced in Somalia and Bosnia are reacting not so much to India's record, which is middling-to-bad in Kashmir, but its defensiveness, which in some eyes betokens a weakness which can be exploited. Almost egregiously, Wednesday's statement has made claims on India's nuclear posture that require some clarification from the government. In responding to its observation that "Pakistan's nuclear intentions are well-known and confirmed time and again," the statement declares "India neither has nor intends to acquire weapons of mass destruction." This is an extraordinarily definitive statement which appears to be at variance with the much more ambiguous, and therefore deterrent, posture adopted by the government till now that it will do whatever needed for the defence of the country, and its unstated belief that its unsafeguarded nuclear power programme and proven nuclear capacity are its real insurance against nuclear adventurism, not brave words.
