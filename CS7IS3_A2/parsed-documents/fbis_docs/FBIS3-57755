As the Kazakh minister Sagan Nurmukhametov told newsmen after the session, the sides signed a protocol on mutual assistance and on republican resources for their armies' logistic supplies. He stressed that the meeting least of all meant secession from the CIS Collective Security Treaty. On the contrary, he said, its results will contribute to broader cooperation between the collective security pact members. As Uzbek Defense Minister Rustam Akhmedov remarked, the consultations pave the way for closer ties between the three Central Asian states in anti-aircraft defense and in other fields. He voiced hope that Russia would join the alliance, since it was interested in reinforcing its southern borders more than any other state. The Uzbek and Kyrgyz ministers also signed a bilateral cooperation accord for 1994.
