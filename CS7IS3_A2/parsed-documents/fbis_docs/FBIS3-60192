Dhar] [Text] New Delhi, 11 Jan -- Pakistan's continued interference in the internal situation in Afghanistan and the guns-for-drugs policy of its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is a major factor contributing to renewed outbreak of civil war in Afghanistan. Most countries, including India, having been forced to vacate their missions in Kabul. Details are available, through diplomatic sources, of the extent of outside interference and the part played by the drug barons with disastrous consequences for the war-ravaged country which is finding it impossible to return to normalcy. India, like other countries, had reopened its mission in Kabul after the Jalalabad accord as a result of which Prof. Borhanoddin Rabbani was installed President and Mr. Golboddin Hekmatyar as Prime Minister. During the U.S-backed anti-Soviet operations in Afghanistan, Mr. Hekmatyar operated entirely from Pakistan territory and in the installation of the Rabbani-Hekmatyar team, the Pakistanis and the Saudis felt confident that a regime which would be dictated to by them had been put in place. Most countries now seem to feel that outside interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs, including arms supplies the Mojahedin groups, must stop and the people should be allowed to take charge of their affairs and elect their representatives on the basis of a national consensus. Despite Pakistan's backing, Mr. Hekmatyar was unable to function and could not even open his office for fear of retaliation by Ahmad Shah Mas'ud whom he had ousted from the interim Government. With Mas'ud and the Uzbek General Dostam having been pushed out, many countries, including India, had doubted whether the Jalalabad accord would last. They were proved right and Prime Minister Hekmatyar, who has not been officially dismissed by President Rabbani so far despite his having staged a coup against him, has joined forces with his arch rival General Dostam who has several thousand men in arms in the northern region. India shares the concern of the international community at the deterioration in the situation in Afghanistan and feels that a genuine reconciliation must take place and forces of stabilisation, instead of fundamentalism, should be encouraged to take charge of affairs and helped materially to undertake the task of economic reconstruction. Under the Jalalabad accord, President Rabbani and commanders from all 29 provinces were supposed to elect a Defence Minister by 22 July last, but this did not happen and Mr. Mas'ud began mobilising the Pathans for an assault on all centres of power. Mr. Hekmatyar's efforts to wean away his followers did not succeed and with the U.S. having called off its Afghanistan operation, huge sums of money which were once channelled through Pakistan were no longer available. Another factor is the prospect of the Pathans, who constitute about 45 per cent of the country's population losing their dominance in all walks of life. It is also obvious that the self-willing people of Afghanistan who have always fought for their independence, are unwilling to accept the rigidities of Islamic fundamentalism which are sought to be imposed on them by several countries which spent considerable sums of money to finance the war against the Soviets and, later, President Najibollah. With itself fully involved in drug trafficking to raise resources for financing insurgency in other countries, the ISI encouraged the drugs trade which had got disrupted during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The Soviet occupation disrupted old smuggling routes between Afghanistan and Europe via Iran, Turkey and across the Iran-Soviet border. These routes were patronised by itinerant Afghans who traded in everything. The cutting up of these routes deflected much of this trade South and East to Pakistan. The Herati traders no longer went to Mashhad, but southeast to Qandahar and Quetta, south along desert tracks to transhipment point in Balochistan and near the Afghanistan-Pakistan-lran trijunction. The major border tribals--Wazir, Masud, Bhattani, Mangal, Bangash, Orakzai, Afridi, Mohmand, Tarklarnri, Utman Khel--live under their own war-like code of Pakhtunwali, still regard themselves as free peoples, and remain adept at playing Islamabad and Kabul off against each other. They continue to resist the slow processes of the integration with Pakistan, although younger Khans recognise that their desire for electricity, roads and services (education and medicine) will make them more dependent on the Government. The Afghanistan conflict, during which most Pakhtuns supported the Afghan Mojahedin, offered limited opportunities to play Kabul off against Islamabad although the Afridis and Mohmands did try to manipulate the conflict to protect their crossborder smuggling and heroin interests. The ISI has financed insurgency not only in Afghanistan (where the operation was backed by the U.S.), but also in Kashmir with disastrous consequences. President Rabbani has been forced to appeal to several countries to come to his rescue by condemning the coup in all international forums.
