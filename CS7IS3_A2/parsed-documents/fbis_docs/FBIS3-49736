The same text of the aide memoire was presented by Ivan Mjartan, Slovak ambassador in the Czech Republic, to ambassadors of NATO countries residing in Prague. The text of the aide memoire has concurrently been sent to the Slovak Republic's representative missions in NATO member countries and to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner. It states: On the unexplored path of transformation, the countries of Central Europe are facing a number of difficulties and challenges, including the lack of security guarantees. The existing security vacuum and the possible destabilizing impact of negative developments nearby could have a negative influence on democratic structures and the process of economic transformation in this region. The Slovak Republic, like the other countries of the Visegrad Group, has made the vitally important political decision of seeking integration into the European and transatlantic political, economic, and security structures. The Slovak Republic therefore launched a number of diplomatic activities aimed at demonstrating its desire and readiness to be integrated into NATO without needless delay. NATO, as the cornerstone of the European security architecture, has demonstrated its competence and ability in defending democratic gains. The Slovak Republic assumes that the coming NATO summit will mean the beginning of a new stage in building a higher form of partnership with the Visegrad Group countries and will enable the expansion of NATO through the admission of these countries of Central Europe. The Slovak Republic expects the alliance to provide a clear and unequivocal reply to the questions of security of our continent, perceived as particularly acute in our region. The Slovak Republic evaluates highly NATO's Partnership for Peace project, initiated by the U.S. Administration, and is ready to join it and to actively participate in projects and missions within its framework. This project will undoubtedly contribute to a marked intensification of cooperation between the Slovak Republic and NATO and its member countries on political and military issues. The Slovak Republic would like to express its conviction that the NATO summit of January 1994 will realistically assess the present security situation in the new democracies of the Central European region and that the United States and its allies within the framework of the alliance will take into consideration the expectations of these countries regarding NATO membership, will not hesitate, and will offer to the countries of the Visegrad Group NATO membership, thereby reinforcing the general stability in this sensitive part of Europe. In the spirit of the concept of accommodating foreign policy, the Slovak Republic pursues its own national interests--peaceful cooperation based on guaranteed security in its region, freedom of citizens in their democratic state, and economic prosperity.
