Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac that ``the (?Serbian) aggressor continued to attack the front lines of the Bihac region last night and this morning. A particular [word indistinct] is on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Height -- that is, the Hasin Vrh -- where they attempted new infantry breakthroughs, which our defenders managed to reject. Artillery and antiaircraft weapon activity is incessant on the Bihac, Bosanska Krupa, and (Budzin) sections of the front. Sniper activity has become more intensive since this morning and chetnik regroupings have been observed. "There is no peace on the lines of separation with the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomy. In the Cazin regions of Krivaja, Crnac, and Liskovac, they were [word indistinct] with mortar and mountain guns and provoking infantry clashes all the time." The 3d Corps Press Center reports the ``more frequent defeats on the battlefield were a reason for the chetnik artillery to retaliate on the defense lines and civilian targets. This time they recorded a defeat on (Terijsko) battlefield, where fighters of the Bosnian Army repressed them by 1 kilometer at Debelo Brdo. Mortar bombs of 82 and 120 mm fell on Zeljezno Polje and the defense lines. An enemy recoilless gun and a Bofors gun were used to pound defense lines. The only consequence was material damage. Chetniks were frequently hitting civilian targets in Krusac: five shells were launched from (Bornici) and inflicted new damages on buildings. Two shells launched from Kalinovac fell on Travnik yesterday afternoon but fortunately had no consequences.'' Hamiz Deronjic reports that "the situation on the Brcko battlefield was somewhat calmer compared to the past several days. At the moment, the Serbian aggressor has resorted to artillery operations from a safe distance, which are regularly accompanied by antiaircraft and antiarmor weapons with intensive work by chetnik snipers. Last night, enemy 60- and 82-mm mortars were most active from the direction of Sekulici, Stari Brod, and Cadjevac and were pounding Brcko defense lines on Djukici, Kladje, at the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca line, and the central battlefield section. Air space in the Bijeljina, Brcko, and Pelagicevo is still the most used for enemy aircraft. At 2000 last night, Serbian transport helicopters were flying overhead." Amira Salibasic reports that "the free Olovo territory was the target of occasional artillery attacks yesterday. The morning passed with provocative enemy attacks from (?infantry) weapons, while in the evening, the aggressor intensified his attacks by using long-range arms."
