Dr. Sulayman al-Salim, Saudi commerce minister and chairman of the current session, delivered a speech at the start of the meeting, welcoming the GCC trade ministers and hailing the depth of cooperation between the GCC states. [passage omitted] His excellency concluded his speech by saying: "International changes are aimed at achieving real free trade, particularly now that all the difficulties have been overcome and the Uruguay Round has ended in success. Endeavors are also under way to turn GATT into an international trade organization at the meeting due to be held in Marrakesh soon. All this imposes challenges on us and obliges us to make huge efforts to achieve greater freedom of trade among us; we must remove all procedural obstacles in order to pave the way so that we may keep up with and adapt to these positive international trends." He also said that he hoped that everyone would cooperate to take more national goods off the list of the goods on which there is an import ban. He added that he would like to see the competent authorities reach a suitable formula to unify tariffs within the GCC. After this the commerce minister announced the end of the opening session.
