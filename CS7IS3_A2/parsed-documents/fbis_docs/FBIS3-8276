This morning, the report that the Cupovac region has been regained was confirmed. Yesterday's report said that what is in fact involved is the area between Jurkovic and (Bartic) Poljana, which was briefly occupied by the Croatian combatants. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops should have control over it, as was precisely stated in the Vance plan. The headquarters of the Serbian Krajina army has announced the liberation of the (?facility) of (Trlo), also on the Teslingrad front. In the battles, Krajina fighters suffered no losses, but Croatian losses are claimed to be great. It is interesting to note that Croatian radio does not report on these battles, but has even carried reports that it is allegedly calm on the Gospic front. According to the press center of the Serbian Krajina army headquarters, there have also been some Croatian Army provocations on the (Plascan) section of the Lika front, and attacks on Kricko and Zitnic near Drnis, as well as Otesic in the Vrlika region. These provocations by the Croatian Army drew a response.
