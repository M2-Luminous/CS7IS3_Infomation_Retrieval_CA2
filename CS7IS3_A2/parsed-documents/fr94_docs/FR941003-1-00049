FR941003-1-00049 FR941003-1-00003 51. Section 1.655 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) to read as follows: §1.655 Matters considered in rendering a final decision. (a) In rendering a final decision, the Board may consider any properly raised issue including (1) priority of invention, (2) derivation by an opponent from a party who filed a preliminary statement under §1.625, (3) patentability of the invention, (4) admissibility of evidence, (5) any interlocutory matter deferred to final hearing, and (6) any other matter necessary to resolve the interference. The Board may also consider whether > entry of < any interlocutory order was erroneous or an abuse of discretion. All interlocutory orders shall be presumed to have been correct and the burden of showing error or an abuse of discretion shall be on the party attacking the order. When two or more interlocutory orders involve the same issue, the last entered order shall be presumed to have been correct. (b) A party shall not be entitled to raise for consideration at final hearing a matter which properly could have been raised by a motion under §§1.633 or 1.634 unless (1) the > matter was properly raised in a < motion > that < was properly > timely < filed > by the party under §§1.633 or 1.634 and the motion was denied or deferred to final hearing < , (2) the matter was properly raised by a > the < party in an > a timely filed < opposition to a motion under §§1.633 or 1.634 and the motion was granted over the opposition > or deferred to final hearing < , or (3) the party shows good cause why the issue was not timely > properly < raised by > a timely filed < motion or opposition. > A change of attorneys during the interference generally does not constitute good cause. A party who fails to contest, by way of a timely filed preliminary motion under §1.633(c), the designation of a claim as corresponding to a count may not subsequently argue to an administrative patent judge or the Board the separate patentability or lack of separate patentability of claims designated to correspond to the count. < (c) > In the interest of justice < To prevent manifest injustice , the Board may > exercise its discretion to < consider an issue even though it would not otherwise be entitled to consideration under this section. 52.
