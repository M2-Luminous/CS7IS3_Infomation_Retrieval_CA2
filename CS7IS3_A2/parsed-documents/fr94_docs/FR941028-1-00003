FR941028-1-00003 FR941028-1-00001 Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;120&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On August 6, 1990, the FAA issued AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18, amendment 39&hyph;6702 (55 FR 33279, August 15, 1990), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747SP series airplanes, to require inspections for cracks in the web of the wing front spar between front spar station (FSS) 636 and FSS 675 over engine numbers 2 and 3, and repair, if necessary. That AD also provides for an optional modification, which, if accomplished, constitutes terminating action for the required inspections. That action was prompted by a report of a 26-inch crack on the front spar web. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent fuel leakage onto an engine and a resultant fire. Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA received a report of cracking in the web of the wing front spar in an area outside the inspection zone specified in AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18 on a Model 747SP series airplane that had been inspected previously in accordance with that AD. The report involved a 31-inch fatigue crack between front spar station (FSS) 628 and FSS 659. The crack was initiated by sonic fatigue. In addition, fuel was leaking adjacent to the number 3 engine. The FAA also received a report of a 24-inch fatigue crack between FSS 646 and FSS 670 on another Model 747SP series airplane. A crack in the web that is not detected before it extends outside the chord footprints can allow fuel leakage. Fatigue cracking on the web of the wing front spar, if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, can result in fuel leakage onto an engine and a resultant fire. Based on these findings, the FAA has determined that additional actions are necessary on airplanes that were inspected or modified in accordance with AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18. The FAA finds that an ultrasonic inspection must be performed in an area that extends beyond that specified in the existing AD. In addition, a high frequency eddy current inspection of an area of the web one inch below the upper chord and one inch above the lower chord footprints between FSS 628 and FSS 675 must be performed. Additionally, the FAA finds that these inspections must be performed on airplanes on which the ``terminating modification,'' which was provided in AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18, was previously installed. The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;57A2259, Revision 2, dated June 9, 1994, which describes procedures for additional inspections of an expanded inspection zone. This revised alert service bulletin describes the following repetitive inspections to detect cracks in the web between FSS 628 and FSS 675: 1. Ultrasonic inspections of the web under the upper and lower chord footprints; 2. High frequency eddy current inspections of the web in an area one inch below the upper chord and one inch above the lower chord footprints; and 3. Detailed visual inspections of the forward face of the web of the wing front spar at fastener locations in the web-to-stiffeners and web-to-rib posts. The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for accomplishment of an optional terminating modification. That modification involves removing a section of the web of the wing front spar between FSS 623 and FSS 670 inboard of the inboard engine, splicing in a new thicker web section, and adding a new stiffener outboard of the web splice. If this modification is accomplished, the repetitive inspections of the web, as described in the alert service bulletin, are no longer necessary. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18 to require various repetitive inspections to detect cracks in the web of the wing front spar in an area beyond that specified in the existing AD, and modification, if cracking is found. Installation of the modification would constitute terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. Operators should note that this NPRM would supersede the existing AD with new, additional inspections and a new terminating modification. Airplanes on which the previous ``terminating'' modification provided for in AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18 had been installed would be required to be inspected in accordance with the new inspections proposed in this notice. Installation of the new terminating modification, specified in paragraph (e) of this notice, would constitute terminating action for the requirements of the AD. The manufacturer has advised that it is currently developing a modification program for the engine struts on these airplanes that will positively address the fatigue cracking condition and other items associated with the engine struts. Once this modification program is developed and approved, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking. There are approximately 35 Model 747SP series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 11 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. The FAA estimates that it would take approximately 22 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspections (between FSS 628 and FSS 675) specified in this AD, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $13,310, or $1,210 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. Should an operator elect to accomplish the terminating modification that would be provided by this AD action, it would take approximately 644 work hours to accomplish it, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost of required parts would be $21,800. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the terminating modification would be $57,220 per airplane. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
