At the working-level talks, the North, on one hand, positively responded to the Southern demand that presidential envoys be exchanged as early as possible. As for the procedural decision, on the other hand, the communist country showed little desire to act, saying, "Since there are few differences on the issue, both sides can reach an agreement at any time." Accordingly, the South had to be satisfied only with securing continuity of inter-Korean dialogue by agreeing to meet again at 10 a.m. at Tongil-gak on the Northern side of the truce village of Panmunjom, failing to make up for the four months of inactivity since the last contact was made on Oct. 25 last year. Until the South Korean delegation came to the border village of Panmunjom, Seoul had expected the Thursday meeting to make considerable progress unless Pyongyang repeated its earlier demands that Seoul stop "nuclear war exercises" and "seeking international cooperation to stop a non-existent nuclear arms program." A clause in Tuesday's North Korean message saying that it recognized South Korean proposal for resumption of inter-Korean dialogue as acceptance of its earlier demands was especially taken as grounds for optimism. Based on this judgment, the South prepared a draft agreement which made concessions on which side will visit which first and on what the envoys can negotiate, among other things. The 13-point draft, which Vice Unification Minister Song Yong- tae, Seoul's chief delegate, presented at the contact, pointed out five aims of special envoys. This was reflection of a strong will on the part of the South that the envoy exchange issue be concluded at the contact since it had virtually accepted what the North had demanded as envoys' missions in the last three working-level meetings. At the Panmunjom contact, however, the South could not even discuss the details of procedural questions because the North erected a new hurdle by demanding Seoul scrap the plan for deployment of Patriot anti-missile batteries on the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang's head delegate Pak Yong-su also required an explanation of the two of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's statements in news conferences. Kim's remarks which the North took issue with were one saying that he could not "shake hands with anyone possessing nuclear arms" in a press conference marking the 100th day of his term and the other saying that there is no substantial proof that the North has an atomic bomb in a recent press meet. Along with the new complaints, the North repeated its earlier demands. According to Vice Minister Song, the Northern side said, "Without resolution of these issues, the envoy exchange is unlikely to take place," adding that the Southern answering of the four complaints "is indispensable" for the envoy exchange. Many government officials take the North Korea's intransigent stance as a sort of tactic to gain the advantage in the process of exchanging presidential envoys, delaying the exchange a little bit. "Pyongyang is well aware that the envoys must be exchanged before March 21 when the third round of high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang is scheduled," said a ranking government official, adding that the North's attitude can be taken as a "transient action." This rather optimistic viewpoint predicts that the South and the North will agree on the process of envoy exchanges in the next border contact slated for next Wednesday [9 March] and that the envoys will be exchanged before March 21. However, as Seoul's chief delegate Song pointed out after the Thursday contact had failed, "North Korea's will to realize the envoy exchange in an early date is not strong," the timetable South and North Korea and the United States have prepared for eventual solution of the nuclear issue is unlikely to be kept, other government officials said.
