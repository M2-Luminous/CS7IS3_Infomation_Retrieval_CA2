Venizelos] [Text] The Americans are said to have leaked President Glavkos Kliridhis' letter to President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister John Major. According to I SIMERINI information, the American Embassy in Nicosia leaked the content of the letter, specifically President Kliridhis' reference that if talks on the CBM's [confidence-building measures] continue he would resign, in order to test the Cyprus Government's reaction and to record the amount of persistence in this warning. The Cyprus Government's message with Kliridhis' warning to the U.S. and British Governments, who are playing a pioneering role these days behind the scenes for the resumption of talks on the CBM's, was crystal clear: We will reject a Security Council appeal if it decides to continue the process. This is what a reliable source in Nicosia has told I SIMERINI and noted that President Kliridhis briefed the Ambassadors of these countries on his intentions at the meetings he had with them last week. These ambassadors briefed their governments before the letter was sent, and at least the Americans began the leaks on this question from the very beginning. What did they expect to gain by the leaks? Through the official statements by the government, they would test how serious the president was about his resignation, or more probably, they would force him to back down in the face of publicity. A government source in Nicosia, without confirming or denying the REUTER report on the content of Kliridhis' letter, told I SIMERINI that Nicosia is determined to avert a resumption of the talks. At the same time, it warns that if elections were held today, the climate to be created in public opinion would favor the election of hard-liners on the Cyprus issue. All the government actions are based on understandings with the Greek Government. Greek Ambassador in Nicosia Alexandros Sandhis is being kept fully briefed on the developments by President Kliridhis, and it appears that some moves are being formulated jointly. Reports from Athens did not rule out the possibility that the Greek Government would also send warning letters. The statements by Karolos Papoulias, Evangelos Venizelos, and Yeoryios Papandreou (which he made after meeting Alekos Mikhailidhis) that the CBM's are dead indicate the Greek side's intentions and activities that will follow. The British and American moves in New York and Kliridhis' reaction with the warning that he would resign are the climax of a series of developments. According to I SIMERINI information, when President Kliridhis recently talked with a foreign diplomat he said that for one year the Greek side has been saying "yes" despite the reaction on the domestic front. Then the foreigners were telling us "bravo," but now they reward Rauf Denktas' intransigence, President Kliridhis pointed out.
