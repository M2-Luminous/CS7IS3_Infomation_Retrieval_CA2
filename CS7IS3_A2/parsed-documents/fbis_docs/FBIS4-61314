Niklus had declared that a secret meeting of Russian officers took place in Tartu on April 23 where an armed coup was discussed. He further claimed that the conspirators are armed and have cells in different regions of Estonia. The PEVALEHT reports that a dismissed Defence League member had sent a letter recently to President Lennart Meri and Commander in Chief General Aleksander Einseln, claiming that retired Russian officers had been preparing a coup at the aforementioned date. The man had added that some servicemen of the Estonia Defence Forces have been involved in the preparation. An unnamed Interior Ministry official dismissed the report, explaining that April 23 had been the day of the payment of pensions to the retired Russian military and their possible expressions of dissatisfaction can hardly be qualified as a preparation of coup attempt.
