He said that there are certain quarters inside and outside Jordan that like to spread rumors on the dinar's rate of exchange for various reasons. He recalled that the 1989 devaluation should be viewed as an isolated incident in over 40 years. Speaking to AL-DUSTUR yesterday through the "Face the Press" rubric, Dr. al-Nabulsi said the increase in the U.S. dollar's exchange rate against the Jordanian dinar over the past three months was caused by the large increase in the dollar's rate of exchange against the other major currencies in the world. He denied that there is a policy to gradually devalue the dinar against the U.S. dollar. [passage omitted] On the Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement that was signed on Friday, and its provisions on the reopening of the banks that were closed in the occupied Palestinian cities, Dr. al-Nabulsi said that the CBJ has asked the concerned banks to submit new applications to the CBJ for reopening their branches there. He emphasized that the CBJ is now waiting for the green light from the council of ministers to start implementing this provision of the agreement and to make the necessary arrangements for this. He said that the Israeli side promised to facilitate the tasks of the inspectors and controllers from the CBJ who will be charged with supervising the branches of the Jordanian banks there. Dr. al-Nabulsi explained that the Jordanian-Israeli economic agreement stipulates the opening of bank branches in two stages; the first, for the banks that had branches there and were closed in June 1967, and the second for the banks that will open new branches there. At the present time, the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement covers only those banks that had branches there before. He added: However, all these things will be discussed and followed up through the joint committee that the agreement created. He said that the reopening of the previously closed bank branches will take place gradually. He said that the first thing to do is to discuss how many branches each bank will be allowed to open. He said eight Jordanian banks had 31 branches in the Palestinian cities. He said that Jordan, the Palestinians, and Israel should approve the reopening of any branch. On the Kingdom's currency reserves, Dr. al-Nabulsi said that they are constantly increasing. These reserves dropped momentarily last year when Jordan recovered a large part of its foreign debt. He said: We paid the price of $400 million to purchase foreign debts worth more than $1.5 billion. [passage omitted]
