In 1993 alone, according to the information of the Federal Counterintelligence Service Directorate for Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, 37 trained spies were discovered among the numerous guests from abroad who regularly came to the "cradle" of Russian capitalism, as well as 125 people involved in the special services. The "cloak-and-dagger knights" are attracted to military-industrial complex installations, research by scientists, and the leaders of political parties. But the most important thing is the Arzamas-16 Federal Nuclear Center.
