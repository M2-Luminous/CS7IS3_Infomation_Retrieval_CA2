Later, more were killed and wounded by the Israeli Army during demonstrations to protest the massacre. In an editorial today, the newspaper says that if some states defend the UN Security Council's slackness regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina and the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre using the excuse that certain powers obstruct any decisive resolution, the world cannot stand by when it sees this important authority become too weak to play the role entrusted to it by the UN Charter. AL-AKHBAR calls for referring the matter to the UN General Assembly to take the necessary measures to restore the UN Security Council's esteem.
