The workers are also pressing for an 80-percent wage increase. Prime Minister Oye-Mba held talks with union leaders on 14 January and told them that his government was examining further measures designed to alleviate the adverse effects of the devaluation through the subsidization of certain basic commodities. [passage omitted] [In a related report at 1215 GMT on 16 February 1994, Libreville Radio adds: "The 72-hour strike called by COSYGA seems to have received little support. The movement was not very much observed and Libreville residents in particular are quietly going about their normal business, both in the public and private sectors." [Libreville Radio says that the personnel officer for the Libreville municipal council said the following: "Reports reaching me from the region say that the strike has only been partially observed. I am happy to report that a large number of our employees have come to work."]
