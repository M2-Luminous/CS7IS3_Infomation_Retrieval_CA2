In August of last year, 4 kg of amphetamines were brought to Helsinki from Estonia in a small airplane. The drugs were hidden in the airplane's space for the heating element. The narcotics were quite pure and valued at significantly more than a million markkas. The smuggling incident is linked to the amphetamine case currently before the Helsinki Circuit Court, in which eight men are accused of aggravated narcotics smuggling, aggravated narcotics crimes, as well as other crimes. The case involves 7 kg of amphetamines. Of that amount, 1.2 kg have been seized. In connection with the case, the police have, in addition to the amphetamines, also seized 5 kg of hashish, tens of thousands of hormone pills and numerous guns, including a submachine gun. The gang involved, which operated in Finland, has had good connections in Estonia and Sweden. According to the narcotics division of the Helsinki police department, a dozen more suspects will be indicted in connection with the case. The main suspect in the case has been arrested in Sweden. During the course of police investigations, it was discovered that the gang was also planning to smuggle 12 kg of amphetamines into the country. The case also involved 10 automobiles, which had been stolen in Finland. The automobiles were taken to Estonia. During interrogation the police discovered that members of the gang had been offered to act as middlemen in the sale of Kalashnikov assault rifles, Makarov handguns, hand grenades, and ammunition. The price of a Kalashnikov, to give an example, would have been 7,000 markkas. Amphetamines Delivered From Hotel A 4-kg shipment was brought to the Malmi Airport on 3 August. The previous day four men had flown to Tallinn in a rented small plane. There, the drugs were picked up from an Estonian dealer at Hotel Sport. In the evening, the men celebrated at the Viru Hotel, and the next day all four men flew back to Malmi. Two of the men are professional pilots; one from Helsinki and the other one from Riihimaki. The 29-year-old pilot from Helsinki told the police that they all were cognizant of drugs being smuggled. The pilot from Riihimaki has, however, denied this. According to him, they were supposed to bring in hormones and not narcotics. A 31-year-old fireman from Helsinki, who also participated in the trip, has also denied any knowledge of the drugs. "I only went on the trip to party," he told the court last Wednesday [26 January]. So far, the police have been unable to locate the fourth passenger on the airplane. The police were able to seize less than half a kilogram of the total 4-kg shipment. The smugglers were able to sell the rest in, among other places, Helsinki and Oulu. Public prosecutor Leena Metsapelto wants the smugglers to pay fines amounting to the value of the airplane, or 350,000 markkas. Some 300 grams of the narcotics were found in an apartment in Riihimaki, where the amphetamines had been hidden at the request of the second pilot. Last Tuesday [25 January], the 28-year-old man from Riihimaki who had concealed the drugs was convicted of a narcotics crime, and sentenced to pay 80-day fines, or 1,600 markkas. Half a Kilo Found in Central Finland Through the main suspects, the case is also linked to another gang faction, from which half a kg of amphetamines have been seized. The drugs were found in a cottage in Toivakka, in central Finland. Jorma Juhani Hypponen (39), who lived in the Rural District of Jyvaskyla and in Tallinn, was sentenced by the district court to four and a half years of imprisonment. In addition to the seized narcotics, the court found him guilty of the distribution of half a kilo of amphetamines, as well as the attempt to smuggle 2 kg of the same drug. He was also convicted of theft, fencing, and a crime involving firearms. Hypponen started to serve his sentence immediately after the verdict. As far as the other individuals charged were concerned, the court granted a two-week continuance.
