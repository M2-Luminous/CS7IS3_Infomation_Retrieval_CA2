Since he did not specify the direction of those decades that were passing so quickly, judging by the war and the decline of the standard of living, Croatia went 40 years back, rather than forward. The debate about whether Croatia went back to 1941 or to 1945 has been going on for four years. According to sporadic neo-ustashi folklore study and the study of ornaments, some tend to claim that Tudjman is closer to Pavelic [Croatian politician, founder of the the Independent State of Croatia -- NDH -- in 1941] and the NDH than to Tito and the Socialist Republic of Croatia. One could find many similies to substantiate this topic -- formally. However, in order to make a convincing material analysis, one should better consider a meaningful comparison of the way of production of the postwar Tito's society and (post)war Tudjman's society. With regard to that, one could consider the category of a law-ordered state. Legally speaking, the NDH was more of a law-ordered state than the Croatia of the present day. How come? It had monstrous, disgusting, racist laws, but its legal proceedings were more or less governed in accordance with them. Tudjman's Republic of Croatia does not have a legal basis for harassing the Serbs, but rather "the best Constitution in the world for ethnic communities and national minorities," but it does not go by it in most cases. Constitution and Rights Such an approach to legislature and regulations was the most distinguishable trait of communists countries. Just as communists made laws to comply with international political good manners, so did Glavas [head of Osijek county], at one point, with regard to defining the national and human rights of the Serbs, say the Croatian Constitution was just a "piece of paper." In distinction to the ustashas, to whom Hitler gave the "revolution" of indulging themselves with the citizens of Croatia, the members of the HDZ won the right to overthrow the state themselves. If the communist revolution carried out in the defensive antifascist war ended by harassing the former enemy, the NDH, the HDZ revolution was also realized in the defensive patriotic war by stigmatizing the participants of former inimical Yugoslavia. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia organized the uprising against the occupying German army [in World War II], and the HDZ did so against the occupying JNA [Yugoslav Peoples Army], and thus, after the victories, the communists remained the only official antifascists and the HDZ members the only official volunteers. Just as Tito asked that chetniks who did not commit "too many" crimes join the partisans, Tudjman asked them to join the Croatian Army. Tito was teaching that agitation and propaganda was the best means of forcing people to suffer their own damage; Tudjman does that by increasing the propaganda for Croatian national awareness. In diplomatic sequestration, Tito kept Trieste and parts of Istria, Tudjman got "krajina." In the postwar years, the USSR played a role of the magic guarantee for a better future for communists, and now HDZ members think the Unites States plays a comparable role. The cults of both Tito and Tudjman were created by means of the monopolized media and claques. But, just as legal development of Tito's cult deviated from norms of realist socialism and contributed to the imposition of sanctions by socialist countries (the Cominform resolution), the development of Tudjman's cult resulted in deviations from European norms, which almost lead to the imposition of sanctions (UN resolutions). Both regimes rely upon a powerful party -- the state in the context of the geopolitically maximum possible political pluralism. At that time, being expelled from the Communist Party of Yugoslavia resulted in an immediate loss of official function; today the same is happening to people expelled from the HDZ. The division of people is executed according to similar propagandistic patterns. People are either for Tito's Yugoslavia or they are traitors who advocate Croatia, i.e., those who want Tudjman's Croatia and traitors who are also inclined toward Istria, Dalmatia, Slavonia.... Both authorities awarded memorial medals and ideologized, politicized, and ascribed state success to their party. What once meant the loss of political, civic rights is today the loss of certificates of citizenship and the pertaining rights. After the communist antifascist war there was class differentiation, and during the HDZ antifascist war ethnic differentiation pays the tribute. One is particularly beware of "internal enemies" who are likely to conspire with the "external enemy" -- a constant danger for the young state. Watching for the Enemy Therefore, protecting its existence justifies all means, so Tudjman's enforcement of taxes is a counterpart to Tito's enforcement of purchases, and Tudjman's (in)humane moving people from their land is a counterpart to Tito's colonization of other people's property. One-time forceful collectivization is, today, replaced with forceful privatization, and the politics of doing away with kulaks, with the politics of expropriating workers. Farmers and the middle class paid for the development of the "Yugoslav working class," workers and the middle class have paid for the development of the "Croatian class." The former regime forced the mobilization of the work force, and now the work force is being mobilized. Farmers made the biggest contribution to the communist revolution and, in the HDZ revolution, the greatest victims are proletarians -- owners of their joblessness. Centralization is a characteristic of both ways of ruling. However, already in 1945, the communists passed the law on the final liquidation of farmers' debts, which was the death of farmers in the old Yugoslavia. In addition to centralization, HDZ members incurred debts for the population: They took foreign currency from the rich and asked the poor to buy their own apartments (which they acquired on the basis of the public ownership in which they partook financially), their own firms, and to reduce health and retirement benefits. And just as in the communist regime, farmers only had the right to minimal ownership (their own land), it was not used optimally without realistic market conditions; today, maximum private entrepreneurship without market freedom is equally ridiculous, since it is for the most part mediated by the state, instead of the market Privatization Fund, and has connections with the HDZ discretionary power. "Kulaks" and "Commies" If it was once easy to change from sandals to shoes, today one can change from shoes to a BMW even faster. But those who lose awareness from the Croatianist patriotic conscience are not getting BMW's, just as those who lost awareness from the communist shock-worker awareness got very little. "Unaware peasants" used to suffer a lot under the pressure of state tutors if they contributed too little to the state; today, "unaware intellectuals" suffer the same kind of pressure, for they are not creating enough contributions for the statesman. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia "became famous" for its pressure on kulaks to "voluntarily" join peasants' work communities, and the HDZ for its pressure on "social managers" and speculators to join the HDZ, threatening that if they refuse they would either be replaced or have to pay higher taxes. Local communist authorities used to let off steam politically abusing work mobilization, while the aphrodisiac of the HDZ authorities is the abuse of military mobilization. Even greater pleasure is derived from "unknown men" mistreating "NDH kulaks" who refuse to obey work mobilization, i.e., "Yugo-commies" who refuse to wear the uniform of the Croatian Army. The leadership of the HDZ is aware of all those irregularities, just as the Politburo of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was. Tito also knew what Tudjman knows today. And what does Tudjman know about Tito today? He knows that Tito is a much greater geopolitical and international reference for him than Pavelic. Having finally paid off the Pavelic-like ideological mortgage, in his conversation with Albanian President Berisha, he made a wise reference to Tito, as a Croatian politician and statesman. Has Tudjman finally surpassed his revolutionary Titoist stage and approached a much more civilized Tito from 1974? Anyway, in interethnic and international relations, Tudjman should also follow Tito's "non-Mandarin" strategic experience. If Tudjman has a strong reason to draw his geopolitical thoughts from the positive and acclaimed achievements of Titoism, he also has reason to democratically dignify it by spreading his tolerance to his critics. One could not publish a similar (ana)logical text in the postwar Tito regime, but the mere act of writing alone could incur an invitation for a "tourist tour" from Goli Otok [island in the Adriatic Sea turned into a prison, mainly for political prisoners] to Lepoglava [prison for political prisoners]. One can say what one thinks about Tudjman -- even when one does not think -- without fear. Without fear of being imprisoned. Indeed, ambitious people only fear stagnation in their careers. Is a new Tito the "Tudjman" who democratically came to his senses and accepted the pluralistic public, or is Tudjman the old "Tito" who ended his crypto-Croatian strategy on the basis of the verified intraparty rough treatment of his followers? All this needs to be critically examined in great detail. The criticism of the Croatian state could, therefore, also consist of its development, instead of the denial of both the state and the criticism. The worst critical state is better than the best state criticism, so the state and its critics should agree that statesmen deal in politics and critics in criticism, to the market satisfaction of their clients. What kind of political market is it where politicians always "take care" of critics?
