He was received by President Geydar Aliyev this morning. Kazimirov said Russia believes the active participation of Turkey and Iran in the efforts to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh problem would be beneficial. He explained that he went to Tehran to hold talks with this aim and that Iran agreed to the proposal in principle. Kazimirov said he will soon go to Ankara with the same proposal. Aliyev said he finds the proposal favorable. He said he supports the current developments, which started with a cease-fire and continued with a letter sent to the leaders of the sides concerned. The active participation of Turkey and Iran, Aliyev said, might make a solution easier. Aliyev pointed out that Turkey is a member both of the CSCE and of the Minsk Group. In this respect, he said, we attach great importance to the participation of Turkey in particular.
