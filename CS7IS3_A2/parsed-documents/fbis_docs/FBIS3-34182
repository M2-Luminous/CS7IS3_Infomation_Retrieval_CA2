FBIS3-34182 "drnes024_a_94004" FBIS-NES-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 ARAB AFRICA Algeria Commentary Decries Terrorism, Killings, Violence LD0302233094 Algiers ENTV Television Network in Arabic 1900 GMT 3 Feb 94 LD0302233094 Algiers ENTV Television Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] Condemnation of assassination and violence in all its forms, be it against Algerians or foreigners, the list will not end as long as more names continue to fall. Here is more with Nassira Ait Saleh: [Ait Saleh] The list of victims is growing longer. The bloodletting of the best Algerians continue; even foreigners have not been spared. The wantonness of terrorism cannot be explained, save by the logic of blind madness, which aims at destabilizing the country and desecrating the right to live. Terrorism does not exclude anyone; intellectuals, journalists, civilians, policemen, gendarmes, and soldiers have all been a target for the bullets of terrorism, merely because they are one of Algeria's symbols. Two days ago, two foreign journalists were also the victims of terrorism. One was killed instantly and the other was seriously wounded. This took place at the Casbah of Algiers -- at what should be a symbolic and welcoming quarter, an international historical monument. This hemorrhage must stop. Algeria will remain steadfast, thanks to its sons, who are producing, resisting, and also dying.
