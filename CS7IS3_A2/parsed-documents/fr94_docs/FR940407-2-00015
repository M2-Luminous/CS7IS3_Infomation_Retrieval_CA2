ACTION: Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review. SUMMARY: On February 11, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of review of the antidumping duty finding on titanium sponge from Kazakhstan (59 FR 6618). The review covers exports of the subject merchandise to the United States from Kazakhstan during the period August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993. We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. Based on our analysis of comments received, the final results remain unchanged from the preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Genovese, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;5254. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 28, 1968, the Department of the Treasury published an antidumping finding on titanium sponge from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) (33 FR 12138). In December 1991, the USSR divided into fifteen independent states. To conform to these changes, the Department changed the original antidumping finding into fifteen findings applicable to the Baltic states and the former USSR (57 FR 36070, August 12, 1992). On August 30, 1993, the Department received a request to conduct an administrative review of the antidumping finding on titanium sponge from Kazakhstan. The Department initiated the review on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51053), covering the period August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993. On February 11, 1994, we published the preliminary results of review of the antidumping finding on titanium sponge from Kazakhstan (59 FR 6618). The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of the Review The merchandise covered by this review is all imports of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan. Titanium sponge is chiefly used for aerospace vehicles, specifically, in the construction of compressor blades and wheels, stator blades, rotors, and other parts in aircraft gas turbine engines. Imports of titanium sponge are currently classifiable under the harmonized tariff schedule (HTS) subheading 8108.10.50.10. The HTS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes; our written description of the scope of this finding is dispositive. Analysis of Comments Received We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from Titanium Metals Corporation (TIMET), a domestic producer of titanium sponge, and rebuttal comments from RMI Titanium Co. (RMI), an importer of titanium sponge. Comment 1: TIMET argues that there were imports of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan, under temporary importation bond (TIB), during the period of review. TIMET cites a December 3, 1993, letter from RMI to the Acting Assistant Secretary to support this statement. TIMET asserts that such imports are processed into titanium mill products and re-exported. TIMET states antidumping duties should be assessed on imports entered under TIB because such imports result in the circumvention of the antidumping finding. TIMET cites U.S. Customs Service Headquarter's rulings to argue that Customs has treated TIB entries of other products as consumption entries in order to prevent circumvention of quota laws.
