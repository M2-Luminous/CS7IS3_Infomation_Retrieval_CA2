Wastewaters The metal UTS for wastewaters are based on chemical precipitation as BDAT. Depending on the initial concentration of metal constituents in the wastewater, operating conditions such as retention time, flocculating agents, reagent concentrations such as iron to affect solubility of other metals, and mixing may need to be adjusted to comply with the standards. The following table presents the UTS metal wastewater limits, and the previous limits. Changes to the proposed metal standards occurred in two areas: use of Office of Water Metal Finishing limits, and an adjustment of the proposed vanadium limit. These changes are explained following the table.
