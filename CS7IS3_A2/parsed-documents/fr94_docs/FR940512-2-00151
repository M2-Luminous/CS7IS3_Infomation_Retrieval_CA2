FR940512-2-00151 FR940512-2-00069 As for the other provisions in Paragraphs 102.03 and 103.05, the Commission finds that they strike an appropriate balance between protecting investors and enhancing the flexibility of the debt listing process. For instance, the proposed rule change retains the current requirement that, to be eligible for listing, a bond issue must have an aggregate market value or principal amount of at least $5 million. This should enable the NYSE to deny listed status to companies whose securities do not have sufficient liquidity for a fair and orderly market, without infringing upon bona fide issuers' access to the Exchange's bond trading and disclosure systems. Conversely, the Commission does not believe that eliminating the distribution requirement will have a significant adverse effect on investors in the bond market. The NYSE currently evaluates distribution of debt securities in an ad hoc fashion. The NYSE does not specify a mandatory minimum threshold for the number of bonds outstanding and/or the number of holders thereof but only requires a distribution ``sufficient for trading on the Exchange.'' In the past, the Commission has recognized that such information may be difficult to estimate accurately and may be relatively less pertinent than other factors. 28 From the Commission's perspective, the benefits of streamlining the Exchange's substantive review is appropriate, especially since the NYSE has discretion not to list an otherwise eligible debt issue if such status would be unwarranted. 28 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32909 (September 15, 1993), 58 FR 49537 (September 23, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;21) (approving amendments to Paragraph 703.06 of the Listed Company Manual to eliminate requirement that distribution information be submitted as supporting document to debt listing application). In terms of the delisting criteria in Paragraph 802.00, the Commission has concluded that the revised standards should enable the NYSE to identify listed companies that may have insufficient resources to meet their financial obligations or whose debt securities may lack adequate trading depth and liquidity. This, in turn, will allow the Exchange to take appropriate action to protect bondholders. In this regard, the NYSE has indicated that it normally will not delist a debt security if it has value and if continued exchange trading is in the best interests of investors; however, the NYSE has pledged to give serious consideration to delisting bonds which, based on their market price, 29 have minimal or no value. In applying this standard, the Commission expects the NYSE to consider carefully the propriety of continued exchange trading of the securities of bankrupt or distressed companies, 30 and expects bonds with minimal value to be delisted. 29 Telephone conversation between Michael J. Simon, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy; Fred Siesel, Director, Fixed Income Markets, NYSE; Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC; and Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC. 30 For example, debt of companies in bankruptcy that file a plan of reorganization that provides no recovery for debt holders should be delisted. The Commission also is satisfied with the NYSE's framework for the listing and delisting of convertible debt securities. By authorizing the Exchange to list and trade bonds that are convertible into any equity security subject to real-time last sale reporting in the United States (rather than merely NYSE listed common stock), the proposed rule change should help the NYSE adapt to today's rapidly changing market environment. 31 The Commission notes that, like the NYSE, the other national securities exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') make quote and trade information publicly available on a ``real-time'' basis. As a result, the Commission believes that the NYSE proposal should ensure that investors have information necessary to price convertible bonds. 31 In addition, the proposed rule change will conform the NYSE's listing standards with the framework used by other markets, including the American Stock Exchange.
