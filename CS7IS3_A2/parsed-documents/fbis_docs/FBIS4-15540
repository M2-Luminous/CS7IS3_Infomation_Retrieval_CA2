The deputies demanded that the permission required to deliver aid be replaced with a simple notice of delivery. This statement was made by the leader of the deputies' group Russian Way, Sergey Baburin, at a news conference Friday. The delegation included mostly deputies from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Agrarian Party, Russian Communist Party and groups Russian Way and New Regional Policy. Baburin pointed out that changing the procedure for delivering humanitarian aid would enable Russia to intensify aid to the people of Serbia without waiting for the lifting of the sanctions. In their statement, the deputies pointed to the need to intensify the activities of the Russian government and the parliament to lift U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia. As has already been reported, the issue was included in the agenda of the State Duma's session this week. It was proposed to recommend to the Russian president and government to decide on Russia's participation in the sanctions, boost humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia, including oil and gas supplies, and intensify bilateral economic cooperation. Deputy Viktor Veshnyakov of the Liberal Democratic Party faction supposed Russia should be ready to enter the Yugoslav market, including that of defense systems, immediately after the sanctions are lifted.
