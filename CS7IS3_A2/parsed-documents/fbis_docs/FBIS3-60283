Vasilenko, chief of the council of experts for issues of social ecology, the Nevada-Semipalatinsk International Antinuclear Movement, in the "Opinion" column: "Atom in Our House. The Ecological Status of Test Sites and the Nuclear Industry"] [Text] ...Still new instances of dangerous pollution of territories are being revealed, whereas the elimination of the risk zones is proceeding slowly because old "debtors" are in no hurry to assume responsibility for their mistakes before the people. Moreover, even the relapses and stereotypes of a militarist ideology survive. The public has become aware of draft agreements between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan concerning procedures for the use of test sites and joint activities for the conversion and subsequent use of the facilities of the former Semipalatinsk nuclear test site. An analysis of the draft agreements indicates that no review of the documents by ecological-law experts has been administered, i.e. the conformity of the documents to the principles, norms, and articles of the laws of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan concerning environmental protection has not been evaluated. We cannot fail to take into account the fact that, from the ecological point of view, military test sites form a specific and specialized type of use of natural resources within the Earth's biosphere whereby the means of the forcible conduct of politics, armaments, and all technologies (nuclear, chemical, physical, mechanical, bacteriological, climatic, and possibly others) are used to destroy natural components and eliminate live species and people within their active zone, which means are extremely dangerous for humanity. Following Rio-92, which adopted new principles of ecological security, all countries of the world should revise the principles of their international relations, all the more so because the problem of the survival of civilization has become an absolute priority from the point of view of the global problems of humanity, of which the ecological problem is one. The ideology for the joint use of territories (ecosystems) for test sites should be ecological rather than military (militarist). The peculiarities and specialization of each test site should be clearly specified, set forth, and mapped out in terms of all characteristics and parameters. The special ecological status of this type and form of the use of natural resources shall be based on a strict regulatory ecological framework, ecological and legal control norms, and instruments firmly restricting possible and permissible military and other destruction so as to preserve nature and to not damage the ecological systems of the Earth's biosphere and man on a local scale, to say nothing of global. Kazakhstan has already paid too dearly for the militarist ambitions of the totalitarian system, and it is still paying. This will be a forced payment until such time as Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation implement an ecological conversion of the nuclear power industry and the nuclear industry in general, including such facilities as the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site. Kazakhstan in whose lands a war has never originated could become an international center for the ecologically safe (natural) development of nuclear technologies, at any rate for the period in which the raw materials accumulated in the course of the nuclear race are used by nuclear power stations. Therefore, for this idea to be implemented, all test sites in Kazakhstan and Russia should be transparent to the public, independent expert review. This is why the agreements should provide for ecological observers. This will facilitate the demilitarization of the consciousness of the politicians, the military, and the public alike and the overall ecological friendliness of the use of national resources. In general, military test sites should have the necessary engineering and ecological equipment and instruments for all types and forms of the evaluation of the impact of explosions and all technologies on the biospheric environment, ecosystems, and man within them. In this sense, former military test sites should functionally become ecological test sites. In conjunction with this, the issue of the ecological status of the Semipalatinsk test site (SIP) acquires particular social, political, and legal significance. With the issue of the SIP raised in this manner, we should be discussing joint activities in the ecological retrofitting and ecological conversion of the SIP facilities rather than their transformation. This is also a fundamental issue because the forms and methods of eliminating the consequences of explosions, prospects, priorities, and directions for the development of nuclear power generation and the nuclear industry in general hinge on it. Taking into account the above arguments, we believe that it is legally justified to raise the issue of openly carrying out an independent, public ecological expert review and public control in the area of environmental protection under the aegis of the Nevada-Semipalatinsk International Antinuclear Movement, its committee on issues and expert councils of scientists. Articles 40, 42, 48, 49, 55, 59, 61, and 62 of the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the Protection of the Natural Environment give us this right, and we are informing the population about this. As we see it, all the enumerated problems compel us to make fundamental revisions in general in the "Management and Planning Chart for Conducting Research and Testing by the Ecology and Emergency Scientific-Research Complex," which does not even make a reference to either the Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources or the International Antinuclear Movement. We propose a different version of the management chart which, in addition to taking into account the place and role of the Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources, the Nevada-Semipalatinsk International Antinuclear Movement, should provide for subdivisions to not just control ecological consequences but to provide ecological services to the test site and its zone of impact in general. In view of the "contribution" of nuclear energy to the grave ecological situation in Kazakhstan, we consider the issue of setting forth the ecological status of the Republic of Kazakhstan National Nuclear Center as an institute and sector for special use of natural resources to be topical. In the legal and political aspect, this issue is topical for the corporation of the nuclear power industry and the nuclear agency because it is associated with the issue of developing the concept of nuclear law as law on the specific use of natural resources by the sector. This issue is politically and legally topical for Kazakhstan and CIS countries in general because no effective special institutions have been created in them to defend the ecological rights of the population in the zones of extreme impact of technical origin and even in the already announced disaster zones. As a result, for example, ecological rights of the citizens of Kazakhstan proclaimed in Article 7 of the Law on the Protection of the Natural Environment are not actually defended by anyone, and are violated right and left. In the sector and at the enterprises of nuclear power generation and in the nuclear industry this violation is currently expressed in the extremely slow elimination of radioactive contamination and the consequences of pollution and radioactive exposure of the population; control over the use safety is lacking at the locations of mining, processing, and even transportation and burial of waste. At present, the ecological situation in the republic and the sector is such that, in our view, it is necessary to develop and pass a law on the liquidation of the consequences of nuclear explosions (military and regular industrial) carried out in Kazakhstan, socioecological rehabilitation of the population and disaster territories, zones, and regions, ecological conversion of defense installations, and ecological retrofitting of the nuclear industry. This law should provide for a comprehensive ecological regimentation of all work in the sector and the development of nuclear power generation and the nuclear industry in general; from the socioecological point of view, they have been developing by the trial and error method to this day. The first legal act of ecological law has been passed (for now, only with regard to sufferers in the Aral Sea area). However, this is merely the beginning of a gigantic effort to solve the most complex problems of social ecology.
