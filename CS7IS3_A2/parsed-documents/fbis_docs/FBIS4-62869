The population's worry has been caused by the fact that the validity of a simplified procedure, under the law "On Russian Federation Citizenship," for acquiring citizenship is expected to end soon -- in February 1995, as has been announced. Oleg Boyko, first secretary of the Russian Embassy in Azerbaijan and head of the consular office, has advised that the deadline will be extended by a special edict. He has served a reminder that the simplified registration rule only applies to those who originally come from Russia. Besides, persons moving to Russia for permanent residence can register their citizenship with internal affairs bodies of the Russian Federation after they have decided on their new place of residence in accordance with the law.
