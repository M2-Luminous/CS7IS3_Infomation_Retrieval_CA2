Clinton sent to the U.S. Congress a series of recommendations on the Canal Commission legislation, including one on tolls. Alegre said the initiatives are positive because most of them include the majority of the recommendations made by the Canal Commission's Board of Directors to the U.S. Administration a few months ago. "I would say that, in general, they are positive because they change the Commission to meet the needs of the canal traffic, making it more flexible for maritime commerce demands, giving the board more power to make needed changes, and better preparing the Commission for the transition," she added. The Canal Commission is a U.S. federal agency whose board of directors is made up of five North Americans and four Panamanians. According to the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties, the canal will be totally in Panamanian hands on 31 December 1999. Alegre said the Canal Commission presented its recommendations to Leon Panetta, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. The majority of Clinton's recommendations "agree with ours," Alegre reiterated. Clinton recommended that the process to establish tolls be carried out by the Canal Commission, not the U.S. president.
