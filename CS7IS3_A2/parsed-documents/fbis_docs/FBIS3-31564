"UNPROFOR is generally implementing the agreement between the Serb and Muslim sides very correctly and with good intentions. The Serb side not only has no complaints, but it also commends the impartial and mediating role of the `international forces,'" Krajisnik said. Asked to comment on air strike threats if the Serbs did not allow Tuzla airport to open, Krajisnik said: "We do not have anything against the opening of Tuzla airport if we get guarantees that it will not be used to arm Muslim forces, thus prolonging the war. However, those who want to open the airport straight away do not have good intentions." We, Krajisnik added, also have no complaints about the demilitarization of the warring sides in Zepa, Srebrenica, and other enclaves because our goal is peace and a demarcation between the Serbs, Muslims, and Croats. However, not a single percent of Serb territory can be threatened by this act. We have opted for a peaceful resolution accompanied by a demarcation between the three states in the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina and any attempt to join the three nations is in reality a prolongation of military operations, Krajisnik said.
