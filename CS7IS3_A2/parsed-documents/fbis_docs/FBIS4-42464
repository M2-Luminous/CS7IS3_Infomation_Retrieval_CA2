The seven other non-NATO countries invited as observers for the first phase of the exercise are Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden. This is the first time that so many neutral and former Warsaw Pact countries are participating in allied naval maneuvers. Some 40 NATO ships provided by the German, Belgian, British, Danish, Netherlands, Norwegian, and American Navies will then continue the maneuvers among themselves until 17 June, according to the German naval staff at Glucksburg (in Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany). Nevertheless, they will put in at Gdynia (Poland), the same source added. The maneuver will be directed by Admiral David R. Morris, the U.S. Navy second-in-command in Europe.
