Hong Kong deputies to the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) and members of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (NPC) [as received] expressed their stand while attending the current NPC session and the second session of the CPPCC National Committee. Delivering a government work report this morning, Premier Li Peng expressed the hope that the Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will unite with the largest possible number of Hong Kong compatriots in preparing for the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, its first government and its legislature. Tsang Hin Chi, Liu Yiu Chu, Tsang Yok Sing and Tsui Sze Man, members of the Preliminary Working Committee, said that the committee will live up to the expectation of the whole nation and make every effort to lay down a sound foundation for a smooth transition. Tsang Hin Chi, vice-chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and chairman of the Goldlion (Far East) Co., Ltd., said the British Government has adopted an uncooperative attitude on the issue of the political structure in Hong Kong when the British colonial rule will come to an end in Hong Kong soon. In such a case, it accords with the will of the people to accelerate work pace of the Preliminary Working Committee, which is confronted with an arduous task and great responsibility. Solicitor Liu Yiu Chu said the Preliminary Working Committee is confident in its work no matter what happens. They said Premier Li Peng's remark on Hong Kong issue in his report shows China's determination and ability to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. Tsang Yok Sing, member of the CPPCC National Committee and chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, said that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten tabled to the Legislative Council the remaining parts of his political reform bill on March 9. This is a another serious and uncooperative step that the British Hong Kong authorities have taken to insist on their stand of violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the convergence with the basic law and agreements and understandings reached between China and Britain. He said that the Preliminary Working Committee is proceeding in a planned way. Whatever attitude and step the British side and British Hong Kong authorities will adopt will have no impact on the work of the Preliminary Working Committee which started its work under the non-cooperation of the British side from the very beginning. Tsui Sze Man, a Standing Committee member of the CPPCC National Committee, exposed British Hong Kong authorities' hypocrisy in spreading "accelerating democracy." The Preliminary Working Committee will listen to opinions of Hong Kong people, unite with all the forces that can be united with and make contributions to the smooth transition and maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
