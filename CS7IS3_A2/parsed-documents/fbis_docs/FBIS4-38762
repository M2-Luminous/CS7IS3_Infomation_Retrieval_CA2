First Deputy Chairman Abdujalil Dostiyev of the country's Supreme Soviet told INTERFAX that the refugees who had fought for the opposition in the civil war would not be prosecuted because they were covered by the amnesty. Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov said that no final date had been set for the Tehran talks. He would not mention any date so as not to harm the negotiating process. Alimov said that there would be no changes in the Tajik Government delegation. INTERFAX Note: In the Moscow round of talks on 5-19 April the two sides agreed on the agenda which includes now a ceasefire, return of the refugees and subsequent consultations. The opposition, notably Akbar Turajonzoda, one of its leaders, wants the government delegation, now headed by Labor and Employment Minister Shukurjon Zukhurov, to be upgraded. Observers in Dushanbe are concerned that the recent killings of Russian border guards in Tajikistan may have a negative impact on the talks. Meanwhile, General Anatoliy Kuptsov, deputy security minister, dismissed the speculation that these killings were politically motivated. He said that these were common crimes.
