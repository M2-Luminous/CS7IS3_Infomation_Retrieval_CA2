Hungary was represented by Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky, International Economic Relations Minister Bela Kadar, Transportation Minister Gyorgy Schamschula, and Minister of Industry and Trade Janos Latorcai. The Russian negotiating group included Telecommunications Minister Vladimir Bulgak, Foreign Economics Minister Oleg Davidov, Nuclear Energy Minister Vitaly Mikhaylov, Deputy Finance Minister Andrei Vavilov, and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Krilov. Hungarian Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman told the press that the talks focussed mainly on bilateral economic cooperation. The two prime ministers agreed that unresolved issues outstanding from the past should be quickly settled, including Russia's debt to Hungary, so that efforts can be concentrated on strengthening business ties. Herman said the $800-900 million which Russia owes Hungary could be repayed through the participation of Hungarian companies in Russian privatization, the use of non-commercial services, or machine deliveries. The possibility of further arms purchases was also raised, though Hungary would prefer modern market methods of debt repayment which promote economic relations. Ministry leaders are to spend the next day-and-a-half discussing debt settlement. It is hoped that an agreement on this issue will be signed during Chernomyrdin's visit. The two prime ministers noted with satisfaction that bilateral trade has stopped declining and conditions have been created for an increase in the near future. Chernomyrdin said Moscow hopes Hungary will move ahead from the 7th place it presently takes among Russia's trading partners. Boross believes Hungary could mainly increase its exports of farm and food products, medicines and buses. Regarding the Hungarian-Russian basic treaty, Chernomyrdin said that while the former parliament was unable to approve it, there is now a good chance for ratification. Touching on the South Slav crisis, the Russian prime minister stressed that Moscow will do all it can for a peaceful settlement as soon as possible, which he noted was also in Hungary's best interest. The two heads of government voiced agreement that political relations are settled and progressing fairly well between the two countries.
