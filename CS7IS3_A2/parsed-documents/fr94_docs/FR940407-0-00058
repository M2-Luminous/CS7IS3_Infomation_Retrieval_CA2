FR940407-0-00058 FR940407-0-00012 The program revisions addressed by Colorado's final application include the first, second, and third third land disposal restrictions, mining waste exclusions, revisions to the Toxicity Characteristic, standards for incinerators, tanks and miscellaneous units, and ground water monitoring. Certain of the land disposal restriction provisions are not delegable to states. EPA is not authorizing Colorado for these non-delegable provisions, which include 40 CFR 268.5; 268.6; 268.42(b); and 268.44. Federal regulations allow exemptions to certain of the land disposal restrictions for certain wastes that are disposed of in injection wells. Since Colorado does not allow the disposal of hazardous waste in injection wells, their program is more stringent that the federal program for these provisions. Some of the federal land disposal restrictions imposed time-limited prohibitions against land disposal of certain wastes. Since Colorado's date of adoption of these regulatory provisions in many cases was after the time-limited prohibition expired, the Colorado regulations do not include these prohibitions or impose a later effective date for the prohibition than the date set forth in the corresponding federal regulation. These differing dates do not affect the equivalency of Colorado's program, since prior violations of these prohibitions remains enforceable by EPA under federal regulation. Colorado has not requested hazardous waste program authority on Indian Country. EPA retains all hazardous waste authority under RCRA which applies to Indian Country in Colorado. C. Decision I conclude that Colorado's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Colorado is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. Colorado now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations of the HSWA. Colorado also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. In addition, Colorado has agreed to submit a draft application for remaining provisions from Non-HSWA Clusters III&hyph;VI, HSWA Clusters I and II, and RCRA Cluster I and partial Cluster II in April 1994. The final application will be submitted within 60 working days of receipt of EPA's comments on the draft application. Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability of certain federal regulations in favor of Colorado's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
