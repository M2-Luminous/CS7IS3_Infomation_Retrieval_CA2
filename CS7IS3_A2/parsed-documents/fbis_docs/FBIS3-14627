Through the investigations opened by the security services on the assassination of a Russian national yesterday in Saoula, south of the capital, it became clear that the Russian national used to frequent a spare-parts merchant and an ironmonger in the area. The same sources pointed out that the victim had made an application to the two merchants to buy certain products 10 days earlier and arrived at the specified time in the same car he was using to receive the merchandise. This gave his assassins a chance to seize him, then assassinate him. The same sources said that the security services, which immediately surrounded the place after they were informed of the operation, succeeded in killing and identifying four of the six armed members. The matter concerns Seddou Said, Chalmouh Ahmed, and Boutiche Yazid, who lived in Ouled Fayek and Douira [only three names as received]. The two armed persons sought out by the security services are Kisoume Omar and Zitouni Djamal. The security sources reported that the search is still under way for Sayeh Atia, the main executor of the assassination of the governor of Tissemsilt and members of the accompanying delegation on 11 January last.
