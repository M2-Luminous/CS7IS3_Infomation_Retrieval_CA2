Washington imposed tariffs of 360.95 percent Wednesday, based on a preliminary ruling by the Commerce Department that Fuji Photo Film was selling the products in the U.S. at less than fair market value. The decision stems from a petition filed by Eastman Kodak Co. of the U.S., charging the Japanese company with selling photographic paper in the U.S. at only a quarter of the prices it charges for identical products in Japan. A Fuji Photo Film executive said, "it is Eastman Kodak that can decide prices in the U.S. market and we cannot understand the allegation that Fuji is dumping its products to harm the U.S. industry." Regarding the huge margin of the penalty tariffs, he said the way they were calculated was not clear. As reasons for the lower prices of the products in the U.S., the official cited the yen's appreciation against the dollar, sales incentive rewards, and costs of other services for processing laboratories in Japan.
