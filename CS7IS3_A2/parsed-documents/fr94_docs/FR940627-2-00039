CFDA: 93.608 Child Welfare Research and Demonstration: Section 426 of the Social Security Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 626. 7. Priority Area 1.01C␣National Resource Center for Organizational Improvement. Child welfare agencies confront demanding management and human resource development issues. In regard to management issues, agencies are faced with the formidable task of developing, implementing and evaluating an expanding range of programs and services for more varied and challenging families and children. These programs and services are often funded under broad and complex legislation and accompanying regulations which delineate appropriate agency practices and behaviors. Often embedded in child welfare statutes and regulations are criteria to which agencies are held accountable. Agencies find it challenging to simultaneously establish a broader repertoire of service programs and meet mounting accountability and regulatory requirements. Agencies' ability to blend funding streams and link programs to provide more holistic services to families and children is daunting but doable. In regard to human resources, the idiosyncracies of State civil service systems, pressures for professional licensure of social service agency staff, the inherent rigidity of bureaucratic systems, and high turnover rates at all levels complicate and often compromise the ability of agencies to attend and respond to staffing needs. This subsequently impairs the ability of staff to meet the needs of families and children.
