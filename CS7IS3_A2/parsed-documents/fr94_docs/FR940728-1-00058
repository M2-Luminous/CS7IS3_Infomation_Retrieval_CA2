FR940728-1-00058 FR940728-1-00018 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) ensures that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The FAA estimates that no small entity would incur incremental compliance costs. Therefore, the FAA has determined that a regulatory flexibility analysis is not necessary. International Trade Impact Assessment The proposed rule would neither have an effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States, nor would it have an effect on the sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries. This is because the proposed rule would neither impose costs on aircraft operators nor on U.S. or foreign aircraft manufacturers. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposal, if adopted, provides for no changes to the required reporting of information by air carrier and commuter operators to the FAA. Under the requirements of the Federal Paperwork Reduction Act, the Office of Management and Budget has approved the information collection provision of subpart S through August 31, 1995. OMB Approval Number 2120&hyph;0524 has been assigned to subpart S. Federalism Implications The proposals set forth herein would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this regulation, if adopted, would not have federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion For the reasons set forth above, the FAA has determined that this proposal (1) Would not be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; and (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Further, I certify that under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, this proposal would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
