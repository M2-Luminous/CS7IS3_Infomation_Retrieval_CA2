The minister said that Arturo Bronstein, chief of the Legislation Section of the ILO headquartered in Geneva, sent him a letter dated 20 December describing the reforms as "important advances over the current Labor Code." In the letter, Bronstein stressed that "the reforms follow the draft recommended by the ILO to a great extent." These reforms were made known in the "Forum for Economic and Social Consensus" formed by government, labor, and private enterprise sectors. The ILO had recommended two changes to Articles 211, 214, and 228 dealing with the protection of union founders. Nevertheless, the minister explained that those articles referred to the "promoters," not the founders, as a result of which Bronstein expressed his total acceptance of the draft. The Labor Ministry presented the Labor Code reforms to the Legislative Assembly at the end of 1993. The ILO's support of the reforms are in addition to the favorable report on labor rights issued by the U.S. Commerce Department. The reforms were made in response to intense pressure from the U.S. Government, which threatened to suspend the Generalized System of Preferences under which some Salvadoran products are exempt from import duties. Some say that the ILO is dependent on U.S. trade unions interested in promoting trade unionism in the Third World. Many analysts believe the new code might reactivate labor agitation in the country and block the reconstruction process. Salvadoran union leaders have accused the government of breaking the "consensus" by presenting the draft reforms, indicating that they do not agree with some points. Nevertheless, the Legislative Assembly will have the last word.
