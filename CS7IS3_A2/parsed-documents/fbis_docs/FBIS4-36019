The international community should bear in mind the support Khmer Rouge and Saddam Husayn got from successive British governments, therefore, it should not come as a surprise to find out that the Serbs are also included in the list of British allies regardless of their atrocities against humanity. One used to believe that the British politicians were more clever than accusing Iran of forging foreign policy documents already known to the public. British allies, led by the United States, could only hope now that London government will come up with something more concrete and convincing against Iran next time. Keeping in mind the level of British politicians' intelligence, as witnessed recently, the world has to wait for quite a long time to hear a single convincing argument against Iran from the British side.
