"I think it was a victory for our country's security," Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend (Austrian People's Party) told DIE PRESSE on Tuesday evening [11 January]. Effective 1 January 1994, the duration of alternative national service will be 11 months. A further extension to 12 months could come into force beginning 1 January 1995, if the number of applications for alternative service between 1 May and 31 October 1994 exceeds 3,000. The new regulation will remain in force until the end of 1995. Unless a further regulation is agreed before the end of 1995, both the board examining reasons of conscience and the eight-month period of alternative service will be reintroduced. This is the compromise agreed upon yesterday by Fasslabend and Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak (Social Democratic Party of Austria), after consultations with their respective party chairmen. Fasslabend said: "Our patience did pay off. I think it is important that the government has found a solution." Interior Minister Loeschnak said that he did not expect an extension to 12 months.
