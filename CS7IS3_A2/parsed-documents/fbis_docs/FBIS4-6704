Nagaoka said the study will focus on ways to reduce listing costs, and the exchange will accept some documents prepared in English by foreign firms to provide investment information to customers. Measures are needed to internationalize the market's operations as the English language sphere, including Asia, is expanding, he said. He added, however, that details of the study have yet to be worked out. Nagaoka took a cautious attitude toward the listing of Asian companies on the Tokyo market. Economic development in Asian countries has made extensive progress but measures to protect investors have to be studied, he said.
