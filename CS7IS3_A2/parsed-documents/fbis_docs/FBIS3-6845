[prefecture], March 20 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura on Sunday [20 March] told the graduating class of the National Defense Academy that Japan should reconsider its defense policies in the post-cold war world. "Considering the changes in the international situation since the end of the cold war and the remarkable progress in science and technology, it is important, with regard to the way the defensive strength of our nation should be, that the government indicate a new fundamental thinking," Takemura said. Takemura spoke on behalf of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who has been in China for a three-day official visit since Saturday. Defense Agency [DA] chief Kazuo Aichi also said Japan must have a more divergent way of thinking than in the past on the defense of the nation in the post-cold war era. "The role of the Self-Defense Forces which positively contributes to the peace and stability of the world through the United Nations will continue to grow larger," said Aichi, indicating a future increase in Japan's participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations.
