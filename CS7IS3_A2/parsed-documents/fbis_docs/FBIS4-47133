The Sootechestvenniki [Fellow Countrymen] Russian Foundation for Assistance to Refugees was the congress' organizer. Present at the congress were more than 500 delegates representing regional organizations from almost all of Russia. In essence, for the first time since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the refugees showed themselves to be an impressive and quite well organized force. As Boris Sergeyev, chairman of the Fellow Countrymen foundation, reported to those present, even now, around 600,000 refugees have been officially registered in Russia. However, in the foundation chairman's opinion, the actual number of forced migrants is much higher, since many of them are living illegally in the USSR's legal successor. According to Sergeyev's estimates, in the next few years, the number of refugees from the outlying districts of the crumbled empire will exceed 6 million persons. The refugees' relations with the Russian authorities are far from ideal and the congress' course demonstrated this fact conclusively once again. The tone of the speech of the Federal Migration Service's (FMS) administrator, Tatyana Regent, was "repentantly self-justifying": "Our service is guilty of failing you, since it answers for both the government and the president and even for the dissolute parliament." The FMS' administrator frankly warned them not to expect an easy life and that, in the future, things will be very difficult. The pessimistic notes which crept into Regent's speech did not stop her from trying to convince those present that the FMS' activities cannot be considered useless and that her department is managing all the same to do something. According to Tatyana Regent's assertions, several ministries and departments, under the guidance of the Ministry of Justice, are currently working on supplements to the laws previously adopted by the old Supreme Soviet on refugees and forced resettlers. The migration service is also advocating having the passport offices subordinated directly to it, which would make it easier for the refugees to obtain Russian citizenship and residence permits. Currently, a draft of a new Russian Land Code is being drawn up in the State Duma and the FMS wants to set up a special land fund for refugees and resettlers. The matter of the exemption of the refugees from taxes and the granting of preferential credits to them is being decided. Thus, as of 1 May of this year, refugee families consisting of three persons are being given interest-free credit in the amount of 3 million rubles for the construction of housing. The Russian Government is also holding talks with the CIS states about them paying compensation to the refugees, however, in the opinion of the FMS' administrator, the hopes for quick progress are slim. Tatyana Regent emphasized that Moscow's financial and credit policies in the states of the near abroad are directly tied to the situation of the Russian-speaking populations in them. Unfortunately, the speech's stressed sincerity and unofficial tone could not shake the skepticism of those present. It was enough to look at the delegates' faces and to listen to the remarks from the audience to be convinced that they do not love Tatyana Regent here and they do not trust her department. This purely subjective impression was completely confirmed by the congress' resolution which the delegates also intend to send to Russia's president. The delegates decreed that: 1. The Fellow Countrymen foundation shall be recognized as the official intermediary between the resettlement organizations and the Russian Federation Government, local organs of power and the various departments. 2. The subsidies from Moscow for the construction of housing and enterprises for refugees should be sent to the Fellow Countrymen foundation. In essence, the congress' decision transfers all the FMS' basic functions to the Fellow Countrymen foundation, leaving for the state structure only the role of sponsor. It is hardly worthwhile discussing now the how well founded the refugees' grudges against the FMS officials are and how successfully the non-state foundation is able to handle the official department's tasks. Something else is much more interesting: the refugees' "condemnation" is being automatically transferred to the Russian authorities as well. In fact, the FMS is the official structure and its disregard of the needs of the migrants (as they see themselves) is being identified with the position of Russia's leadership. And although currently, the Fellow Countrymen foundation's leadership is not ceasing to emphasize that the organization is not pursuing any political goals -- the temptation to win over to its side the hundreds of thousands of embittered people who "no longer have anything to lose" is extraordinarily great for all political parties. It is worth noting that the first such attempt has already been undertaken at the congress: the presidium received a note from delegates from Orel Oblast (one of the signatures belonged to the head of the FMS' oblast division) with the suggestion that a board of trustees be established for the refugees under the chairmanship of Sergay Shakhray and that Tatyana Regent be appointed his first deputy. And even though the refugees voted down this proposal, no one knows how they will regard others.
