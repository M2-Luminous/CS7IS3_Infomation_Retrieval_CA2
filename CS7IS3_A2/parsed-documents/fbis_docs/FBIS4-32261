Geoffrey Pattie, head of the delegation, said in the meeting that "Albania is a significant country for the European Democratic Union" adding "we like to come here to follow the development of the democratic process." Later he expressed interest in the vision of the Republican Party of Albania on this question. Fatmir Veliu, deputy chairman of the Republican Party, underlined that the Republican Party has made and continues to make all efforts to strengthen the democratic right wing against social communist threat. Only a total engagement of the Albanian political right wing forces, he said, can uproot communism and cleanse the state administration form its collaborators. The Republican Party, Mr. Veliu said further on, has energetically rejected the latest decision of the parliament on compensating the site with vouchers supporting the view that the real value of the land can be defined only with the realisation of the real bargain market, which is attained with the restitution of property to their owners. Mr. Geoffrey Pattie, on behalf of the European Democratic Union thanked those present for their briefing and said that the Republican Party makes up an increasing tendency for the Albanian public. He also gave explanations about the documentation and ways to be followed for the Republican Party's membership to the European Democratic Union. On the same day, Mr. Pattie held a meeting with Albanian reporters during which views were exchanged about the Albanian mass media, the role it plays during the present democratic developments in Albania and about the application of the Law of the Press, recently approved by the majority of the Albanian reporters. The participants in the meeting also spoke of the freedoms and rights as well as of the difficulties the Albanian reporters are faced with today.
