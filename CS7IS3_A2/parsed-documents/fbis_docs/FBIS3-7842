What is the reason for such a surge of interest in military education? [Sliwinski] The Army gives people concrete skills and occupations. After graduating from a military school, a young man has a guaranteed job with us, a substantial salary, and the promise of getting an apartment soon--in other words, prospects of security and stability. Young men are increasingly eager to join our establishments. It is not that they follow a fashionable trend--rather, it is their chosen way of planning their lives. [Larecki] Let us begin with university-type schools, which educate their students to master's degree level. [Sliwinski] There are three well-known educational establishments at that level: the Military Technical Academy in Warsaw, the Military Medical Academy in Lodz, and the Naval Academy in Gdynia. [Larecki] What about other higher education establishments? [Sliwinski] After the planned reorganization, we will recruit students to four establishments training students to the level of higher technical college education. These will be: the Tadeusz Kosciuszko Officers College in Wroclaw, the Stefan Czarniecki Officers College in Poznan, the Jozef Bem Officers College in Torun, and the Air Force Officers College in Deblin. [Larecki] There is a particularly large number of applicants hoping to join warrant officers schools. [Sliwinski] We have 14 such schools in the country, with a range of specialized profiles--for example, mechanized troops, engineering troops, signals troops, air force, military police, and navy. These schools train students to the level of technical high school education. In addition, there are four noncommissioned officers schools training students to the level of occupational colleges: the Navy College in Ustka, the Military College of Music in Gdansk, the Air Force College in Deblin, and the General Military College in Czestochowa. [Larecki] What documents are required for admission to military colleges? [Sliwinski] An application, in preset questionnaire format, to join the given college (application forms are available on request from the Military Clearing Centers), two photographs, a handwritten curriculum vitae, the original copy of the graduation certificate from the relevant occupational college or high school, a reference or recommendation document from the school (if the application is submitted in the year of graduation), a copy of the birth certificate (if the candidate does not yet have a full or provisional identification document), a signed declaration undertaking to perform professional military service for a period determined by the parliamentary act on professional military service, a reference or recommendation from any social or political organizations to which the candidate may belong, and, if previously employed, a reference from the latest employer. The documents should be submitted at the appropriate Military Clearing Center during the months of March and April. Candidates will have to sit examinations in mathematics, physics, and a foreign language, and also a current affairs knowledge test. [Larecki] What if a candidate does not want to study but just to do career service instead? [Sliwinski] He has two recently created military career opportunities open to him. The first is a five-year contract service for officers, ensigns, and noncommissioned officers. This can be extended by another five years twice, so that the total length of contract service can be 15 years. The other possibility is extended basic national service, which will be offered for up to four years. [Larecki] A scheme has been launched whereby students of university-level military academies are sent to do their study courses abroad. [Sliwinski] Yes, at some of the more distinguished American and French military academies. Admission is contingent on the candidate's passing an examination in the appropriate language at the relevant country's embassy in Poland. [Larecki] Thank you for talking to us.
