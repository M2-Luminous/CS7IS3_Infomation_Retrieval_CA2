China adviser [on Hong Kong affairs] Zhu Zhimin told journalists that Xi was tried and convicted in mid-February. He is expected to be given a suspended sentence. That would mean that the MING PAO journalist would be freed immediately and allowed to return to Hong Kong with his employer acting as guarantor. Xi Yang was arrested in Beijing last September and charged with stealing state secrets.
