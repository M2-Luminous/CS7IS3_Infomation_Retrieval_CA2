SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In 1980, Western began examining its marketing criteria for long-term capacity and energy sales from the SLCA/IP. Existing long-term contracts were due to expire in 1989, and sufficient time was needed for customers to make other contractual arrangements based on their final allocations of SLCA/IP power. Western proceeded to develop the Post-1989 General Power Marketing Criteria and Allocation Criteria for the Salt Lake City Area, and completed an EA in late 1985. DOE approved a finding of no significant impact on January 8, 1986. In response to controversy over the potential environmental effects of the proposed marketing criteria, Western announced its intent to prepare an EIS on its power marketing and allocation criteria in the April 4, 1990, Federal Register (FR) (55 FR 12550). Western's Salt Lake City Area Office markets electricity produced at hydroelectric facilities operated by the Bureau of Reclamation largely on the Upper Colorado River. The facilities are known collectively as the SLCA/IP and include dams equipped for power generation on the Green, Gunnison, Rio Grande, and Colorado Rivers. These facilities are located in the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. Of these facilities, only the Glen Canyon Unit, the Flaming Gorge Unit, and the Aspinall Unit (which includes Blue Mesa, Morrow Point, and Crystal Dams) are currently influenced by Western power marketing and transmission decisions. The operation of these facilities and their potential environmental impacts are analyzed in the draft EIS. Up to nine hydropower operational scenarios were developed for each generation facility to assess the range of possible operational impacts. Western developed seven EIS alternatives, called commitment level alternatives, which reflect the range of combinations of capacity and energy which would feasibly and reasonably fulfill Western's firm power marketing responsibilities, needs, and statutory obligations. Operational scenarios at each facility were combined to form various SLCA/IP supply options, which were in turn paired with the commitment level alternatives in order to conduct air quality, economic, and financial analyses. The draft EIS evaluates the potential impacts of these alternatives, including no action, no socioeconomics, air resources, water resources, ecological resources, cultural resources, land use, recreation, and visual resources. Western is actively seeking public input on the draft EIS in order to make a decision on a preferred alternatives. No preferred alternative is identified in the draft EIS for this reason. A decision on a preferred alternative will be made after considering comments on the draft EIS, and that alternative will be identified in the final EIS. Issued at Washington, DC, March 23, 1994. Joel K. Bladow, Assistant Administrator for Washington Liaison. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7266 Filed 3&hyph;24&hyph;94; 11:13 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P&hyph;M
