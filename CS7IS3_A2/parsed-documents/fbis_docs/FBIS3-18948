The move was being made as a matter of urgency to help implement a Security Council resolution on restoring essential public services in the Bosnian capital, he said. France has more than 6,000 troops in former Yugoslavia, forming the largest UNPROFOR contingent. Half are in Bosnia, including 2,400 at Sarajevo. The redeployment to strengthen the French units in and around Sarajevo was also announced by government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy after the weekly cabinet meeting. He made the point that it was not a question of increasing France's UNPROFOR strength but of carrying out a redeployment. French troops in Sarajevo meanwhile cleared away the last of the landmines and other defences dug in in 22 months of war at the Brotherhood and Unity bridge linking the Serb district of Grbavica to the rest of the city. The French moved in a month ago when the current ceasefire took effect. The bridge still remains out of bounds to civilians however, in the absence of a political agreement between Bosnians and Serbs on restoring normal traffic.
