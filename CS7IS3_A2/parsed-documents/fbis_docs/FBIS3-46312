As for the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear issue, he gave an optimistic assessment, saying: "In part, there are encouraging signs. If all those concerned make efforts to continue dialogue, an appropriate solution will be found eventually." In explaining China's exports of oil to North Korea, he said, "China and North Korea will in the future continue to further normal economic trade relations, based on the principle of equality and reciprocity." He thus hinted that China's policy is to continue to export oil to North Korea in 1994 at least at the level of that of 1993. As far as the matter of exporting oil to North Korea is concerned, a U.S. State Department spokesman recently talked about the possibility of imposing sanctions on North Korea if negotiations with that country fail. The PRC Foreign Ministry official's remarks can be said to have confirmed China's stand of not being willing to cooperate in an effort to ban oil exports to North Korea. The official indicated that China is urging North Korea to accept dialogue on the nuclear question, for he said, "We have always said to all the people concerned that what is needed is dialogue and not confrontation." Asked about the economic situation of North Korea, the official insisted, "China does not interfere in or comment on the domestic affairs of any other nation," but he still assessed the policy recently announced by North Korean President Kim Il-song of "giving top priority to trade, agriculture, and light industry" as being an "important strategic policy in the economic sector." He welcomed the new policy, noting, "We hope that North Korea will be successful in improving the national economy and the living standards of the people by implementing the new policy." It is unusual for an official of China's responsible bodies to comment specifically on North Korea's economic policy. The Chinese Government appears to be positively accepting North Korea's new policy of placing emphasis on opening up the country and improving the people's living conditions. When asked whether there was no possibility of resuming negotiations with the United Kingdom over the Hong Kong question, the official only criticized the United Kingdom and noted that China will hasten with preparations for the return of Hong Kong.
