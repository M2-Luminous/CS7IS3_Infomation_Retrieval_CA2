Trade between Switzerland and Russia currently stands at a relatively low level. The agreement will replace similar agreements that were concluded with the Soviet Union. In a news conference after the signing, Delamuraz made it clear that the agreement laid down the most important GATT principles for trade with Russia -- first of all, the principle of the most-favored-nation status and non-discrimination. Of major importance are also the regulations on improving the protection of the rights to intellectual property and the definition of those areas of economic cooperation that should be intensified with priority. In a news conference, Delamuraz, who has been accompanied to Moscow by leading representatives of the Swiss business, made a point in stating that he was the first representative of the Swiss Government to visit the new Russia. He described as most successful and constructive his talks with Chernomyrdin. In answering a question regarding the banker's discretion, Delamuraz emphasized that Switzerland would try to strictly apply the money laundering article. In connection with the issue of aid, he referred to the East Europe credit, a sizable part of which will go to the CIS countries. Before his departure, Delamuraz described trade between Switzerland and Russia as insufficient and far beneath what was possible -- and quite rightly so: In 1993, the official trade volume was 700 million Swiss francs, which is hardly worth mentioning compared to the 2 billion francs in the Soviet era (which was not a lot at the time either). Imports to Switzerland reached 376 million francs, while exports to Russia stood at 327 million francs. Compared with the previous year, this means an increase by 12 percent (imports) and 23 percent (exports); however, in view of the almost insignificantly low overall trade volume, these figures are hardly relevant. The 5-percent growth in imports in the first quarter of 1994 and the 80-percent increase in exports should not be overestimated, either, particularly since the Russian Government currently appears to be greatly inclined to deter potential investors with a flood of regulations and duties.
