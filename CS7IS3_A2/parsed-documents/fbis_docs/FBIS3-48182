He thus drove a wedge in the criticism being made by the people within the DP. When reporters commented that there is a possibility that his visit to the North may be used by North Korea, he said: "From my political statesmanship point of view, I firmly believe that by no means will I be embroiled in North Korea's reunification front strategy. I believe that anyone, including government officials, can work to dissolve the current stalemate existing between the South and North." Executive Chairman Yi, who has been trying to visit China, postponed his visit because no substantial results were achieved by his special envoy who visited China recently.
