Correspondent Konstandinos Dhimtsas has the following report from Maximos Palace. [Begin Dhimtsas recording] EU Commissioner Van den Broek will have a new meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias at the Foreign Ministry tomorrow as the most important EU initiative on Skopje unfolds. The EU commissioner reportedly told the prime minister that in Skopje he found a climate of goodwill to resume the dialogue with Greece under the auspices of the United Nations. He also presented a letter from Gligorov to Papandreou. The main points of Gligorov's letter are: Skopje seeks a dialogue on all the issues on the foreign ministerial level in a third country under UN auspices. If Greece does not revoke the sanctions against Skopje, Gligorov said, his country will file an appeal to the UN Security Council and the CSCE. In a statement, Foreign Minister Papoulias described Commissioner Van den Broek's effort as positive. We hope, he said, that it will continue. The EU commissioner said the EU is in full agreement with Greece and Gligorov agrees that good neighborly relations are essential for the survival of his statelet. Prime Minister Papandreou's reply to EU Commission President Jacques Delors is being drawn up in the prime minister's office. In his letter, the prime minister will support that taking counter measures against Skopje is a political issue. The letter will also stress that the measures that concern the national sovereignty, history, and security of our country cannot be seen as issues of customs or trade. Papandreou will also outline legal arguments stressing that Greece's decision does not violate international or EU law and will recall that Greece has signed no accord on surrounding states.
