INTERFAX has reported that "Wintershall" and "Verbundnetz Gaz" reported Thursday [20 January] that they had managed to reach a last-minute compromise on the price of Russian gas and thereby avert the termination of deliveries of it to the FRG's eastern Laender. It was announced that this month the sides will sign a long-term contract for gas deliveries from Russia.
