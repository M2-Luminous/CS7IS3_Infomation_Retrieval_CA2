Mr Buthelezi accused the ANC and the government of colluding to keep the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] out of the election by not allowing the mediators to consider a change in the election dates. An irate Mr Buthelezi accused the government and the ANC of reneging on the terms of reference agreed to between the ANC and the IFP at the weekend. The international mediators, including Henry Kissinger and Lord Carrington were holed up in a Johannesburg hotel room for discussions while Mr Buthelezi and his team waited in the lobby. They were due to have departed to a secret location to begin the mediation intended to resolve outstanding constitutional issues. Dr Kissinger, after a meeting with ANC President Nelson Mandela on Wednesday morning, said the mediators did not consider the election date to be part of the terms of reference. The initial terms of reference agreed to by a joint IFP/ANC working group on Sunday made no mention of the election dates. However, the IFP has consistently maintained that the resolution of constitutional differences that have so far kept it out of the elections would inevitably reopen the debate on the election dates. At the Skukuza summit last Friday, it was agreed that the government would join the mediation process as a full participant. Following this, new terms of reference had been drafted that specifically entrench April 26-28 as the election dates. Mr Buthelezi said he received the new draft on Tuesday night and that he objected to it. On Tuesday, ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa told the Transitional Executive Council he wanted to make it clear that a postponement of the election was not up for negotiation. In a reference to the IFP, Mr Ramaphosa said there were parties who still hoped the elections could be postponed. He was later involved with Deputy Constitutional Development Minister Fanus Schoeman in drawing up the new terms of reference. Mr Buthelezi said his negotiators would meet the ANC on Wednesday afternoon to try iron out their differences on the terms of reference. "The new draft (of the terms of reference) is not acceptable to us. The ANC and the government are trying to make sure there is no chance of discussing a new election date," he said. He said the ANC and the government had brought the mediators to South Africa under false pretences.
