The group is mainly discussing the social-economic development in the region, as explained by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. [Begin Amorim recording] The subjects are democracy, human rights, sustained development, and science and technology. This meeting obviously cannot exhaust all subjects, because it is merely the preparation for a process that will conclude with a presidential summit in September. Beside economic and social development, as well as poverty -- which are essential subjects -- I believe we will also discuss the possibility of a consensus on the hemispheric conference. [end recording] The election of the next OAS secretary general is another subject to be discussed in this Rio Group meeting.
