FR940728-0-00058 FR940728-0-00019 VI. Rationale for Not Excluding Recovered Oil That Is Inserted Into the Petroleum Refining Process After Crude Distillation or Catalytic Cracking (i.e., Into a Petroleum Coker) Today's final rule is narrower in scope than the January 8, 1988 notice in that the Agency is not finalizing the proposed exclusion of recovered oil that is converted to petroleum coke. EPA is deferring the exclusion at this time because EPA lacks data assuring that hazardous constituents from petroleum refining do not end up in the product in quantities that, when such product is utilized as a fuel, could be harmful to human health and the environment. EPA is also concerned that toxic constituents, such as heavy metals, can be discarded by simple incorporation into the coke product. In effect, the product would be used as a disposal medium for toxic constituents, and so could be part of the ``waste disposal problem.'' The Agency also lacks sufficient data to show whether oil recovered from refinery wastewater treatment systems contains toxic metals that are not present in the normal feed to a petroleum coker. Such metals could end up in the coke product. In contrast, the Agency is excluding recovered oil inserted at or before a point in the refining process designed to remove toxic metal and organic contaminants, i.e., prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. See 50 FR 28725 (July 15, 1985) and 50 FR 49169 (November 29, 1985). As explained there, the distillation process splits the feedstock into fractions based on the differing boiling points of feedstock components. Data submitted by API at that time indicated that most metals concentrate in the heavier petroleum fractions, thereby increasing the probability of contaminant removal from many fuel fractions produced using distillation (and other contaminant-removing processes). See 50 FR 49170. Although the proposed exclusion of recovered oil that is converted to petroleum coke is not being finalized in today's rule, for different reasons EPA is slightly amending the regulatory exemption at §261.6(a)(3)(vii) (redesignated §261.6(a)(3)(vi) in today's rule) for petroleum coke produced using oil-bearing refinery hazardous waste. The exemption states that such coke is subject to regulation only if it exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste. (The exemption recites the provisions of RCRA section 3004(q)(2)(A).) The purpose of the statute, and the exemption, is to allow petroleum companies to recycle their oily refinery waste to their petroleum coker, without automatically subjecting the coke output to the rules applicable to hazardous waste fuels. (Such automatic effect could occur without the exemption, if listed wastes are being reinserted into the coker, because of the derived-from rule.) S. Rept. No. 298, 98th Cong. 1st Sess. 39 (1983). Both the statutory and current regulatory exemption, however, are worded so as to apply only to situations where petroleum coke is produced from hazardous wastes ``at the same facility at which such wastes were generated *␣*␣*''. EPA believes that this limitation is unnecessarily narrow, and does not foreclose a regulatory expansion. In particular, so long as a petroleum refinery is coking its own wastes, it should not matter whether the coker is located at the site where wastes are generated or at a different facility. Since the generator and coker operator remain the same entity (or ``person'', as defined in §260.10) there is sufficient guarantee that hazardous wastes of unknown or uncertain composition will not be used in the coking process, which is the evident concern behind the limitation in the statute. Cf. 50 FR at 28725 (July 15, 1985); 50 FR 49170 (Nov. 29, 1985). Since the hazardous wastes would remain regulated under RCRA when they are generated, transported, and stored prior to recycling, id., potential concerns regarding tracking are also addressed. EPA also sees no difference in the composition of coke produced partially from on-site and off-site hazardous wastes when the coke is produced by the same entity. Consequently, the Agency is slightly broadening the current regulatory exemption so that it applies to coke produced by a single petroleum refining entity, even if the coker is located at a different facility from where the hazardous wastes are generated. Finally, the coking process itself continues to be exempt from RCRA regulation as a recycling unit, provided this recycling is legitimate. Section 261.6(c)(1) (``The recycling process itself is exempt from regulation except as provided in §261.6(d).''). Today's rule does not affect this provision. VII. Rationale for Not Excluding Other Oil-Bearing Hazardous Materials Just as EPA is not excluding oil-bearing wastewaters from the definition of solid waste, it is not excluding other similar types of oil-bearing materials, such as hazardous wastewater treatment sludges. These materials are not composed primarily of oil; they are unlike raw materials normally used in the petroleum refining process; and the units in which they are managed_API separators, DAF units, land treatment units and surface impoundments_are not parts of the refining process, but rather function as waste holding and treatment units. In addition, there have been many damage incidents associated with management of such materials as toxic sludges from wastewater treatment, confirming that these materials are part of the waste disposal problem, rather than part of an on-going manufacturing operation. (See, for example, the Listing Background Documents for Hazardous Wastes K048&hyph;052 and F037&hyph;038.) For these reasons, the Agency continues to classify these materials as discarded, within the meaning of RCRA Section 1004 (27). Recovered oil that is obtained from such wastes, however, is excluded from the definition of solid waste under today's final rule (assuming the rule's conditions are satisfied). The Agency is also aware of various types of units designed to treat wastes K048&hyph;K052 and F037&hyph;F038, in order to reduce the volume and toxicity of these wastes, as well as to recover oil. See, e.g., 57 FR 37198 (August 18, 1992). EPA does not view these units as part of the manufacturing (i.e., refining) process, because such units are not part of a continuing series of unit operations that crack/distill/fractionate crude oil. The input to these units are materials such as wastewater treatment sludges, that contain relatively small amounts of oil. A different determination frustrates the Congressional objective that hazardous waste be treated properly. These types of units are the basis for treatment standards under the land disposal restrictions for K048&hyph;K052 and F037&hyph;F038. If the sludges treated in these units are no longer hazardous waste, they would not need to be treated by application of BDAT so as to minimize the threats they pose. Cf. API , 906 F. 2d at 741&hyph;742. Thus, excluding such sludges from jurisdiction until properly treated could contribute to the waste disposal problem that Congress sought to remedy. Finally, although EPA is not excluding these types of oil-bearing materials (such as hazardous wastewater treatment sludges), the units in which the recovery of oil is occurring may still be a type of recycling unit, and therefore may be exempt from RCRA permitting requirements under 40 CFR 261.6(c)(1).
