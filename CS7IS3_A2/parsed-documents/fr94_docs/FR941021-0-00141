FR941021-0-00141 FR941021-0-00021 One State agency requested that the Coast Guard require overfill devices on vessels which carry non-petroleum oils as cargo. A barge company submitted a comment recommending the continued exclusion of vessels carrying non-petroleum oil cargoes. In the NPRM, the Coast Guard explained that it is interested in addressing overfill spills of MARPOL Annex I oils because these products represent the most significant risk. They are the most frequently transported cargoes with the greatest volume transported and spilled. Non-petroleum oils are not MARPOL Annex I oils. The Coast Guard may extend the regulations to additional oils in the future, but for now will not impose overfill device regulations on tank vessels which exclusively carry non-petroleum oils. In accordance with 33 CFR 155.1015, this rule does not apply to foreign tank vessels engaged in innocent passage in the territorial sea. These vessels do not engage in cargo loading operations in U.S. waters and, therefore, the Coast Guard is not exercising jurisdiction over these vessels for this interim rulemaking. Minimum Standards for Overfill Devices: Tankers One comment from an industry association recommended that only one overfill alarm instead of two, as proposed in the NPRM, should be required in each tank. The comment argued that the standards for vapor recovery equipment should not be applied automatically to overfill devices because of the particular nature of vapor recovery. For vapor recovery systems, the potential for cargo tank overpressure and rupturing of vapor recovery piping dictated a two-alarm system. The Coast Guard agrees that one overfill alarm per cargo tank is sufficient and ยง155.480 has been revised to reflect this. This change also applies to cargo tanks with closed loading systems. Minimum Standards For Overfill Devices: Barges Much of the discussion in the NPRM concerning standards for overfill devices dealt with barges. Twelve comments responded to the question posed in the NPRM on whether a high level indicating device, such as a stick gauge, would be an adequate overfill warning device on a barge. Six comments, all from the barge industry, favored the use of stick gauges. At the public meeting, representatives from the barge industry stated that most barges currently have no overfill devices. In most cases, the level of liquid in a barge is determined by the use of sounding tapes, ullage measuring devices, or inspection ports. Several participants at the meeting expressed the view that adding an overfill alarm system for each tank would be extremely expensive for barge owners and operators. Barge owners and operators currently using stick gauges as well as the vapor recovery systems would incur significant costs if an additional alarm system were required.
