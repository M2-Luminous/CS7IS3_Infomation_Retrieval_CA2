This Is What the President of Tatarstan Promised in an Interview With NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Back in January"] [Text] Kazan, January--My meeting with Mintimer Shaymiyev, president of Tatarstan, was scheduled to take place at the Borovoye-Matyushino recreation center, at a guest dacha near Kazan. The leadership settlement is not that big--40 frame houses, not particularly aesthetic in appearance. The whole charm of the settlement is the forest and the age-old firs, the tops of which glisten with the white of frost and gleams of the sun. They are almost all two-family houses. The chairman of the Supreme Soviet is the neighbor of the mayor of Kazan. The atmosphere in the dachas is, I would say, simple. The guest house stands out in the settlement somewhat both by its external appearance and its interior. It was built by craftsmen from General Service Department. And the cottage had been furnished with imported furnishings, only the radio being of national production. Neither imported furniture nor foreign equipment catches the eye in the homes of the leadership. This detail of the life of the president's entourage and the president himself has probably performed a considerable role in the way in which relations between the first person of the state and his people have taken shape. There is not that glaring, striking difference in the living standard here: The apartment of the working professional, the lecturer at the higher educational institution, and the farmer of average means might be furnished in this way. [Vladina] I never cease to be amazed at the modesty of the furnishing of your home, in your office, and, now, at the dacha. What is this--a character trait of yours, or economics, or a specially cultivated style? [Shaymiyev] It is a rule of life. [Vladina] I remember the voice of the people: The old authorities had everything and thought about the people. The new ones--poor democrats--until they are through stealing, will not remember the people. [Shaymiyev] I would like to sincerely confess that I sometimes feel awkward at being better dressed when I meet people because, seeing today's low living standard, I do not consider that I have the right to wish for something further, over and above what is necessary. This could serve as an irritant. [Vladina] Yes, but the republic has, all the same, just one president.... [Shaymiyev] I understand, but, still. This depends on character, perhaps. But I cannot do otherwise. [Vladina] I was at your national theater, attending the premier of the youth show. It is a lively, sparkling performance, and the theater has survived since it is in receipt of a sizable government subsidy. Does this apply to the whole sphere of culture and research? How are you finding the means for this? [Shaymiyev] Three years ago our artistic unions, theaters, and cultural institutions were in a dreadfully calamitous state. That is what power is for--to help gifted people not only survive but create. After all, their gifts are God-given, can I compare myself with them?... In order to help them, we set up the Culture Support Fund. These are not just words; the fund operates. Each month the artistic unions meet and determine which writer, artist, or actor specifically needs assistance. We have given all theaters a subsidy, the actors have begun to travel more, and we support overseas travel. The artistic intelligentsia has gained a second wind, as it were.... We also now stage various contests, children's festivals, say. A song contest for the President's Prize was held recently. Small amounts, perhaps, but we allocate money for this. Last year we conducted a song festival-contest among adults. A $1,000 first prize was established. There are $1,000 also for the winners of the annual Chaliapin Festival, and contestants from overseas also take part. Practically all children from the kindergartens and schools take part in the children's festivals. Of course, there are expenses, big expenses, there is no denying that! But we believe that this is a matter of state importance and we do not begrudge the money, therefore. You yourself know how the people perceive this.... Nothing happens or emerges just like that, of its own accord--specially people's normal relationship with the state authorities. (I recalled how the president had responded to the heckling comments of people in the lower stands of the stadium at the time of the opening of the winter season--racing was starting. Everyone was in the grip of a common passion, having completely forgotten about ranks and titles. It was 20 below, and the stands were uncovered, and for this reason the president and his entourage stopped to warm themselves at small, unattractive-looking service areas. I was struck by an interesting detail here: Someone had closed the door to an adjoining room, where, most likely, people of a somewhat lower level were congregated. The president reacted instantly, and his eyes revealed a flash of dissatisfaction. "Open the door. We are all together." I saw the "iron" Mintimer [this is what his name sounds like in translation]) You have to work the whole time. This is strenuous work. Illusions pass. Everything is difficult, and I do not believe that it will get any easier in the future. Nonetheless, whenever I am in Moscow, I try to conclude each visit with a trip to the theater. The last time I went to see Rostand, Raykin's, and saw "Cyrano de Bergerac".... (And I suddenly hear the president performing: "Ah, me! I have long been capable of standing frozen in admiration "At the sight of grass or a gentle flower...") [Vladina] I was pleasantly gratified by the small number of commercial stalls in Kazan. The crime-breeding situation in the city is not, therefore, that dramatic, perhaps? [Shaymiyev] I would not judge the progress of market reform by the stalls. I do not believe that this is an indicator, because the formation of stock companies here is somewhat ahead of schedule now. We were for a long time criticized for not getting involved in this, but we needed to prepare thoroughly for this step. Large enterprises are now engaged in the formation of stock companies here, and progress is evident. [Vladina] Are you moving into first place among the CIS states? [Shaymiyev] Well, first or not first.... But what have we done? We have distributed the R10,000 vouchers to all our inhabitants. We added up--we had more property, and we opened supplementary accounts in savings banks for each inhabitant of the republic, children included. And such an account is called the registered privatization voucher--R30,000 in each of them. Auctions have now been held. And stock has been issued, and investment funds have appeared. [Vladina] And what about privatization of housing here? Has it begun? [Shaymiyev] No, we have not embarked on it yet. This is a very painful problem for us. We have studied the experience of Moscow and St. Petersburg. Many mistakes were made in Moscow, after all, and we sought our own approach. We are also investing with property people who have been on the waiting list for housing for a long time and who did not have such and the very neediest in order that these people retain at least some advantage: We are opening for them accounts supplementary to the R30,000 deposits.... And privatization of housing has worked. Everything has now been thought through, it would seem, and the value of the property to be privatized and the cost of garbage removal, operation of the elevator, and so on, and so forth have been determined. There have been mistakes in this plan also, perhaps; otherwise, whence the racketeering in housing--this is an appalling business.... In order to rid ourselves of this, we also have thought up some things: We have introduced a special drafting mechanism, which will help people to some extent. When it is a question specifically of the interests of an individual, everything needs to be given serious thought. For we are breaking with established principles for the first time, people have never been involved in this before, and it is, therefore, hard to foresee the various consequences. And all the criminal world does is keep a watch on where weak spots may emerge in order to take advantage of them at a rush. [Vladina] Culture, housing.... It is perfectly obvious that you are ahead of others here. And land? Is land reform under way here? [Shaymiyev] How many years can this game be played? Remember how the center spoke about private property at first: We will have done with the kolkhozes and sovkhozes, then we will give out the land. Then, prior to the elections, an edict appeared. Now, after the elections, Boris Nikolayevich makes changes to this edict: This and that was not done right, apparently, let us adjust it.... In a word, there is once again confirmation of the proposition that you should be in no hurry to jump up and salute, for all this is attended by additional difficulties for the people. Everything needs to be thought through first! There is the story of the shepherd who was grazing his sheep and who decided to have some fun: He shouted and begged for help--wolves were attacking the herd.... He fooled them! And everyone ran to help as fast as possible. Since the shepherd had done this once, twice, a third time, when the wolves really attacked, no one heeded his calls for help.... There has, therefore, to be belief! [Vladina] Mintimir Sharipovich, concerning belief.... Do you attend the mosque? [Shaymiyev] The mosque? I am an atheist. [Vladina] But you were born to a religious family? [Shaymiyev] My mother's influence. My father was not a believer. I did last year, as president, attend the Central Mosque. It was the big festival of Kurban Bayram. And I have now just been to the Orthodox Cathedral of Peter and Paul on Christmas Eve, 6 January.... [Vladina] And today is our, Christian, holiday--Epiphany--and I would like to ask you: What do you do not out of official duty but at the command of the heart? [Shaymiyev] Duty of the heart.... Attitude toward the mosque... yes? In any event, the mosque and Islam appeal only to the good. I joyfully accept the serious revival of religion, therefore. When I first attended the Peter and Paul Cathedral, I inspected the very rich iconostasis, one of the best, and understood what a cultural asset this is. [Vladina] Like all people, you surely have moods of depression. Is a president entitled to this, and how do you restore the balance of the soul? [Shaymiyev] I prefer solitude at such times. [Vladina] Do you not miss the past? [Shaymiyev] I would like to emphasize once again that although I did not suffer from the former system, did not suffer as a person--I grew in stature continually--I was the nomenklatura of that system, as they say: There is no escaping the life that has been lived. But we can no longer live as we did. I perceived perestroyka with satisfaction, and there are no problems here because I, as an industrial manager, now also do the same thing, I organize people for work. I very much like the economist Leontieff's formula: The economy is a ship or sailboat, which has to have a rudder and a sail. And to be able to move by the set course, it needs wind. Interest, the driving force of an economy, is the wind. The interest of each individual--this is ultimately the incentive to the most efficient labor. The sphere of application of the human intellect or hands, be it private property or other forms of the use of this interest, is not that important, therefore. The main thing is that there be interest in labor. We must make use of this factor. The old social system did not, alas, afford us access to any form of activity. We attempted to operate via ideology, compulsion, and socialist competition, but were unable to properly awaken interest in what was being done. And it was unclear to me how this was to be achieved other than by a change of the form of ownership. The fact that we are changing the form of ownership--I am not in any doubt about this. The ways of achieving the goal leave much to be desired, of course. Property should in time, therefore, pass into normal hands; there is no escaping this process. I cannot imagine our future otherwise. But I cannot say of which system--capitalism or socialism--I am a devotee: There is simply no such thing as capitalism in the form in which we were taught. [Vladina] Your attitude toward Zhirinovskiy? [Shaymiyev] I do not trust Zhirinovskiy. [Vladina] People put their trust.... [Shaymiyev] No, they did not. This was a protest against what is happening in society. I personally cannot take this election seriously, perhaps this is my mistake. The democrats have begun to accuse one another of having failed to unite for no good reason, otherwise they would have won. This is rubbish! Had they not separated into blocs and operated under the slogan of Russia's Choice, they would have lost even more heavily. Today Yavlinskiy and Shakhray have won some number of votes also. But what is there in the program of Russia's Choice to attract the people? Why should people have voted for this bloc, for the mistakes they made? No one should be accused of anything, therefore; it is conclusions that need to be drawn: A course correction is needed. This was the fundamental mistake--counting on foreign assistance. It is time to produce everything ourselves. [Vladina] Today, when the Constitution of Russia has been approved and your republic has a special position, are you personally not experiencing psychological strain on account of the opposition to the powerful will of the center? Are you up to this? [Shaymiyev] We walked out of the Constitutional Conference because Tatarstan's voice was not being heard. We were, after all, already living by the Constitution--by the old Constitution of the Russian Federation, it is true. The very concept of sovereignty is absent from the new Constitution. It is altogether incomprehensible how it is possible to forget about the Federal Treaty, which both the present president and the former Supreme Soviet presented to the people as a tremendous achievement for the sake of preservation of the Russian Federation. Today the Federation Treaty has been forgotten, as it were, and it would, most likely, be best were no one to remember it. Is this right?... Almost half the republics of the Russian Federation rejected the Constitution since it is incapable of securing the complete accord of our society, even taking account of the fact that it was adopted in accordance with low requirements. It turns out that one-third of the populace voted for the adoption of the Constitution, but the majority has to live in accordance with it. But I still hope that there will be no further violation of the Constitution of the Russian Federation. Neither by the president nor by anyone else. And now, continuing the process of negotiations with the Russian Federation, we must within the frameworks of the Constitutions of Russia and Tatarstan come to an accord. Is this more difficult today than yesterday? Undoubtedly. But can agreement be reached? I believe so. [Vladina] From where do you derive your strength in defending your case that this is an understanding of the true interests of both the people of Tatarstan and of Russia as a federation? [Shaymiyev] You know, this could be defined as inner opposition, but I do not wish to call it this, although this, perhaps, is what many people think. But, from my viewpoint, it is the position that could help build a more democratic federal Russian state. Unfortunately, we are not taking advantage of this propitious moment in history and have once again taken the path of easy solutions, because building an empire and a unitary state on a smaller scale in the place of the former Union seemed far simpler than building a democratic federation. It is necessary for this, after all, to negotiate with us and with the other states; it is necessary to have sufficient patience and to reach an accord in order that society be rid of the constant tension. But there is another aspect of the matter also. I am now told: We have a Constitution, it has been adopted, your voice was not heard. What next? I say: We need to come to some arrangement, everything needs to be resolved in civilized fashion. If some people are dreaming of other forms of cooperation and power pressure, we have already had this. Why resort to such a solution of questions? When there is a lack of other arguments and the patience to negotiate. Of course, any people within the former Union and Russia could today still be "driven" into any regime; people lived for so many decades "in a regime," after all, but then there should be an end to the talk about democracy. [Vladina] Have we gone back to what we had before? [Shaymiyev] To worse than what we had before, even. It is for this reason that the soundness of my position and my conviction give me strength. The position of Tatarstan is that of the building of a law-based democratic Russian Federation. We shall not abandon our positions, although we will, via, perhaps, compromise even, arrive at a treaty with the Russian Federation. We will sign it. There will come a time when our case is recognized. I have a composed attitude toward this. [Vladina] You have an upcoming meeting with Yeltsin. What do you expect of it, what might the compromise be? [Shaymiyev] The president and I have a normal relationship, but our positions do not always coincide. We have agreed to continue the negotiations and reach mutual accord. Unless my intuition deceives me, I believe that we will have signed the treaty before March. But on condition that no one seek seeming advantages for himself, neither party. Repeat elections are scheduled here for 13 March. After all, Russia also has an interest in Tatarstan being represented in both the Duma and the Federation Council. If Tatarstan is not represented, as today, in either the Duma or the Federation Council, the constitutional, legal question--where is Tatarstan--will arise. In order that the elections be held on 13 March, therefore, the treaty should have been signed and relations with the Russian Federation regulated by that time. Then we also will tell our people: We have come to an agreement, the provisions of the relationship have been formulated, and we will take part in the activity of the Duma and the Federation Council--in a word, in the affairs of Russia. [Vladina] Nine months have elapsed since our last meeting, and I see that life in the republic is in some respects better, in some respects more difficult. Prices have jumped. You have not adopted shock therapy. Are not some adjustments needed today, inasmuch as all of Russia is going a different way? [Shaymiyev] The adjustments have already been made. We have now released prices on many commodities. Did you notice, come to that, that we now have the lowest prices for bread, milk, and dairy products in Russia? [Vladina] A very marked difference! Although there are goods that are more expensive. [Shaymiyev] The dairy products and bread are cheaper thanks to subsidies. These foods should be affordable to everyone. We are releasing the prices of other types of food, as in neighboring regions also. But an entirely different policy is being implemented here today: A program of targeted social protection of the populace has been activated. A very serious office has been created. We have converted one of our institutes furnished with computer equipment and possessing experienced personnel into a social studies and social problems center. A methods system according to which not a single person must find himself below the poverty line has been devised. According to the data bank, the information--this includes the consumer basket, several types of budget, minimum included, the subsistence minimum, definition of each stratum of the population by income, and so forth--is checked weekly (not monthly!). It has been hard work, but we have done a good thing, because it is now known with what and how each family is living. It is on the basis of this information that we adopt the social protection measures. Thus, each child, regardless of whether he is an urban or rural inhabitant, is specifically protected here now. There is protection also for retirees, who receive a pension according to our procedure: If the pension is small, it is raised to the subsistence minimum. [Vladina] And what is the subsistence minimum here? [Shaymiyev] It changes weekly, but has to be sufficient to ensure not even a subsistence--we have now adopted a somewhat higher plank--a social minimum, which includes the cost not only of foodstuffs but also the apartment charge, utilities, the purchase of basic necessities. [Vladina] Do retirees travel free here? [Shaymiyev] Thus far, yes. [Vladina] It is said in Moscow that Tatarstan is behind in its payment of taxes to the federal coffers and that this is why it is better off. Is this right? [Shaymiyev] No. We have now settled the tax affairs, having signed in the fourth quarter with the Russian Federation an agreement with which we are complying. But we have stuck to our opinion here that the republics and regions should not operate on the basis of a subsidy and that in settling up with the Russian treasury we should keep for ourselves a necessary amount of the revenue. We are not, therefore, nor will we be, sitting in the corridors of the Ministry of Finance either. This also is a firm position. There is another aspect of the matter also: Revenue depends on work. Tatarstan is accused of not paying sufficient taxes, but no one has inquired as to how Tatarstan is working. How is another region laying claim to a large piece of the pie working? How, for example, do the same 100 hectares of land in regions that are different, but similar in terms of climatic conditions, "work"? There is agricultural land, there is plowland. We need to see what each 100 hectares produces--how much grain, meat, milk, and other products. And let there be comparisons. Many people have forgotten about this now, unfortunately. We have high indicators. Agricultural products, in particular, have in the past two years grown more than ever before: from 8 to 11 percent in 1993. Without a developed agriculture, speaking about the success of the economy of any country with any social foundations is simply not serious. [Vladina] You still have the previous parliament here. How were the events in Moscow on 3-4 October evaluated here? [Shaymiyev] The present composition of the parliament of Tatarstan is a parliament of the perestroyka period. The entire path that we have negotiated thus far we have negotiated via decisions of the present parliament, beginning with the adoption of the Declaration of State Sovereignty, the Constitution, and all other laws. We could say that parliament is not restructuring the economy, not adopting fateful decisions.... But this parliament cannot be blamed for this. It is essential first to reform the Supreme Soviet. Life goes on, the multiparty system is becoming a rule of life--these are our present realities, whether we like it or not, whether the parties are good or bad. And if the parties insist that elections need to be conducted on a multiparty basis, we have to agree, their voice has to be heard. There is an argument for early elections. [Vladina] Is your opinion on the events in Moscow on 3-4 October identical to that of parliament? [Shaymiyev] There can be no identical opinion at this time--either in Moscow or in the regions or throughout Russia. Just as there are no identical answers to the questions of the present day. Because there is a crisis in the country. A real crisis, which has been tackled in the most deplorable fashion. [Vladina] You think it could have been tackled in some other way? [Shaymiyev] Is this an "option" if it has been paid for at the cost of people's lives? [Vladina] There is talk increasingly often today about Eurasian solidarity, but for many centuries Russians and Tatars have confirmed by deeds that living together is possible. What is Tatarstan's contribution to this process in Russia and the CIS? [Shaymiyev] Half of the population of Tatarstan is composed of Tatars, half, representatives of other nationalities. And it has been the case for centuries that all have lived in peace and harmony. It is not just today. There were, it is true, attempts by various leaders of extreme forces to drive a wedge between people in the perestroyka period. But this was unsuccessful even under the conditions of an aggravated political situation. This phenomenon should be studied in greater depth for future use of the useful experience in the relations of Russia and the CIS. Another, no less important, problem is the position of the Russian-speaking population in the republics of Central Asia and other republics. The problem cannot, I believe, nor need it be resolved merely by the movement of people to Russia. If there is a desire to leave, of course, this is another matter. But it should be remembered that people are bound by good-neighborliness cultivated by the life of many, many generations. I wondered why I had no sense of oppression or fear in Tatarstan. This may be explained, of course, by the crime situation, which is calmer than in other regions: People go to the movies, the theater, the museum. Life goes on.... But it is not this that is the main thing. Perhaps it can be explained by belief, it is not yet exhausted! People are well disposed toward the authorities. It is odd, but they love the president. It had always seemed to me that a house could not be built on love alone. For from love to hatred it is but a single step. And I asked Mintimer Shaymiyev: Is it not frightening facing the people's love? "Whether they love or do not love is still open to question, but there is a respectful attitude on the part of the absolute majority. And I believe that people are not afraid of me. Justifying their hopes is the main thing. And this imposes quite a commitment!"
