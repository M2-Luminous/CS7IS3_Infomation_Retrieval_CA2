Raidi, chairman of the standing committee of the regional people's congress and a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), made the remarks here today at a press conference called by the Tibet delegation at the current session of the Eighth NPC. Raidi, who used to be a serf in old Tibet, said that Tibet is an integral part of China and Tibetan nationality is a member of the big family of the Chinese nation. Any attempts at separatism and any activities aimed at creating the "independence of Tibet" are doomed to failure and will be firmly opposed by all the Chinese people including Tibetans. Asked about his comment on the Dalai Lama, Raidi said that the Dalai Lama has engaged in activities aimed at separatism and sabotage of national unity since he began to live in exile after the 1959 rebellion. The central government's attitude towards him has always been explicit, hoping he will abandon separatism and return home to contribute to the country's construction. In response to a Hong Kong reporter's question on the state of human rights in Tibet, Losang, a neighborhood committee director of Chengguan District of Lhasa city, said, "I'm most qualified to answer this question since I used to be a serf. In old Tibet, my grandfather, my father and I were all serfs. We suffered hardships and beatings with no right to speak of." "It is only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party that we Tibetans enjoy real human rights. We are now masters of the country, enjoying equality with other nationalities, and economic equality and equality between men and women and fully enjoying freedom of religious belief," 55-year-old Losang said. "Without knowing well the historical background, it is hard to understand things now," he added. Raidi chipped in, saying that the claim that 105 "peaceful protesters" were jailed in prisons in Tibet was groundless. "I do not know how the list is compiled," he added. Asked whether Tibet enjoys full freedom of religious belief, Losang Gyaincain, vice-president of the Buddhist Association of China, said that the policy of freedom of religious belief adopted in Tibet is protected by the Constitution. "We have the freedom of religious belief and also the freedom of not believing in religion and the freedom to choose religions or religious sects," Gyaincain said. Gyaincain, also a living Buddha in Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery in Xikaze, told reporters that in recent years Tibet has invested 200 million yuan in renovating temples. Now the region is home to more than 1,400 temples which basically satisfy needs of local religious believers. Answering questions about relations between Han and Tibetan nationalities, Raidi said Han and Tibetan people have lived in peace and harmony and enjoyed equality since the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951. Han and Tibetan people have forged close friendship in their joint efforts of building Tibet. "Thus they have shared a common fate and can never be separated from each other," Raidi added. On the claim of "emigration" of Han people to Tibet, Losang Toinzhub, mayor of Lhasa, said, "that's a sheer nonsense." He cited Lhasa, capital of Tibet, as an example. Among its 400,000 population, Tibetans account for 87.21 percent and Han, 11.9 percent. Among the Han people, some came to help with Tibet construction and some came to do business. Toinzhu called economic exchanges "inevitable" in the course of reform and opening up. People from inland areas can go to Tibet and Tibetans can go to interior areas to do business there. "Why cannot people do so?" he asked. "The flow of people is not necessarily a bad thing and the most important thing is whether it is conducive to the development of Tibet. When Americans were opening up the West, weren't there many immigrants there?" he said. Gyalcan Norbu, chairman of the Tibet regional government, disclosed at the press conference that, of a total population of 2.28 million in Tibet, Tibetan people account for more than 96 percent and, Han people and people of other nationalities less than four percent.
