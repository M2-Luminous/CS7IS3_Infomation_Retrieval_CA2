In an interview with the Russian media, he announced that over the last year prices had gone up nine-fold. Let me remind you, in 1992 they went up by 26 times. Moreover, they are quickly approaching world prices at present and this means the end of prosperity for low-effective enterprises. Boris Fedorov noted as a positive element the fact that it proved possible in 1993 to stop a flow of unjustified subsidies and credits to CIS countries. At the same time, the interest rates were considerably increased and privileges for non-effective enterprises reduced. This has led to an improved protection of the savings of the population and enterprises against inflation.
