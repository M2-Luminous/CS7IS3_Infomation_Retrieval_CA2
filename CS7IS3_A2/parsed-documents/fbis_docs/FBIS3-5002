Moreover, procedures for foreign-invested firms to expand into areas not covered by their initial investment plans and for foreign investors to sell stocks will be greatly simplified. Foreigners may now invest in tourist hotels simply by registering their investment plans with the government. These are highlights of the new regulations governing foreign investment that the Finance Ministry put into effect on Wednesday under the revised foreign capital inducement law. Under the new rules, the government cannot reject foreign investment in areas where such investment could lead to monopoly of or encroachment on the domestic market, though it can still reject foreign investment in areas sensitive to public order and morals, national security and national health and environment. The business of handling foreign investment applications will be transferred from the Bank of Korea to all domestic foreign exchange banks, effective July 1. The new foreign investment rules are expected to increase foreign investment in domestic industries, ministry officials said.
