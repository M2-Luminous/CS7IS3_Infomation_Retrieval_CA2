The state should adopt preferential policy to lend support to such an idea. According to the national plant protection headquarters, 1994 would be a year of fairly serious plant diseases and pests. The ministry is scheduled to produce 210,000 tonnes of pesticide of 176 varieties this year. As of late last April production of pesticide was put at 75,900 tonnes. Mr. Cheng was convinced that varieties and quantity of pesticide turned out could by and large meet the need to prevent and control plant diseases and pests. From the viewpoint on a long term, Mr. Cheng, however, said that the pesticide production industry should be further exploited with implementation of a number of measures. [as received] First, pesticide produced at present should be further improved because the current pesticide is not as effective as some new varieties now being developed overseas. Germicide and herbicide shared a rather small portion in pesticide production. Second, the vice minister put forward a proposal that the state should adopt some measures to support pesticide production because pesticide was used only in farming, which was naturally subject to the profit the farming sector was able to make. As agricultural productivity was still rather low in China, the pesticide production industry had shown poor economic results and in fact it suffered a loss last year. Third, Mr. Cheng also suggested that a reserve fund for pesticide production be set up. New variety of pesticide should be developed and establishment of two centres in southern and northern China for exploitation of pesticide should be accelerated. The vice minister attributed the false and poor quality pesticide which flooded the market during the busy season each year to loose administration of pesticide production and of the sales market. Peasants' lack of knowledge of false and inferior pesticide added fuel to the spread of such phenomenon. He called for strict law to curb false pesticide.
