The Black Sea Economic Cooperation group is responsible for setting up the project. Kumbaracibasi told reporters upon his return at Ankara's Esenboga Airport that the protocol of the project known as the West-East Corridor was signed on Friday [18 February], and that Bulgarian, Albanian, and Macedonian ministers participated to the meetings held in Sofia. Italy is participating as observer. The 1,000 kilometer-long highway, with its 500 km section between Istanbul and Sofia ready to use, will rescue Macedonia from its isolated position in the middle of the Balkans. The corridor, which does not pass through Serbia or Greece, will be the main route connecting Albania to the Black and Aegean Seas. The Bulgarian portion of the road will be financed by Turkey, and Sofia will have direct access to the Adriatic Sea and thence to western Europe. Kumbaracibasi said the project was proposed by Turkey which is its greater supporter, adding it will be an advantage for countries with weak economies such as Albania and Macedonia.
