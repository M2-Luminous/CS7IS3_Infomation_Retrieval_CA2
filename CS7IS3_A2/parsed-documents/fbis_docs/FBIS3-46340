The other 11 signatories of the "Peace Charter" yesterday issued a statement, denouncing the authorities for violating the civil rights of the people on the mainland as specified by the mainland Constitution and trampling on the mainland citizens' freedom of speech and assembly. Yang Zhou, one of the signatories, said that while telling the outside world that they were going to release prisoners, the mainland authorities continued to pass reeducation- through-labor sentences, showing that their deeds did not match their words. In yesterday's statement, the "Peace Charter" signatories stressed that the action by the mainland authorities was one of trampling upon and mocking the mainland Constitution. The statement strongly demanded that the authorities release Qin Yongmin and abolish the reeducatioan-through-labor system. The main points of the statement are as follows: 1. The contents of the "Peace Charter" did not go beyond the limits allowed by China's current laws and regulations. Chinese citizens have the right to make proposals on the state system within the limits allowed by the Constitution. The persecution of the "Peace Charter" drafters in any form is to rudely trample upon and ruthlessly mock the laws in our country. 2. The purpose of the "Peace Charter" was to promote peaceful changes. Democratic politics and the protection of human rights represent the world trend. We shall never give up our position and ideals and shall never yield to any pressure, even if this means that we lose our personal freedom and lives. 3. We strongly demand that the authorities release Qin Yongmin and guarantee that they will no longer violate the legal rights of the citizens in any form. In view of the similar unfortunate experience of such democracy champions as Qi Dashan, Zhang Xianliang, and Fu Shenqi, we call for: The immediate abolition of the reeducation-through-labor system and the detention-for- investigation system, which go against the existing criminal law in our country; and for stripping the administrative institutions of the illegal power to deprive citizens of their personal freedom without trial by the judicial organs. Yesterday, when answering reporters' inquiries, Yang Zhou said that the action by the authorities had aroused indignation among the people and he also felt that the action by the authorities was extremely ridiculous. He said that the "Peace Charter" was aimed at peace but it had been treated violently by the authorities and he felt that this was rather ironic. He added that the authorities sentenced Qin Yongmin without trial and this was not the sort of behavior expected of the state in a country exercising rule of law, thus it crushed the people's hopes. In addition, Lo Hoi-sing, who was jailed on counterrevolutionary charges in the 1989 prodemocracy movement, said yesterday: Although the mainland authorities have made concessions on the human rights issue to the United States and indicated that they would release some prodemocracy activists, their basic attitude toward human rights and the prodemocracy movement has not changed because, when talking about the releases, the mainland authorities continued to arrest prodemocracy activists and sentence them to imprisonment. The action against Qin Yongmin was a good example. He held that as long as the "old man" who held the paramount power in the Chinese mainland continued to regard the prodemocracy movement as an unstable factor, the mainland authorities will never change this point of view.
