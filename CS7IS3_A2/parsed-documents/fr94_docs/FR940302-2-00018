FR940302-2-00018 FR940302-2-00008 This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the bases for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the amount of tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference between USP and FMV, but is the result of the price of the United States merchandise containing more expenses that the price of the foreign market merchandise The Department's policy to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance with the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does exceed USP. Zenith Electronics Corp. v. United States, 988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made to mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included in FMV. Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. v. United States, 7609 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustment and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in Daewoo. Foreign Market Value In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of PET film in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating foreign market value (FMV), we compared the volume of home market sales of PET film to the volume of third country sales of PET film, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of Tariff Act. Each respondent had a viable home market with respect to sales of PET film made during the period of review. For Toray, we calculated the FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market. We did not use related party sales because the prices to related parties were determined not to be at arm's length, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.45(a). We made deductions, where appropriate, for rebates and inland freight. We deducted home market packing cost and added U.S. packing costs. Pursuant to section 353.56, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in claimed warranty expenses, post-sale warehousing expenses, credit expenses, and credit interest revenue. We made a difference-in-merchandise adjustment, where appropriate, based on differences in the variable costs of manufacture. For Teijin, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated and three related customers in the home market. These related party sales were determined to be at arm's length, in accordance with section 353.45(a) of our regulations. We made deductions, where appropriate, for rebates, inland freight, and insurance. We deducted home market packing cost and added U.S. packing costs. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in post-sale warehousing expenses, and credit expenses.
