This assessment is based on the latest threats by top U.S. officials that if the Bosnian Muslims reject the peace plan, they would be punished by a gradual lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia and, if the Bosnian Serbs fail to accept the plan, the Bosnian Muslims would in return be exempt from the U.N. arms embargo (in force for all of the former Yugoslavia) and the anti-Yugoslav sanctions tightened. The United States has for the first time officially admitted that the anti-Yugoslav sanctions were entirely politically motivated rather than caused by Yugoslavia's alleged aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina, the circles say. The sanctions aimed to force Yugoslavia to pressure the Bosnian Serbs to renounce their right to self-determination, create a chaos in Serbia and effect a change of authorities there. After these two intentions had failed, the U.S. engineered a new one -- to make the lifting of the sanctions conditional on the peace in Bosnia. Thus, the U.S. simultaneously threatened to punish either the Bosnian Serbs or Muslims. Belgrade says the parallel threats aim to justify a decision of the House of Representatives to unilaterally exempt the Bosnian Muslims from the U.N. arms sales embargo. Belgrade describes the decision, which is still to be confirmed by the Senate and can be vetoed by U.S. President Bill Clinton, as political calculations which are hardly applicable in practice, because a final decision to exempt the Muslims from the embargo would simultaneously give others the right to unilaterally lift the anti-Yugoslav sanctions. The U.S. is fully aware of this, but its obvious intention is to pressure the Bosnian Serbs into accepting the peace plan. It has already estimated that the Serbs are very likely to reject the peace plan, whose concept is much closer to what the Bosnian Muslim government regards as a reasonable solution. U.S. officials say that in the next six weeks America and its NATO allies will come out with a plan, which incorporates also a map of territorial delineation between the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation and the Serbs. Belgrade believes that the maps will be drawn up to the benefit of the Bosnian Muslims and to the Bosnian Serbs' detriment. The Serbs are thus bound to reject it, which would supply an excuse for the sanctions to be prolonged. If the United States and its closest allies actually wish to bring the Bosnian war to an end and to find a political solution acceptable to all, the first step is definitely the lifting of the sanctions against Yugoslavia.
