They were Noboru Takeshita, Toshiki Kaifu, Takeo Fukuda, Yasuhiro Nakasone, Zenko Suzuki, and Kiichi Miyazawa. Although the visits were exactly like those made by a newly appointed prime minister when the LDP was in power, Hata's "modest" visits appear to have been accepted favorably by the former prime ministers. Nakasone even gave him a yell, saying: "(Although the Hata cabinet is a minority government) there is a saying that small is beautiful. So, hold on to it!" Hata stayed at each of their offices for just less than 30 minutes. Both Takeshita and Miyazawa praised Hata, respectively saying: "Since you are a good listener, you will be able to manage things successfully," and "You are a first-class person in terms of personality." Referring to the fact that Hata served as chairman of the LDP's Research Commission on the Electoral System under the Kaifu cabinet, Kaifu also said: "Since the outline of political reform has been drawn up, I hope you will carry out the remaining task of achieving it." Meanwhile, Nakasone said: "The right to dissolve the House of Representatives is the supreme power given to the prime minister. You should use the power with courage no matter what electoral system is used for the next general election." In this way, Nakasone indirectly opposed Hata's adherence to the idea that constituency boundaries should be redrawn for a new single-seat electoral system so that the next general election will be held under the new system. Maybe because of their warm welcome, Hata seems to have felt relaxed. But during the meeting with Miyazawa, he carelessly revealed his true feeling about the uproar caused by the formation of the parliamentary group "Kaishin" [Innovation], due to which the Social Democratic Party of Japan had to leave the ruling coalition. Hata said: "After all members of the ruling coalition parties voted for me in the prime ministerial election, some moved to form the new group. I was also offended by their act."
