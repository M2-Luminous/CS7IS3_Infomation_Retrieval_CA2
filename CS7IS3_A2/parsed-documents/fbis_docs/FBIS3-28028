It was a brigandish sophism reversing black and white and a shameless outcry reminding us of a thief crying "stop thief" [sentence received without punctuation mark]. Completely reversing its promise to the DPRK at DPRK-USA contacts, the United States is urging the DPRK to accept the demand of the IAEA Secretariat for full-scale inspections. It has gone the length of setting a deadline and resorting to ultimatum-like threat and intimidation, declaring that it will not have the third round of DPRK-USA talks but seek "sanctions", unless its demand is accepted. And the United States and the South Korean puppet clique plan to force the "Team Spirit" and other large-scale nuclear war exercises against the DPRK and are pushing ahead in real earnest with the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. These facts clearly show that the United States has no intention at all to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula peacefully but is still pursuing the objective of stifling the DPRK with force at any cost. It is only too natural that in the current crisis created by the mean and dangerous perfidy on the part of the United States, the spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry declared that if the United States defiantly went back on its promise to the DPRK, the DPRK would no longer be bound by the promise it had made to the United States and, if the United States was unwilling to hold another round of talks, the DPRK had no intention to have it, and that, if the United States wanted to seek another option, the DPRK would choose a countermeasure commensurate with it. Yet the puppet clique clamoured about "threat" and "intimidation." This is no more than a base attempt to justify their sinister attempt to overpower the North by force of arms. Our people will never tolerate the dangerous hostile acts and reckless new war provocation moves of the United States and the South Korean puppet clique. The South Korean puppet clique must act with discretion, mindful that the blasting fuse of a new war is linked to a time bomb at "Chongwadae" [South Korean presidential offices].
