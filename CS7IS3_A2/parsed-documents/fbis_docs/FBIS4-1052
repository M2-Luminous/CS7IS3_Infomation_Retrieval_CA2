Our correspondent reports that the seven parachutes fell into Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] defense lines at 1500. FAPLA units and riot policemen tried in vain to retrieve the parachutes, violating the glorious FALA forces' defense lines, using intense fire backed by heavy and self-propelled artillery pieces. FALA forces had no option but to defend themselves. After an intense 40-minute clash, Jose Eduardo dos Santos' adventurers were forced to beat a hasty retreat [words indistinct] abandoning large quantities of war materiel. The clashes took place in (Cambulucuco) Ward and in the former Fermina school. The incident occurred 48 hours after the FALA regional command warned the Luanda troops not to violate UNITA's defense lines. Our correspondent reports that the situation has returned to normal.
