[read by announcer] A comparative analysis of the number of voters registered during the 27 September 1992 constitutional referendum and the upcoming 6 and 20 February legislative elections totally refutes allegations that the majority of voters who participated in the constitutional referendum have left the country and have become refugees in neighboring countries. The number of voters has increased considerably in all prefectures due to the registration of young voters who reached the voting age after the constitutional referendum. Charity organizations, such as the World Food Program, claim that more than 400,000 nationals who are exiled in neighboring countries will not participate in the upcoming elections. The territorial administration and security minister protests such allegations, which are not true at all. Togolese citizens who meet the conditions set out in the Electoral Code have registered in all the prefectures, particularly in the Maritime Region. The administrative committees on which all legally constituted political parties are represented have prepared the electoral lists, and no political party has complained about the number of voters registered in the 81 electoral wards. The majority of Togolese wish to have a peaceful and tolerant democracy. They elected the president of the Republic and they will elect their representatives to the National Assembly in a peaceful and orderly manner. [passage omitted]
