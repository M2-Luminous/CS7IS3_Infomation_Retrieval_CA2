It said in a ruling that Belgium had flouted EU treaties by asking students from other EU countries to pay higher enrollment fees than non-Belgians. The Court also blasted Belgium for fixing a 2-percent quota on the number of EU students which Belgian universities must mandatorily enroll. The ruling followed a plea lodged by the European Commission, whose job it is to check that member states stick by EU rules.
