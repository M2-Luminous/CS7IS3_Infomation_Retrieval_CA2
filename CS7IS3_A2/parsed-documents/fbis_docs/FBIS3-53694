This was said when he met, in his office today at the Friendship Hall, a delegation from Bara Province visiting Khartoum to take part in the consultative meeting which convened recently between the president and executive and popular leaderships to discuss the redivision of the states. Lt. Gen. al-Bashir explained to the delegation that the government relies upon the project for the redivision of the states because of the revenue that it will achieve in the field of development, despite its exorbitant financial cost. Lt. Gen. al- Bashir explained that the new states need an unleashing of energies and the deployment of available resources to guarantee the continuation of true development. He pointed out that there is no way of building Sudan except by self-reliance and concerted official and popular effort.
