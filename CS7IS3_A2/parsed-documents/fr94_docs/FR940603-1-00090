FR940603-1-00090 FR940603-1-00009 (e) The Bidder will not perform any work hereunder on Sundays unless there is urgent need for such Sunday work and the Owner consents thereto in writing. The time for completion specified in subsection (a) of this Section 1 shall not be affected in any way by inclusion of this subsection nor by the Owner's consent or lack of consent to Sunday work hereunder. Section 2._Environmental Protection The Bidder shall perform work in such a manner as to maximize preservation of beauty, conservation of natural resources, and minimize marring and scarring of the landscape and silting of streams. There should be no deposition of trash in streams or waterways. Herbicides, other chemicals or their containers should not be deposited in or near streams, waterways or pastures. The Bidder will be required to follow, under the general direction of the engineer, the criteria relating to environmental protection as specified herein by the engineer. Section 3._Supervision and Inspection (a) The Bidder shall cause the work on the Project to receive constant supervision by a competent superintendent (hereinafter called the ``Superintendent'') who shall be present at all times during working hours where work is being carried on. The Bidder shall also employ in connection with the Project, capable, experienced and reliable foremen and such skilled workmen as may be required for the various classes of work to be performed. Directions and instructions given to the Superintendent shall be binding upon the Bidder. (b) The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Bidder if in the judgment of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner or the Supervisor, if any, shall have the right to require the Bidder to increase the number of its employees and to increase or change the amount or kind of tools and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner or Supervisor; but the failure of the Owner or Supervisor to give any such directions shall not relieve the Bidder of its obligations to complete the work within the time and in the manner specified in this proposal. (c) The manner of carrying out the Project, and all materials and equipment used therein, shall be subject to the inspection, tests and approval of the Owner and the Administrator, and the Bidder shall furnish all information required by the Owner or by the Administrator concerning the nature or source of any materials incorporated or to be incorporated in the Project. The Owner and the Administrator shall have the right to inspect all payrolls, invoices of materials, and other data and records of the Bidder and of any subcontractor, relevant to the Project. The Bidder shall provide all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests and shall maintain an office at the site of the Project, with telephone service where obtainable and at least one office employee to whom directions and instructions of the Owner may be delivered. Delivery of such directions or instructions in writing to the employee of the Bidder at such office shall constitute delivery to the Bidder. The Bidder shall have an authorized agent accompany the Engineer when final inspection is made and, if requested by the Owner, when any other inspection is made. (d) In the event that the Owner, or the Administrator, shall determine that the work contains or may contain numerous defects, it shall be the duty of the Bidder and the Bidder's Surety or Sureties, if any, to have an inspection made by an engineer approved by the Owner and the Administrator for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent and location of such defects. (e) The Engineer may recommend to the Owner that the Bidder suspend the work wholly or in part for such period or periods as the Engineer may deem necessary due to unsuitable weather or such other conditions as are considered unfavorable for the satisfactory prosecution of the work or because of the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions of the Contract: Provided, however, that the Bidder shall not suspend work pursuant to this provision without written authority from the Owner to do so. The time of completion hereinabove set forth shall be increased by the number of days of any such suspension, except when such suspension is due to the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract. In the event that work is suspended by the Bidder with the consent of the Owner, the Bidder before resuming work shall give the Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours notice thereof in writing. Section 4._Unsuitable Workmanship The acceptance of any workmanship by the Owner or the Engineer shall not preclude the subsequent rejection thereof if such workmanship shall be found to be unsuitable. Workmanship found unsuitable before final acceptance of the work shall be remedied, by and at the expense of the Bidder. The Bidder shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long as any unsuitable workmanship in respect to the Project, of which the Bidder shall have had notice, shall not have been remedied.
