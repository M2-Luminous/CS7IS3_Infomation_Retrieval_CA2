It also called for the immediate establishment of an independent human rights commission. But Governor Chris Patten believes a commission might be a "pretty toothless creature." In its first comprehensive report on the territory for four years, Amnesty claimed Hong Kong fell short of its minimum obligations to provide an effective complaints system for people who believed they were victims of violations of the Bill of Rights. "People in Hong Kong have been priced out of the market," said international law expert Chris Avery, who compiled the report. He said people claiming the Government had violated their rights were often deterred from bringing a civil case by the fear that, should they lose the case, they would be ordered to pay the "often huge" costs. "Many people feel they must simply let their rights be violated rather than risk financial ruin trying to enforce them in court." Mr Avery was very surprised there had been only 15 applications for legal aid in civil Bill of Rights cases, with the exception of immigration cases which were treated separately. Only one application had been granted and two applications had been withdrawn. Legal Aid Department spokesman Andrew Leung Kin-pong said all cases were dealt with on an independent basis. He said there was a comprehensive appeal procedure. The report called for the Government to make the legal aid agency fully independent and also to set up a human rights commission to provide an "accessible, affordable, speedy and effective remedy" for victims of human rights violations. Mr Avery said the Legislative Council [Legco] had already voted for a commission, but Mr Patten had not spoken in its favour. Mr Patten, speaking during Legco question time yesterday, said the administration would look at the pros and cons of the suggestion before stating its position by the end of June. He added: "One can think of some human rights commissions which are pretty toothless creatures and perhaps at the end of the day do less for the advance of human rights than could have been achieved in other ways." Legislator Anna Wu Hung-yuk, the sponsor of a private member's bill on the commission, described the Governor's attitude as "empty- minded" and aimed at preserving the status quo. Senior law lecturer at Hong Kong University, Dr Nihal Jayawickrama, said he agreed with the recommendations of the 45-page Amnesty report, Hong Kong and Human Rights: Flaws in the System. He said the Bill of Rights had been introduced by the Government in 1991 as a confidence-boosting measure after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. "They seemed to say that now they had got the Bill of Rights, they would be able to leave it alone, without introducing the necessary safeguards." But he said the commission provided those safeguards. Meanwhile, more than 70 members of the United States House of Representatives have written urging Mr Patten to set up a commission.
