Commenting on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Tudjman stressed that, through the Washington agreement on the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and its confederation with the Republic of Croatia, Croatian and Muslim interests have been harmonized with the interests of the Republic of Croatia and those of the Western world that wanted to link Muslims with Western civilization. Speaking about relations between Croatia and Serbia, the Croatian president said that the mutual recognition will create the basis for peace and the establishment of a new international order in that part of Europe. He also said that the area of the Balkans should undergo a process of Scandinavization, recalling that the Scandinavian states recognized each other after years of being at war, then cooperated with each other, and successfully resolved the question of protecting minorities' rights.
