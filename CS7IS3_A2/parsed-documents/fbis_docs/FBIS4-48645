At the start of a two-day conference on the future of radio, Dr. Jordan said that in the past governments had too easily abused their links with broadcasters. An independent body such as the Independent Broadcasting Authority should regulate the industry. Mr. Jordan said the government would want to monitor and restrict any possible cross ownership of the media, but that the government will ensure that the airwaves were free.
