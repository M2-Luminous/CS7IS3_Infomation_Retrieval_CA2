The Syndicate of Iraqi Journalists confirmed, in a statement, that this notorious attack was aimed at prolonging the hostile and criminal sanctions against the people of Iraq. It explained that human rights in Iraq were protected and safeguarded by the Iraqi constitution, at a time when human rights were willfully and bloodily violated with the knowledge of the big powers in many countries of the world. It pointed out that Britain, France, and America ignored these excesses and ongoing violations of human rights because the rulers in question were serving their interests and goals. The Syndicate of Iraqi Journalists accused the big powers and the Security Council of violating Iraqi human rights by persisting in continuing the sanctions. Was not forbidding the Iraqi people food, medicine, and common necessities, they asked, an intentional violation of the rights accorded them by international conventions and laws? The Syndicate of Iraqi Journalists called on Arab and foreign press organizations and federations to take a stand for justice and right, and to expose the hidden goals of this oppressive campaign.
