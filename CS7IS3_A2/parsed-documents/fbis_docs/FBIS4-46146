The Islamic Group issued a statement saying that killing Copts is not its objective, adding that security authorities have always tried to raise accusations against it to conceal the facts and their incompetence at identifying the real criminals. The security authorities' objective is to distort the image of the Islamic Group in Egypt and abroad, it added. The Islamic Group said that it is concerned with the issue of the Copts and that the Copts' rights, which were approved by Islam, will be respected at present and in future.
