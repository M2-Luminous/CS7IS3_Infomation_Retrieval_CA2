Berisha and Tudjman held a special 30-minute meeting at the Presidency. Later they continued with talks between both delegations. After the end of these talks, both presidents spoke to correspondents: [Begin Berisha recording] With President Tudjman, we discussed the development of friendly relations between Albania and Croatia to find a sound and all-round basis to develop these relations, and I am convinced that the visit of President Tudjman is a real contribution in this direction. The cooperation between Albania and Croatia is at the same time a contribution to regional cooperation. It assumes great values in the future in the framework of a broad regional integration. [end recording] [Koleci] The visit of the Croatian delegation in Albania, Mr. Tudjman declared, and the talks held with the Albanian delegation will serve to promote bilateral ties and more successful common efforts for a commitment by the international community to intervene in our region. During the talks, we found complete understanding. Berisha and Tudjman commented on today's act by NATO -- the downing of four Serbian planes which violated the UN flight embargo on military planes in Bosnia. [Begin Berisha recording] We consider the NATO response to the Serbian aggressor in the (?bosom) of Bosnia to be legitimate and very important. We think that the courage and bravery of the U.S. pilots will accelerate peace and stability in the region. [end recording] [Koleci] Mr. Tudjman assessed this act as a sign and signal that the international community will continue efforts to solve the crisis in Bosnia and create conditions for peace in the region. Wishing for a more concrete pronouncement, I asked Mr. Tudjman how he would assess today's act, and he said: It is an act of determination of the superiority of the international community and Europe to oppose the Serbian aggressor, but also to put barriers on Russian intervention in the Balkans. This afternoon the Croatian president and the delegation accompanying him will meet Prime Minister Meksi and Parliament Chairman Pjeter Arbnori.
