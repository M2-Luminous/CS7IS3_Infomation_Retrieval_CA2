Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;15&hyph;09 Aerospatiale: Amendment 39&hyph;8980. Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;95&hyph;AD. Applicability: All Model ATR72 series airplanes, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent loss of the main landing gear (MLG) during a hard landing, accomplish the following: (a) Perform a visual inspection (using a borescope) to detect damage to the protective treatments on the inside diameter of the upper hinge pins on each shock absorber on the MLG, in accordance with Messier-Bugatti Service Bulletin 631&hyph;32&hyph;099, dated April 12, 1994, at the time specified in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this AD, as applicable. Repeat this inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 4,000 landings. (1) For airplanes on which the MLG has accumulated more than 9,000 total landings as of the effective date of this AD: Inspect within 300 landings after the effective date of this AD. (2) For airplanes on which the MLG has accumulated 6,000 or more total landings but less than or equal to 9,000 total landings as of the effective date of this AD: Inspect prior to the accumulation of 9,300 total landings, or within 1,000 landings after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. (3) For airplanes on which the MLG has accumulated less than 6,000 total landings as of the effective date of this AD: Inspect prior to the accumulation of 7,000 total landings, or within 3,000 landings after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later. (b) If no damaged protective treatment is found, prior to further flight, reinstall the grease duct and fill the cavity between the pin and the grease duct with grease in accordance with Messier-Bugatti Service Bulletin 631&hyph;32&hyph;099, dated April 12, 1994. Thereafter, perform the repetitive inspections required by paragraph (a) of this AD. (c) If any damaged protective treatment is found, prior to further flight, strip the damaged protective treatment to determine if the base metal is corroded, in accordance with Messier-Bugatti Service Bulletin 631&hyph;32&hyph;099, dated April 12, 1994. (1) If no corrosion of the base metal is found, within 250 landings, complete a paint scheme of the damaged area, reinstall the grease duct, and fill the cavity between the pin and the grease duct with grease in accordance with the service bulletin. Thereafter, perform the repetitive inspections required by paragraph (a) of this AD. (2) If any corrosion of the base metal is found, prior to further flight, remove the corrosion, and perform a dye penetrant or a fluorescent penetrant inspection to detect cracking of the pin, in accordance with the service bulletin. (i) If no crack is found, accomplish either paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) or (c)(2)(i)(B) of this AD in accordance with the service bulletin. Thereafter, perform the repetitive inspections required by paragraph (a) of this AD. (A) Prior to further flight, repair the hinge pin; or (B) Within 50 landings after performing the inspection required by paragraph (c)(2) of this AD, replace the hinge pin with a serviceable pin. (ii) If any crack is found, prior to further flight, replace the hinge pin with a serviceable pin in accordance with the service bulletin. Thereafter, perform the repetitive inspections required by paragraph (a) of this AD. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113.
