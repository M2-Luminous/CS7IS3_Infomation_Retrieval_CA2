Mayor Don Burgers of Den Bosch, who led the four-member delegation for the second visit here this year, said his city is joining hands with two other cities in the vicinity to become an electronics hub in Europe. One of the cities, Eindhoven, is the home of world-renown electronics company Philips. To attract Asian investors, Den Bosch, a sister city of Hsintien in Taipei County, recently set up a Far East trade and business center which includes duty-free warehouses, rental offices and other facilities, Burgers said in a news conference. Burgers said Taiwan businesses can use Den Bosch as a springboard to other markets in the European union. Den Bosch is located near Holland's Amsterdam and Roterdam, Germany's Dusseldorf and Belgium's Brussels, he said. Burgers, who is on his fifth visit to Taipei, said more than 10 Taiwan companies have established production centers in Den Bosch. Among the Taiwan companies, First International Computer Inc. has made Den Bosch its operation headquarters in Europe. An optimistic burgers estimated that the number of Taiwan companies in Den Bosch will double in two years. The city government has even helped Taiwan businessmen establish a Taiwan school in Den Bosch, further improving the city's appeal to Taiwan investors.
