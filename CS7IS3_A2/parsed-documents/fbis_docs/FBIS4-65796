The EU bureaucracy in Brussels appears positive regarding Cyprus' accession to the Union, as long as this does not bring it into confrontation with Turkey, does not get it involved in the Cyprus issue, and provided structural changes within the EU have proceeded to a conclusion. Despite all the above reservations, there are thoughts about the accession of Cyprus to the EU through Greece, or the clarification and amendment of the German formula for the Cyprus case. It appears that what the EU will not accept is the existence of two clearly Greek states with the same prerogatives (presidency-veto). A source in Brussels who favors Nicosia's positions has told O FILELEVTHEROS that what the Cyprus Government should make clear is that Cyprus itself would agree to have the free areas alone join the EU if there is no solution to the Cyprus issue. Regarding the Cyprus Government's demand for talks with the EU to begin as quickly as possible, the Brussels bureaucracy appears to have divided views. There are some who support the beginning of some kind of talks in 1995, but not necessarily accession talks. On the other hand, others feel that the EU should limit itself to a statement regarding expansion that will satisfy Cyprus and Malta but will have no practical effect at this stage. In general, it is thought that Germany's presidency [beginning in July 1994] will prove decisive for the EU's relations with Cyprus and Turkey because the EU-Turkey Accession Council will convene in the second half of this year, when deliberations that are expected to lead to full customs association between Turkey and the EU in 1995 will be intensified.
