FR940921-0-00052 FR940921-0-00016 It should be noted that, while the natural gas certification fuel specifications contained in today's rule are much broader than CARB's, CARB certification fuel does fall within the federal specifications, and thus could be used for certification testing. For a further discussion of this issue please consult the summary and analysis of comments document available in the public docket. The Agency would like to take a similar approach for LPG certification fuel as it took for natural gas certification fuel. However, there is little information available about in-use LPG composition upon which such a fuel specification could be based. Thus, EPA believes it prudent to adopt commercial LPG as the certification fuel at this time. Should adequate information on in-use LPG composition become available at some point in the future, EPA may elect to define a certification fuel specification for LPG at that time. Today's rule contains no controls on in-use fuel composition for either natural gas or LPG. EPA does not believe that the need for such in-use controls has been adequately demonstrated. Further, the cost-effectiveness of such controls is not likely to justify such action. The Agency is concerned, however, about the possibility of in-use fuel composition changes over time, and urges the natural gas and LPG industries to take steps to minimize such variations. Should the in-use compositions of these fuels change in such a way as to adversely impact the emissions performance of gaseous-fueled vehicles the Agency would likely take steps to address the issue at that time, either through corresponding changes in certification fuel specifications, or possibly through in-use fuel composition specifications. H. Fuel Economy Summary of the proposal: The NPRM included test procedures and calculations for determining the fuel economy of natural gas-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks for purposes of allowing them to be included in a manufacturer's CAFE calculation. The proposed procedures for determining the fuel economy of natural gas vehicles (NGV) utilize the same principles as those used in the procedures currently in place for gasoline vehicles. Availability of CAFE credits for NGVs was mandated in the Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA) of 1988 (Public Law 100&hyph;494, October 14, 1988), to be effective with the 1993 model year. No CAFE provisions regarding LPG vehicles were proposed. Summary of the comments: In general, the comments regarding the CAFE provisions for NGVs were very supportive. Some commenters urged EPA to quickly finalize this rule in order to assure that CAFE credits will be available for 1993 model year NGVs. The lack of fuel economy provisions for LPG vehicles, however, was perceived by many as an unfair disadvantage for LPG vehicles. Additionally, many commenters pointed out that the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated the availability of CAFE credits for LPG vehicles, and urged EPA to finalize fuel economy test procedures and calculations for LPG vehicles. EPA response to comments: The Agency did not propose fuel economy measurement procedures for LPG vehicles because prior to the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 the determination of whether LPG vehicles should be included in the CAFE program was required to be made by the Secretary of Transportation under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (U.S.C. 2001(5)). At the time EPA issued the NPRM for today's action the Secretary of Transportation had not made a determination to include LPG vehicles in the CAFE program. The Energy Policy Act allowing LPG vehicles to participate in the CAFE program was signed into law just as EPA issued its proposal. Thus, no fuel economy provisions were proposed for LPG vehicles. There are two reasons why EPA is not adopting fuel economy provisions for LPG vehicles in this rule. First, before EPA can adopt fuel economy test procedures and calculations for LPG vehicles, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is required by the Energy Policy Act to determine a fuel equivalency factor equating gasoline and LPG so that fuel economy can be calculated on a gasoline gallon- equivalent basis. This fuel equivalency factor has not yet been set by DOT. Second, the Agency believes that the required new fuel economy measurement provisions for LPG vehicles must be subject to public notice and comment. Thus, the Agency will work with DOT to develop the fuel equivalency factor, and, upon determination of that factor, will propose LPG fuel economy provisions in a separate Agency rulemaking action.
