However, since yesterday, the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] has two floor leaders in the persons of Franco Piro and Nicola Capria, and -- mustered around them -- two parliamentary groups. One of them, the largest, originates from the old guard, whereas the smaller one is loyal to [PSI Secretary] Del Turco. This is a sort of inverted preview of the split proper, which will take place at the end of the month, when the majority will follow the party's secretary to form a new Socialist force on the left, while the Craxian minority will move, with all their belongings, into the moderate camp: perhaps to join forces with [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, most certainly -- as has already been announced by Treasury Deputy Secretary Maurizio Sacconi -- to join forces with the Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi. Following weeks of expectation, the split among the Socialist deputies is thus suddenly becoming a fact, and will in all probability lead to the "rebels" being suspended from the PSI. Moreover, it is becoming a fact in the presence of the entire old general staff, who all hurried to vote for Piro and to pose for a group photograph featuring Craxi, De Michelis, Di Donato, Signorile, and all their unconditional followers, in addition to a small group of supporters of former Finance Minister Formica -- ranging from Sollazzo to Dell'Unto -- who voted for Dell'Unto at the national assembly. Overall, 51 deputies out of 91, practically all those present once the minority had left the room in order not to take part in the vote following the announcement by Capria -- who is supposed to have resigned months ago, but was never replaced -- that the meeting was closed. Led by Ugo Intini and Maurizio Sacconi, the "rebels" decided to go their own way, declaring that they could not address the issue of confidence from a position with which they could not identify. When Capria and his followers left, those who stayed replaced him with the deputy floor leaders, first electing Piro and then adopting a document which voiced their "indignation at the humiliations that the PSI has suffered at the hands of the so-called progressive table," and warned the secretary "not to make political choices outside the statutory regulations." A polemic concerning the two floor leaders' legitimacy flared up immediately. Del Turco spoke of a "very serious action" and of a "split within the parliamentary group," confirming his confidence in Capria, who, in the meantime, claimed before [Lower House speaker] Napolitano that the procedure followed by Craxi's followers for the election was illegal, while Labriola stated categorically that such an election "does not exist." For their part -- while they wait for Napolitano to pronounce -- Piro and the others claim that the election was carried out according to the rules: "Nothing tragic happened," said Intini. "Quite simply, the group elected a new floor leader who does not share the secretariat's line." While "rebel" deputy floor leaders Sollazzo and Poti denied having carried out a split and shouted "neither with Craxi nor with [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto," Craxi himself ("I have always been disciplined, I was called, and I came") answered Del Turco in harsh terms, dismissing his reaction as being "completely hysterical": "The group simply exercised a parliamentary right, which comes before any political stance. Since time immemorial, parliamentary groups have chosen their floor leader freely by means of a secret ballot, when they have deemed it appropriate to do so. That is all there is to it."
