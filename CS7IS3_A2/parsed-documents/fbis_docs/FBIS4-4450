Mr Wirasak said Thailand and Burma have been haunted by the "legacy of distrust" for a long time and that needed to be changed. At present, Thailand and Burma are in the process of creating mutual trust the ambassador said. "We are trying to help Burma break political isolation by inviting them to be a guest country at the ASEAN meeting in June. And at the same time we facilitate the attempt of Burma to talk with the minority groups and stop the fighting." "Thailand maintains a non-intervention policy. However, we hope that Burma and the minority groups will eventually reach a peaceful settlement. The border between Thailand and Burma should be the border of cooperation and not the border of conflict. The fighting between Burma and the minority groups along the border also adversely affects our country and our people." The envoy said only when Burma settles the problem with the minority groups will that country will be able to start focussing on development. "The situation has somewhat inched towards peace as Burma has developed a more flexible stance when dealing with the minorities," he added. The diplomat said Burma has tried to improve its image and that will take some time before it finds acceptance. "When I first arrived in Burma, it was under martial law. Curfew was imposed. Now there is more freedom. A number of political prisoners were released and Burma has somewhat decentralised its power." "It has also drafted a new constitution which will have the presidency system. However, the military will continue to play an important role in that country. It's just like Indonesia. If we can accept Indonesia, why don't we accept Burma?" He said he has eyed Burma with an Asian point of view. "I admit that I had in the past looked at Burma from the westernised viewpoint and I had misunderstood that I know the neighbouring country well. In fact, I came to realise that I knew very little about Burma which has a different political culture. Let's look at our neighbour from the Asian point of view, like people in the same region should think of." Burma should be allowed to find its own political solutions, he said. Thailand has initiated a number of projects to help Burma in the areas of public health in the rural areas, he said. Apart from Thailand, many countries have approached Burma for its rich natural resources.
