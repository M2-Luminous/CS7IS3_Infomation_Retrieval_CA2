At the beginning of official talks between the two leaders today, da Moura said that Robaina's visit has taken place at a particularly complex moment for the Angolan people because of the war being waged by the opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. The Angolan minister noted the peace efforts his government is making to put an end to the instability produced by the domestic conflict, which UNITA rekindled more than one year ago after failing in the first multiparty elections. Referring to relations with Cuba, da Moura said that in spite of difficulties, Angola will work to strengthen the historic ties of cooperation with the Caribbean island. Robaina said that his 48-hour visit to this capital forms part of a diplomatic offensive in a changing world. Robaina stated that the Cuban authorities are working to establish the country in the framework in which it belongs. He said: We cannot speak of Cuban diplomacy without mentioning Africa and Angola, with which we are united by fraternal and traditional ties, in particular, he said. During his first visit to Luanda, the Cuban foreign minister has already spoken with the Cuban medical and paramedical personnel who work in an important metropolitan hospital and plans to meet with Cuban experts in other fields. Today, as part of his busy agenda, Robaina will meet with Prime Minister Marcolino Moco and tomorrow he will be received by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Robaina will also meet with Franca Van Dunem, president of the Angolan Parliament. Angola is Robaina's second stopover in his African journey. He has already visited Ghana and will be going to Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Namibia.
