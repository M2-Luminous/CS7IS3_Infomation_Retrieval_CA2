At the meeting, Qian Qichen pointed out: Since the establishment of Sino-Mauritian diplomatic relations, exchange and cooperation between the two countries in the political, economic, and cultural areas have expanded continually. The Chinese Government has always cherished friendship with Mauritius and is ready to work together with the Mauritian Government in exploring new ways for mutually beneficial cooperation. Kasenally believed that Qian Qichen's visit would certainly result in the deepening of mutual understanding and expansion of cooperation, especially in the economic and trade fields, between the two countries. The two foreign ministers briefed each other on their respective country's stance on the conflict in Somalia, problems in South Africa, reform of the Security Council, and the establishment of a new international political and economic order. Qian Qichen said: Under the new international situation, many African countries are facing aggravating difficulties and widening their gap with the developed countries. To reform the irrational economic order and help African countries shake off poverty is a pressing task facing the international community. Only when the economy of the African countries shows improvement can the global economy grow healthily. Africa's development needs the support of the world, and Africa's participation is also essential for the development of the world. Kasenally pointed out: The solution to problems in Somalia and other African nations will depend primarily on their peoples. He said: It is necessary to bring into play the OAU's role instead of relying on solutions imposed externally. The establishment of an international order must be participated by all small and big nations on an equal footing and must not be manipulated by one or two blocs again. Prior to the meeting, the two foreign ministers attended a ceremony to sign an agreement on the Chinese Government's donation of general goods to Mauritius, and signed the agreement for their respective governments. Qian Qichen and his party arrived in Mauritius on the evening of 19 January for a two-day goodwill visit to the island country in the Indian Ocean.
