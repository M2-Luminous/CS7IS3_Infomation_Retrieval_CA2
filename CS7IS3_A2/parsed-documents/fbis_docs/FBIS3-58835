At the Chamber of Commerce and Industry's New Year Reception in Duesseldorf on Tuesday [18 January], Kohl pointed out that top achievements in research and technology are important preconditions for future-oriented jobs in Germany. "I am, therefore, very concerned about our falling behind important competitors in the fields of research and technology, for instance regarding the number of patent applications," Kohl said. Research and innovation are not only a matter of funds. They also require a social climate that is open to new ideas. On the labor market situation, Kohl said the problems "cannot be solved in the short term," even with the expected upswing of the economy. For this reason, everybody who is involved in the economic process is called on to help secure jobs. The Federal Government has taken action. The new law on working time, which enables more flexible working hours and longer machinery operating hours, has been presented to the Bundestag. The 1992 pension reform provides the opportunity to combine part-time work with drawing partial pensions. So far, this instrument has been made far too little use of. Almost 2.5 million full-time employees would rather work part-time. This means there is an enormous job potential there, said Kohl. Kohl welcomed the wage agreement in the chemical industry as "an important signal." The wage round parties put employment at the center of their talks. This is a good contribution to securing jobs. Other important factors are the agreed starting wages for young people starting work and for the long-term unemployed. This is the first time that wage round parties made agreements that take account of the different capacities of different companies. Kohl said the government's job is to improve the basic structures for stimulating growth and employment in Germany. In this connection, the chancellor emphasized the government's decision to cut the budget by another 5 billion German marks [DM]. This was "not simple," because a total of DM21 billion had already been saved in the 1994 budget. Financial planning has a "solid base," which can also be seen from the preliminary 1993 budget balance. In 1993, the government's new indebtedness was some DM500 million below estimate. Economizing also means fighting the misuse of social benefits, which has led to DM1.2 billion being saved by the end of November 1993. Kohl stressed that in the next legislative term the tax law should be simplified and the company tax reform continued. Another important issue on the government's agenda is simplifying the planning and licensing procedures in Germany. These -- with the "program to increase growth and employment" -- are important steps taken by the coalition toward enforcing the measures laid down in the report on "Securing Germany's Future as a Business Location," as was announced last September.
