It also attempts to rudely interfere in others' internal affairs. Today, I would like to take two examples of this disgraceful behavior of the United States, which it is openly following in its dealings with the world. The first example is the request Warren Christopher made to Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani during their recent meeting in Washington. Christopher wanted the sisterly Arab state to desist from strengthening its fraternal relations with Iraq. The second example is Clinton's arrogant request to the Japanese prime minister to impose taxes on the Japanese industries exported to the United States and to give special facilities to U.S. exports to Japan. He wants to tip the trade balance between the two countries in Washington's favor. When the Japanese rejected this request that would damage their industries, Clinton ordered a series of trade measures hostile to Tokyo. This was a declaration of war against an ally, well within earshot of the entire world. These two examples shown once again that Washington will never be satisfied if it does not impose its will on other countries. Qatar is not allowed to practice independent decisionmaking with regard to its relations with its sisterly and friendly states. And Japan, which a major economic power in the world today, is not allowed to compete against U.S. industries, but must be forced to direct its development in the interest of the United States. Both examples indicate that U.S. policy under any administration does not really have any friends or allies in its general dealing. How many enemies does the United States have today, and how many more will it have in the future? This shows the extent to which Washington controls the world. The important thing is that the rejection of this hegemony has begun in different forms, including the firm rejection represented by the Iraqi stand.
