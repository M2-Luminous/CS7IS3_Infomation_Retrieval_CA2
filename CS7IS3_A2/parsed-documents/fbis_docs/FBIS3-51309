The part of the Constitution that states its postulates and dogma will remain untouched, however. The pact signed by Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin, according to its most enthusiastic defenders, will ensure, "for the first time in Argentina, a representative, democratic, and historic Constituent Assembly." This future assembly, say those who are negotiating the basic premises of the reform, has "legal and political" guarantees that previous ones lacked. According to the text approved by the Senate on 21 September, the delegates to the Constituent Assembly will be elected by the D'Hont system of proportional representation. Each province and the Federal Capital will elect a number of delegates equal to the total number of legislators it sends to the Congress of the Nation, and in the same proportion: 303 members all together. The requirements for being a delegate are the same as those for being a national deputy. Any public official may go to the Constituent Assembly, except for members of the judiciary. The delegates will enjoy the same privileges and receive the same expense allowance as legislators, from the day they are elected to the date the assembly concludes. As for duration, the Senate draft says that the assembly will begin work within 60 days of the election of delegates, and must complete its work within 120 days, with no extensions. The senators also want the assembly to be held in the Entre Rios city of Parana. Although the final word has not been said on this matter, the provincial deputies from Santa Fe, for example, at the insistence of the Progressive Democrats, approved a draft Thursday requesting the National Congress to put the assembly in their jurisdiction. They argue that the province has a historic right to host the assembly: the Constitution of 1853 was drafted there. Step by Step After Congress passes the law calling for reform, elections will be held to elect delegates to the assembly, although no date has been set. The timing of the elections depends, among other things, on the duration of the tug-of-war between the negotiators of the Justicialist Party (PJ) and the Radical Civic Union (UCR). Alberto Garcia Lema, counsel to the Treasury and a member of the PJ drafting team that has been working on the wording of the reform pact, says that "if things keep going the way they have been so far," the election of delegates will take place in January, February "at the latest." The vacation will be spiced up by a short election campaign. In March (or April), the Constituent Assembly will begin its work. After it has been convened for a fixed date, the assembly must decide how it is going to operate. Constitutionalist Ricardo Monner Sans indicates that "all constituent assemblies have regulated themselves. In other words, they elect their own officers according to their own criteria; they decide on internal regulations, the operation of committees, and what kind of committees they will have." He gives examples: The 1949 assembly, for example, elected Col. Domingo Mercante chairman pursuant to a decision by the Justicialist bloc. At the 1957 assembly, however, Socialist Nicolas Repetto was elected because he was the oldest delegate. The schedule will be as follows: - Election of officers and approval of provisional rules of procedure. This will be done at one or more so-called "preparatory" meetings. - Approval of rules of procedure. This will be done at the first plenary session of the assembly, which may also involve several meetings. - Formation of committees. There were three committees in the 1957 Constituent Assembly: Powers and Regulations, Drafting, and General Business. In the 1949 assembly there was also a Constitutional Revision Committee. One of the tasks of the Powers Committee is to identify how many members each committee will have and what its mandate will be. - Plenary-session debates on constitutional amendments. During these debates, delegates will speak individually, but in the name of the party delegations. - Voting on the new Constitution. At this point, the assembly may also pass a number of transitory provisions that will indicate, for example, how the the oaths of allegiance to the new basic law will be administered. - The assembly delegates will swear allegiance to the new Constitution. - The oath will be repeated by the top authorities of all the branches of government. The first to swear allegiance will be the president of the nation, who will then administer the oath to the cabinet ministers. The presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies will also take the oath, and will then administer it to all legislators. With respect to the judiciary, the transitory provisions approved by the Constituent Assembly of 1949 provided for the reappointment of the Supreme Court and all judges. The legality of their terms was suspended, because the new Constitution revamped the entire justice system. According to the draft now being discussed, the Constituent Assembly does not have sovereignty. It can, however, reject the reforms proposed by Congress, although in no case can it carry out reforms, repeals, or additions that have not been specified by Parliament in its passage of the law calling for constitutional reform and setting forth the sections to be amended. It is clear to everyone that this is a key issue, because if the Constituent Assembly were declared sovereign, it would acquire the range of an eagle. Radical Deputy Jorge Vanossi, who is a constitutional specialist, believes that the Constituent Assembly "cannot be a mere echo of Congress." Even though the Menem-Alfonsin pact guarantees a consensual reform, "not all assembly delegates will give their unquestioning approval." The last election of Constituent Assembly delegates was in 1957, and it was called by the military regime that in September 1955 had overthrown the government of Juan Domingo Peron. It is true that that year the delegates were elected under the D'Hont system for the first time in Argentina, which allowed small groups (such as the Communist Party and the Labor Party) to be represented. But Peronism was prohibited, and the vast majority of Peron supporters cast blank ballots. [Box, p 9] X-Ray of the Constituent Assembly How It Is Elected - Voting is mandatory and by secret ballot. All Argentine citizens over the age of 18 can vote. - As in legislative elections, the voters choose a slate of assembly delegates by party. Who May Be a Delegate - Any a native-born or naturalized Argentine citizen over the age of 25 may be listed on the slate of candidates. - Each delegate must represent a party, as either a member or a nonmember. - As in deputy elections, each province elects its delegates. - All public officials may be delegates, except for members of the judiciary. - The assembly will have 303 delegates, equal to the number of national deputies and senators. - Privileges: Assembly delegates will enjoy the same immunity as legislators, from the day they are elected to the end of their mandate. - Expense allowance: Delegates will receive the same allowance as legislators. Inauguration, Duration, and Operation - Session will open 60 days after the election of delegates. - Session will last 120 days. The assembly may conclude its deliberations prior to that time, but not after it. - Quorum: Half plus one of the delegates; but the assembly may adopt its own rules of procedure. Powers - The assembly is free to accept or reject the reforms proposed by Congress. Note: The law to be passed by Congress calling for constitutional reform may modify some of these points. [Box, p 9] It Is Written in History Since the Constitution of 1853 was enacted, seven Constituent Assemblies have been convened, although only five were actually held: in 1860, 1866, 1898, 1949, and 1957. Radical deputy and constitutionalist Jorge Vanossi wrote in the magazine TODO ES HISTORIA [Everything Is History] that the 1860 Constituent Assembly (held in Santa Fe) "formalized and made viable" the incorporation of the "State" of Buenos Aires into the "State" of the Argentine Nation. Between 1853 and that year, two entities with different territories, populations, and governments existed side by side: the Argentine Confederation, which was governed by the Constitution of 1853, and the State of Buenos Aires, which was governed by its own Constitution of 1854. The Constituent Assembly of 1866 (also held in Santa Fe) introduced a partial amendment to Article 4 of the Constitution, which dealt with export duties. "No official record of that assembly's deliberations remains," says Vanossi. In 1898, this time in the Federal Capital, another assembly was held to make partial amendments to the Constitution. In 1949, Congress passed a law declaring that "the revision and reform of the National Constitution" were necessary "in order to eliminate, modify, add, and correct its provisions to better defend the rights of the people and the welfare of the nation." It was, in fact, a total reform, and among other things it led to the reelection of Juan Domingo Peron in 1951. That election of assembly delegates followed the provisions of the Saenz Pena Act, which provided for a majority and a single minority. The UCR, the minority, left the site of the assembly claiming that the convocation of the Constituent Assembly was "legally nonexistent." The military government of Gen. Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, which overthrew Juan Peron in September 1955, convened another Constituent Assembly in 1957. With Peronism banned and Radicalism divided into two factions, the UCR of the People led by Ricardo Balbin and the Intransigent Radical Civic Union (UCRI) led by Arturo Frondizi, the assembly merely reflected the profound divisions in Argentine society. The UCRI, which was the political group with the most delegates in the assembly, showed up for the sole purpose of impugning the assembly. Having achieved that objective, it left the assembly hall. A few days later, several representatives of the UCR of the People also left. Finally, a dozen conservative delegates left as well.
