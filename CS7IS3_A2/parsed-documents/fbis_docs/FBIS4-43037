What lessons have you learned from this alliance, and how do you differentiate yourself from your partners? [Santer] Since 1984, we have been committed to a policy of consolidating and transforming the country. We have restructured our steel industry and developed our tertiary sector, especially by consolidating the financial market and the audiovisual sector. We managed to execute these deep-rooted changes thanks to an economic and social policy that has enabled us to fulfil the convergence criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty regarding economic and monetary union. Our concern was to position Luxembourg in this new Europe. I think the two parties in the coalition converge in this respect, in so far as they are both committed to a social model that is also backed by our trade unions. We succeeded with this change, which was extremely deep and also vital for our country, in which two-thirds of all jobs in the steel industry were eliminated, without any social troubles. Of course, our parties -- I would not say the government -- have slightly different economic and financial orientations, but it is up to the government to integrate the various sensibilities into a comprehensive policy. A coalition government is a marriage of convenience lasting a specific period of time. [Gueriviere] You have reached the end of this marriage of convenience. Are you now ready to ally yourself with the liberals if, as they hope to do, they oust the Socialists? [Santer] We are not dismissing any party out of hand, no matter what it is, as long as it is democratic, of course. I myself was a member of a coalition with the Liberals. However, we here in Luxembourg are not in the habit of making declarations of intent before the voters have made their choice. [Gueriviere] This would appear to cloud the image of the parties and complicate the voters' choice. But do not all the majority parties resemble each other as far as the voters are concerned? [Santer] We are presenting a program and results. We have fundamentally reformed the funding of the social security system, in that we used taxation to finance retirements and in that we were able to maintain our social security contributions at a low cost. In this respect, we are complying with the recommendations set out in the white paper by Jacques Delors regarding taxation on the indirect cost of labor. The Luxembourg model as we conceive it, with comanagement in companies and union participation via professional bodies, made it possible to safeguard the social peace. Twice a year, there is a round of tripartite negotiations to facilitate a dialogue between the government, employers, and employees. The outcome of these tripartite agreements is submitted to the Chamber of Deputies and it is Parliament that has the last word in deciding whether or not to ratify the agreements. The art lies in seeking a common denominator among the current trends. In the latest agreements, the employers did not get everything they wanted, nor did the trade unions, just as the government was unable to impose all its views. However, overall, we succeeded in making our businesses more competitive by further lowering wage costs. This was done by having the state take charge of family allowance benefits. In exchange for a guarantee of employment, the unions agreed to a certain level of wage restraint. [Gueriviere] Regarding the future of the European Union [EU], what will your attitude be at the intergovernmental conference on the institutions to be held in 1996, if the rights acquired by the Union's "small countries" are called into question in the name of greater EU efficiency? [Santer] Our position is very clear. We agree to rearranging the institutions in order to make them more efficient, but we feel that, in the main EU bodies, we must now maintain the principle that each country participates "with an equal level of dignity," as President Mitterrand said during his state visit here in Luxembourg. Nor must we overlook the contribution made by "small- and medium-sized" countries to EU construction. I believe that a failure to take this contribution into account would be to deny the European spirit and the Community spirit, which is based on solidarity. The United States of Europe will not be put together along the lines of the United States of America, because our entire history runs counter to that sort of approach. There will always be Luxembourgers, just as there will always be Frenchmen, Germans, and Italians. Our wealth lies in this diversity, and every country must be able to contribute its ingredient to the Union. [Gueriviere] Yes, but in observing the campaign for the European and legislative elections in Luxembourg, one can see nationalist reactions. Did you not underestimate your population's sense of national identity? [Santer] Luxembourg is normally extremely reticent about anything from the outside, given that it is the smallest country in the EU. However, we must be well aware that our entire modern history shows that a "small" country like ours can survive economically and politically in a large group without losing its own identity. Our history has taught us that our position is becoming stronger in that we are sharing sovereignty with others. In the Maastricht Treaty, we do not lose part of our sovereignty, we simply transfer it to supranational bodies where this sovereignty is jointly wielded with our partners. By doing this we gain political importance. Moreover, our country, which was conceived as a buffer state between France and old Prussia, has every interest in consolidating peace. It is our mission to make the voters understand this. [Gueriviere] In a Europe conceived with six or 12 members, it was clear that Luxembourg, as a founder member, played a role that was out of proportion to its true weight. With enlargement, does that not risk becoming less true? [Santer] If, for example, we go by the number of deputies we have in the European Parliament, then you are right. However, I think I can say, and here I am going by my personal experience, that a small country can have an influence in the Union. An influence which is all the greater since it is isolated. [Gueriviere] Luxembourg has just announced that it is joining the Eurocorps. What does that mean in actual fact? [Santer] We made and announced a decision of principle. Now, it is a matter of preparing our participation by seeing how we can make a battalion available to NATO and at the same time participate in the Eurocorps. We are talking to NATO about this. [Gueriviere] At the European Council in Corfu, will you support Jean-Luc Dehaene as successor to Jacques Delors, rather than the candidate from the Netherlands, which is your other partner in the Benelux? [Santer] That is a delicate question! I have always said that I would support a Benelux and Christian Democrat candidate. The problem is that there are two! What I can tell you is that putting off the decision until later sends a bad signal about the functioning of our institutions and would not be credible to public opinion.
