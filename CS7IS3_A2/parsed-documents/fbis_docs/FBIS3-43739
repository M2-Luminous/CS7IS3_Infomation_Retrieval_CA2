"They were hurt when a command-detonated device exploded under their truck and it overturned," UN spokesman Major Tim McDavitt said. "Their injuries were from the truck rolling over, not from shrapnel." All five Indians were reported in "stable condition" at a UN hospital in the southern port of Kismayo, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of the ambush site just outside the town of Jilib. The explosion under the middle vehicle in convoy of three trucks on patrol was followed by an exchange of small arms fire with unidentified Somalis. The motive for the attack was unknown. Meanwhile three Somalis were killed and 12 others injured by an explosion which occurred while they were digging in a trash pit near a U.S. base in Mogadishu, a U.S. spokesman said. Colonel Steve Rausch said U.S. soldiers from nearby Victory Base gave six of the wounded first aid and drove them to a Romanian field hospital at the UN-controlled airport. The other six wounded were also admitted to the Romanian hospital. No further details were immediately available about the blast. Lieutenant General Abu-Samah Abu-Bakar of Malaysia arrived here Thursday to assume military command of the UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM). Outgoing commander Lieutenant General Cevik Bir of Turkey and his deputy, the U.S. force commander Major-General Thomas Montgomery, welcomed Abu-Samah in a brief ceremony at the UN- controlled airport attended by about 100 soldiers from Malaysia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Egypt. Jonathan Howe, a former U.S. admiral, remains in overall command of UNOSOM. Bir, who has been military chief since the United States transferred command of the multinational intervention in Somalia to the United Nations in May, will officially hand over command to Abu- Samah on Tuesday [18 January]. Malaysia has nearly 900 soldiers in Somalia. Abu-Samah met the visiting commander of the U.S. Navy Central Command, Vice Admiral Douglas Katz, soon after his arrival. Katz was to leave Friday after inspecting the UN-controlled port.
