He noted that the new year marks the death of an old era and the birth of a new one. He added: We told the Vatican, which we respect, that if Christ were here now he would expel the Jews from the temple as he did the thieves, because the Jews are the thieves of security, politics, and economy. Therefore, the Vatican's recognition of Israel is not Christian because we believe in Christ's values, which are ones of right and justice. To recognize Israel, he added, is to recognize its injustice against the Arabs and the Palestinians. 'Allamah Fadlallah noted that the United States stands against any righteous and just position in the Third World and is working with its full power against the Islamists and to besiege the Islamic Republic of Iran. He added: While we believe that the United States is the enemy of the peoples and justice, we have no problem with the American people but rather our problem is with the U.S. Administration. Our problem with this administration is that there is no U.S. policy in the region, there is an Israeli policy.
