Vietnam agreed to receive the Australian Parliament consultative delegation in the name of developing bilateral relations between the two countries on the basis of equality, respect for each other's sovereignty, and mutually beneficial cooperation. The purpose of the visit is to exchange views on issues of mutual concern, particularly measures to promote cooperation. Following several meetings, both sides clearly understood this. Any activities that are not in line with this agreement or that intervene in Vietnam's internal affairs would be inappropriate. They could undermine the visit and harm the cooperative relations between the two countries, which have been developing favorably.
