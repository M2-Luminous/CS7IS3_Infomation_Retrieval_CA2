Even within the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, voices can be heard denouncing a program "doomed to failure before it even begins," according to one agronomist. He adds: "There is currently no alternative to cannabis growing." The EC, which is primarily where Morocco turned in February 1993 to request a financial contribution equal to the amount being allocated by the kingdom, is still dragging its feet. The modest sum of DH125 million that was appropriated last December to finance jobs, modernize agriculture, and improve health in the region in question is far less than Moroccan authorities expected. The Twelve [the EC], concerned in particular about the trafficking in cannabis resin (Europeans consume 30 percent of the some 700 metric tons of hashish produced every year), are frightened by the size of the sums at stake. "Twelve billion francs represents one-tenth of our annual development effort," a Commission spokesman emphasized. That cautious attitude exasperates the Moroccans. When he announced his eradication plan, Hassan II denounced "those international middlemen and traffickers who peddle cannabis resin and oil in Europe and make 50 times more profit than the peasants growing that crop." The fact is that the consuming countries bear a great responsibility for the trafficking in question. The very rapid expansion in cannabis acreage over the past 10 years or so is largely due to the consuming frenzy of the Europeans, who are encouraged by more or less permissive legislation in their own countries. In the 1970's, many pushers rushed to the Rif mountains, where growing and consuming Indian hemp was a centuries-old tradition. The peasants, hard hit by drought and severe soil erosion--2 percent of the soil washes into the Mediterranean every year--found cannabis an easy solution to their problems. The inevitable consequence was that the area planted in cannabis went from 6,000 to 50,000 hectares in 15 years! The crop was confined to the Ketama region at first, but now it stretches for more than 150 km between Tetouan and Al Hoceima. It is a real industry and one that pays off big: the annual turnover exceeds DH20 billion--the same as the budget earmarked for the five-year eradication plan. This hidden sector is as important to the Moroccan economy as earnings from emigrants. The money, which is often reinvested in real estate, generally in Spain, also benefits big Moroccan traffickers. The rising power of tightly structured gangs is a considerable hindrance to the Moroccan Government, which is in the midst of negotiating a partnership agreement with the European Union and cannot allow mafia-like practices to develop in its territory on a large scale. Combined with that desire for "honorability" abroad is the need at home to combat a traffic that not only increases corruption among officials but also hastens the emergence of a new social class consisting of farmers enriched by cannabis and increases the risk of secession by a region traditionally jealous of its independence. As far back as the latest municipal elections (in 1992), nearly 440 candidates linked to the drug traffic--and more interested in a legal cover for their criminal activity than in the affairs of their municipalities--had to be stricken from the ballot. Others managed to get elected thanks to blackmail, bribery, or physical violence. It was in that context that the King banged the table with his fist and began a wrestling match with the traffickers. Since then, a real quarantine line has been set up around the production area, and police checks have been stepped up. "The roads to Tangier and Casablanca are being increasingly guarded," says one Ketama resident. That repressive action, undertaken largely at the behest of the Europeans, who have made it "an indispensable condition for the success of the program," is beginning to worry all those in the Rif who are dependent in one way or another on drug money. The fact is that the ambitious program to develop the North is not very attractive to the some 200,000 cannabis growers. It calls for replacing kif with appropriate crops such as fruit, almonds, and figs, opening up a region where some villages are accessible only by donkey, and providing sizable infrastructure (roads, drinking water supply, electrification, and so on). "It will take a long time to combat this scourge because cannabis is very profitable," says Hamid, a stockraiser faced with the slow disappearance of grazing land as the inevitable consequence of deforestation linked to the illegal growing of kif. Other farmers do not hesitate to say that "the authorities close their eyes" to the trafficking. According to the Geopolitical Drug Observatory (OGD), it is publicly rumored that the highest state authorities have benefited from the traffic. Another problem to be solved is this: a planter who grows cannabis can hope to earn DH30,000 (18,400 French francs) per hectare annually, or 10 times what he would earn by growing almonds. Among the small-time pushers who make the trip from Casablanca to Ketama every month to buy hashish despite the increasing risks, no one believes that cannabis growing can be stopped. "It supports too many families, and the peasants are often in debt to the big traffickers," says Rahal, who is one of those pushers. Another problem in this mountainous area is that of achieving participation by the local population, which is historically resistant to any "interference" by the central government. All the more, says one academic in the capital, since "the authorities all too often confuse participation with political control." Other development programs for these northern provinces were launched by the FAO [UN Food and Agriculture Organization] and the World Bank in the 1980's, and they were a complete failure. But this eradication program is still the first of its scope in the world. Unlike the program in Mexico, it is not limited to the destruction of drug plantations by napalm with no regard for the farmers' future. It is true that keeping the inhabitants in the Rif and improving their standard of living by licit means is essential to avoid an inordinate increase in the rural exodus and emigration. Most of the Moroccan immigrants in Europe are from this deprived area. Denounced by the kingdom's media and lacking an ambitious financial aid policy, the Twelve, "with their logic of the lowest cost," might very well find themselves faced with the following dilemma: more hashish available for European consumers or more immigrants. In either case, the limits of repressive measures have been revealed.
