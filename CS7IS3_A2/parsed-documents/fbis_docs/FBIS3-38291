"Since my arrival in Bosnia, we have developed a system of air cover (by the NATO fighter-bombers participating in the `deny flight' operation). If there had been a massive attack against the major UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] bases, I would not have hesitated to call for these planes to intervene as they would have been acting in legitimate defense," he said at a news conference in Evere, three days after his return from Bosnia. "If the lives of dozens of blue helmets had been in danger, General Cot (commander of the UN forces in the former Yugoslavia) and I would have requested permission from the UN headquarters in New York to reply with air power," he added. He confirmed, however, his opposition to massive air strikes against the positions of the fighters. General Briquemont also indicated that a withdrawal of the blue helmets from Bosnia in the spring -- as is often mentioned -- would be a "terrible failure" for the United Nations. "Certain troops would also be very difficult to retrieve. I am not sure that the population of Sarajevo would allow the UNPROFOR to leave, as it represents their sole guarantee of survival," he warned. Finally, the former commander of the blue helmets in Bosnia called on the international community to adopt a coherent strategy on Bosnia, while stressing that he did not believe that any of the parties in the field were in a position to win the war.
