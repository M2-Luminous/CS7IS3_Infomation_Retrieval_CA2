FR941212-1-00032 FR941212-1-00012 Applicant may petition to have an abandoned provisional application revived as a pending provisional application for a period of no longer than twelve months from the filing date of the provisional application where the delay was unavoidable or unintentional. It would be permissible to file a petition for revival later than twelve months from the filing date of the provisional application but only to revive the application for the twelve-month period following filing. Thus, even if the petition were granted to reestablish the pendency up to the end of the twelve-month period, the provisional application would not be considered pending after twelve months from its filing date. The requirements for reviving an abandoned provisional application set forth in this new rule parallel the existing requirements set forth in §1.137. Sections 1.177, 1.312(b), 1.313(a), 1.314 and 1.666 would have the reference to §1.17(i)(1) replaced with a reference to §1.17(i) to be consistent with the proposed change to §1.17. No substantive change is intended by these proposals. Section 1.701 would be added to provide for the extension of patent term where the issuance of a patent on an application filed after the implementation date of the 20-year patent term provisions of S. 2467 and H.R. 5110, other than for designs, was delayed due to certain causes of prosecution delay. By virtue of 35 U.S.C. 173, the term of a patent and patent term extension under proposed 35 U.S.C. 154 do not apply to patents for designs. The provisions for patent term extension under proposed §1.701 are separate from and in addition to the patent term extension provisions of 35 U.S.C. 156. The patent term extension provisions of S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 are designed to compensate the patent owner for delays in issuing a patent, whereas the patent term extension provisions of 35 U.S.C. 156 are designed to restore term lost to premarket regulatory review after the grant of a patent. In order to prevent a term extension under proposed section 1.701 from precluding a term extension under 35 U.S.C. 156, S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 amend 35 U.S.C. 156(a)(2) to provide that the term has never been extended under 35 U.S.C. 156(e)(1). Under proposed 35 U.S.C. 154(b)(1), if the issuance of a patent is delayed due to proceedings under 35 U.S.C. 135(a) and/or the application is placed under a secrecy order under 35 U.S.C. 181, the term of a patent could be extended for the period of delay up to five years. Proceedings under 35 U.S.C. 135(a) include any appeal to federal court. Under proposed 35 U.S.C. 154(b)(2), if the issuance of a patent is delayed due to appellate review by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences or by a federal court and the patent was issued pursuant to a decision reversing an adverse determination of patentability and if the patent is not subject to a terminal disclaimer due to the issuance of another patent claiming subject matter that is not patentably distinct from that under appellate review, the term of the patent could be extended for the period of delay up to five years. Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 154(b)(4), as contained in S. 2467 and H.R. 5110, the term of a patent could only be extended under 35 U.S.C. 154(b)(1) and (b)(2) for a maximum of five years regardless of whether there were delays due to more than one of the reasons covered under 35 U.S.C. 154(b) (1) and (2). Proposed subparagraph (c)(1) of §1.701 sets forth the method for calculating the period of delay where the delay was a result of proceedings under 35 U.S.C. 135(a). Proposed subparagraph (c)(2) sets forth the method for calculating the period of delay where the delay was a result of the application being placed under a secrecy order. Proposed subparagraph (c)(3) sets forth the method of calculating the period of delay where the delay was a result of appellate review. Pursuant to proposed §1.701(d)(1), the period of delay set forth in subparagraph (c)(3) shall be reduced by any time calculated under subparagraph (c)(3) before the expiration of three years from the filing date of the first national patent application presented for examination. The filing date for the purpose of §1.701(d)(1) would be the earliest effective U.S. filing date but not including the filing date of a provisional application or the international filing date of a PCT application. For PCT applications entering the national stage, the filing date for the purpose of §1.701(d)(1) would be the date on which applicant has complied with the requirements of §1.494(b), or §1.495(b) if applicable. Pursuant to proposed §1.701(d)(2), the period of delay set forth in subparagraph (c)(3) shall also be reduced by any time, as determined by the Commission, during which the applicant did not act with due diligence. The standard for determining due diligence is whether the applicant exhibited that degree of timeliness as may reasonably be expected from, and which is ordinarily exercised by, a person during the pendency period of the application. Examples of what may constitute lack of due diligence for this purpose include requests for extensions of time to respond to Office communications, submission of a response which is not fully responsive to an Office communication, and filing of informal applications. Applicants need not file a request for the extension of patent term under proposed §1.701. The extension of patent term is automatic by operation of law. It is currently anticipated that applicant would be advised as to the length of any patent term extension at the time of receiving the Notice of Allowance and Issue Fee Due. Review of any determination as to the length of patent term extension would be by way of petition under §1.181. Section 3.21 would eliminate the use of serial number and filing date as an identifier for national patent applications in assignment documents. This proposal would eliminate any confusion as to whether an application identified by its serial number and filing date in an assignment document is an application filed under proposed §1.53(b)(1) or §1.62 or a design application or a provisional application since there is a different series code assigned to each of these types of applications. If an assignment was executed after the filing of the national application, the assignment would be required to identify the application by the application number, consisting of the series code and serial number, e.g., 07/123,456 (for applications filed under proposed §1.53(b)(1) or 1.62), 29/123,456 (for design applications) or 59/123,456 (for provisional applications filed under proposed §1.53 (b)(2)). The series code would be required since it would clearly identify the application to which the assignment document is directed. Section 3.21 would be further clarified to indicate that existing requirements relating to assignments executed before the filing of the application refer to applications other than provisional applications. Section 3.21 would be further amended to specify the requirements for identifying a provisional application in an assignment executed before the filing of the provisional application. The assignment would be required to identify the provisional application by name of each inventor and the title of the invention. The date of the execution of the provisional application would not be required since a provisional application need not be executed by the inventors. Section 3.81 would have the reference to §1.17(i)(1) replaced with a reference to §1.17(i) to be consistent with the proposed change to §1.17. No substantive change is intended by this proposal.
