The international exhibit on ``Mother and Child Care--93,'' which opened in Moscow, proposes to solve them by means of the latest medical technologies. In his remarks at the opening of this exhibit, Eduard Nechayev, Russian Federation health minister, stated that the problem of mother and child care in Russia is presently one of the top priorities. For expressly this reason he considers this exhibit to be very important. The minister expressed his hope that this will be instrumental in development of a system of mother and child care in our country. The indicators characterizing obstetric care in Russia are lower than those of a number of foreign countries: mother and infant mortality rates, as well as morbidity rates for children and pregnant women, are high. The incidence of abortions also remains high. In the opinion of Nikolay Vaganov, Russian Federation deputy health minister, all this is attributable, to a considerable extent, to the flaws in obstetric technologies, intensive care and resuscitation of neonates, as well as shortage of drugs. The deputy minister mentioned that one of the ways to solve this problem is for Russia to set up joint production of equipment and drugs with western firms. The ``Mother and Child'' exhibit offers modern equipment, instruments and drugs used in gynecology, obstetrics and pediatrics.
