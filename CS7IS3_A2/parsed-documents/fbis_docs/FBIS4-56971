He said this was determined by the testimony of three repentant Shining Path members who were under the command of one of them and also from intelligence information. Other military chiefs said the dead were known as "Comrade Mardonio" and "Comrade Abel" of the logistical and military commands respectively of the so-called 3d Batallion of the Moena-Moyuno People's Committee. The body of "Comrade Abel" supposedly belongs to the peasant Felix Loyola who, according to his wife and relatives, was a coca grower who had his farm in this sector and was shot by soldiers when he was leaving the area. Gen.
