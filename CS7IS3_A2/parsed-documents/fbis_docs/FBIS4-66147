Hence its limitations. Fifty-seven countries or international organizations, including the United States and Russia, will be represented at the opening session of the Conference on Stability in Europe, which is being held at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. This French initiative, the brainchild of [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur, has been taken up by the EU and, according to a senior official at the French Foreign Ministry, constitutes "the first real sign of common foreign and security policy as defined at Maastricht." With a wide variety of bodies such as the Council of Europe, the CSCE, NATO, the WEU [Western European Union], the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, and the Partnership for Peace, there is no shortage of organizations responsible for ensuring peace in continental Europe. However, now we are being asked to believe that they are not sufficient. Hence the idea of this conference, which, within one year, should lead to a stability pact under the auspices of the CSCE. "The diplomatic response to a problem is traditionally to create an institution or to publish a long declaration," said Edouard Balladur. This time, he said, "it has been decided to intervene at the very source of the problem itself, by seeking to resolve the questions concerning minorities and borders via the implementation of pragmatic measures. The example of Yugoslavia, which demonstrates the dangers of leaving questions in abeyance or unresolved, is probably prominent in everybody's mind." Consequently, according to [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, it will be a question of proceeding with an exercise in "preventive diplomacy." However, by deliberately placing it within the perspective of the EU, the French foreign minister has excluded the hottest dossiers: Bosnia, Kosovo, the Crimea or Caucasus, etc. In short, "the plan applies precisely to the area where there are no problems," said one British diplomatic ironically. This renders no less laudable the objective being sought, namely to ensure that the countries counted as candidate EU member states (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania) establish relations built on trust at regional level, by signing reciprocal good neighborliness agreements. This is something that Alain Lamassoure, [French] minister delegate for European affairs, sums up in the following terms: "We are ready to welcome new members, but not new sources of conflict." After having adopted a final document reiterating the main principles of the CSCE (respect for human rights and the rights of minorities, etc.), the participants in the conference will have to have "multilateral or regional discussions" in order to try and settle, for instance, the fate of the Hungarian minorities in Romania and Slovakia, or that of the Russian minorities in the Baltic states. "We will have to combine the strong political impetus given by the EU and the Paris conference with great flexibility in the methods of negotiation, bearing in mind the subjects treated. The important thing is to stipulate an obligation to achieve a result," says Paris. An interim conference could be scheduled for the end of the year to evaluate the progress being made, and the final conference at which the stability pact will be adopted could be held "during the first half, or even the first quarter, of 1995," said Alain Juppe.
