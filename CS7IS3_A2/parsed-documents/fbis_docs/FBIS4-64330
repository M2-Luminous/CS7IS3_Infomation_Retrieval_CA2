Hardly any country is so much aware of that as Germany. In the U.S. headquarters in Berlin, John F. Kennedy's phrase "The world must know that we are willing to fight for Berlin" can be read in bronze letters. Tomorrow U.S. soldiers and their families will be the guests of families in Berlin and will say good-bye. They came as occupiers, became protectors, and leave as friends -- as was stated by Major General Walter Yates, who will be the last U.S. soldier to leave Berlin on 15 October. Polls show: For more than 80 percent of Germans the United States is the most important partner. It is said that States only have interests and no friends. However, the Marshall Plan, the Berlin blockade, and, most recently, reunification showed us to our pleasure that peoples do have friends. Our American friends must know: This will never be forgotten. As a result of the end of the East-West conflict, a worldwide threat to security has been abolished. Economic aspects are now becoming more important all over the world -- also in the European-U.S. relationship. However, I am profoundly convinced -- and this, Ladies and Gentlemen, is my most important message to you this evening -- that Germans and Americans will be able to continue the great chapter of success of the postwar period also in the new time. For quite a simple reason: We need each other in the future just as we did in the past! We have not only common interests but our common interests and ties far exceed our differences. Germany and the United States form the core of NATO. Never before have U.S. Armed Forces been so closely interlaced. We are alternating as world champions in export, and we are leading in the support for Central and East Europe and the CIS states. The dollar and German mark are the main reserve currencies in the world, and we are both leading in the protection of the natural bases of life. Since 1945 more Americans have lived and worked in Germany than anywhere else in the world. The United States is the biggest foreign investor in Germany and, at the same time, number one in German foreign investments. For 40 years we successfully were against communism. Today the important thing is what we stand for together. This is more difficult, but also more profitable: Up to now we had to invest in armament, now we can finally turn to the tasks of peace. Just as we, together with France, are the engine of European integration in the European Union [EU], we, together with the United States, want to be the engine for enforcing European-Atlantic goals. Being the common driving force for efficient multilateralism -- this is our idea. Making sure together that the new multilateral order, rudiments of which already exist, works properly -- this is our goal. The ties between us, which have proved their worth over 40 years, are not weakened by European unification -- on the contrary, they get an additional dimension: We also understand ourselves as an important supporter of European-U.S. dialogue and as a guarantor of an Atlantic Europe which is open to the world, supports free trade, and in which our American friends will always remain our most important partner. This European dimension of our relations will become increasingly important in the future, given the new importance of economic and trade issues. I am convinced that President Clinton's planned visit in July will make this new dimension of our ties very clear. After reunification and the fall of the Iron Curtain our interests remain basically unchanged: First: We owe security and prosperity to being anchored in the Western community of peoples through the EU and the Alliance. Second: European and Transatlantic anchoring cannot be played off against each other; they are inseparable and interdependent. Third: The Alliance is the most important and indispensable link across the Atlantic. It is a forum for dialogue, an anchor of security, a shield for European unification, and a manager of regional conflicts all in one. Without the Alliance there would not be any balance in Europe; in particular, however, there would not be any equal partnership with Russia, which we are striving for together. The wooing of the old lady NATO could not be more stormy than it is at the moment. In Germany, NATO is more popular than ever in the past 15 years. It may sound paradoxical in view of the end of the East-West conflict, but if NATO did not exist, one would have to invent it again! Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are confronted with issues that hardly anyone thought about 10 years ago: How can the citizens in the industrial states get appropriately paid jobs, if hundreds of millions of people in East Europe or in the Third World compete with them for a fraction of the wages paid in our countries? How can we establish a stable and liberal order all over Europe after the end of communism? How can we prevent the struggle for technological superiority from turning the three large industrial regions into opponents? During the hour that I am talking to you here, another 10,000 people will be born. In the course of 800 years -- from the birth of Christ to the time of Charlemagne -- mankind grew by 50 million. Today it is growing by this number within eight months. Can we brake this development in time, before it will become impossible to live a decent life in this world? We need look no longer for a new transatlantic agenda for the turn of the millennium. These challenges are the agenda. If we want to save something of the prosperity and the security of our days for our children and grandchildren in the next millennium, then this agenda must lead to common transatlantic solutions. Japan and the Pacific area must be included. Never has political leadership been more urgent than during this time of revolutionary changes. And it can come only from one country -- the United States. The superpower United States must keep its leading role! I see four main tasks for a strategic transatlantic partnership: First: All three large industrial regions must put their houses in order. This is the precondition for successful cooperation toward the outside. The G-7 conference in Detroit was a signal: The employment crisis cannot be solved by working against each other. Detroit may have shown a vision for the future: European vocational training coupled with U.S. mobility. We are learning from each other. The great trump card of your country is the readiness for change, the courage to follow new paths. In the United States the multimedia world of the 21st century is currently developing. West Europe must get away from the mentality of the status quo and of complete insurance. However, the economy in our countries is also experiencing an upswing again. The extraordinary effort of internal unification is showing success. In the new laender we expect a growth of 8 percent this year. We want to participate in heading the necessary intellectual and economic renewal of Europe. Second: Whether it will be possible to save the world from a relapse into the power struggles of the past will be decided in Europe. With the same energy that the United States and West Europe used to preserve West Europe's freedom in the postwar period, they now must help to make democracy and market economy irreversible all over Europe. The opening up of the EU and NATO toward the East is thus becoming the decisive stabilizing element. This means setting the course in Europe for the next years. The accession of Norway and the so far neutral countries Austria, Finland, and Sweden to the EU, for which I have worked with all my strength, will be another milestone in overcoming the European division. However, the postwar Europe will be completely a part of history only when Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and others also sit at the table in Brussels. European and German interests are parallel in this respect. We are the advocate for the return of these states to Europe. However, this does not mean that we want to get away from the West. We want to have "West" also at our eastern border, that is the point! As little as Europe was viable with the Iron Curtain, as little can it flourish in the long run with a dividing trench which divides the European democracies into a two-class system. After centuries of fratricidal wars and two world wars, the reconciliation of minds and the unification of forces in Europe remains a historical task. And if there is a foreign policy mission for the united Germany, then it is the mission to support this task, to unify Europe, and to save it from a relapse into the past. The path toward this is the one that we are following: common institutions, a big single market, equal laws, and regional solidarity. Everything in Europe is oriented toward this model of the EU -- like metal parts toward a magnet. It will determine Europe's course in the future. Therefore, my message to our American friends: Even if the EU is not yet what we would like it to be -- do not underestimate this Europe! The discussion about our participation in the D-Day celebrations in Normandy shows that 50 years are a short time in the memories of the peoples. However, we know how much new, real ties have developed despite the continuing memory of all the terrible things of the past. De Gaulle rightly called the close German-French relationship the actual miracle of the postwar period. We ourselves do not want to ignore our past. We are building on it, and we see our view confirmed that memories do not block the view into a better common future. The credo of your administration: "Foreign policy is domestic policy is foreign policy" applies to us Germans in a particular way: A humane, liberal face of our country, our credibility as democrats are the basic precondition for our position in the international community. I do not want to play down in any way the ugly and incomprehensible things that have happened in the recent past in Germany to foreigners or Jewish facilities. I just ask you to believe me when I say: This is done by deluded individuals. This is not Germany! We Germans are ashamed of that, we abhor it! We have learned from our history. Ladies and Gentlemen, Jim Hoagland once called the traditional U.S. attitude toward European integration "creative ambivalence." I would call the position of the current administration a position of "creative involvement." With its offer of the Partnership for Peace the United States has convincingly documented its power of political leadership and its continuing will to participate in shaping the European fate. Now there is a concept for solving the complicated security needs in the postcommunist Europe, a concept that has met with widespread approval. It avoids the dead end of the either membership or exclusion. It facilitates a flexible approach to NATO without tearing up any new trenches. I hope that Russia, too, will join in soon. To all those who are calling for a "take and run policy" by referring to Zhirinovskiy, that is, quickly lowering a new Iron Curtain a few hundred kilometers east of the old one, I can only say: Anyone who now leaves the reformers in Moscow in the lurch burdens himself with great responsibility. Russia is undergoing a tensile test. No one could seriously have expected that this enormous process of transformation from a dictatorship to democracy would take place without any problems. We must not show less understanding and patience toward the new democratic forces in Moscow now than we showed to the communist apparatchiks in the past. As long as Russia says "yes" to partnership with Europe and the United States, we want to say "yes" to partnership with Russia. A new European order presupposes equal rights and mutual respect -- for big and small. We must help the reformers, who are under great pressure at home, to keep their country on this European course. Russia is a large and important country, which cannot be bypassed by a new European peace order. The actual question is not whether the West can influence the internal development in Russia but whether it can afford not to try. I think: No, it cannot, and with this opinion I find myself in the company of Warren Christopher. Third: The EU and the United States must together become the most important supporter of the new multilateral architecture and its global responsibility. Germany wants to participate in this fully, if necessary also with military means. However, global co-responsibility must also mean global co-determination. In this spirit we have registered our claim for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. I am grateful for U.S. support. Regarding greater German co-responsibility in the United Nations there is broad agreement between the Federal Government and the opposition. However, this consensus does not cover the role of the Bundeswehr. As a Liberal I certainly do not want a militarization of our foreign policy. As a realist, however, I also know that there are situations in which aggression and violence can be ended only with violence in return. Germany's foreign and security policy cannot ignore this insight. As a result of the changed tasks of NATO and the Western EU, this now involves our ability to function in the alliance! We will not forget our past, but we will not hide behind it, either. I expect the Federal Constitutional Court to pave the way for that soon. Strategic partnership across the Atlantic naturally requires an interlocutor on the European side and a common European foreign and security policy, which deserves this name. Admittedly, there is still a lot to be done in this respect. Germany does not see a common European policy as a restriction but as the only chance for really getting something done on the world stage. Institutions depend on the interests and possibilities of those of their member states that are most capable of action. In Croatia and Bosnia not only the EU, but also NATO and the United Nations had to realize that. Barbarism has returned virtually at our doorstep. The tragedy of Gorazde forces the admission: None of the international organizations has passed its test so far. On the other hand, we must see clearly that there are no simple and speedy recipes for success in this conflict. However, resignation is also forbidden. The peace process must be continued. We must continue to look for a pragmatic path in the middle. It lies in a credible mixture of political and military options. In our view, President Clinton's new initiative offers a good basis for that. Above all, the political efforts of the EU, the United States, and Russia must be brought closer together. In this conflict, too, it has been shown again: One cannot do without the United States. Therefore, we have urged the United States [to undertake] greater involvement right from the start. Fourth: Strategic partnership -- this is no less urgent in the economy, the ecology, and the North-South field. The GATT agreement has banished the danger of the development of trade fortresses for the time being. But the trade imbalances in the triangle of Europe, the United States, and Japan are an ongoing source of serious tension. The EU and the United States agree on the need for greater opening up of the Japanese market. In the field of military security we have successfully taken one lesson into account for the past 40 years: If one's partner is well off, one is also well off. We still have to learn that this also applies to the economy. We need some sort of code of behavior for the geo-economic age. It must balance competition with cooperation, and free trade with ecology and social development. Ladies and Gentlemen, "For better or worse, we have had to learn that we all live in one world, in which we cannot isolate ourselves. We have learned that peace and well-being are inseparable and cannot be bought at the cost of the pace and well-being of another people." This was stated by State Secretary Byrnes in his great reconciliatory speech in Stuttgart on 6 September 1946. Today we once again make this experience in a world that has become freer but not simpler. However, we have every reason to rely on the opportunities provided by the new freedom and not to let ourselves be discouraged by the risks. If Europeans and Americans, Germany and the United States stand together, then there is very little that they cannot master together. The United States can rely on Germany! We know that we can rely on the United States!
