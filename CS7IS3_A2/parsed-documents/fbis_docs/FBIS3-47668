"Future consumption tax must be indicated... and should be stated in a package of tax reform bills" on cuts in income tax and taxes levied by local authorities on their residents, Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, told a press conference called to correct his comments. Earlier, the head of the advisory panel to the prime minister told reporters, "It's not necessary now" to include the consumption tax rate as long as the package includes the timing of the hike. The consumption tax, currently 3 percent, is levied on practically all goods and services. Kato's earlier statement was apparently aimed at mollifying members of the ruling coalition -- most notably the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] -- who are strongly opposed to raising the consumption tax rate. His retraction came after the Finance Ministry objected that his comments could be interpreted as virtually allowing a tax cut to be carried out separately from hiking the consumption tax. Kato said the tax cut will stimulate the economy even if a consumption tax hike is included in the package for later implementation. "The tax cut might have been ineffective last year, but would be effective this year" with the economy "starting to show signs of hitting bottom," he said. A consumption tax hike would therefore not undermine consumption, and the government and politicians should clearly state the "consumption tax rate and its timing" in the proposed tax law to guarantee repayment of "bridge" bonds to fund the tax cut, Kato said. He said the argument that a consumption tax hike would dampen consumption is "absolutely a fiction," especially in Japan where savings are still high compared with other countries. "Last-minute" spending can be expected, as happened in China when the government there announced in December a new consumption tax, he said, adding the panel is to study the Chinese case. Many computer simulations show that the economy may "suffer sluggish consumption for six months to a year" after the spending spree subsides, but will "recover in the following year," he said. Japanese politicians and U.S. Government officials have voiced concerns that a tax cut would be ineffective if linked to a future consumption tax hike. Referring to opinions that an income tax cut would spur economic recovery, leading to increased tax revenues, Kato said such a scenario has been proven wrong in the United States under the administration of President Ronald Reagan. Concerning deficit-covering bonds, he said, "Bridge bonds are for repayment in the short term, and it's irresponsible... to borrow without any scheme for paying back." "Politicians may not win votes with a consumption tax hike...but those who correct public views instead of just following them are the true politicians," he said. As for signs of the economy hitting bottom, he cited recovering spending mainly on housing resulting from lower land prices, impact of the yen's exchange rate changing favorably for Japanese companies, and an expected increase in automobile purchases because of a cut in the tax on automobile sales. He also said the bribery scandals involving general contractors that have held up public works projects are "near settlement," and the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks may lead to lower prices. Meanwhile, a senior member of the tax panel told reporters the panel cannot support any issuance of deficit-covering bonds and wants the government to launch the tax cut and hike in a single law. But the panel, which resumed discussing the tax reform Friday after a break since mid-December, confirmed its stance of "leaving the decision to the government and coalition parties," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. As for a timetable, the panel will meet on Tuesday and Friday next week and hold meetings almost evevy day from the following week with a target of issuing final proposals by the end of January, he said.
