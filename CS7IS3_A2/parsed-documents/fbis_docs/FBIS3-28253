FBIS3-28253 "dreas024_a_94033" FBIS-EAS-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 February 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Complaint Filed Against Ozawa Over Donation OW0402090894 Tokyo KYODO in English 0811 GMT 4 Feb 94 OW0402090894 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- A group of 23 private individuals filed a complaint with public prosecutors against Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] co-leader Ichiro Ozawa on Friday [4 February], accusing him of illegally receiving a 5 million yen political donation in December 1992. The group also lodged accusations with the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office against four accountants of Ozawa's fund-raising bodies and a former executive of a major construction firm who allegedly passed on the 5 million yen. The group's written complaint accused Ozawa and the other five of violating the Political Funds Control Law. Ozawa, former secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has denied allegations he regularly received illegal donations from the major general contractor over the past few years, including the 5 million yen in December 1992. But Shinji Kiyoyama, 67, a senior vice president of Kajima Corp., has acknowledged to prosecutors that Kajima gave Ozawa donations of 5 million yen twice a year -- in midsummer and at the year-end -- for two or three years, prosecution sources have said. Kiyoyama is under arrest on suspicion of giving a 20 million yen bribe to then Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi to get favorable treatment for Kajima in bids for prefectural public works projects. According to the plea of complaint, Ozawa and the four accountants did not list the scandal-plagued Kajima Corp. in his reports of spending and revenues on political donations despite receiving more than 1 million yen in donations from the firm. The Political Funds Control Law prohibits politicians from receiving more than 1.5 million yen a year from any single individual or corporation and also requires politicians to report the names of donors of 1 million yen or more at any one time. Early last November, Ozawa told reporters he accepted the 5 million yen from Kajima as a legal political donation and denied allegations he regularly received illegal contributions from the leading contractor over the past few years. Several of his political organizations received money from Kajima and formally issued receipts for the money, Ozawa said.
