According to a U.S. military spokesman, the work was suspended because of protests by residents of Legua de Pital, who blocked roads and demanded drains be built to avoid floods in the rainy season. The residents also warned that if troops continue their work without changing their construction techniques, they will organize more demonstrations to stop work by the Army Engineers. Meanwhile, a communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in San Jose noted that U.S. soldiers will be remodeling and repairing several schools in the area over the next few days. The soldiers have been in the country since mid-January, participating in the annual "Caminos de Paz 1994" maneuvers.
