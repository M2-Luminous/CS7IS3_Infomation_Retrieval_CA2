The Togolese delegation was led by Colonel Sei Memene, director of national security, while the Ghanaian side was led by Colonel Jasper Ahadzi, President Rawlings's special adviser for security affairs. Johnny Kojo Maxwell, Ghanaian charge d'affaires in Togo, also attended the meeting. It was the second time that the two delegations have met. The first meeting took place on 10 January a few hours after the terrorist aggression against Lome. Nothing filtered out of the meeting, which lasted 30 minutes. Nevertheless, it is quite probable that the two parties are trying to ease the tension between the two countries. Relations between Ghana and Togo have seriously deteriorated since 5 January when there was a commando attack on the Interarms Regiment camp where the Togolese head of state has his residence. Togo accused its western neighbor of serving as a base for the attackers.
