On the evening of 31 May last year, (Ma Zhanxiang), (Sha Zhufu), and (Zheng Erli) sneaked into the office of the No. 2 plant of the Harbin city vehicle company in order to attempt robbery. (Gao Jinzou), a civil policeman of the railway goods yard police substation of the Harbin Railway Station, discovered these three suspicious-looking persons and prepared to take them back to the police substation for questionning. These three criminals robbed (Gao Jinzou) of his 54-caliber gun, and he died after being stabbed in 16 places. The three criminals took the gun and ran away. In the first ruling on the case, the Harbin Railway Transportation Intermediate Court sentenced (Ma Zhanxiang) and (Zha Zhufu) to death. Being under-aged when he committed the crime, (Zheng Erli) was given a lighter sentence of life imprisonment. Although the three criminals lodged appeals after the first ruling, the provincial higher court overruled the appeal in the second ruling so that the original judgment stands.
