The Golan Heights Settlements Committee says the remarks undermine the existence of all the settlements in the north and raise a question about the country's future. Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu says Rabin's remarks attest to the total political collapse of a weak prime minister. Rabin disavows his commitment to the settlements' continued existence and the control of the Golan in the peace era as well, Knesset Member [MK] Netanyahu says. The Tzomet faction is demanding that the prime minister announce immediate elections in order to allow the people to decide whether Golan settlements should be removed. MK Refa'el Eytan says that Rabin has apparently been lying to the nation for a long time. The National Religious Party says the prime minister is forfeiting the Jewish people's assets like a political greenhorn.
