State Councillor Chen Junsheng, who is in charge of China's agriculture, said it is of strategic importance to the prosperous national economy to increase farmers' income in a stable way and ensure adequate supply of farm produce. The official said China could not be well off if farmers' could not live a fairly comfortable life, adding that a brisk national market is impossible if farmers' purchasing power is not improved and rural markets remain low. China's government has promised to give a comfortable life to its citizens by the year 2000. The goal requires the average annual growth rate of farmers' income be more than five percent during the remaining years. The per capita net income of 900 million farmers for 1993 is estimated at 880 yuan (about 100 U.S. dollars). The figure represents a real increase of about two percent over the previous year after inflation. "Farmers' income has been growing too slowly during the past several years. The average annual growth rate for 1985-1992 is only 2.2 percent. It could be said that farmers' income has been fluctuating," said Chen. In order to improve farmers' income, the Chinese Government is considering a package of measures to promote the development of agriculture and the rural economy. The measures under consideration include more investment in agriculture, construction of more major grain and cotton production centers, improvement of the grain protection system for situations when the grain price is too low to be profitable, and faster development of township and village enterprises. Statistics show that about 60 percent of farmers' net income has in recent years come from township and village enterprises. The sustained increase of farmers' income depends considerably on the growth rate and efficiency of rural firms. Last year the Chinese Government announced an increase of grain and cotton prices. Chen said that efforts should be continued to supervise and control the financial burdens or taxes imposed on farmers. He stressed that it was important to prevent farmers' increased income being taken away from them.
