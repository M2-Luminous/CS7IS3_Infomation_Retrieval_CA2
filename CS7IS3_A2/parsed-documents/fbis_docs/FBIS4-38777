People's Deputy Petro Osadchuk sharply criticized the draft resolution and noted that the document "plays into Yuriy Meshkov's hands" and is an example of "Kravchuk's head in the sand policy" over Crimea. Admiral Borys Kozhyn, speaking on behalf of the Rukh deputies' group, noted that the Republic of Crimea should be transformed into a Crimea-Tatar autonomy within the composition of Ukraine. He criticized the president and the government since, in his words, they assumed the position of detached onlookers of events in Crimea. Borys Kozhyn proposed that the president should travel to Crimea together with ministers to "tackle the problem within the law." Serhiy Kyyashko, a representative of the socialist group, supported Kravchuk's proposal and the draft resolution. Olha Pshenychna, a deputy from Crimea and member of the interregional deputies' group, asked deputies "not to make any hasty conclusions and decisions noting that people in Crimea want peace and not bloodshed." She proposed that the president of Ukraine should seek advice from the Russian president and that the Supreme Council of Ukraine should seek advice from the Russian State Duma. People's Deputy Serhiy Holovatyy said that he has a plan on how to solve the "Crimean problem" and is prepared to give it to the president. Discussion of this issue continues.
