The measure, which was approved by congress, was sanctioned by President Itamar Franco on 27 May with two vetoes and it was published in the official gazette on 28 May. [passage omitted] The two vetoes by President Franco to Provisional Measure 482 affect the parity between agricultural products prices (Paragraph 2, Article 16) and labor relations (Article 41). Paragraph 2, Article 16, established that "monetary correction" of rural financial, marketing, or investment credit operations regardless of their source, "must be equivalent to the minimum prices in force for agricultural products." This amendment was part of the agreement reached between the congressional ruralist bloc and the government to approve the provisional measure.
