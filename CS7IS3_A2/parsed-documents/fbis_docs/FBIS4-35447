National Security Adviser Anthony Lake recently issued a new dictum, whereby the U.S. administration would be prepared to cooperate with radical Muslim regimes as long as these were elected in democratic elections. Although Lake and his aides did not use the words "fundamentalist regimes," they were primarily referring to extremist regimes rather than countries such as Saudi Arabia which has long been embraced by the United States. Lake did not specify the characteristics which would meet U.S. criteria, which led to a great deal of confusion in several Arab countries. "I guess they mean well, but somehow they manage to hurt their friends," says an Egyptian official. "At a time when Egypt is beginning to prove its ability to fight fundamentalist terror, the United States displays an incomprehensible tilt toward extremist elements. What should President Mubarak infer from such a policy? Should he call off the elections for fear that the extremists might score more votes? Is that a signal to Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in Israel to undermine the PLO's authority and to count on the support of the United States when it is elected?" A White House official explained that the United States was getting ready for a possible scenario in Algeria, whereby the Islamic Salvation Front topples the regime (or, at least becomes a prominent part of it) if and when new elections are held. At present, such a possibility seems the only way to end the daily killings (a total of 700 fatalities since March) and to maintain some kind of order in a country that on the verge of general collapse. Hence, in view of its experience with Iran, the United States decided to build a positive policy toward the regime it foresees as rising to power in Algeria. However, this would seem to provide a solution to one part of the Arab world and pose a serious problem to another part of it. On the face of it, the new policy would seem to contain some logic, or at least a wish to secure U.S. interests. There is no Arab country that does not have to cope with, is not governed by, or does not share power with extreme Islamic elements to some extent or another. On one end of the scale lies Iran, on the other lie Syria and Iraq, and in the middle lie Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, the Gulf states, the five Muslim republics in Central Asia; in fact, every Arab country with institutions that bear romantic names and shoot innocent people in the name of Islam. How long can undemocratic regimes curb religious opposition movements which are seeking to install a worldwide Muslim regime but are in the meantime prepared to make do with wrecking the current regimes? Is the United States prepared to come to the aid of every regime seeking to eliminate its religious opposition? Is that possible? These questions featured prominently in various debates held by the U.S. Administration, which was anxious about the possibility that Iran, Sudan, and soon Algeria may be joined by other countries which will not just burn local law books but also the U.S. flag. U.S. Administration officials realized that if such a scenario came true the United States might be left without any allies in parts of the Middle East and Central Asia, and it is against this background that the new policy announced by the national security adviser can be understood. What remains unknown is the conditions the U.S. Administration set for supporting extreme Muslim regimes. If the administration intends to support only those Islamic regimes elected in democratic elections it is deluding itself on at least two counts. The only Arab country that has ever held democratic elections is Yemen, which is currently experiencing a tough war and where the tanks will probably determine who will rise to power. All other Arab countries may call their elections democratic, but it is their rulers who determine how democratic the elections or their regimes are. If fundamentalist regimes rise to power, they will most probably follow the Afghan model, which is partially being implemented in Algeria: street fights, guerrilla warfare, sweeping the poor classes, eliminating the intelligentsia, splitting the army, and ultimately seizing power. The second count is even worse. The administration need only check the results of democratic elections in most African countries and in those Arab countries that hold some kind of elections to conclude that democratic elections do not guarantee democratic regimes. The U.S. Administration actually made clear that only legitimate regimes, however ruthless and corrupt they may be, will enjoy U.S. support. The caveat of democratic elections was merely designed to give a guise of legitimacy to the continued U.S. relations with and support of such countries. Arab regimes, at least those considered pro-Western, have reason to be upset by this U.S. policy; the Americans have reason to worry that such long-term policy might destroy U.S. interests any time down the line.
