This was revealed Tuesday evening [5 April] during a forum organized by the Royal Navy Institute of Den Helder. The submarine crew, using sophisticated equipment, eavesdrops military communications between Bosnian and Serbian troops. Tactical and strategic information, which may be of importance, is made available to UN peaceforce commanders in the former Yugoslavia. PvdA [Labor Party] Defense Spokesman Van Traa said that Netherlands espionage for UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] had revealed some interesting military events, which Van Traa did not specify. The Defense Ministry recently reported that a fire had broken out on board the submarine, causing breathing problems to some of the crew members. Not a word was said about the submarine's special duties. When asked, W. Van Straten, head of the Navy Information Service, said that he was able neither to confirm nor to deny the submarine's espionage mission. "The duties and possibilities of Netherlands submarines are described in defense notes without any further comment," the spokesman said.
