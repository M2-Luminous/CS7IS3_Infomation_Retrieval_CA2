This would be part of a "dynamic strategy" involving government, the private sector and labour, he told journalists after he and nine other people were sworn on to the PWV Executive Committee at Sandton, north of Johannesburg, on Friday. Mr Moloketi has already formed a strategic management committee of people with technical know-how. His chief concerns are a better quality of life for everyone, promoting small business and manufacturing and increasing jobs. Contributing 40 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, the PWV must co-operate with the other eight provinces and ensure its strategy complements national efforts, but not to the detriment of the PWV, he believes. Mr Moleketi, who matriculated in Soweto, was recruited into Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], the African National Congress' armed wing, in 1976. He spent about 14 years in exile in countries including the former Soviet Union, Cuba, Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Mr Moleketi returned to South Africa in November, 1990 and was soon elected as secretary of the South African Communist Party's PWV region, a post he still holds.
