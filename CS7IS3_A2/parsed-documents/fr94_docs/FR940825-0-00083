FR940825-0-00083 FR940825-0-00016 • Appendix A _The Circular inadvertently misstates the applicability of the statute commonly know as the Bryd Anti-Lobbying Amendment, 31 U.S.C. 1352. The statue applies to organizations which apply or bid for an award exceeding $100,000, not $100,000 or more. We have made the correction in Appendix A; we have also included a cross reference to 45 CFR part 93 which contains the applicable HHS regulations implementing the statute which were issued pursuant to an OMB common rule promulgated in 1990. • Patent and Trademark Laws_ We have corrected the citation ``35 U.S.C. Ch. 18'' which was inadvertently included in section XXXX .24(h) of the Circular. The correct citation is 35 U.S.C. 200&hyph;212. We have also added a proscription on HHS awarding agencies from employing terms and conditions of awards made for educational purposes to assert Federal rights in inventions made thereunder, in keeping with the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 212. • Insurance of Federally-owned Property _At the revised §74.31, Insurance Coverage, we have not included the last sentence of section XXXX .31 of Circular, ``Federally-owned property need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the award.'' We have determined that, since the Government is a self-insurer, recipients should not dilute the effect of the assistance awarded by expending appropriated funds on insuring Federally-owned property. Because by its terms, the Circular's provision is discretionary with the agency, our omission of it represents a policy choice effectively to regulate against allowing HHS awarding agencies to exercise such discretion. Therefore, the omission is consistent with the substance and intent of the Circular. III. Justification for Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking As a matter of longstanding policy set forth at 36 FR 2532 (Feb. 5, 1971), the Department of Health and Human Services normally follows the notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment (NPRM) procedures set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553, even when it is not required by the APA to do so. The APA, however, provides for an exception to the NPRM procedures when an agency finds that there is good cause for dispensing with such procedures on the grounds that they are impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest. Pursuant to 5. U.S.C. 553, this rule is being published as an interim final rule with an immediate effective date because HHS has found good cause to dispense with both the prior notice and comment on this rule, and the 30-day delay in its effective date. At the same time, HHS encourages interested parties to comment on this rule so that we may have the benefit of the public's reaction before publishing the rule in final form. As previously stated, the primary purpose of this rule is to incorporate the provisions of the revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110 into HHS's award administration regulations. The Circular was developed over a period of several years by a Federal interagency task force and was subject to public review and extensive public comment before OMB published its final revised Circular on November 29, 1993. OMB in fact received over 200 comments in response to its proposed Circular from a wide array of Federal and non-Federal respondents, many of whom included past and current recipients of HHS awards. To expedite government-wide use of these uniform procedures, OMB directed that Federal agencies responsible for awarding and administering grants and other agreements covered by the Circular publish agency-specific rules adopting the Circular's specific language. OMB has allowed agencies little latitude to publish rules that deviate from the Circular which, as stated, had been subject to public comment. Unless a different provision is required by Federal statute or an agency has obtained OMB's approval for a deviation, the provisions of the Circular govern. This interim final rule essentially adopts the provisions of the Circular to the maximum extent possible. Some key technical clarifications, which are detailed elsewhere in this Preamble, have been made to enhance the rule's clarity and thus that ability of HHS awarding agencies and recipients of HHS funds to comprehend and apply its provisions. As also explained elsewhere in this Preamble, other provisions of this rule that may differ from the precise language of the Circular simply carry over longstanding HHS policies from the current part 74. Some of these provisions neither derive from nor conflict with the Circular. Concerning others, such as the rule requiring prior approval of patient care costs in research awards, HHS obtained OMB's approval to publish them under OMB's deviation procedures. But even these ``deviation'' provisions have been reflected for some time in HHS's regulations at part 74. For those provisions where HHS has exercised the discretionary decisionmaking inherent in the Circular's provisions, we have made choices that we believe inure chiefly to the recipients's benefit by avoiding imposition of additional or unnecessary administrative and other burdens. Therefore, because this rule is (1) on a Federal policy which has been subject to extensive public comment, (2) based in the main on current regulations where it differs form that Federal policy, (3) intended to benefit both affected Federal agencies and recipients of Federal awards by removing unnecessary administrative and other burdens, and thus facilitate sound award administration, HHS has determined that publication of this rule as an NPRM is unnecessary, impractical and contrary to the public interest. For these same reasons, HHS finds that good cause exists to eliminate the 30-day delay of the effective date of this rule.
