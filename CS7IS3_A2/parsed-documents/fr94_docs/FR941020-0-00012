Introduction In Order No. 566, 1 the Commission adopted a final rule amending its regulations governing the Standards of Conduct applicable to pipeline interactions with their marketing affiliates and the reporting requirements for transportation and affiliate transactions. The final rule retained the existing Standards of Conduct, with one exception. The rule made significant changes in the reporting requirements to reduce or consolidate maintenance and reporting burdens based on the changes in the way pipelines are allocating capacity under Order No. 636 2 and the requirement of Order No. 636 that pipelines develop Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBs) to provide customers with access to important information. Thirteen parties, most of whom are pipelines, have sought rehearing or clarification of the proposed rule. 3 1 Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements for Transportation and Affiliate Transactions, Order No. 566, 59 FR 32885 (June 27, 1994), III FERC Stats. & Regs.

Preambles ¶30,939 (Apr. 8, 1992), order on reh'g , Order No. 636&hyph;A, 57 FR 36128 (Aug. 12, 1992), III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles ¶30,950 (Aug. 3, 1992), order on reh'g , Order No. 636&hyph;B, 57 FR 57911 (Dec. 8, 1992), 61 FERC ¶61,272 (1992), appeal re-docketed sub nom ., Atlanta Gas Light Company and Chattanooga Gas Company, et al . v. FERC, No. 94&hyph;1171 (D.C. Cir. May 27, 1994). 3 The parties seeking rehearing and clarification are listed on Appendix A. One of the principal issues raised in the rehearing petitions is the timing of the requirement for posting affiliate discount information on the pipelines' EBBs. Current Standard H requires posting when a discount offer is made. After considering all the interests involved, the Commission is revising Standard H to require posting within 24 hours of the time at which gas flows under the discount. The Commission is leaving undisturbed the requirement of Standard H that a pipeline making a discount offer to an affiliate must make a comparable offer contemporaneously available to similarly situated non-affiliates. 4 4 The Commission also is changing the posting period from 90 to 30 days and is making other minor changes to make the posting more informative and easier to use. The other substantive change the Commission is making is to revise Standard K to ensure that shippers have reasonable access to tariff waivers. The revised Standard will require pipelines to provide their log of tariff waivers within 24 hours of a request.
