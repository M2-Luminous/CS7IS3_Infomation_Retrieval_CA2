These stipulate that all changes in the stationing and strength of military units should be coordinated with the corresponding Crimean structures. He reported that at present two mechanized brigades had been formed within the 32d Army corps. One of them, about 2000 in number, is deployed in the village of Perevalnoe, the second brigade is in Kerch and Feodosiya. In addition air mobile forces to be stationed in the city of Saki are being formed, said Kuznetsov. "This is being done without the knowledge of the Supreme Soviet and Crimean president. We have sent a request to Ukraine's Defense Minister and commander of the 32d Army corps and are waiting for an answer," said Kuznetsov. He also expressed perplexity due to the fact that the Ukrainian Army had taken control of several military installations, some of them crucial to the country's defenses. These are deteriorating due to the absence of appropriate funds in Ukraine. As an example he reported that the training base for the pilots of the aircraft carrier aviation is located in the disposition of Ukrainian servicemen. Meanwhile, Ukraine has no aircraft carriers.
