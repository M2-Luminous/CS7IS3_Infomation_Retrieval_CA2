FBIS3-46910 "dreas003__a94013" FBIS-EAS-94-003-A Document Type:Daily Report 5 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Poll: Support Rate for Hosokawa Cabinet Drops OW2812033893 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 Dec 93 Morning Edition p 1 OW2812033893 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] On 23 December, the JIJI PRESS compiled the results of its monthly poll for December. According to the poll, the approval rating for the Hosokawa cabinet dropped dramatically to 55.6 percent, a 10.5-percentage change from the previous month, while its disapproval rating has jumped to 23.4 percent, up from 13.3 percent in November. The results show that some of those who supported the cabinet in November now disapprove of it. This is the first time the Hosokawa cabinet, which has maintained a high, 60 percent or more approval rating since its inauguration in August, has seen the rate drop below 60 percent. JIJI PRESS also surveyed approval ratings for political parties. While the support rate for the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has increased a little, those for most of the ruling parties have dropped. The nationwide poll was conducted on 12 and 13 December among 2,000 men and women aged 20 or over. Of them, 70.1 percent agreed to be interviewed. The large drop in the cabinet approval rating seems to be the result of its failure to launch an effective pump-priming package as well as its decision to partially open Japan's rice market. It is possible that a question about a loan provided by the Sagawa Kyubin parcel delivery company to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa also affected the rating. When asked why they supported the cabinet, 18.1 percent of respondents noted its "favorable impression," 15.5 percent said, "the prime minister is trustworthy," and 15.3 percent said, "there is no one better than Hosokawa to do the job of prime minister." Asked why they did not support the cabinet, 9.6 percent said, "the cabinet is incapable of meeting public expectations," and 5 percent mentioned "its poor policies." The figures are almost double those of November. Meanwhile, the poll shows that the LDP approval rating has increased a little to 23 percent from 22.2 percent in November, while support for most of the ruling parties has decreased. The approval rating for the Social Democratic Party of Japan has dropped from 7.4 percent to 6.6 percent; for Shinseito from 3.5 percent to 3.0 percent; for Komeito from 3.7 percent to 3.1 percent; for the Japan New Party from 7 percent to 6.2 percent; and for the Democratic Socialist Party from 1.4 percent to 1 percent. Sakigake and the United Socialist Democratic Party are the only parties among the ruling coalition whose support rates have increased from 1 percent to 1.3 percent and from 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent, respectively. The approval rating for the Japan Communist Party dropped to 1.9 percent from 2.2 percent in November.
