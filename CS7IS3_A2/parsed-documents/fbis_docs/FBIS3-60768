In an annual report on the domestic and international security situations, the Public Security Investigation Agency said the extremists escalated "indiscriminate" attacks against targets including national cultural treasures and state-designated national assets. The report also cited guerrilla activities targeting the April visit by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko to the southernmost island of Okinawa and the March dispatch of a second Self-Defense force engineering contingent to Cambodia. The report said ultrarightists have escalated activities against Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa after he voiced in his August policy speech remorse and apology to Asian people for atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers in World War II. It said about 2,260 international guerrilla cases were reported, of which seven targeted Japanese people and companies. The Public Security Investigation Agency, established in 1952, collects intelligence on extremist groups in line with the 1952 Antisubversive Activities Law which is designed to crack down on subversive groups.
