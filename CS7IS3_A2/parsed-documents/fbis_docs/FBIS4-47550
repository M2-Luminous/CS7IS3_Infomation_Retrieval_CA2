To this end, the transduction ability of 17 P. pseudomallei bacteriophages five of which are capable of transducing the Tn7 (Tp[.sup]R[/], Sm[.sup]R[/]) transposon markers to the C-5 P. mallei strain is investigated. Together with the outcome of the Tr[.sup]R[/] recombinant clones, DNA-DNA hybridization data confirm that the PP25 phage transduces the P. mallei cells while the PP16, PP32, PP61, and PP64 phages can also produce Tr[.sup]R[/] clones whose properties are closer to transduced C-5/PP25/Tr[.sup]R[/]Sm[.sup]R[/] P. mallei. The phenotypic properties of these clones make it possible to speculate that the PP16, PP32, PP61, and PP64 phages are also capable of transducing the Tr[.sup]R[/] and Sm[.sup]R[/] markers during transduction. The transduced bacterial recipients become lysogenic and acquire resistance to trimethoprime and stroptomycin. Figures 2; tables 2; references 19: 12 Russian, 7 Western.
