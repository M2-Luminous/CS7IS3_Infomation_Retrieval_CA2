Needless to say, one conlusion from this meeting is that it is "too early to turn our swords into ploughshares," as Minister Olechowski put it. The meeting was chaired by Bronislaw Geremek, who said that the country was now entering the stage of actually implementing the PFP program that was signed by Prime Minister Pawlak. That, he explained, was the purpose of inviting both ministers to the meeting, so that they could report on preparations to implement it. Minister Olechowski briefly described the benefits of the PFP program and reported that a special Foreign Ministry-Defense Ministry team had prepared a plan of technical military cooperation with other PFP partners, and that a plenipotentiary has been chosen to coordinate undertakings and negotiate preliminary agreements with PFP partners. Minister Kolodziejczyk said that, since Poland's acceptance of the PFP, NATO countries have made Poland numerous offers of cooperation. He also noted that this cooperation would inevitably involve costs. If the West cooperates with us, will we have enough funds? he asked. After all, changing the parameters of communications, command, and reconnaissance systems to NATO standards costs money. Eleven deputies asked questions. Deputy Janusz Onyszkiewicz [Democratic Union) wanted to know what Russia's attitude toward the PFP was and what difference it would make to Polish politics if Russia joins or fails to join the PFP. He expressed the fear that the emergent rivalry among the Visegrad Group countries to be the first to join the PFP might upset our own PFP objective. Deputy J. Szmajdzinski (Democratic Left Alliance) asked whether this Defense-Interior Ministry team contained room for representatives of the Industry Ministry interested in producing suitable weapons. Tomasz Nalecz (Union of Labor) feared that the cost of joining the PFP this year would be too high, while Bronislaw Komorowski (Democratic Union) asked how much other Visegrad countries would be spending. Aleksandra Malachowska (Polish Peasant Party) suspected that the Polish Government was overtly optimistic and had exaggerated the meaning of the gestures made by various Western partners following Poland's acceptance of the PFP. The ministers tried to dispel fears as calmly as they could, without underplaying various complications and without attempting to conceal various uncertainties concerning the implementation of the the PFP with Poland's participation. They expressed a cautious hope that Russia would ultimately join the PFP, naturally in a role that suits its power status. They also spoke about the indivisibility of European security and the parallel nature of various measures intended to increase security guarantees. Minister Kolodziejczyk said that the Polish aim to join NATO is expressed in many other undertakings, some of which have already been completed, such as the conclusion of treaties with neighboring countries. Minister Kolodziejczyk recalled that our emergent links to the Western European Union are seen not as an alternative to the PFP, but as a complement and addition to it. Joint military exercises that have been suggested recently, such as a possible German-Polish-Dutch one or a joint Visegrad Group exercise in Ustka in June, already suggested a long time ago, could play a similar role. The defense minister also indicated a reform of NATO. It is necessary for Poland to present opinions on this subject because this would help establish a path to this reform. He added that Poland should have representations at NATO facilities in Brussels. Some 100 officers should be employed there, capable of maintaining contacts with approximately 300 NATO institutions and agencies. Over a dozen such people should leave for Brussels in 1994. Kolodziejczyk once again mentioned the issue of unexpected budget expenditure. The government, he said, had not decided on a budget amendment that would permit a more convenient financing of Polish representations to NATO.
