In fact, it is dramatic. Decisive battles are being waged. The enemy is pounding civilians and residential areas with unprecedented savagery. The 133-km long defense line of the Seven South Operative Group is in flames. The Serb aggressor has engaged almost 50 percent of their military might in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including heavy artillery withdrawn from the Sarajevo battlefield. This all-out attack, which the army of occupation calls Borders '94, is coordinated personally by war criminals generals Mladic and Talic. The aim is to establish the southern border of the phantom Serb state in the area of the Vranduk tunnel. The free territories of Tesanj, Maglaj, Doboj, and Teslic are -- believe it or not -- being hit by more than 200 heavy shells every hour. These barbaric attacks aiming at systematic destruction of civilians and their homes have outdone everything seen so far on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. As I am reporting, tank and howitzer shells are raining down onto the town of Tesanj, as was the case throughout last night. However, the situation is the most serious in Maglaj where most civilians are dying. Specifically, the army of occupation is doing its best to capture Maglaj and drive out its remaining surviving residents. We are reminding the international community once again, for the umpteenth time, that Maglaj and Tesanj have been encircled by the aggressor and completely sealed off for nine months. This is the only area in Bosnia-Herzegovina where the aggressor is stopping all convoys with food and other goods for civilians. However, our soldiers have not given in. In hand to hand fighting, the joint units of the Seven South Operative Group and the 2d Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army have halted the aggressor, and everyone is determined to die rather than allow the army of occupation to enter Tesanj and Maglaj. All defense lines are unchanged, and the aggressor is suffering heavy, truly heavy, losses in manpower. Our soldiers keep on fighting. Hajrudin Rezovic reported from the information center of the Seven South Operative Group.
