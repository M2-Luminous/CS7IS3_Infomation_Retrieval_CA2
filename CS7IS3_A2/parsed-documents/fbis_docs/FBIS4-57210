EPS spokesman Ricardo Wheelock said that they arrested seven passengers--three Costa Ricans and four U.S. citizens--and that the boat was towed to Bluefields on Nicaragua's atlantic coast. "They probably were sport fishing. It is also a drug trafficking area, and that it is why there are special EPS patrols in that area," Wheelock told the press. Contrary to the EPS report, Costa Rican Security Minister Juan Diego Castro said that the Nicaraguan patrol boats entered Costa Rican territorial waters to apprehend two boats, not one, as Wheelock had said. Castro said he contacted the Nicaraguan Government Ministry to work on the release of the people arrested, but the ministry spokespersons were not available.
