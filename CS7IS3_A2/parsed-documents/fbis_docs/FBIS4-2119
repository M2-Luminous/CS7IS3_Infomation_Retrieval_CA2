In 1993, farmers in Jiangsu, one of China's richest provinces, registered a per capita net income of 1,266.9 yuan, an increase of 19.4 percent over the previous year. After deduction of price rises, average income grew by three percent. Last year was the first year for the market economy to be introduced into every economic sector of the province. Township enterprises contributed the bulk of the increased income. Last year, township enterprises in the province reported an industrial output value of more than 40 million yuan, an increase of 5.4 percent over that of the previous year and accounting for about 75.5 percent of that of the province's entire rural economy. In 1993, one out of every five local farmers worked in township enterprises or worked as transient laborers in wealthier provinces. Statistics show that more than half of local farmers' added income came from township enterprises. Brisk markets are creating more sources for cash income for farmers. In the past, Chinese farmers relied almost entirely on farming for cash income, and their income was mainly in the form of crops and grain. In 1993, cash income accounted for 70.3 percent of a Jiangsu farmer's total income, a slight increase over that of the previous year, while his cash income from selling grain decreased. The facts indicate that farmers are profiting more from industry, commercial ventures and the service sector. In addition, some farmers have started investing in treasury bonds and stocks.
