In the spacious hall, several passageways eight to 18 meters wide have replaced the original 72 customs inspection counters and more than 100 banisters. Passengers going from the mainland to Hong Kong or going from Hong Kong to the mainland can now pass through customs -- the "door to the country" -- swiftly and easily. This is a profile of Chinese customs' efforts to expedite passage through customs. 1. In the Huanggang area of Shenzhen, which has the largest highway port in Asia, a cargo truck can pass through customs in only 20 seconds. [passage omitted] At China's Shekou port, which handles the largest number of ships and boats in China, customs officials no longer go aboard ships to carry out inspections. Therefore, foreign ships' time in port has been reduced greatly. [passage omitted] The speed in passing through customs is an important point in judging the extent of opening up to the outside world. An open-type country will certainly ask its customs officials to provide the greatest convenience for the legitimate entry and exit of people, cargo, and means of transportation. 2. To speed up the passage through customs, decreasing inspections plays an important part. [passage omitted] Luohu customs head He Tangfa said: We have now adopted the method of the "selective inspection of key cases." We simply removed those customs counters which allowed only one person to pass, and we now allow passengers to pass through freely. Meanwhile, we have strengthened on-the-spot investigation and study. When we find doubtful pieces of luggage, we will use equipment to inspect them. We call it "controlling the key things and letting the little things pass freely." In this way, the overwhelming majority of passengers can pass through customs without being checked. [passage omitted] 3. The speeded-up passage through customs is based on a decrease in inspections. However, customs' responsibility has not decreased. Customs officers have not reduced their efforts, and their achievements have increased. Shekou customs head Huang Haitao told a reporter that after implementing the new system for supervising and controlling international shipping, customs officials can now concentrate their forces and emphasize the inspection of key areas which were not handled seriously due to a lack of manpower. In just over one month, customs officials uncovered several major smuggling cases involving goods valued at over 80 million yuan. The situation with Huanggang customs is quite similar. Outwardly, customs officers do not inspect most vehicles. Cargo trucks' drivers only have to hand over a list of their goods to customs officers and then can pass through in less than one minute. Empty vehicles can pass through using special lanes without being stopped. Customs officials, however, have not neglected their duty. They have strengthened on-the-spot investigation and intelligence work and have placed emphasis on cracking down on major smuggling cases. During the first 11 months of 1993, they uncovered more than 1,400 smuggling cases -- a total that was 70 percent higher than in the previous year -- in which the value of the goods confiscated exceeded 110 million yuan. The speeding up of passage through customs must also depend on strong management. Jiulong [Kowloon] customs can open its door wide because it has paid attention to checking and controlling the enterprises concerned. The customs office has established files and knows very well which enterprises have good reputations and which earlier have engaged in crimes of smuggling. In this way, the customs office can handle different cases under different categories.
