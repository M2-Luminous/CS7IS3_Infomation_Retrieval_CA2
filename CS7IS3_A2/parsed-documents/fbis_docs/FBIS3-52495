When he arrived in Islamabad to renew the Foreign Secretaries talks exercise, J.N. Dixit was all smiles and, for a change, willing to acknowledge Kashmir as a disputed territory. He especially flew to Karachi to meet the Prime Minister as if he was on a mission of serious business. But, what has actually transpired at the negotiations table is a reaffirmation of the view that there has been no real change in New Delhi's stance on Kashmir, and the offer to have talks on Kashmir was basically a ploy to hoodwink world opinion. `We told you so', the Opposition would say, and persist in accusing the government of `miscalculation' and `mismanagement'. And the government will have to reckon with the charge that we have let the Indians get off the hook by acquiescing in the farce of Kashmir talks, more so because Islamabad had called off its initiative at the UN to facilitate the holding of the seventh round. Not that the Foreign Office had raised any false hopes about a breakthrough, notwithstanding the Prime Minister's comment that New Delhi's willingness to discuss Kashmir was a `significant development'. It had, on the contrary, made it quite clear that it did not expect the Indians to depart from their official position to make any major concessions on Kashmir. The outcome of the seventh round has thus been what was being anticipated in Islamabad. Nevertheless, what calls for a convincing explanation is whether or not the hasty decision to hold back the UN resolution on human rights violations in IHK was worth the `dirty game' the Indians have played on us on the pretense of accepting Kashmir as a disputed territory. Where do we go now from the debacle of bilateral approach to the Kashmir dispute, is the question that needs to be address by the government. We are told by the Foreign Office that it was necessary to go through the drill of talks on Kashmir to convince our friends abroad that we were willing to negotiate with India all the outstanding disputes. But, the Indians, being past masters of running international propaganda campaigns, are not likely to miss the opportunity to hold Pakistan responsible for the deadlock. In any case they have been successful in creating confusion and misgivings in the name of bilateral talks, in the ranks of freedom fighters. Islamabad has clearly brought the message home that no talks at the Foreign Secretaries, or any other level, will be scheduled unless there is a visible de-escalation of oppression let loose by the Indians in the Kashmir Valley. It is admittedly a principled stand, and should dispel the Opposition's apprehension that there may have been a sell-out on Kashmir. Refusal to delink other outstanding problems from the `core issue' has demonstrated that the government is not prone to buying the so-called `step by step diplomacy' at the cost of consigning the Kashmir question to limbo. What has emerged as an imperative of ground reality is to renew, with all the resources at our command, a concerted bid to internationalise the Kashmir question, no matter how annoying it may be to New Delhi.
