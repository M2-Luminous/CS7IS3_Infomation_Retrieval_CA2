FBIS4-57667 "drlat099_l_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-099 Daily Report 19 May 1994 Bolivia Government To Regulate Use of Coca Leaf by Decree Government To Regulate Use of Coca Leaf by Decree PY2005120694 La Paz Television Nacional Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 19 May 94 PY2005120694 La Paz Television Nacional Network Spanish BFN [Text] The executive branch believes that 80 to 90 percent of the coca leaf produced in Chapare is earmarked for drug trafficking. Minister German Quiroga stated it has therefore been decided to regulate the use of coca leaf through a supreme decree. Quiroga, however, made some warnings. [Begin Quiroga recording] The decree states in what zone of the country this regulation regarding the industrialization of coca leaf should be implemented. We were under the impression that some coca farmers wanted to decriminalize coca production, but the government has no intention of doing that as the entire country is aware that approximately 80 or maybe 90 percent of the surplus coca leaf produced in Chapare is earmarked for drug trafficking. [end recording] Minister Quiroga made a clear comparison. He said that on one hand, there is the good coca, which is used for chewing and for industrial purposes, and on the other there is the bad coca, and we must not forget that. The bad coca is essentially that produced in Chapare which, in turn, is used to produce cocaine. Therefore, no one should have any illusions that coca is going to freely circulate in Bolivia. That would be like giving cocaine carte blanche.
