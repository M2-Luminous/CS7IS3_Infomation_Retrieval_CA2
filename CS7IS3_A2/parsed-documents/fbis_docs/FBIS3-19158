A senior police officer described as untrue reports issued earlier in the day that the Latin American terrorist, also known as "the Jackal," had been expected to stop over at the airport en route to Europe. The reports said Carlos was believed to be on a flight from either Damascus or Cairo. Dozens of policemen and members of the antiterrorist squad had reportedly taken up positions in the airport. Policewomen were also allegedly assigned to check each passenger on flights from Cairo and Tel Aviv. It had also been alleged that Thursday's bomb hoax concerning an Austrian airlines flight carrying U.S. Special Coordinator Robert Lamb was intended to divert police in the event of Carlos' arrival.
