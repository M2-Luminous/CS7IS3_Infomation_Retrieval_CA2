Negotiations on the name, the report said, would be left to a later date. Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias met President Konstandinos Karamanlis yesterday and told him he had notified UN mediator Cyrus Vance of Athens' position, Mega said. Earlier, the president received Miltiadhis Evert, the New Democracy leader. After the talks, Mr. Papoulias said Greece was now waiting for mediator Vance to take the initiative. "We are waiting to see what Mr. Vance will do," Mr. Papoulias told reporters. "But, of course, in the meantime we will continue consultations with our European partners." Mr. Papoulias added: "There was no reaction from the president either to the Skopje sanctions imposed by Athens last month, or to the government's diplomatic efforts since then." He thus denied conservative news headlines over the weekend, alleging a growing rift between the government of Andreas Papandreou and the presidency, as regards the former's handling of the FYROM problem. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos later also dismissed such reports as a "nonissue," because "our constitutional order functions perfectly, and the government spokesman is not entitled to elaborate or comment on the presidency's own announcements."
