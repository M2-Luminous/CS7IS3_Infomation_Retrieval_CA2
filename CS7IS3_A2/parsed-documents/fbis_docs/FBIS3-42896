Shatalin, president of the Reform international foundation, academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, under the "Point of View" rubric: "The Market Needs To Be Managed"] [Text] The Economics Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the "Reform" International Foundation have prepared the joint report, "Socioeconomic Transformations in Russia: The Current Situation and New Approaches," and forwarded it to the supreme leaders of the state. The report analyzes the progress of the reform and the outcome of the socioeconomic development of Russia in the last two years. Conclusions have been drawn about the need for a new strategy for socioeconomic transformations which would make it possible to complete the formation of the model of a socially oriented market economy that would be suitable for the conditions of Russia and would ensure its position among the leaders of the world economy. At the request of the editorial office, Stanislav Sergeyevich Shatalin, the president of the Reform international foundation and an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, discussed the main provisions of the report. Two years, 1992 and 1993, is a sufficient period of time to make it possible to sum up the outcome of "shock therapy" and to evaluate its results. The latter are far from unambiguous, which is quite natural. Socioeconomic developments always have their positives and negatives. The final balance and the evaluation of the consequences of emergent tendencies are important in this matter. So, positives first. The process of overcoming the total statization of the economy and creating diverse forms and types of economic operation has continued and largely accelerated. The formation of an infrastructure of a market economy and its characteristic mechanisms has begun; the mechanism of supply and demand has begun operating, albeit with disruptions; the first signs of competition have appeared. The mentality of economic cadres who are adjusting to the conditions of an emerging market economy is changing. A new generation of managers--educated, energetic, and free of the baggage of old dogmas and habits--is assuming management responsibilities at various levels of economic operations. A stratum of entrepreneurs has gradually been evolving. All of this makes it possible to evaluate favorably the movement toward a market economy that has gotten under way. At the same time, we must note the continuously growing, and largely excessive, "price" that our society has already paid and will be forced to pay for the selected strategy and tactics of a transition to a market economy. The scale of the current crisis, which has increased as a result of "shock therapy," and its internal structure are affecting the accomplishment of social tasks in a particularly painful manner, and are fraught with the danger of irreversible destruction of the economic and scientific-technical potential of the country. In the last two years alone, the fall in production on key macroindicators came to about 30 percent, and compared to the precrisis level it approximated 40 percent. I will stress, first, that the drop in production is of a universal rather than structural nature. Second, it has affected the most progressive and high-technology industries and types of production to the greatest degree. A slump in investment activity is the most profound and dangerous in terms of its socioeconomic consequences. In the last two years alone, the volume of investment in the Russian economy fell by a factor of more than two, and now comes to about 40 percent of the precrisis level. The amortization of fixed production assets has already come close to 60 percent--the threshold beyond which the physical destruction of the production potential of the country begins. Our society has become a witness to a growing number of accidents and disasters. The number of unprofitable enterprises and those with slim profit margins is growing. The disorganization of the financial system, the "war of the budgets" between the center and many regions, the payments crisis, and uncontrolled emissions all testify to the loss of state control over monetary circulation. The growth of inflation that was triggered by the liberalization of prices has not stopped in two years. The failure of combating inflation is explained by a failure to understand its nature in the economy of Russia, for example, due to underestimating its highly monopolized structure, ignoring the factor of cost inflation, and correspondingly opting for inadequate, purely monetarist means to contain it by way of demand constraints. As we can see, the hope for financial stabilization without overcoming the slump in production is turning out to be illusory and theoretically unsound. The depletion of social resources for the continuation of "shock therapy" is an alarming outcome of the implementation of this policy over two years. A drop in the real income of the population by a factor of more than two, accompanied by a sharp differentiation in incomes, has aggravated the social situation in the country. At present, the incomes of 10 percent of the most affluent citizens exceed the income of the same proportion of the least affluent citizens by a factor of 10. One-third of the population has incomes below the official subsistence minimum, and 10 percent of the population, or about 15 million people, are below the threshold of physical survival. This is a signal that the society is entering a social conflict zone. The social price paid by society for the "shock therapy" has exceeded the maximum permissible limits. A deep crisis and social calamity are not the result of unsolved problems that had piled up in the past, isolated miscalculations, or the resistance of conservative forces (although all of these have also occurred), but rather an unavoidable consequence of the chosen course of the reform and the methods used to carry it out. It appears strange, but it looks as if some political leaders both in Russia and in the West have seriously come to believe that any change in the chosen course of the economic reform means a rollback, a return to the administrative-command system. The belief in one's own infallibility is a nourishing medium for deliberately refusing to seek national accord. In the December election, the people resolutely came out against experiments associated with "shock therapy." Only 8 percent of the voters came out in favor of the Russia's Choice bloc, whose leaders personify the ideologists and champions of this course. To continue this course in the future means to act against the clearly stated will of the people. The RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Economics Division and the Reform international foundation believe that, in the name of rejuvenating Russia as a superpower, it is necessary to evaluate the results of the past two years critically and honestly, and to work out a new strategy for socioeconomic transformations. We have selected the following as the key parameters of the ultimate objective of reforms in the Russian economy which should certainly be made more specific and refined with regard to individual stages and time periods. It is the orientation of the economy, in terms of its structure and motivation, toward accomplishing social tasks, attaining a high standard of living, and creating institutions and mechanisms that make it possible to combine economic effectiveness and social justice. It is the formation of a modern system of market relations and mechanisms with an active role of state regulation of the economy, a combination and mutual complementariness of various forms of property and economic operations that ensure stable motivation for entrepreneurial and labor activity. Finally, it is the creation of a highly effective economy that is flexible and receptive to scientific-technical innovations and continually changing social and personal needs. The RAN Economics Division and the Reform international foundation propose certain initial principles for the development of such a strategy. First. Social indicators of the reform should be specified and set forth: its goals, as well as the borderlines and limits the transcending of which is impermissible under any circumstances and for any considerations--a guaranteed subsistence minimum, an employment threshold, the proportion of expenditures for education and health care in the composition of the gross national product, and others. Second. The naive belief in the automatic nature of healing the economy with the help of impersonal monetarism should be abandoned, and the natural and commonly accepted functions of state regulation should be restored. As we see it, by way of priority measures the accent must be shifted toward supporting material production and stimulating business activity, including investment activity. It is necessary to develop an effective industrial policy, including structural policy, which will be called upon to give the Russian economy a modern image and to improve the competitiveness of domestic products on the world and domestic markets. Also, the supreme power of the law should be ensured on a priority basis, and well-conceived and reliable economic legislation, stable "rules of the game" must be created in the absence of which it is impossible for entities in the market economy to function successfully. Third. We should make a transition to new principles for financial stabilization in the national economy. They include the elimination of disproportions between material-tangible and financial-outlay aspects of reproduction; the mobilization of domestic sources of accumulation--depreciation allowances, profits, and monetary savings of the population; a combination of a firm financial and credit policy with selective support for priority sectors and production facilities; the use of various forms of regulation of prices and incomes, including the establishment of price parities and cartel agreements; and the improvement of tax and budget policies. Fourth. The course toward the formation of a unified all-Russian market, taking into account the peculiarities of the federated arrangement of Russia, should be made the foundation for the reform. This means shifting the focus of implementing the economic reform to the localities, with the center retaining the function associated with the formation and operation of a unified market. At issue is the development of uniform "rules of the game," the regulation of monetary circulation, the commonality of the customs territory, and ensuring the freedom of movement of goods, financial resources, and labor among regions. Fifth. The issue of the role of outside assistance in reforming the Russian economy should be reconsidered, with orientation toward the domestic scientific, technical, and production potential and internal sources of accumulation being made the foundation of this strategy. This does not run counter to the course of an open economy or of Russia organically entering the world economy. However, this presupposes that Russia may and should solve its own problems itself for the most part. Sixth. The problem of transforming ownership arrangements plays a special role. This is one of the key avenues for the further development and enhancement of the economic reform. We should overcome the ownerless, no-man's nature of property, and help each of its forms (including the state form) find a real, motivated, and responsible master. There should be a gradual movement toward a modern multisectoral economy, in which most diverse forms of property are combined and mutually complement one another: private and state property, cooperative and municipal property, the property of public and religious organizations, foreign property, and various mixed forms of property. Ensuring the growth of effectiveness and attracting investment to expand and upgrade production should be the main criteria for making particular decisions concerning privatization. It is necessary consistently to wind down voucher privatization as a populist direction which is not able to solve the problem of social justice but boosts the growth of inflation and the disintegration of the production potential. The almost complete loss of manageability in the economy has become an extremely dangerous peculiarity of the current situation in Russia. A deepening managerial crisis has begun in the country; virtually not a single state structure remains that has not lost its authority and has not been deprived of genuine devices for affecting processes under way in the economy. Laws and edicts are adopted, decrees are issued, and programs are approved, but the management mechanism does not operate at any level. The continuation of this situation renders the development of any program for enhancing the reforms simply nonsensical; the programs are doomed to failure in advance. Not a single one of the tasks of overcoming the crisis in the country and a constructive continuation of reforms can be accomplished in the absence of immediately overcoming the organizational muddle in all elements and at all levels and eliminating defects and disharmony in the management mechanism. The existing power vacuum should be filled to the full extent by restoring the status of the principles of state regulation and substantially increasing the level of manageability of the economy. The manageability of the economy is an antipode to a power vacuum and lawlessness, and it should not be confused with a return to the administrative-command system.
