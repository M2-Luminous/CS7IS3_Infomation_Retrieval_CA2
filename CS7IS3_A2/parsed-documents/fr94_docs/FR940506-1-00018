FR940506-1-00018 FR940506-1-00010 During meetings with the International Standards Organization (ISO) some ISO member countries expressed a desire for the Coast Guard to include a two character country of MIC registration code as part of the expanded HIN format to distinguish between MICs issued by different foreign countries. The Coast Guard agrees that including the two character country of MIC registration code in the proposed HIN would be appropriate. The proposed expanded HIN would consists of 19 characters. The additional seven characters would indicate country of MIC registration, length, hull material, principal means of propulsion, vessel type and a check digit. The expanded HIN with its check digit would reflect additional information useful to law enforcement authorities investigating vessel thefts and provide a useful means of identifying vessels in VIS. Section 181.25 would be revised to require that each of the Hull Identification Numbers prescribed by §181.23 must consist of 19 characters uninterrupted by slashes, hyphens or spaces: (1) Characters one and two would be the two character alphabetic ``country code'' from ISO Standard 3166. The country code for Manufacturer ID Codes the Coast Guard assigns in the United States, for example, would be ``US.'' (2) Characters three through five would be the existing manufacturer identification code the Coast Guard assigns to the vessel manufacturer in accordance with §181.31(a). (3) Characters six through ten would be the serial number the manufacturer currently assigns in accordance with §181.25(b). (4) Characters eleven and twelve would indicate date of certification for vessels subject to safety standards or the date of manufacture for vessels not subject to standards in accordance with the existing format specified in §181.25(c). (5) Characters thirteen and fourteen would indicate the model year in accordance with the existing format specified in §181.25(d). (6) The fifteenth character would indicate overall length of the vessel using a corresponding letter of the English alphabet. The character, ``A,'' would indicate a vessel with a hull length of less than six feet; ``B'' would indicate a vessel with a hull length of six feet to 10 feet, 11 inches; ``C'' would indicate 11 feet; ``D'' would indicate 12 feed, and so on. The character, ``Z'', would indicate a vessel with a hull length of more than 31 feet. Inches would not be included in the measurement of length, therefore, 15 feet, 10 inches is 15 feet and 16 feet, 2 inches is 16 feet. (7) The sixteen character would indicate hull material using a corresponding Arabic numeral. Arabic numerals one through eight would indicate aluminum, ferrocement, fiber reinforced plastic (FRP), flexible fabric, foam, plastic, steel and wood, respectively. (8) The seventeenth character would indicate the principal means of propulsion of the vessel using a corresponding Arabic numeral. Arabic numerals one through nine would indicate air propeller, bracket mounted outboard, inboard, inboard jet, inboard/outdrive, nonpowered, outboard, sail and sail with inboard auxiliary, respectively. Footnotes to a table in this section would distinguish between which Arabic numerals to use to indicate nonpowered vessels, sailboats and sailboats with auxiliary power. (9) The eighteenth character would indicate the type of vessel using a corresponding Arabic numeral. Arabic numerals one through nine would indicate air cushion vehicle; canoe, kayak, sailboard or surfboard; inflatable; monohull/cabin configuration; monohull/closed bow; monohull/open bow; multihull/cabin or closed bow; multihull/open deck; and personal watercraft, respectively. Footnotes to a table in this section would distinguish between which Arabic numerals to use to indicate the vessel types described above. (10) The nineteenth character would be a check digit determined by performing certain arithmetic calculations involving the previous 18 characters. Characters consisting of letters of the English alphabet would be converted to corresponding numerical values. A diagram in the section would show how the calculations should be performed. The Coast Guard has developed a computer program which calculates the check digit and is available to any vessel manufacturer with a computer. The Coast Guard has also developed several work sheets to help determine the HIN for a vessel which are also available. (d) Reference to State Boating Law Administrator Section 181.31 prescribes the regulations on the assignment of a Manufacturer Identification Code (MIC) to each recreational vessel manufacturer and importer. According to §181.31(c), persons who are building vessels for their own use and not for the purposes of sale, must obtain an entire Hull Identification Number from the State Boating Law Administrator of the State where the vessel will be principally used, in lieu of applying for a MIC. A number of the States use their Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for numbering and titling of vessels and the DMV would issue a State HIN. Under the proposed amendments, references to ``State Boating Law Administrator'' would be removed from the section and the words ``the issuing authority of the State'' would be added in their place.
