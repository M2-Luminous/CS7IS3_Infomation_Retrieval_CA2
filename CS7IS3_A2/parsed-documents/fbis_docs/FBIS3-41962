What are you doing about the matter? Werthebach: Smuggling of nuclear equipment and material or other weapons falls within our jurisdiction only when such activity is organized by a foreign intelligence service. Shimron: Such as Iran? Werthebach: Most of these activities are perpetrated by organized crime. However, we have evidence that Iran is very interested in the illegal acquisition of equipment and weapons of mass destruction and the means to launch them, and that the Iranian intelligence services are involved in these activities. They relocated their procurement office from London to Dusseldorf. I consider curbing these activities originating in Iran one of the most important missions of the organization I direct. We set up a special unit to deal solely and exclusively with the smuggling of weapons and equipment to dangerous countries. Shimron: Iran has a big embassy in Bonn and a large procurement office in Dusseldorf. Is it true that they oversee all their nonconventional procurement programs from Germany? Werthebach: First of all, I would like to say that I am convinced that the production of nonconventional weapons (nuclear, biological, and chemical) constitutes the worst type of terror one can imagine, because it does not just imperil one person but entire nations. That is why all of us, all my colleagues in the West, including Israel, are unanimous in our belief that the matter should be treated with utmost gravity. There is evidence, including the relocation of the Iranian procurement office from London to Dusseldorf, that the Iranians may be using Germany as a business center for all of Europe. They buy equipment and material not just from Germany, but also from neighboring countries. However, the entire business is overseen and administered from Germany. We have evidence to corroborate this assumption, and for our part, we have taken all the appropriate measures against this phenomenon. We treat the matter with utmost seriousness. Speaking from the point of view of an intelligence service, I can tell you that we have been doing all we can and we will do all that is necessary, incidentally, amid coordination with our partners.
