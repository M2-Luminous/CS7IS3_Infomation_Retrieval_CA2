In a press statement, a coordinator with the people's defense in the Upper Nile State, 'Abd-al-Halim Adam, stressed that the scattered remnants of the rebellion's army in the region have suffered a collapse of morale, and a great number of them have expressed their wish to surrender. He said that government soldiers, the people's defense, people's police, and the national service, with the support of the citizens, participated in the opening up of the road. Meanwhile, the command of the people's defense has called on all combatants to enlist in the Misk al-Khitam Brigade, which is currently heading toward the operational zone. The deadline for enlisting is 13 June, at Mawlid Square in Khartoum. This comes as a support for national unity, development plans, and the defense of peace in the country.
