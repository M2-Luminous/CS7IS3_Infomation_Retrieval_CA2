Mineo reports visiting poppy plantations in Chontali, Jaen Province. According to a local peasant, she says, "Colombian citizens came along with people from Juanjui" and "taught local peasants how to extract opium from the poppy seeds, and they promised to return to buy their production at $1,500 a kilo." Mineo continues: "Many peasants from the northwestern Maranon Region are willing to cultivate poppies." A Chontali peasant told her that since "we live from what we plant, we will not doubt in planting this." She adds: "It is obvious that if the demand for poppy seeds grows, poppy plantations, which are now a few, will expand." Poppy cultivation is "in an incipient stage" in Jaen Province, but according to experts, "soil and climate conditions" in some places of Cajamarca are "ideal" for this kind of plantation. According to the Peruvian Antidrug Division, Mineo states: "Poppy plantations were detected in Yanacanchi Valley in Cajamarca in 1991 and on the border between Piura and Cajamarca in 1992." She concludes by saying that she "learned through sources in the 5th Jungle Infantry Division based in Bagua, Amazonas, of poppy plantations in Tabaconas District in San Ignacio Province in Cajamarca." From sources in the Huallaga Front political and military command she learned that "trading of a brown substance identified afterward as poppy latex has been detected in the past few months in Chiclayo."
