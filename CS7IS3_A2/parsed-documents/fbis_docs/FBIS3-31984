After a meeting scheduled to last 15 minutes, but which lasted an hour, the Colombian diplomat said Colombia will be able to sell almost all its products to the 12 EU countries without paying duties. She added that such conditions would be applicable for a period of four or 10 years, depending on Colombia's request, to begin when the current agreement expires. Noemi Sanin visited France in December and met with French officials to expound on the country's achievements, the government modernization policy, the strengthening of the judicial system, the efforts to counter drug trafficking, the peace process with the guerrillas, and the defense of human rights. The possibility of France investing in our products, including bananas, and the repercussions for Colombia -- especially the Uraba region -- would be a positive step that would further expand Colombia's participation in the foreign market.
