In the meantime, the minister is not giving up. That is why the conflict between the MSZ and the government, which has been concealed for some time, erupted anyway. Yesterday the Council of Ministers rejected the draft of a new MSZ statute which attempted to divide the ministry into a political and a civilian part. Debate on the draft by the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM] has been pending for almost two months. Two weeks ago, GAZETA WYBORCZA reported that a delay in the decision may lead to a resignation by Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski, who denied the reports while hoping for an agreement with URM. But the Democratic Left Alliance-Polish Peasant Party coalition regarded its control over MSZ as more important. According to the coalition's chief politicians, the reform being proposed by Olechowski permanently forecloses access for the coalition to posts in this prestigious ministry. It is a decision that I cannot accept -- an angered Olechowski told reporters. I failed to obtain the support of any minister during today's session. When asked whether, in this situation, he still rules out his dismissal, Olechowski refused to answer: The foreign minister's position is such that if he is a responsible and diligent man, then he cannot go around talking about a resignation any time he pleases. And then he ended the discussion in an even more determined manner: We are in a period of intensive international measures which in my view are of historical importance. So I refuse to answer such questions at all. As we found out unofficially from a very well-informed source, if it were not for the upcoming visit by U.S. President Clinton to Warsaw on 6 and 7 July, Olechowski would not have hesitated to submit an ostentatious resignation yesterday. But if he fails to come to an agreement with Pawlak and the coalition in the near future, the question of resignation will be just a question of time. The debate is to be continued and decisions should be made in June or July, not later than that -- Olechowski said. I regard the July deadline as a borderline one, and a further delay of the reforms would be very hard for me to accept. When asked by a reporter what he meant by "borderline deadline," Olechowski replied: It means what you just heard. After July, comes August.
