[passage omitted] Please allow me to start by offering my best wishes and my thanks at the efforts put into discussing my speech, which according to practice I read to the Chamber immediately after having read it to the Senate. Once the custom was to repeat without omissions the speech of the prime minister, but this practice has been, I think wisely, abolished. The repetition of an identical speech came to be considered a mere formality, or if you will, a rite rather than a homage to the rules of institutional communication. On the other hand, as my colleague Giorgio Napolitano [former speaker of the Chamber of Deputies] reminded us, ours is a system of perfect bicameralism, where one assembly repeats, or almost repeats, that which the other does. [passage omitted] As every one knows, the elections took place on 27 and 28 March of this very year, and the republic will from this evening, if of course I obtain your confidence, have a government that is completely in control of its duties. [passage omitted] For the hundreth time, I will tell you how things stand: I founded, nurtured, and administered until a few months ago a large number of companies. I acted in accordance with the constitutional laws that guarantee free enterprise. However, today I am no longer a businessman, I no longer carry out any administrative duties in my companies, I do not take part in the decisions concerning the running of these companies, I do not hold any posts in these companies, I am the managing director of nothing, I do not attend any meetings, nor do I attend any shareholder assemblies. This is my ethical behavior with regard to the assets that I own. Furthermore, I am supervised by my conscience -- which no one in good faith can doubt -- I am supervised by the president of the republic, by the anti-trust authorities, by the media ombudsman, by the Council of Ministers -- which is a collective body -- by the parliament, and most especially by the opposition parties, by judiciary, by the free press, by the electors, and by public opinion. If all this is not enough, if we want to look into the future and exercise without control the normal functions of surveillance to which all public men are subject then this is bad. [passage omitted] Let us return to serious matters, former speaker Napolitano touched upon points with which I frankly agree. [passage omitted] It is true that a first-past-the-post system must have a series of checks and balances. The American system of democracy, which is a presidential and first-past-the-post system par excellence, is indeed based on a cast-iron system of checks and balances, of autonomous powers, which are controlled by great authorities. However, in Italy we are only at the beginning of this process. For the past few months, we have had a first-past-the-post system with a strong proportional counterweight. [passage omitted] I am sensitive to the question of counterweights and guarantees, of rules and the rigorous adherence to those rules. [passage omitted] I will not repeat here the considerations on my government's policy or on the various points of this policy, as I already did this in the Senate. I am convinced that even the best policy cannot exist and thrive without the existence of instruments to put this policy into practice. [passage omitted] I am certain that I have formed a capable team full of competent and enthusiastic people. [passage omitted] Mr. Fausto Bertinotti [leader of the Communist Refoundation Party], what do you mean when you say that the crisis in the Italian economy is a structural one? I think that you mean that the crisis is a serious one, that it has nothing to do with the current situation, that it cannot be solved without intervention, that the sectors involved are productive, agricultural, industrial, financial, and commercial, that briefly what is at stake are the destiny and the aims of our economy. If structural means this, then my honorable colleague, be so kind as to realize that there is no difference of opinion between us as far as our country's economy is concerned. We disagree on the means of overcoming these difficulties. Our disagreement is a simple one and is one that everybody can understand without oversimplifying the nature of the problem. [passage omitted] I am referring to a point in your speech in which you blame all of the world's suffering on capitalism. Allow me to say that you are forgetting a fact that is now universally recognized in our time. [passage omitted] Most of the suffering in our time should be laid at the door of Communism and the Socialist reality and to the misery that they caused, rather than at the door of captalism. Everyone knows how I feel about this, and my views were put to the electorate. I do not expect this to be accepted, but I only ask that it should be put to the test, because, as I said, they are not dogmatic thoughts. [passage omitted] The government must intervene in two ways, by supporting the economy by freeing it from too many rules that stifle it, and, at the same time, by supervising the adherence to those rules without which there would be no free market: support and supervision. This does not mean managing the economy. [passage omitted] The free market is a strategy of development that must be treated cautiously, but it is a strategy to whose principles this government has decided to adhere with wisdom and restraint. [[passage omitted] Dear deputies, I would like to thank Achille Occhetto for his speech. I am sure that he made the right choice when he said that the Left would not follow a blind and factious opposition line. [passage omitted] Achille Occhetto was one of the first to recognize after the general election vote the right of the winning coalition to govern. Then, for some reason, he changed his mind, and the secretary of the largest party on the Left called this government a humiliating one for Italy. Furthermore, he used a tone that was completely out of character in an attempt to take away the government's legitimacy. [passage omitted] I do not believe that this is simply a right-wing government. This morning, the honorable Taradash [Radical Party] and the honorable Bonnino, with her moving silence, asked me how I regarded the role of the reformers in my government. [passage omitted] I intend to keep the helm firmly in the center. The coalition that feeds the government with ideas and proposals -- as we saw during the course of the debate in the chambers -- has a common moderate and democratic denominator. The coalition encompasses the liberal left wing of the reformers to the Catholics then through to the center politics of Forza Italia and to a grassroots movement such as the Northern League, and finally encompassing the institutional right of Gianfranco Fini. However, one can coin the definitions that one prefers. [passage omitted] A pretext for bitterness is the presence in the government of the National Alliance. This is an electoral slate and political organization that has signed a pact with the electors and with other movements to govern Italy; it emerged from the polls triumphant. This is a political organization that, as the Honorable Fini solemnly confirmed this morning, has consigned its links with fascism to history. This is a political movement that, as Francesco Cossiga reminded us in the Senate, in the past, when it was not called National Alliance and when it was very different from what it is today, used its determining votes to elect people to the highest offices in the state. These actions were received with thanks. [passage omitted] If you want to criticize us, then let me be the target of your criticism, because I am a liberal democrat antifascist or perhaps you can criticize my policies; however, do not look for any pretexts to criticize the National Alliance. [passage omitted] I would like to thank the groups that make up the Freedom Alliance and that have decided to give their vote of confidence to the government. [passage omitted] We have a shared vision of a united and federal Italy in a united and federal Europe. [passage omitted] I listened carefully to the things said by the Honorable Gianfranco Fini during the course of this parliamentary confidence debate. I do not know if one can say that antifascism is the opposite of fascism. However, it is certain that the Honorable Fini confirmed this morning the rigor of his intention that many, including his adversaries, recognize. I am certain that he says what he means and what he believes in when he affirms his belief in the principles of democracy and liberty and when he affirms his opposition to the political totalitarianism that has marked the history of this century. Italian democracy has always shown, my dear colleagues, a great capacity to attract its ideological adversaries, and this has been recognized instinctively by true liberals: liberty liberates. Madame speaker and honorable colleagues, if we obtain your confidence, then from tomorrow the work of the government will begin in earnest. You know that we have been summoned here by millions of Italians who have a great desire for change. You know the principles that we believe in and the values that inspire us. We believe in all forms of liberty -- the liberty of thought, the liberty of expression, of association, the liberty to practice one's religion -- every religion, those faiths that encourage man to improve himself. We believe in the individual, we believe that we each have the right to fulfill ourselves, to build our future with our own hands and to aspire to well-being. We believe in the family, which is the center of our affections and the fundamental nucleus of our society. We believe in enterprise, which is the organization and institution that creates work, well-being, and wealth. [passage omitted] We believe in tolerance, and for us it is natural to practice this. We believe in respect, in respect for everyone -- even our enemies and above all for those who are the weakest. [passage omitted] We are ready for everything. Today we are ready to govern and tomorrow to be in opposition. We are a new force managing the state, and for this precise political motive, we ask to be judged by facts. [passage omitted] It is obvious that it will not be easy to put the country back onto the right road, it will not be easy to relaunch the economy and to safeguard jobs and above all to create new jobs. It will not be easy to manage public money with attention and with the capacity to make savings by reining in public expenditure to relieve fiscal pressure. [passage omitted] We know that our task will not be easy, but we will try to succeed. Dear colleagues, I thank you and ask that you give the government your confidence.
