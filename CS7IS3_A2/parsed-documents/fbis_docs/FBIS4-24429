FBIS4-24429 "drchi104_p_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-104 Daily Report 31 May 1994 Central-South Region Guangzhou Leaders Warn Against Foreign Espionage Guangzhou Leaders Warn Against Foreign Espionage HK3105064894 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 31 May 94 p 7 HK3105064894 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [Text] Foreign espionage remains a threat to Guangzhou's political and social stability as well as the overall safety of China according to Guangzhou leaders. "Activities by foreign spies in China aimed at subversion, infiltration, divisiveness and rebellion have not stopped," the Guangzhou party secretary, Gao Siren, told a recent state security meeting, the official GUANGZHOU DAILY reported on Sunday. "Foreign enemy forces have joined hands to encourage destructiveness, which is a danger to the social stability of Guangzhou," he said. The mayor of Guangzhou, Li Ziliu, said many people were lulled into a "one-sided" belief that economic prosperity meant "not being conscious about secrecy and the movements of the enemy." The warnings follow a special trip to the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in April by the director of the State Bureau of Secrecy, Shen Hongying, who said those regions on "the front line of China's opening to the outside world" caused the greatest loss of state secrets. "The frequent foreign economic exchanges of Shenzhen... have led to arduous and complicated secrecy needs," Shen said. Chinese leaders have expressed alarm at the frequency of contacts between foreigners and Guangdong officials, which they believe has resulted in disclosure of state secrets. Officials from other parts of China frequently travel to Shenzhen or Guangzhou to meet foreign couterparts for the sake of convenience. China's concept of enemy spies is not limited to trenchcoated diplomats poking around military bases. It includes everyone from foreign businessmen gathering conventional market data to journalists doing what in most countries would be considered their regular work of news reporting. Shen's and Gao's use of the term jingwai (outside the border) rather than waiguo (foreign country) in reference to espionage activities that are supposed to be aimed against China reflects their belief that Hong Kong and Taiwan people are possibly the biggest threat to them. While political secrets remain closely guarded, economic reform has made it almost impossible for any significant economic policy or information to be kept secret for long, despite the best efforts of the secrecy cadres assigned to every department of both central and local governments. Gao said stepped up vigilance in guarding state secrets in Guangzhou was crucial for both government cadres as well as the common people. Li dismissed suggestions that stepped up vigilance in protecting economic, technological, and commercial secrets would harm Guangdong's economy. "All such thoughts are badly mistaken," the mayor said, without further explanation.
