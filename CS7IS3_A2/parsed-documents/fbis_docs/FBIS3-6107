According to Seoul radio, in a meeting of the UN Human Rights Committee recently held in Geneva, many human rights organizations urged South Korea to abolish the National Security Law. In the meeting, a U.S. human rights organization exposed that illegal confiscations by invoking the National Security Law have yet to be rooted out in South Korea, even under the so-called civilian government, and demanded that the UN Human Rights Committee investigate human rights infringements in South Korea. Denouncing South Korea for still repressing the students movement and imposing evil sentences by invoking the National Security Law, the World Students' Christian Federation strongly demanded in the meeting that the puppet authorities release all prisoners of conscience. On 8 March, a spokesman for the South Korean opposition Democratic Party released a commentary expressing strong dissatisfaction at the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's brake on the abolition of the National Security Law, an antireunification fascist evil law, and stressing that the party will push ahead with the movement for the abolition of the National Security Law to the end. This party's position of strongly demanding the abolition of the National Security Law was also expressed in a news conference held by the party representative on 5 March. On the same day, the Hong Kong branch of Amnesty International issued a statement and said that it would carry out a movement of sending protest postcards to the puppet authorities to protect human rights of prisoners of conscience in South Korea. The Amnesty International branch also demanded that the puppet authorities release figures arrested on charges of violating the National Security Law. These facts show that the abolition of South Korea's National Security Law is unvaryingly demanded not only by the South Korean people but also by the people of the world and that this is the most pressing issue that can be no longer delayed. As everybody knows, the so-called National Security Law of South Korea is an old remnant of the military fascist dictatorship and an evil, antireunification and fascist law that is the most savage and malicious in the world. The National Security Law defines us fellow countrymen as an antistate body and enemy, so that those who support and admire us or even mention a word regarding the fatherland's reunification are subject to punishment, and so that the just struggle by youth, students, and people for the independence and democracy of South Korean society become an object of oppression. Tens of thousands of youth, students, and people have been punished for carrying out the just struggle of demanding independence, democracy, and reunification. Countless numbers of people died on the scaffold. Today, many prisoners behind bars with long-term sentences suffer inhumane torture in South Korea. It is no accident that the Amnesty International pointed out on 9 March that South Korean incarcerates prisoners for longer terms than any place in the world, such as Kim Son-myong and An Hak-sam, who have been confined in jail since the Korean war. Moreover, even with a civilian mask, the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime not only maintain the National Security Law but also abuse it to oppress with more cruelty the South Korean people's just struggle for independence, democracy, and the reunification, to block North-South dialogue, and to amplify confrontation, not reconciliation or unity between the North and the South. Last year, the Kim Yong-sam groups blocked dialogue between youth, students, and people of the North and South -- including the meeting between youth and students of the North and South in Panmunjom on 12 June and the Fourth Pannational Rally -- by applying the National Security Law. Even this year, it blocked representatives of the Chondoist religion in the North and South from holding a working-level contact in Panmunjom to discuss joint celebration of the 100th anniversary of the peasant war in 1894. Also, it has indiscriminately suppressed South Korean youth, students, and people who want to hold dialogue with us. All these facts prove that the South Korean people cannot enjoy their democratic freedom and rights nor achieve their social independence and national reunification because of the existing National Security Law. Therefore, the South Korean people and the people throughout the world have strongly called for the abolition of the National Security Law, an evil antireunification, fascist law, which cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Amnesty International has exposed and denounced the acts of the South Korean puppets who are viciously infringing upon their people's human rights without abolishing the National Security Law. However, the South Korean puppets will say that they regret hearing Amnesty International's denouncement and will find an excuse. Such acts by the South Korean puppets show that they will continue to brutally suppress the patriotic people in South Korea without abolishing the National Security Law. Therefore, their acts are unforgivable and become challenges to the voices of the people at home and abroad who call for the abolition of the National Security Law If the Kim Yong-sam groups fail to listen to the voices of the people at home and abroad -- which have reflected the demands of the times -- but instead continue to embark upon the road of betrayal, they will not avoid a greater denouncement from the people. The Kim Yong-sam groups must clearly see the trends of the times and immediately abolish the National Security Law as demanded by the people.
