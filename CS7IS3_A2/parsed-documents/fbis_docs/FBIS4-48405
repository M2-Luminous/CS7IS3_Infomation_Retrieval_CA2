[Dhlakama] Maringue is still our headquarters. It is the historic headquarters. So, I will just stop over there on my way to Quelimane, Zambezia Province. I will arrive in Maringue today. On 20 May, I will leave for Quelimane where I will attend a conference with all our district and provincial delegates from Zambezia and Nampula. They are assembled in Quelimane. [Manhique] There is a question that I have been wanting to ask you for a long time now. The city of Beira is very close to Maringue. Yet, you have not gone there. Is there any special reason? [Dhlakama] Beira is my home. [Manhique] But you have never visited it. [Dhlakama] When I am in Maringue, it is like being in Beira. Everyday I receive people from Beira -- our delegates, as well as relatives. To be in Beira is like being in Maringue. I am giving priority to the provinces which are distant from Maringue. [Manhique] Have you already set a definite date to visit Beira? [Dhlakama] Yes, I will be there in June. [Manhique] For sure? [Dhlakama] For sure. I will visit Beira, Manica, and Chimoio. [Manhique] One has the feeling that the peace process is somewhat bogged down. It seems that there are many problems, things are not running smoothly, and there is some mistrust. Would you like to comment? [Dhlakama] I can clarify that. There are no problems. What happens is that our Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] brothers are nervous. That is self-evident. That has been noticable over the past month. We understand the reason for their nervousness. It is because they have been in power alone for over 18 years, with no political opposition. In view of the pressure from the various political parties, Frelimo does not feel comfortable. Why do I say that? For instance, now the question is whether the army should consist of 30,000 or 15,000 men. We have already said time is running out. It is impossible to train 30,000 men before elections are held. The government, however, insists that we go for it. Meanwhile, the government has not made preparations for training. That makes us believe that the government will continue to press for an army of 30,000 men, thought it will not be able to do that. So, by October the government will say that there can be no elections because we have not completed training the army. We are insisting to the government that we should only train half of the required number. The other half will be selected and sent home on leave for about three or four months. After the elections, they will be called up. We are, however, negotiating with the government. [Manhique] It appears that there is a great deal of confusion in Sofala Province. Woodcutters claim you have assured them that they can operate freely. There are, let us say, little Renamo chiefs who are complicating things. Are you going to deal with this issue? [Dhlakama] There is no confusion. We have grown tired of this situation. Our policy is to protect economic resources. We have never allowed more than 150 people, claiming to be woodcutters, to go about destroying the forest. That is where we differ from Frelimo. Nobody has given them permission. At my base in Maringue I received more than 150 woodcutters after the signing of the General Peace Accord. We cannot allow people to destroy the whole forest. We are protecting the forest. The woodcutters have no reforestation program. They fell tress and that is it. So, we are protecting the forest. It is not true to say that I have given permission to fell trees and then a little chief contradicts that. [Manhique] So, what the woodcutters are saying is not true. [Dhlakama] It is not true.
