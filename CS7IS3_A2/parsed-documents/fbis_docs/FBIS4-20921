It will be the world's most advanced fighter aircraft apart from the American F-22, which will be more than twice as costly and several years later entering service. Eurofighter is designed as a highly agile multi-role aircraft, capable of ground-attack as well as its primary air defence role. Developed by Britain (33%), Germany (33%), Italy (21%), and Spain (13%), it will replace the RAF's Jaguars, Tornado F3s and now defunct Phantoms from the year 2000. It is an aerodynamically unstable aircraft requiring on-board computers to make thousands of calculations every second to keep it in the air by controlling the flaps, rudder and front "canard" wings. The single-seat cockpit is highly automatised to allow the pilot maximum time to engage the enemy. Powered by two new EJ200 engines, it has a top speed of twice the speed of sound and can operate between the limits of nine times the force of gravity and minus three times gravity in tight turns and other manoeuvres. On normal missions it will carry two short-range and four medium-range air-to-air missiles. A 27mm cannon is carried internally. The advanced ECR90 radar developed by GEC-Ferranti will allow pilots to detect, track and fire at enemy aircraft well beyond visual range. Eurofighter is also equipped with an infra-red search and track system that will enable pilots to spot the enemy by detecting minute differences in temperature between the target and its background. This will complement the radar as it is a passive system so it cannot be detected and it makes "stealth" aircraft visible.
