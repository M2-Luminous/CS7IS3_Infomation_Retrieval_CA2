The industrial increase will remain the same as in the last quarter. The industrial output value of township level and above will increase by 22 percent over the same quarter of last year, but will be the same as for the last quarter of last year. Light industry will continue its increase and remain three percentage points up over heavy industry. The increase in fixed assets investment will slow down and infrastructural construction investment by state-owned enterprises will increase by 36 percent while technological renovation investment will be 40 percent up. Both, however, will be down compared with last year. There will be a slowing down in money supply, but currency in circulation will recover its increase. Various loans will increase by 22 percent over the same period of last year and currency in circulation will be 25.4 percent up. The adverse balance of foreign trade will be improved with exports expoected to be 18 percent greater than in the same period of last year while imports are expected to be 21 percent up. The difference between exports and imports will fall to three percentage points from 14 percentage points for the first quarter in previous years. [sentence as received] Based on the above forecast, the State Information Centre has proposed keeping the emphasis on macro-level control. The too rapid increase in investment should be controlled before the estalishment of a self-control system for investment. Speculative capital should be carefully controlled and restricted. A variety of economic reform measures being newly implemented should be gradually improved and coordination strengthened. While disparities between people's earning power remain, fairness in the distribution of wealth and the raising of living standards of lower-income earners will need to have close attention paid to it. The establishment of the social security system should be speeded up and the income of retired and unemployed people should be guaranteed.
