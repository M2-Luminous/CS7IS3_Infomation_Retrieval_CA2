FR941003-0-00035 FR941003-0-00012 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 931199&hyph;4042; I.D. 092394A] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Modification of a closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is opening directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Central Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to fully use the total allowable catch (TAC) of Atka mackerel in that area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), September 30, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. In accordance with ยง672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the annual TAC for Atka mackerel was established by the final 1994 specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 1,000 metric tons (mt) for the Central Regulatory Area. At the same time, the directed fishery for Atka mackerel in the GOA was closed under ยง672.20(c)(2)(ii) in the final 1994 specifications in order to reserve amounts anticipated to be needed for incidental catch by other fisheries. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that, as of September 17, 1994, 995 mt of Atka mackerel in the Central Regulatory Area of the GOA remains unharvested. This amount is in excess of the amount necessary as incidental catch for other groundfish fisheries. Therefore, NMFS is terminating this closure and opening directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Central Regulatory Area of the GOA effective at 12 noon, A.l.t., September 30, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. All other closures remain in full force and effect. Classification This action is taken under ยง672.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: September 27, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
