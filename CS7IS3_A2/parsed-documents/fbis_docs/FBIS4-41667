FBIS4-41667 "drsov124cc_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-124 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 28 Jun ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 28 Jun LD2806072194 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0552 GMT 28 Jun 94 LD2806072194 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA carries remarks by Police Colonel-General Mikhail Yegorov, first deputy interior minister and head of the ministry's main department for combatting organised crime, in connection with the presidential decree "On Urgent Measures to Protect the Population from Banditry and Other Manifestations of Organised Crime". The decree took effect on Monday. Yegorov said that more than 200 well-organised and heavily armed criminal groups operate now in Moscow alone. Criminal groups commit 1,500 crimes in Russia every month. He said rejection of the presidential decree by many officials and politicians is accounted for by the fact that they are businessmen themselves and it would be disadvantageous to them if law enforcement agencies get access to commercial information and, what is most important, would be able to trace the tortuous ways their money travels through. Corruption in close conjunction with organised crime has penetrated all spheres of state administration, the Interior Ministry spokesman stated. He said that in 1993 alone police discharged more than 500 operatives who collaborated with criminal groups, selling day-to-day information. There were even personnel members who together with bandits were involved in murders. Criminal proceedings were instituted against them and they were dismissed from internal affairs agencies. Several high officials were arrested in Vladimir region and Komi Republic. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA gives the opinion of Issa Kostoyev, chairman of the federal council committee for constitutional legislation and court and legal matters, that the decree runs counter to the Constitution, the Criminal Procedure Code, the Law on Enterprises and Entrepreneurial Activities, and the Law on Banks and Banking Activities. As a result, innocent people may be affected. NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (NEW DAILY NEWSPAPER), referring to statements by spokesmen of the Russian Interior Ministry, writes that "no cardinal changes, no sweeping round-ups or searches (in view of the entering into force of the above-mentioned decree -- note by ITAR-TASS) are planned. Simply, `it will be easier for police to act'. "Do you think that we were looking forward to the decree as a starting pistol signal? We put gangs into prison and we shall continue to do so. The decree is only of some help in this process," Gennadiy Chebotarev, first deputy head of the ministry's main department for combatting organised crime, told the newspaper. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) carries an interview with Valeriy Manilov, deputy secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council, who believes that the following levels of security exist: "The security of the individual, the security of society, the security of the state. But still the safety of the individual is most important and is the point of departure". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI interviewed Oleg Gaydanov, deputy prosecutor- general of the Russian Federation, who told the newspaper: "The presidential decree dated June 14, I should say, is viewed in the prosecutor's office in varied ways, too. Some measures provided for in the decree really run counter to the current legislation. But one must realise that the problems of combatting crime are now uppermost in the minds of people in Russia and worry them more than any other one". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with two candidates for the Ukrainian presidency -- the incumbent President Leonid Kravchuk and ex-Premier Leonid Kuchma. "I am convinced that whoever becomes a president of Ukraine he, and together with him the whole of Ukraine, will always be in a hard situation if he would fail to proceed from the premise that relations with Russia should have a special status, considering the past and the future ..." Kravchuk told the newspaper. "If we learned to respect each other, then 70 per cent of our problems would have been resolved. Therefore relations with Russia are the most important matter, the centerpiece in our policy", Kravchuk said. Kuchma stated, for his part: "I have believed and continue to believe that we have many common interests on the territory of the former Soviet Union. As far as trips abroad are concerned, one should travel and have contacts with those countries which want that". Touching upon the Black Sea Fleet issue, Kuchma emphasised: "The problem, to my mind, has long been resolved by the present government. One should come to see what the solution is. We really need to undo this Black Sea knot. Otherwise, someone will always play this card in relations between Ukraine and Russia". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports that "the military collegium of the Russian Federation Supreme Court has referred an application from former Soviet Deputy Minister of Defence Valentin Varennikov to the Russian prosecutor-general's office for the institution of criminal proceedings in connection with the fact of `the break-up of the USSR'. Varennikov's defence lawyer Dmitriy Shteynberg, who announced this, pointed out that in accordance with law the prosecutor's office should verify the application and decide on or deny the institution of criminal proceedings". Varennikov was a defendant at the coup plotters' trial. PRAVDA writes that "now, just as two years ago, the question of Lithuanian investigators' possible taking of testimony from former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has re-emerged. They are convinced, the newspaper RESPUBLIKA reported, that Gorbachev was well informed of a conspiracy being prepared in Lithuania and did not stand aloof from the developments'. Referring to well-informed sources, the newspaper maintains that `an official charge against Gorbachev may be formulated in the coming days'". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, referring to the opinion of Vice- Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, writes that gross production of grain in Russia this year is expected to amount to 90-95 million tonnes, which will make it possible not to purchase grain abroad. TRUD carries an article by Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's Democratic Choice Party, who writes: "We are for a party of clean hands. This is what all politicians say. But it seems to me that we have real grounds to say that. At all events, I do not know who from among our active workers was accused of corruption if only once. "Those democratic politicians whose reputation was not impeccable, quit Russia's Choice or from the very outset were members of other parties. On the other hand, our party is supported by those who are known as decent people, who did not pursue big money and high positions and who were even ready to go to prison for their convictions." TRUD carries in interview with Ranendra Sena, the Indian ambassador to the Russian Federation, who said "We should not limit our relations to trade. It is essential to develop lasting and mutually beneficial partnership, establishing co-production, combining technological resources, creating common managerial structures and studying the market." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA runs an interview with Admiral of the Fleet Ivan Kapitanets, who points out: "We intend to uphold the interests of the fleet through the Federal Assembly. Our task is to convince the deputies, government and president that fleet expenditure should be separated from the all-budget one and turn it into a separate purpose-oriented item. A state programme should be worked out for the development of the fleet 15-20 years ahead. Without that, the fleet would not simply survive". PRAVDA carries a statement by the State Duma group of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, on the 1994 budget issue. The statement reads as follows: "The members of the Communist Party group in the state Duma believe that the 1994 draft budget submitted by the government, even after the introduction of some amendments to it, firstly, does not meet the interests of the people and the country. Secondly, it does not promote the country's getting out of the economic crisis and, thirdly, it has no clear priorities and is not aimed at providing the social protection of the population or strengthening the country's defence capacity".
