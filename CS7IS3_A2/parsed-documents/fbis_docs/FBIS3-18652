However, he takes the view that as long as the EU's fisheries policy remains unchanged, Iceland should remain firm on its decision to stay outside the EU. The political reactions in Iceland to the membership agreements are characterized in part by fears of growing isolation, but several politicians are also stressing that Iceland as a small island nation with an 80-percent dependency on fishing can best satisfy its special interests through bilateral agreements. Foreign Minister Hannibalsson wants thus to strengthen Iceland's position in relation to the EEA [European Economic Area] and the Common Market through a free trade agreement with the United States. Bjorn Bjarnason, chairman of the Althing Foreign Affairs Committee, said that the enlargement of the EU will not lead to immediate changes to Iceland's foreign policy. "The EEA agreement fully meets Iceland's need for access to the European market. On the other hand, Iceland will not of course have the same potential to influence the decisionmaking processes in the EU as the other EFTA countries. The Icelanders will therefore be obliged to revise their attitude to possible future EU membership the next time the doors are opened, but this will not happen for some years," Bjarnason said.
