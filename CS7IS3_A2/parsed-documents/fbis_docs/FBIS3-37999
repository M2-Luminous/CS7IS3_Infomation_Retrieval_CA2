This decision was adopted today during a joint meeting of the foregoing committees, which discussed Boris Yeltsin's corresponding request to the Council of the Federation, made in reply to an appeal of the U.N. secretary-general, ITAR-TASS was told by Petr Premyak, vice-chairman of the Committee for Defence. This item was included in today's agenda of the upper chamber's work. The committees also want the parliament to recommend the Foreign Ministry "to find political ways for normalising relations in that region, instead of steadily drawing Russia into the conflict," the deputy said. He also stated that Russian troops were being deployed in the most difficult spots of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In his opinion, this is because representatives of the Russian Defence Ministry had not been included in the command of the U.S. joint forces. "This omission must be corrected," the Russian MPs believe. The meeting also discussed cash allowances to Russian servicemen. They now receive from the United Nations wages, money for the upkeep of hardware, and food allowances in amounts equalling to those received by units deployed at home. However, in accordance with traditional rules, these payments should be 100-200 per cent higher in combat conditions. Premyak said that this point should be included in the State Duma's bill on the Russian U.N. peacekeeping contingent, which is now being drawn up. Russian airborne troops commander Colonel-General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, who attended the meeting of the two committees, told ITAR-TASS that there were now twelve hundred Russian servicemen in the conflict zone. If the Council of the Federation decides to send there an additional contingent, it will apparently be flown there in his planes this April.
