The president instructed his staff to convey to Sergey Shakhray "a few critical remarks concerning his style of work and some personal qualities". The president, according to Kostikov, pointed to Sergey Shakhray's "political whimsicality and his desire to accumulate too many posts. The president observed Sergey Shakhray's personal political motives are not always correlated with Russia's interest". Kostikov rejected categorically press allegations about the forthcoming sacking of Sergey Filatov as the president's chief of staff. According to the press secretary, Yeltsin said there can be no question about Sergey Filatov's resignation. Kostikov said that rumours about the dismissal of such figures as Sergey Filatov are destabilising in character. "I have an impression that NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has no real sources in the presidential and governmental structures and often engages in improvisations," he stressed. Filatov was is and will be in the foreseeable future one of the president's closest employees, Kostikov said.
