New ยง310.518 is added to subpart E to read as follows: ยง310.518 Drug products containing iron or iron salts. Drug products containing elemental iron or iron salts as an active ingredient in solid oral dosage form, e.g., tablets or capsule shall meet the following requirements: (a) Packaging. If the product contains 30 milligrams or more of iron per dosage unit, it shall be packaged in unit-dose packaging. ``Unit-dose packaging'' means a method of packaging a product into a nonreusable container designed to hold a single dosage unit intended for administration directly from that container, irrespective of whether the recommended dose is one or more than one of these units. The term ``dosage unit'' means the individual physical unit of the product (e.g., tablets or capsules). (b) Labeling. (1) If the product is packaged by the manufacturer in unit-dose packaging, its label shall bear the following statement: WARNING_Keep away from children. Keep in original package until each use. Contains iron, which can harm or cause death to a child. If a child accidentally swallows this product, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. (2) If the product contains less than 30 milligrams of iron and is packaged by the manufacturer in other than unit-dose packaging, e.g., a container with a child-resistant closure, its label shall bear the following statement: WARNING_Close tightly and keep away from children. Contains iron, which can harm or cause death to a child. If a child accidentally swallows this product, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. (3) The statement required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall appear prominently and conspicuously on the immediate container labeling in such a way that the warning is intact until all of the dosage units to which it applies are used. The statement required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall appear prominently and conspicuously on the immediate container labeling. In all cases where the immediate container is not the retail package, the warning statement shall also appear prominently and conspicuously on the principal display panel of the retail package. In addition, the warning statement shall appear on any labeling that contains warnings. Dated: September 28, 1994. David A. Kessler, Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
