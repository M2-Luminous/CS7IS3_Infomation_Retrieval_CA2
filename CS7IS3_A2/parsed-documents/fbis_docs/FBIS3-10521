A copy of this interview reached the Haitian press agency. After admitting that there has been a weakening of the front in the Chamber of Deputies, Paul asserted that dialogue could resolve the conflicts that have arisen within the front, to avoid social explosion [corrects himself] sorry, total explosion. He added that divergences within the FNCD are the product of circumstance, and could be easily resolved. In his opinion, the proposal voted as a resolution in the Lower Chamber must be analyzed and tailored to the stance expressed by President Aristide, whose views must be taken into account in order to reach a compromise. Paul explained that FNCD's stance has not changed since 16 February, when it rejected the appointment of a puppet prime minister. In conclusion, Paul invites all sectors to express unity so the solution to the crisis does not come exclusively from the United Nations or the four countries called, Friends of Haiti.
