In particular, he said, the fishing problem will be raised. He noted that it is the duty of the navy to ensure the safety and proper treatment of Thai fishing trawlers in the international waters off Indonesia and in the South Pacific when they sail home through the specific economic zones of neighboring countries. They should not be left to face any act of bullying or harassment on their way home. Asked about the Cambodian Government's attempt to outlaw the Khmer Rouge, the navy commander said this is a rather tough issue but Thailand does not interfere in internal affairs of Cambodia. However, it will affect Thailand because the Khmer Rouge is one of the factions that will always engage in fighting. If the fighting takes place near the border, Cambodian people will again flee to Thailand and this will cause problems to the Thai people. The world wants to see national reconciliation in Cambodia. In practice, it is not that easy. Meanwhile, Thailand will try to persuade the Cambodian factions to compromise.
