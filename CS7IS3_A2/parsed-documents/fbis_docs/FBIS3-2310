A constitutional amendment panel under the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has submitted a revised CPPCC constitution (draft) to the CPPCC plenary session that opened here this afternoon. The panel says in its explanation to the session that the revision aims to make the CPPCC constitution conform better to the latest amendments to the constitution of the People's Republic of China and to the tenets of the 14th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC). The panel notes that the revised constitution will highlight the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, CPC's basic line of taking economic development as the central task and the multi-party cooperation system under CPC leadership. The constitutional revision is designed to improve CPPCC's status and role in the political life of China, it says. According to the panel, since the major principles and basic framework of the 1982 constitution have remained correct, it has recommended only a necessary and partial revision. It suggests that issues which have a bearing on the work of the CPPCC but are beyond the limits of the CPPCC constitution be handled through state legislation and other channels. According to the panel headed by CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan, the revised CPPCC constitution (draft) has been approved by the Standing Committee of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee and is being submitted to the general session for examination and adoption.
