The banks were allocated 83 billion German marks [DM] within the framework of security transactions under repurchase agreement. The marginal allocation rate was 5.94 percent and thus 0.03 percentage points below the interest rates of the security transactions under repurchase agreement last week. Until then the important "third prime rate" had been 7 percent. According to the Bundesbank, the allocations were given an interest rate of 5.94 to 5.95 percent. The allocation volume of DM83 billion is set off by expiring transactions of DM82.5 billion. The latest security transactions under repurchase agreement were, like the ones last week, an interest tender, in which the banks contribute their own ideas concerning the interest rate at which they want to use the money for a duration of 14 days. At the Frankfurt banking center the new tiny step was interpreted as a signal that the guardians of the currency want to keep to their course of lowering interest rates, which they have announced for 1994. "The Bundesbank has decided not to do nothing," it was said. In view of the enormous expansion of the money supply in January and the latest turbulence on the international financial markets, a major decline in the prime rate cannot be expected for the foreseeable future.
