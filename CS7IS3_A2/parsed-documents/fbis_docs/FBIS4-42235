This meeting will make it possible to prepare for the European Council meeting in Corfu on 24 and 25 June, the G-7 summit in Naples on 8 and 9 July, and the German and French terms as president of the European Union [EU] which will take place in succession from 1 July. Elysee [office of the French president] spokesman Jean Musitelli confirmed the creation of "a high-level working group which would have the task...of ensuring full consultation between our two countries." German Government spokesman Dieter Vogel also confirmed that Paris and Bonn planned to combine their efforts to make their respective presidencies of the EU a success for Europe. "We may assume that the major squalls are behind us," Mr. Musitelli stressed, referring to the crisis in the European Monetary System, the GATT negotiations, and to the "uncertainties linked with the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and the problems of expansion to include four new members." In addition, in an interview published by L'ALSACE and the BADISCHES ZEITUNG, Francois Mitterrand explained that he did not see "why and how Europe's `center of gravity' should shift following the expansion" of the EU: "Look at a map of Europe: Germany and France have never been more `central' in every sense of the term."
