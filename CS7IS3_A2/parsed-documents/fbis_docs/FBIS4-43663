The delegation attended the four-day WEU parliamentary assembly which finished today. The Czech Republic was granted WEU associate partnership on May 9. The Czech Republic's integration with the EU has not only economic and political dimensions, but also a clear-cut defense and security aspect, Necas added. The sooner the Czech Republic joins the EU, the sooner it will join the WEU or NATO, he specified. The Czech delegation stressed that it was not correct -- as it has frequently appeared in the WEU documents -- to regard all the Central and Eastern countries as one bloc. It pointed to "wide economic, political, and security differences" between these countries. "We had to note that the Czech Republic was stable, heading for prosperity, and undertaking reforms supported by its population," Necas said. The Czech delegation has also assured the Western deputies that the Czech effort to come closer to the WEU was not just a "panic calling for a security umbrella" in the form of guarantees, but a sign of sharing the same values. "We want to protect these values. We want to share our part of responsibility as evidenced by the presence of the Czech troops in the Persian Gulf and now in the former Yugoslavia," Necas said. The Czech deputies asked the deputies from the nine WEU member countries to make it possible at their autumn session for the Czech Republic and other Eastern countries to fully join the work of the Assembly, except for the voting right. WEU representatives promised that the association status which was under preparation would correspond to this. The Czech deputies proposed that representatives of the WEU and Eastern countries meet to discuss the contents of the associate partnership in the coming months in Prague.
