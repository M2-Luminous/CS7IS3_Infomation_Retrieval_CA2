Recalling his brilliant achievements, which have gone down in history, officers and men of the whole Army, like the people of all the nationalities in China, are filled with great admiration for this great man of history. Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist, and theorist as well as a great patriot and national hero of modern Chinese history. He achieved indelible historical feats in the founding and developing of our party and the People's Army, victory in the cause of liberation of the people of all the nationalities of China, the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the development of the socialist cause in our country, to allow the Chinese nation to plant its feet firmly in the forest of the world of nations. The Chinese communists, with Comrade Mao Zedong as their chief representative, made theoretical generalizations on a series of experiences of long-term Chinese revolutionary practice with originality based on the basic tenets of Marxist and shaped into Mao Zedong Thought--scientific guiding ideas suitable to conditions in China. At the same time, Comrade Mao Zedong was a great proletarian strategist. In half a century, he led our party, people and Army in founding our great military cause that will shine through the ages. The characteristic of the Chinese revolution was armed revolution against armed counterrevolution, the central task of the revolution was the seizure of political power with armed force, the major form of struggle was armed struggle, and the chief form of organization was the People's Army. The entirety of the theory and practice of our party during the whole period of the new democratic revolution was unfolded by centering around the core of revolutionary war. Inside our party, Comrade Mao Zedong was the first to see the importance and pressing nature of armed struggle, the first to indicate the road of establishing revolutionary bases, encircling the cities with the rural areas, as well as seizing political power with armed force, and he personally initiated the People's Army under the absolute leadership of the party with fresh-and-blood ties with the people. In the surging waves of Chinese revolutionary wars, Comrade Mao Zedong became our Army's wise commander-in-chief, formed strategic plans at headquarters, determined victories on the vast battlefields across China, and directed one campaign after another full of power and grandeur. From the struggle at Jinggangshan to the Long March, from the consolidation and development of the Northern Shaanxi Revolutionary Base Area to vanquishing the invasion by Japanese imperialism, from the War of Liberation and the decisive battle against 8 million Kuomintang troops to contending with a most powerful enemy on the Korean battleground, all these reflected his superb art of command marked by great proficiency. The duration of his command during the revolutionary wars, their scope, the complexity of situation, the splendor of the victories, and the far-reaching effects were all rare in the all-time history of war of all countries. Comrade Mao Zedong was the glory of the People's Army as well as the pride of the Chinese nation. Comrade Mao Zedong was a great man, a famous military commander, as well as an outstanding military theorist. He combined the basic tenets of Marxist-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolutionary war and army building, scientifically summarized the Chinese revolutionary war and the precious experiences of our army building, critically absorbed the rational essences of all sorts of military theories from all eras and from all lands, concentrated the wisdom of the whole party and whole Army, and founded Mao Zedong military thinking. Mao Zedong military thinking on the building of a revolutionary army, people's war, and strategies and tactics characterized by flexibility and a scientific concept of war and methodology based on dialectical materialism and historical materialism have enriched and developed Marxist-Leninist military doctrine with a series of original theories that were shaped into a scientific system characterized by extensive and profound knowledge, and this became a brilliant, important part of Mao Zedong Thought. Especially in the arena of building a people's army, Comrade Mao Zedong systematically formed a revolutionary army with its main factor being peasants, and the question on how should the army be built into a new-type people's army which is proletarian in nature and has strict discipline, while maintaining close ties with the people. He stipulated that serving the people heart and soul should be the sole purpose of the People's Army; determined the principle of the party commanding the gun, but not otherwise; formulated the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention; stressed the implementation of democracy in the three main fields, namely political, economic and military democracy at the company level; implemented the principle of unity between officers and men, unity between the Army and the people, and disintegrating enemy forces; and set out and summarized a whole range of principles and methods of political work for the Army. The correctness of all these theories and principles in building a new-type people's army had been fully proved in the long-term practice of the Chinese revolution and the building of the People's Army. By drawing a lesson from China being bullied by various powers during its modern and contemporary history, which resulted from impoverishment and being weak, Comrade Mao Zedong set out, in the wake of the PRC's founding, the guiding thinking of strengthening defense and building a powerful modern revolutionary armed force, and he made the important decision on developing modern defense science and technology through self- reliance, thus effectively insuring China's independence and peaceful socialist construction. Mao Zedong's military thinking took deep root in the fertile soil of the practice of Chinese revolutionary war and the building of our Army. It originated from military practice, while it was tested and developed in giving guidance to military practice. The half-century of progress in our Army's struggles give evidence to the fact that Mao Zedong military thinking has correctly answered and resolved a series of important issues on why we must carry out a revolutionary war, whom we should rely on in fighting a revolutionary war, and how we can win that war, while profoundly revealing the basic law that governs China's revolutionary war and building of the People's Army, and that this has scientific quality and progressiveness beyond a doubt. With the changing of the times, great progress has been made in science, technology, weaponry, and equipment, and many characteristics different from the past have surfaced in modern warfare along with great changes in the means, tactics, and ways of war. Nevertheless, the basic law of war has not changed, nor has the nature of our Army as a people's army; Mao Zedong's basic principles on building a people's army, the concept of people's war, and strategies and principles, especially his military dialectics, continue to have universal guiding significance, and this is a mighty ideological weapon for making preparations for future wars against aggression. Mao Zedong Thought is an ever-developing theoretical system. It was none other than Comrade Deng Xiaoping who became an outstanding representative and brilliant model in pushing Mao Zedong Thought to a new realm and new heights. As an important member of our party's first-generation collective leadership, Comrade Deng Xiaoping participated in the founding of Mao Zedong Thought; furthermore, as the core of the party's second-generation collective leadership, he has led the Chinese people in the great practice of reform, opening up, and modernization, concentrated the wisdom of the whole party, enriched and developed Mao Zedong Thought, initiated the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and realized the second historical leap of Marxist basic tenets combining with China's concrete practice. In the application and development of Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts, his outstanding political wisdom, and Marxist spirit of blazing new trails have been given full play. As the chief architect of China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has personally planned for and led our Army in building a revolutionary, regular, and modern army. He has adhered to and inherited the most fundamental essence of Mao Zedong's military thinking, set out our Army's purpose of serving the people heart and soul, and brought forward our Army's glorious traditions and "five kinds of revolutionary spirit" to always maintain our army's political color. At the same time, with extremely great political boldness and theoretical courage, he set out the guiding idea for army building and the need for implementing strategic change through profoundly analyzing the world strategic situation today, the characteristics of modern warfare, China's national conditions, and the Army's actual conditions. He indicated that our Army building must take modernization as the center, strengthen quality building, and take the road of picked troops with Chinese characteristics, while building our Army into a powerful, modern, regular, revolutionary army. He stressed the need to augment scientific research and improve weaponry and equipment, as well as elevate education and training to a strategic position, work hard to improve cadres' ability in commanding modern warfare, and bring up qualified people who are able to fight a war and pursue socialist construction, namely training people for both military and civilian jobs in a big way. He stressed the need to complete and perfect rules and regulations, be strict with discipline, and adhere to strictly running the Army and the need to augment logistics building to meet the demand of the new situation and the needs of modern warfare. He has called for exerting efforts to make cadres more revolutionary, younger in average, better educated and more professionalized; to augment and improve ideological and political work; continuously push the building of spiritual civilization in the army; bring up soldiers with lofty ideals, moral integrity, a better educational background, and a high sense of discipline; and so forth. All this has shaped into Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building for the new period sharply marked with the characteristics of the times. This thinking has answered and resolved, with originality, a series of basic issues in theory and practice about our army building during the new period, and is the fundamental grounds and guiding thinking for our army building and reform. Without Mao Zedong military thinking, there would not have been the growth of the People's Army and the victorious development of the people's revolutionary wars. Likewise, without Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building during the new period, there would not have been the great accomplishments of our army reform and building today. To firmly arm the whole Army with Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building during the new period is basic insurance for victoriously advancing along the road of building a modern army with Chinese characteristics. Carrying forward the cause and forging ahead into the future, the third-generation collective leadership of the Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has held aloft the banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and has continuously pushed forward China's great cause of reform, opening up, and modernization. The Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as chairman has formulated military strategic principles for our Army during the new period based on Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building during the new period and has set out the general requirement of "being politically eligible, skillful in military affairs, strict with discipline, and effective with logistics," and has drawn up a series of important decision on augmenting the building of a more revolutionary, modern and regular Army. The whole Army, from the top down, has brought forward our party's fine traditions in a big way, united as one, worked hard, and continuously made new progress in military affairs, political work, and logistics and defense scientific research in the course of reform. The century from the birth of Comrade Mao Zedong has been one of earth-shaking changes which have taken place in China and the world. The most significant commemoration of Comrade Mao Zedong is to inherit and develop Mao Zedong military thinking and forge ahead along the broad path of building a modern army with Chinese characteristics initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. It is necessary for us to consciously meet the requirements set out by the Central Committee and Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, work hard to arm our thinking with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, continuously enhance our resolution in "adhering to the party basic line without wavering for a hundred years," and enthusiastically support various reforms with building the socialist market economic structure as the goal. It is imperative to firmly implement our Army's military strategic principles for the new period, continuously augment the Army's quality building, and improve the Army's combat effectiveness in a comprehensive way to provide reliable security insurance for reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. It is necessary to augment the Army's political and ideological building in a big way and take the lead in building socialist spiritual civilization in the whole society. Comrades of the whole Army, let us closely unite around the Central Committee and Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, go all out in doing substantial work, exert great efforts to make the country strong, and work hard together with the people of the whole country in building and defending a prosperous, powerful, democratic, and civilized socialist country while advancing toward the 21st century full of confidence!
