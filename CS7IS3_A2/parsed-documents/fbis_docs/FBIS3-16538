Russian deputy defence minister, Georgiy Kondratyev, addressed lawmakers today, saying that over 16,000 Russian servicemen are performing their duties in hot beds of tension on our planet in the framework of a peace-keeping mission. Lawmakers took into account appeals made by Russian Defence Ministry officials who pointed out that the law was a matter of vital importance. It was pointed out that Russia's participation in peace-keeping activities, connected with continuing instability in areas adjoining Russia's territory, and Russia's membership in the U.N. make it necessary to create a corresponding legal basis which does not exist at present. The law, adopted in the first reading, determines the order, rights and duties of bodies of state power when resolving matters of sending military or civil contingents on peace-keeping missions outside the Russian federation.
