In an interview on Lithuanian TV, Lithuanian Prosecutor General Arturas Paulauskas said the searches are related to the investigation of financial violations in the purchase of weapons for the Lithuanian army. The investigation was started in January. Paulauskas declined to comment on the investigation but promised to inform about the results of the Thursday searches "in a matter of two days." According to unofficial reports, the police arrested Vladas Laurinavicius, president of the Kaunas-based association Selma, which in 1992-1993 acted as a mediator in the purchase of weapons for Lithuanian defense forces. The investigation established that the Lithuanian Defense Ministry paid unrealistic prices for automatic rifles, frigates and helicopters sold by Selma. Besides, the payments were made in cash, which is contrary to the law. Millions of then Lithuanian provisional money, also called talonas, and Russian rubles were paid personally to the association's president, who has several previous convictions and spent 5 years in jail. Selma also builds housing for Russian servicemen withdrawing from the Baltic states. Paulauskas said the unfavorable conditions for buying weapons at that time should be taken into account, but in his opinion, the financial violations cannot be ignored. He said "the investigation will establish whether (Defense Ministry) officials had any selfish incentives."
