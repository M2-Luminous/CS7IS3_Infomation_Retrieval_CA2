The first differences between the soldiers and the civilians who promoted a coup d'etat that toppled constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on 30 September 1991 are emerging six days after the octogenarian Jonassaint was installed. He also matter of factly assumed the post of prime minister on 16 May when he established a new government with the military's support. Jonassaint, in a decision enacted by decree, assumed full control of the Executive Branch on Monday and announced that he would assume the posts of provisional president and prime minister. After the de facto ruler made his announcement, Acting Prime Minister Robert Malval urged government officials and the general public to "ignore all instructions given and decisions made" by the Jonassaint Government. Meanwhile, Sansaricq expressed his reservations about certain ministers appointed by the new government and presented a copy of correspondence he exchanged with Jonassaint on 13 May in which Sansaricq asked Jonassaint to send to the Senate leadership, which he heads, the name of the person who would occupy the post of prime minister. Jonassaint, 81, replied that after consulting Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde, the latter convinced him to not appoint a prime minister because of the "special nature" of his government. Hubert Deronceray, leader of the group Mobilization for National Development, the main promoter of the implementation of Article 149 of the Haitian Constitution, which was the basis for the appointment of Jonassaint to the post, accused the "de facto" president of violating that constitutional statute. Deronceray, who had supported the appointment of the ruler imposed by the military men of General Raoul Cedras, the leader of the coup against Aristide, said that his party was surprised to confirm [comprobar] that Jonassaint violated the Haitian Constitution. The right-wing leader, who had hoped he would be appointed head of government, accused Jonassaint of eliminating the post of prime minister "and of establishing a government without consulting the parties." Deronceray described the way in which that article was applied as "a shadow of Article 149" and stressed he will monitor future developments. Meanwhile, the de facto ministers appointed by Jonassaint were installed on 16 May. Robert Malval, the prime minister appointed by Aristide, called for fiscal disobedience. Malval, in reaffirming his rejection of the Jonassaint government, described as void "all decrees, administrative acts, property concessions, and creations of associations." [sentence as received] He advised state traders that if they supply services to the de facto government, such financial obligations will not be honored. Malval also said that he will not recognize promotions of public administration personnel.
