If that is indeed the case, how does Israel propose to handle things? [Rabin] We are trying to establish a dialogue with every Arab party to the negotiations on the basis of the Madrid peace conference and the continuation of the talks in Washington. We do not create any sort of linkage between progress with one Arab partner out of the four we are negotiating with. I am referring to Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinians. We will make progress with anyone prepared to talk to us with whom we can find a common language, without this being conditional on the state of the negotiations with the other Arab partners. However, it is worth remembering one thing: There is a fundamental difference in the negotiations between us and the three neighboring Arab countries, with whom we seek to sign a peace treaty, and the negotiations with the Palestinians. The Declaration of Principles is not a peace treaty, it is merely an important step toward peace. The title of the paper signed in Washington faithfully reflects the nature of the agreement itself: It is an agreement on an interim accord. We still use old terminology and call it autonomy while the Palestinians and the formal documents at the Madrid conference and afterwards speak of arrangements for Palestinian self-rule. [Segal] Does King Husayn's declaration of a possible parting of the ways with the PLO perhaps pave the way for a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation in the permanent settlement? Is this not cause for concern? What is Israel's attitude toward this move? [Rabin] At the moment we are negotiating a peace treaty with three Arab countries and holding talks on an interim settlement with the Palestinians. The Israeli Government has reached no decision on a confederation with Jordan in the permanent arrangement. According to international terminology, a confederation is a framework incorporating two states. Anyone caring to read the Labor Party's election platform and the decisions made at its latest convention will see that there is no mention of a Palestinian state between Israel and Jordan. Therefore, any attempt to deal with issues pertaining to the permanent solution now are wrong. We oppose the Palestinian attempt to raise elements of the permanent solution for discussion in the course of negotiations on the Gaza-Jericho First proposal, which is merely the first step in the interim stage. We firmly and clearly insist on one thing: the negotiations today are over the interim accord. Both sides must keep all their options open for the negotiations on the permanent solution. All the wisdom and logic in reaching an interim agreement first lies in the attempt to examine whether Palestinians and Israelis can achieve peaceful coexistence in Judaea and Samaria. Until we experience whether or not this is possible, it would be a mistake on our part today to deal with elements of the permanent solution or to allow the Palestinians to raise issues pertaining to the permanent arrangement, such as for example, the refugee issue. At this stage of negotiations on the interim arrangement, we are not dealing with the issue of refugees, whether these are Palestinian refugees or Jewish refugees from the Arab countries. [Segal] At a meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee two weeks ago, Knesset Member [MK] Binyamin Netanyahu pulled out an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Intelligence Branch document warning about the security risks posed by autonomy. Your reaction was, and I quote: With all due respect to the IDF Intelligence Branch, it has been wrong in the past and these are merely assessments. Sir, do you believe that when the PLO assumes responsibility we will be able to count on them? Can 'Arafat guarantee security and deal with the terrorist squads? [Rabin] Let us separate the substantive part of your question and its introductory sentence. At the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee session, MK Netanyahu did, indeed, mention an IDF Intelligence Branch document which I had not yet seen. I replied that it was the Intelligence Branch's job to present the dangers. I never concealed the fact that any political move carried out by Israel entails some risks. Giving up all of the Sinai Peninsula and erasing all signs of an Israeli presence there also engendered danger. Not only security risks, it also set a precedent regarding the price Israel would have to pay in exchange for peace with other countries. It is the political echelon, however, which makes the decisions. As for the assessments of the Intelligence Branch, whether right or wrong as it occasionally transpires, there is the example of the Yom Kippur War which proves that mistakes have been made, perhaps not in overrating dangers but rather in underestimating them. Now back to your question. First of all, Israel retains responsibility for the security of Israeli citizens and for external security. True, in the situation which we hope will ensue, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, for example, will control the areas of Gaza city with over 250,000 Palestinian residents. Clearly, in order to control such a population -- and because we do not want to place any Israeli soldiers or policemen at risk -- there will have to be a Palestinian police force which will be armed with rifles, not sticks. They will not receive their arms from Israel but from another source. All the talk about Israel arming the Palestinian police is simply being fabricated by various elements who are trying to mislead the public with baseless lies. There must be a strong police force. This was already promised -- and I believe rightly so -- by an Israeli prime minister way back at Camp David. I also think that there should be a strong police force. This police force must take control of the street because if it fails to do so, or if it does not receive strict instructions to impose law and order, the basis for the whole agreement will be undermined. [Ben-'Ami] Security problems can also arise from the other end. What about the settlers' riots and the calls for insubordination inside the IDF? What about the letter by the reserve officers? [Rabin] Let me start off by saying that I consider insubordination within the IDF to be totally unacceptable. I was also opposed to it during the Lebanon war. Even if the public was divided, a democratically elected government has the authority to tell the IDF what to do and no soldier has the right to refuse an order. There is nothing worse than calling for insubordination. I find it inconceivable for a soldier to refuse to serve in the territories. There were many cases of soldiers who refused to serve in the territories because the military occupation of another people was contradictory to their political beliefs. It is just as inconceivable for soldiers to refuse any orders except for what the Supreme Court defines as manifestly illegal orders which contravene the humane and legal values we seek to instill in our soldiers. [Ben-'Ami] What about the settlers' terror activities? [Rabin] If such things happen, God forbid, it will be Israel's responsibility to deal with it, just as we shall demand that the Palestinian police deal with Palestinian terrorists in the areas under the control of the Palestinian police. [Segal] Sir, was the release of 101 Palestinian prisoners part of a deal with the PLO to renew the Taba talks? Are further releases of Palestinian prisoners expected in the coming days? [Rabin] No one informed the PLO of the decision to release over 100 prisoners. I was responsible for this decision. I would like to reiterate our criteria: None of these prisoners belonged to the rejectionist groups which continue terrorist activity, none of them has any Jewish or Palestinian blood on their hands, and most of them were due to be released soon anyway. I would like to remind everyone that Israel is holding between 9,000 and 9,600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. These are mostly prisoners or detainees still undergoing legal proceedings. These prisoners are held in IDF lockups or in Prison Service installations. On average, over 300 prisoners are released each month when their sentence is completed or when the administrative detention of about 130 or 140 prisoners out of the 9,000 expires. The remainder have either been convicted or are undergoing legal proceedings. We did not release any prisoner or detainee still undergoing legal proceedings. Approximately 200 to 300 prisoners are released each month anyway. [Ben-'Ami] Sir, you were in favor of negotiating with Syria first. In a week President Clinton will meet with Syrian President al-Asad. Do you expect a change in Israel's relationship with Syria? Do you foresee a possibility of the Syrian track taking priority over the negotiations with the Palestinians? [Rabin] First of all, I would like to correct what you said. I have always stressed the need to focus on the Palestinian-Israeli issue, at least since the last election campaign and after becoming prime minister. If you watch the television reports on our election campaign you will see that we placed the focus on the Palestinian track and I even announced a timetable of six to nine months that we failed to meet. We failed to meet the target date but we reached an agreement with the Palestinians. I always said that the key for a breakthrough is in the hands of two of our four Arab partners: either Syria or the Palestinians. Why is this? I always realized that Jordan cannot -- without getting into the reasons for this now -- lead a breakthrough. Lebanon, which, putting things nicely, is very much under Syria's influence, is definitely incapable of such a move. Therefore, the key to any breakthrough is either Syria or the Palestinians. We reached a declaration of principles and we are conducting negotiations with the Palestinians. I will not say things are easier. There have been ups and downs, as I said there would be immediately after signing the agreement in Washington. As for the Syrians, I have still not received an answer to my question. I said earlier that the goal of our negotiations with the neighboring Arab countries was a peace treaty, not some other agreement. To the best of my knowledge, Syria, up to this very moment, has not explained that its interpretation of the term peace is similar to the way we understand it. In other words, borders that are open to the traffic of goods and people, diplomatic relations and embassies, a policy of normalization, and a peace treaty between our two countries that is independent and not effected by our relations with other Arab partners. I would not be wrong to say that up to now, the Syrians have been demanding a full withdrawal and the dismantlement of all Jewish settlements on the Golan Heights in exchange for a peace that does not even include normalization. Al-Asad constantly insists he will not be willing to accept anything less than was accepted by the late Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat. In other words, Israel's return to the international border, the evacuation of all of the Sinai and the uprooting of any Israeli presence there. Al-Asad insists that this is a precedent for making peace, and he is adamant not to receive less even in return for a less extensive peace. At this stage, we have not received a full answer regarding what kind of peace President al-Asad is referring to, and we have certainly not accepted the price he is asking in return for peace. We have accepted the principle of withdrawal on the Golan Heights to secure and recognized borders. We said we would not enter negotiations on the geographical dimensions of withdrawal until we know what kind of peace we are getting in return. As for what will happen at the al- Asad-Clinton summit on 16 January, why should I guess? We only have to wait nine days to find out. [Segal] Washington pundits believe that the Syrian president will clearly explain his concept of peace with Israel. According to some assessments, he will propose full peace with embassies and open borders. According to your own formula of full peace in exchange for full withdrawal, are you today capable of passing a decision on withdrawal from the Golan Heights? [Rabin] Up to today, when defining Israel's position, I have never spoken of full withdrawal. If that becomes a problem, we shall have to discuss it. Our position today is in support of a withdrawal on the Golan Heights. [Segal] Given today's political situation, can you gain a majority for such a decision? [Rabin] For a withdrawal on the Golan Heights? Yes. [passage omitted]
