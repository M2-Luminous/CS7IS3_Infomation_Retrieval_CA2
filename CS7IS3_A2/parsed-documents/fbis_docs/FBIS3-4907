The message was sent in the name of Song Yong-tae, chief South Korean delegate to the inter-Korean contact. Thursday's meeting is to be held at "Peace House" on the southern side of the border at the truce village. It has been four months since South and North Korea last held the working-level contact on Oct. 25 last year. "We will go to the Peace House at 10 a.m. Thursday, as you have proposed, hoping a successful outcome of the working-level contact," Song said. "It is regrettable, however, that you have placed responsibility on our side for the suspension of the contact and failure to make any progress in the meantime," Song said. The exchanges of special envoys between Seoul and Pyongyang have to be realized as soon as possible because they were agreed upon by both sides for the resolution of the nuclear issue and other pending inter-Korean problems, Song told North Korea. "It is important for you (North Korea) to make a sincere and productive approach to discussions for the exchanges of special envoys, and respect and fulfill commitments you made," Song said. After sending the message, Song told reporters that Thursday's meeting could make progress if North Korea does not offer preconditions and repeat its past demands that South Korea suspend "a nuclear war exercise" and stop participating in "an international campaign" against North Korea. Song also said that he does not detect any signs of North Korea rejecting further working-level contact blaming a delay by South Korea on the announcement of the suspension of the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise Team Spirit. But Song said whether or not International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors who went into North Korea on Tuesday have actually began their work has not been confirmed. In any event, if the inter-Korean contact is carried out on Thursday, South Korea is expected to announce a conditional suspension of the Team Spirit exercise while the U.S. Government will make its announcement on a third round of the U.S.-North Korean high-level talks tentatively slated for March 21 in Geneva.
