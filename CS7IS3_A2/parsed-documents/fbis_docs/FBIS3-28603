FBIS3-28603 "dreas026__a94024" FBIS-EAS-94-026-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Government Formulates Economic Stimulus Package OW0502100894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 3 Feb 94 Evening Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0502100894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] It seems that the scale of comprehensive economic measures, which the government will announce soon, will reach some 15.1 trillion yen in total, the largest ever. The package will consist of 5.7 trillion yen in tax reductions, including income and resident tax cuts and expansion of housing-related tax system, and 9.4 trillion yen in public investment and loans, such as public works projects. A possibility of studying new measure -- designed to liquidate interest reduction and exemption bonds payable to nonbank and other companies by selling them to bond purchasing companies to urge private financial institutions to deal with bad bonds they have -- will be incorporated in the package. However, the process of coordinating views among the ruling parties on the issue of finding financial sources to cover a shortfall, which will be created by tax reductions, is experiencing rough sailing. Because of this, there is a possibility that the total amount of the package may change depending on the outcome of the coordination process. The details of the public investment and loans in the comprehensive economic measures are: 5 trillion yen for "public investments," 2.8 trillion yen for purchasing land before mapping out utilization plans for it to activate land transactions, and 1.3 trillion yen for helping small-to-medium-sized enterprises. Of the 5 trillion yen for public investments, 2.9 trillion yen will be allocated for additional general public works projects and public corporations' projects for fiscal 1993. Regarding expenses for improving facilities, additional 600 billion yen will be earmarked mainly for education, research, and medical services. The government will ask the municipalities to increase the amount of public works projects, which local governments will carry out independently, by about 300 billion yen. Amount of the Housing Loan Corporation's housing loans will be increased by 1.2 trillion yen, which is enough to cover loans for 70,000 housing units. Of the 2.8 trillion yen for purchasing land before mapping out utilization plans for it, 500 billion yen will be secured for purchases of new land for general urban development projects. Land purchases for these projects will be made through a private [minkan] organization for promotion of urban development.
