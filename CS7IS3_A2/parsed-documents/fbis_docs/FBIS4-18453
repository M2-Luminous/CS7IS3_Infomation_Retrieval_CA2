"The challenge today is not to decide whether or not to act in the social sphere, but how and when to do so"; this must not be interpreted as a protectionist measure as regards the less developed countries (for which cheap labour is a sizeable economic factor). "At Marakesh, I propose to make this clear, explaining why we are keen to include social issues on the agenda of the WTO," Sir Leon announced, considering that it will above all be a question of demonstrating that this is not motivated by "protectionism, self-interest or opportunism"; this is why safeguard mechanisms against protectionist abuses in this social clause will have to be set up. What mechanisms? According to the Commissioner, above all, this means: - Making sure that policy in this field is defined on the basis of multilateral dialogue, not only involving the developed countries, but also countries from the Third World which are most concerned by this problem; - Establishing objective criteria which will enable one to note whether a country is or is not respecting the political line agreed in social matters; - Setting a goal and introducing control and examination mechanisms for cases where some countries should be accused of acting against the agreed principles; - Making sure that any action in this field is compatible with the other international obligations agreed to by the community of States. Having said that it was "crucial" that these safeguard measures be spelt out within the new global trade structure "from the very outset," Sir Leon welcomed the proposal made by the trade unions consisting in considering the standards established by the International labour Organisation (ILO) in Geneva as being valid common criteria which could be discussed with the WTO. "This is no doubt along the lines of thought of the Commission," he said, as "pursuing the enforcement of ILO obligations worldwide is a long-held European priority. We pursue it because it is in principle right to do so, not because we expect material gain to result." Reservations of Developing Countries The Chairman of the EP's Committee on External Economic Relations, Willy de Clercq, also pleaded in favour of including the social clause in the new rules and structures for world trade, considering that "freedom in trade, fair trade and the protection of human dignity are not incompatible concepts, on the contrary." The Philippines ambassador to the European Union and chairman of the ASEAN Committee in Brussels, Mr. Pedrosa, on the other hand, not only said that including the social clause in the rules of international trade was an "inappropriate remedy" ("we should rather be speaking of this in international social fora, like the ILO and UNICEF"), but also affirmed that it would be a "nontariff trade barrier and would be protectionist" which would be "imposed" on developing countries by developed ones. Opposition by developing countries was moreover confirmed in Geneva where -- in the framework of the GATT work preparing the signing of the Uruguay Round accord -- work relating to the draft ministerial declaration to be approved in Marakesh on 15 April was interrupted. The United States, indeed, wanted to include explicit references to the "social clause," which the developing countries refused. The GATT discussions on this aspect of the draft declaration will be resumed next week: the European Union has a more flexible position to the United States, in the sense that it would regard as sufficient that the social issue be inserted in the working programme of the future World Trade Organinsation.
