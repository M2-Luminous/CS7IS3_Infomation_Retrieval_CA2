Ukraine itself cannot complete the building of this ship, says the head of the largest shipyard in Ukraine. The Varyah meanwhile occupies a quay, creating problems with its utilization and causing expenses for servicing it in a mothballed state. The plant cannot independently resolve the issue of cutting up or selling the ship. A great deal of money has moreover been invested in the Varyah, and courage is needed to dare to give up on it now.
