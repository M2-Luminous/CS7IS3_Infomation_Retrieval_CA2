FBIS4-44176 "drweu124_o_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-124 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 CYPRUS Spokesman, Parties on EU Summit Position on Cyprus Spokesman, Parties on EU Summit Position on Cyprus NC2706173594 Nicosia Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in Greek 1500 GMT 27 Jun 94 NC2706173594 Nicosia Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network Greek BFN [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that the Greek EU [European Union] presidency in Corfu sought the best regarding Cyprus' accession in the EU, which was the beginning of official negotiations to achieve Cyprus' participation in the next EU enlargement. This goal, he said, is considered realistically positive. Evaluating Greece's handling of the issue during the EU summit in Corfu, Kasoulidhis added that it became clear that the reason no date for the beginning of accession talks was given was not due to the developments in the Cyprus issue but to the internal structural changes that will take place within the Union. Kasoulidhis repeated that the decisions made in Corfu represent a significant step in Cyprus' move for accession into the EU, and added that the next step is the establishment of a date for accession talks. AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] says in a statement that the government's triumphant statements regarding the decisions made in Corfu are not justified because the goal for the appointment of a date for the beginning of accession talks for Cyprus has not been achieved. Instead, AKEL says, there is a general position that Cyprus will be involved in the next expansion stage, without anyone knowing under what conditions and when the next expansion will take place. AKEL also notes that the conclusion, that the EU has disassociated the direction of Cyprus' accession from the Cyprus issue, is arbitrary. Government spokesman Kasoulidhis commented on AKEL's statement about the decisions made in Corfu, and noted that the government does not make triumphant statements, in comparison with AKEL which speaks of disasters, as he put it, for every positive step for Cyprus. Kasoulidhis added that one additional reason that AKEL undermines the importance of the decisions made in Corfu is that because of the policies it followed, it was the main reason for the delay in the submission of Cyprus' application for accession under the presidency of Yeoryios Vasiliou. A statement issued by socialist party EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] expresses satisfaction, because the decision of the EU summit in Corfu does not associate Cyprus' move toward accession in the EU with the move to solve the Cyprus issue, and because the next stage of EU expansion will include Cyprus and Malta. EDEK adds that now there is a need for a real crusade by all forces in Cyprus and Greece in view of the EU summit next January so that a decision for the beginning of accession talks will be made. Finally, EDEK expresses gratitude to the Greek Government for the fight [on behalf of Cyprus] in the Corfu summit. The Free Democrats Movement issued a statement regarding the reference to Cyprus and Malta in the final communique of the EU summit in Corfu, which it describes as a positive development. However, it adds that it has been greatly exaggerated. In the statement, the Free Democrats Movement stresses that there is no final decision for Cyprus' accession during the next expansion as Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis had said. The statement also notes that the claim for disassociation of the Cyprus issue from that of accession is not true. It adds that the EU Commission's position, that Cyprus' application will be reexamined in January 1995 in light of developments in the Cyprus issue, is still in effect.
