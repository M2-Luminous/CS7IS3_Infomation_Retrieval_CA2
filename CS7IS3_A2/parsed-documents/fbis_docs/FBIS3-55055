"You can be absolutely sure," he said, "that stabilizing the Russian ruble or the U.S. dollar means undermining our economy and robbing our people. This would strengthen the economies of the countries whose currencies would be allowed in Belarus. Who is devising these kinds of policies? The government of an independent state or a special agency? The latter, is the most likely answer."
