These officials told KUNA that a number of surface-to-surface missiles landed on Aden airport at dawn today. The airport has for the last several days been under indiscriminate bombardment in a move to prevent military aircraft from flying from it. However, they did not report any casualties. The Yemeni news agency in Aden has quoted security sources as having said that the village of Dar Sa'd, which lies 15 km from the capital, was subjected last night to an indiscriminate bombardment by the artillery of the northern forces which left 18 people killed and no less than 23 wounded. The agency said the southern forces responded fiercely to silence the source of the fire while resisting to check the advance of these forces which seek to tighten the noose on the city from different directions. On the other hand the capital Aden was still suffering from shortages of drinking water and foodstuffs, the prices of which have skyrocketed dramatically, according to some Yemenis. Yemeni citizens interviewed by KUNA said that the price of a kilogram [kg] of potatoes has risen by five times its price before the outbreak of fighting between the north and the south, with one kg reaching 50 Yemeni riyals in the last two days. (One dollar is the equivalent of 12 riyals at the official exchange rate) An official in the government disclosed in Aden that former Algerian Foreign Minister Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the envoy of the UN secretary general, will meet with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, tomorrow or the day after at the latest in Mukallah. Ibrahimi is due to arrive in Sanaa today from Cairo at the start of a new mission to halt the fighting which has been going on in Yemen since 4 May. Ibrahimi's mission as the UN envoy begins in accordance with Security Council Resolution 924, which calls for an immediate cease-fire.
