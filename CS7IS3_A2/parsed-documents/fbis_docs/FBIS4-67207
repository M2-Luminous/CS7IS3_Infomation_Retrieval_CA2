Choking back tears, Gregory told the court her fellow Briton had promised to pay her £1,000 to act as a "mule" by smuggling 87 grams of heroin to Japan for him. She said he had bought the drugs which she was caught with at the city's airport last year. Sitting in leg-irons and a faded prison tunic, Lock, 30, who has denied all charges, watched the proceedings impassively. He was carrying no drugs when he was arrested with Gregory after they checked in with his girlfriend, Ruth Billingham, for a flight to Tokyo. Lock insists he was simply going on holiday to Japan with Billingham and met Gregory at the airport. But the court has previously heard that undercover narcotics agents at the British Embassy had tipped off Thai customs to watch out for Lock, whom they suspected of drug smuggling. Gregory, 28, of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorks, who faces a minimum 25 years in jail after pleading guilty, was found with the drugs hidden in her body in four condoms. After giving evidence for two hours she said from her cell: "I couldn't believe I was talking about myself. I can't believe I am in this position. "I did it because I needed the money to get back home. It sounded too good to be true and there was supposed to be no chance of getting caught." In her evidence she told her lawyer that Lock, who ran a jewellery business in Bangkok, came to her guesthouse a few hours before the flight last February and gave her the drugs. They had met previously to discuss the trip. Gregory, who had been teaching English in Bangkok for two years, told the court she was suffering from fever and wanted the money for a ticket home. Under cross-examination from Lock's lawyer, Khun Puttri, Gregory said she had only previously seen heroin in newspaper pictures. The lawyer focused on apparent discrepancies between her initial written statement and her testimony yesterday, most notably on how much money she claimed Lock was to pay her. The case, which has already lasted a year, was adjourned until May 16.
