The Corfu Council put another three building blocks in place in constructing post-Communist Europe. ``First, the Treaties of Accession signed with Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden will help create the wider Europe that we seek: a European Union [EU] that extends from the Atlantic to the Arctic. I warmly welcome the positive vote on accession in the recent Austrian referendum. I hope referenda in the other three EFTA countries this autumn will be equally successful. ``Second, we agreed in Corfu that the Association Agreements with our Central and East European partners must be fully and urgently implemented. So should the UK/Italian initiative to link these countries more closely with the foreign affairs and home affairs pillars. This will help them to prepare for full membership of the EU as soon as possible. Cyprus and Malta, too, will be involved in the next phase of enlargement. ``Third, the EU signed a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia -- one of the most comprehensive agreements ever concluded between the community and another country. President Yeltsin said the agreement symbolised Russia's return to the economic life of Europe as an equal partner. He also pledged the support of his government in bringing about stability in Central and East Europe and his willingness to work closely over former Yugoslavia. Russia has just signed the Partnership for Peace Agreement with Nato and on July 9 President Yeltsin will play a full part in the political debate at the Naples summit. I warmly welcome Russia's increasing integration with Western political institutions.'' Mr Major told the Commons: ``In the discussion of the problems facing people throughout Europe, I suggested a series of moves to combat drug trafficking and other international crime. The drugs problem throughout Europe is growing. Enough cocaine has been seized in the EU this year to provide 24 million individual doses. I pressed for more effective cross-border intelligence gathering on drug trafficking. I urged the community to strengthen the Europol drugs unit and to set up the full European Police Office quickly, with a wide remit to tackle organised cross-border crime. I underlined the importance of action within our own countries. I suggested that the Union should hold a conference on drugs and organised crime, and should involve countries in Central and East Europe. I was glad to receive wide support for these proposals, which were endorsed in the conclusions of the Council. ``We made progress on two economic issues high on the British agenda. ``First, we agreed that markets in telecommunications and energy should be further liberalised, to give Europe's consumers access to wider, cheaper and more efficient services. ``Second, we strongly supported the German proposal to set up a European Deregulation Task Force with businessmen as members, precisely as we have done in this country. This was agreed. The Task Force will help to cut back burdensome community regulations on business. ``The Council endorsed the macro-economic guidelines drawn up by the Economic and Financial Council on the conditions for sustainable growth. We agreed that it was essential to continue cutting public sector deficits and reducing inflation. ``I reported that the British economy had grown by nearly 3 percent in the year to this Spring, and that unemployment had fallen here by by over 300,000 since the end of 1992. Britain remains the fastest-growing of the big economies in the EU.'' Mr Major said: ``The Council approved a first priority list of 11 trans-European network projects. This includes the second Channel Tunnel rail link and proposals to improve the rail links between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Any contribution to the financing of such projects must come from within existing community resources. At our insistence, the Council agreed that there could be no financial guarantee from the community for trans-European networks. We believe that Europe's taxpayers must be protected against such open-ended commitments. ``We heard further evidence that the subsidiarity principle is being successfully implemented. We expect the number of main legislative proposals coming out of Brussels this year to be about half the number in 1993, and a quater of the total four years ago. This is a very significant improvement. ``In external policy, the Council discussed Ukraine and agreed to step up support for economic reform and nuclear safety there, tied to the closure of Chernobyl. This discussion will be taken forward with the United States, Japan and Canada at the Economic Summit in Naples in early July. ``The Council once again discussed Bosnia. The Contact Group has done valuable work based on the EU's plan; but there is an urgent need for the parties to show the will for a negotiated settlement if the process is to succeed. ``We agreed that the EU would make every effort with the United States and Russia to bring the negotiations to a point of decision.'' Mr Major told the House: ``Let me now turn to the presidency of the European Commission. The treaty lays down that the Commission President should be selected by `common accord' to serve a term of five years. Common accord is vital. For the President of the Commission to serve the whole Community effectively, he must enjoy the confidence and support of all of its members. ``Before the Corfu Council, we told the presidency and other partners that we supported Sir Leon Brittan's candidature; and believed that a genuine consensus of all 12 member states to be essential. No one disputed the necessity of a genuine consensus. ``When we heard that Mr Dehaene was thinking of putting himself forward at a late stage, we privately informed the Belgian Government and other partners that we could not support him. We warned that it would not be possible for him to attract a consensus of the whole community. We hoped, therefore, that his candidature would not be pressed. ``Neither then nor at any later stage did any partner say that either Sir Leon Brittan or Dr Lubbers, the two long-standing candidates, was unacceptable. Both, of course, had outstanding credentials and long experience of the community -- Sir Leon Brittan as a Commissioner for six years and Dr Lubbers from 12 years on the European Council. ``At the Corfu Council, four states -- representing nearly half of the community's EU population -- did not support Mr Dehaene in the long discussion on the first evening. In several interventions, I made our strong views very clear to the Council, as I had in a number of bilateral discussions. ``On the following morning, Sir Leon Brittan and Dr Lubbers decided to withdraw their candidatures. Other European countries indicated that they could accept Mr Dehaene. I maintained my position that we could not. I said that I had given the matter careful thought and that our decision would not change at any stage. I reiterate that position in this House today. I suggested that consultation should be put in hand to find a candidate who had the support of all. The German Chancellor, who takes over the presidency later this week, said he hoped to resolve the matter quickly, if necessary by convening a special summit on July 15.'' Mr Major insisted: ``Our position was not a personal criticism of Mr Dehaene, although in our view Sir Leon and Dr Lubbers had much stronger qualifications. For the next five years the Commission needs a President who is in tune with the times and the mood across Europe, a President whose instincts are with enterprise and competitiveness. Above all, Europe needs a President of the Commission selected with the full approval of all member states. ``The Corfu Council has highlighted an issue of increasing concern to many EU members -- that issue is the way in which decisions are reached. It is an important point of principle that the key decisions require unanimity and that all member states should have an equal opportunity to participate in collective decision-making. The procedures used for this decision, before and during the Council, were not satisfactory. ``There was no need for this matter to have come to an open division at a European Council. It should have been avoided. Had more comprehensive consultation taken place, as in the past, and had the views expressed by different states been heeded, it could have been avoided. ``I believe that there are a number of well-qualified people who could take on this post, on the basis of a genuinely common accord. We stand ready to play our part in consultations on it. There is no reason why this should not lead to an early and satisfactory outcome. ``I want Europe to succeed. I want it to regain the affections of the people of Europe. I want a Europe with which all member states -- soon to be 16, then 20 -- can feel comfortable. Achieving that may mean disputes along the way. But being a good European does not mean signing up to everything which our partners propose. At Corfu we fought for what we believe is in the best interests of this country and of Europe. That is what we will continue to do.''
