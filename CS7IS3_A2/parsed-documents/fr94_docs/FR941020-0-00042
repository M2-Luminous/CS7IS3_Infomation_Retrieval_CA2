FR941020-0-00042 FR941020-0-00012 Executive Order 12866 This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. Regulatory Flexibility Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. section 600 et seq., USEPA should prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. This partial approval/partial disapproval does not create any new requirements. Therefore, I certify that this action does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of the regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of the State action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base its final partial approval/partial disapproval of Ohio's Stage II vapor recovery program on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. USEPA , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976).
