The burial site at Qiryat Arba' is temporary, and his body will be moved eventually to the Jewish cemetery in Hebron. Speakers eulogizing Goldstein praised both the man and his actions. Mark Weiss was at the funeral: Eulogies were recited at the Shamgar funeral parlor in Jerusalem and at the yeshiva in Qiryat Arba', and the message at both venues was militant and uncompromising. Speakers praised the massacre as a selfless act committed on behalf of the Jewish people as a whole. The victims were described not as innocent worshippers, but as the people who stabbed innocent Jews and the descendants of the Hebron residents who murdered almost the entire Jewish population of the town in 1929. A million Arabs are not worth the fingernail of one Jew, said one of the speakers. We are all Goldstein, shouted one of the mourners at one stage. Again and again, the speakers denounced the government and the media, and above all the fact that an armed Palestinian police force is about to be established. All this, together with the fact that Dr. Goldstein had repeatedly treated the victims of Arab terror, combined to create a situation where he just couldn't take it any more. All the eulogizers said Goldstein should be praised as a righteous man. A few hundred people attended the eulogies in Jerusalem. Many hundreds more joined in at Qiryat Arba'. [passage omitted] For many other mourners, the most radical elements among the settlers, the funeral was an occasion to come together and express solidarity. And, that was definitely the feeling of a community under siege. There was intense hostility toward journalists, and much of the talk among the crowd was of a witch hunt and the possibility of informers planted within the settlements.
