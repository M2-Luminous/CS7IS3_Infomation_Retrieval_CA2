The companies that deal with Israel or help it in its war effort will remain on the boycott file and will make no unilateral decision to stop or cancel these dealings. The strange thing about this boycott is that the moods felt about it fluctuate. Those who used to dismiss the effectiveness of the boycott and claim that it had no real influence are now wondering about and revising their positions. Why all the fuss about the boycott? Why does the United States always take the initiative and ask that it be lifted? If this Arab boycott of Israel does not harm Israel's economy, why are there so many threats being issued by Zionist pressure groups? Those who used to underestimate and belittle the effectiveness of the boycott are suddenly waking up and monitoring the debate about it in the Arab and American arenas. They finally realize there is something to it. As the popular saying goes: There is no smoke without fire. The clouds of smoke are shielding the boycott. There is a fire--the boycott--to which the smoke led. Those who used to dismiss the effects of the boycott are now worried and acting to lift it. They insist that it be lifted. The conclusion is that the truth about the effectiveness of the boycott laws has not changed. Otherwise, what is the meaning of this action? First, a group of U.S. congressmen or members of parliament have rallied support for a draft project that asks the U.S. Administration to stop the contracts of any U.S. arms deals with any Arab country that fails to end its boycott of Israel. They are trying through every means of pressure to gain the support of other congressmen so that a majority will pass the draft project. They mean Saudi Arabia first, which has contracts with the United States to buy developed planes and missile launching pads plus many other things on the list that it needs to develop its Armed Forces, especially after the lessons it learned from the catastrophic Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and after the bitter experience of Desert Storm. The question is: If these people thought the boycott was useless, why do they have this aggressive stance on the Arab countries, most of which have distinguished relations with the United States? Why is Saudi Arabia the primary target of this threat? Is it because it encourages a just peace in the region? Or because, thanks to it, it has revived the U.S. weapons factories and prevented millions of workers and employees from losing their jobs so that they do not end up in the cesspits of unemployment and homelessness? Second, there is a saying that some U.S. Administration officials always repeat but that has become hollow and empty of any practical content. This saying is that taking such a step encourages Israel to assume positive positions in the course of the peace negotiations and to speed up the implementation of autonomy for Gaza and Jericho. Undoubtedly, time has proven the falsity and treachery behind this logic and that Israeli positions regarding the peace process remain governed by belligerence. Third, when Israel's friends found the Arabs were reluctant to speed up taking such a step before the aggressor forces ended their occupation of the Arab territories, they rallied around this issue from another angle using the pretext that the boycott has started to hamper and paralyze projects to build up the autonomy areas. When U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown arrived in Cairo as part of his visit to countries in the region, he made a point of visiting the Arab League and meeting its secretary general, Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al- Majid. This visit resulted in the start of a dialogue on ending the boycott. When the secretary general affirmed that the decision to boycott Israel was an Arab League Council decision, the U.S. commerce secretary took Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid's pulse on whether this issue could be discussed anew during a coming Arab League Council session. The secretary general wondered about the motives behind the question. The U.S. secretary replied that there are American companies that want to participate in implementing the reconstruction projects in the Gaza Strip. But the Arab boycott laws prevent them from carrying out this urgent mission--a pretext with logic. The response from the secretary general was: This issue is always on the Arab League Council's agenda. It automatically moves from one council to the other. It is listed on the agenda, naturally. Time bombs and fuses: Indeed, not all of these are the parties involved in the game of pressure to revoke the boycott laws. There are also the parties that hold the threads and play on the nerves of the Palestinian team in the talks to implement the self-government principles. The Jewish campaigns of pressure on U.S. President Clinton and his men are continuing. These pressures have two objectives. The first is to tell the world in general and the Arabs in particular: The solution for all crises is not in the hands of the U.S. Administration; it is in our own hands. The second is to hint to the same U.S. Administration that it stop making statements it cannot implement. Signs of this are: Following the working meetings between Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in the Swiss city of Davos, Peres' declaration that progress was made in this round of talks, and the U.S. reactions praising Peres when he arrived in Washington after the Davos talks, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin made remarks from which one understands that Peres did not have full authority during these talks and that concluding them requires several months, not one or two weeks. He then summoned the top officials in "the ruling military establishment in Tel Aviv," that is, the Israeli army's commanders, to solicit their views. He stated: We want first to ascertain three issues that require study. These are: The security issues. The border crossing points. The size of Jericho. From this, it appears that Israel has not spent almost three months arguing these three points. Clearly, and despite what is being said, Rabin stands by his word that he is seeking more from the Palestinian self-government principles than he is giving. By claiming the need to be assured of "Israel's security" guarantees, he wants to turn the border crossing points in Gaza and Jericho into outlets for tightening his grip on the Palestinians through search posts that enable Israel to tighten its police grip. And he wants to expand his presence in the self-government areas under the slogan of his right to provide all possible security means for the Jewish settlements in these areas. Israel thus wants to return to the old policy of occupation to make itself the government at the heart of the self-government authority. These are the real mines buried in the body of the Palestinian agreement. They will be like fuses that threaten all the self-government projects and interfere in its legitimate sovereignty over its national soil. The nearer the U.S. Administration moves toward taking positive steps to boost the negotiations on the peace tracks, the more intense the Jewish organizations' pressure on it become. Such campaigns have frequently forced the U.S. President to retract some of his decisions. Pressure was exerted to withdraw his nomination of Admiral Bobby Inman for the post of defense secretary on the pretext of his hostility to Israel. Nobody knows yet how successful the new campaigns to force the U.S. President to abandon his nomination of Strobe Talbot as assistant secretary of state on the pretext of his hostility to the Jews will be. Maintaining the boycott's rules has become an inevitable need until the Israeli Government complies with and implements the resolutions of international legitimacy, makes the resumption of the peace negotiations in Washington on 15 February the starting point for a solution to all the points of difference, and agrees with a joint timetable for the stages of its withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. The security guarantees for the various countries of the region lie in the implementation of Resolution 242, which enjoys the unanimous support of all countries, including Israel. Will it do so? I doubt it can join the "peace of the brave."
