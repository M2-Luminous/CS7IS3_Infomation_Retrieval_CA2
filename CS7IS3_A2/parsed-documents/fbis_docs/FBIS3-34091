Our colleague Rabah Hallis wrote an analytical paper on the issue, which will be read by Mokhtar Maher: Mr. Mourad Benachenhou, the economy minister, affirmed that Algeria's present problems center around continued inflation pressures and the increase in the unemployment level, especially among the youth, on the other. Prevailing over these problems call for an agreement with the IMF, because the continuation of the situation as it is would lead to the collapse of the whole of the production apparatus and the dismemberment of the social body. But the agreement with the IMF on a stable economic program does not mean that all the problems would be solved in a comprehensive manner, because the economic and social situation in Algeria is very complicated. Any violation of either of the social or economic balances could result in social and political dangers. The statements of the different officials confirm that Algeria is attempting to sign a politically and socially acceptable agreement. The main problem lies here. How could a compromise solution, between Algeria's demands of a politically and socially acceptable agreement, on the one hand, and the contents of the programs proposed by the IMF, on the other, be reached ? The contents of the programs that the IMF is calling for have a very high social cost, because in essence they restrain social demand and attempt to absorb the surplus, while Algeria knows a big increase in demand that is not matched by a supply which suffers from weaknesses in its structure. This means that the real average of income will noticeably fall. Would it therefore be possible to make this fall acceptable socially? Mr. Benhamouda's recent statements reveal that the General Union of Algerian Workers [UGTA] does not any more object to the idea of devaluing the dinar if the aim was to control inflation. This stance is considered new in the UGTA's thinking. Has Benhamouda been finally convinced that the continuation of the existing situation is more dangerous to the workers than signing a stable economic agreement with the IMF the main aim of which is to control the levels of unemployment and inflation?
