The revisions read as follows: Appendix A to Part 208_Capital Adequacy Guidelines for State Member Banks: Risk-Based Measure * * * * * III . * * * E. * * * 12. Calculation of credit equivalent amounts. a. The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance-sheet rate contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract in accordance with section III.E.5. of this appendix A is equal to the sum of (i) the current exposure (sometimes referred to as the replacement cost) of the contract; and (ii) an estimate of the potential future credit exposure over the remaining life of the contract. b. The current exposure is determined by the mark-to-market value of the contract. If the mark-to-market value is positive, then the current exposure is that mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market value is zero or negative, then the current exposure is zero. Mark-to-market values are measured in dollars, regardless of the currency or currencies specified in the contract, and should reflect changes in the relevant rates, as well as counterparty credit quality. c. The potential future credit exposure of a contract, including a contract with a negative mark-to-market value, is estimated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by a credit conversion factor. Banks should, subject to examiner review, use the effective rather than the apparent or stated notional amount in this calculation. The conversion factors are: ‚ê£ 1Remaining maturity 1Interest rate contracts (percent) 1Exchange rate contracts (percent) One year or less 0 1.0 Over one year 0.5 5.0 d. Examples of the calculation of credit equivalent amounts for these instruments are contained in Attachment V of this appendix A. e. Because exchange rate contracts involve an exchange of principal upon maturity, and exchange rates are generally more volatile than interest rates, higher conversion factors have been established for foreign exchange rate contracts than for interest rate contracts. f. No potential future credit exposure is calculated for single currency interest rate swaps in which payments are made based upon two floating rate indices, so-called floating/floating or basis swaps; the credit exposure on these contracts is evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market values. 3. Risk weights. Once the credit equivalent amount for an interest rate or exchange rate contract has been determined, that amount is assigned to the risk weight category appropriate to the counterparty, or, if relevant, to the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. 49 However, the maximum weight that will be applied to the credit equivalent amount of such instruments is 50 percent. 49 For interest and exchange rate contracts, sufficiency of collateral or guarantees is determined by the market value of the collateral or the amount of the guarantee in relation to the credit equivalent amount. Collateral and guarantees are subject to the same provisions noted under section III.B. of this appendix A. Collateral held against a netting contract is not recognized for capital purposes unless it is legally available to support the single legal obligation created by the netting contract. * * * * * 5. Netting. a. For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to the offsetting of positive and negative mark-to-market values in the determination of a current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit equivalent amount. Any legally enforceable form of bilateral netting (that is, netting with a single counterparty) of rate contracts is recognized for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount provided that:
