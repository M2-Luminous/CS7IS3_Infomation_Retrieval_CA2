The party has been describing al-Hariri's government in its statement as "murderer and killer." Although the official Lebanese stand is opposed to the agreement, similar to the Syrians', Hizballah was the only organization that chose to take the trouble to go out into the streets in order to proclaim its opposition. This has prompted President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri to wonder about whom this party is demonstrating against in Beirut streets since the government is already adopting the same stand the party itself is advocating. The timing of the demonstration was significant. The party called for the demonstration following the return of Shaykh Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah from one of his frequent visits to Tehran during which he met with Iranian President Rafsanjani and the leader of the Islamic revolution Ali Khamene'i. The party sources said that discussions during this visit dealt with coordinating stands with regard to the new situation the area is entering under the title peace with Israel on all fronts. This has led to many questions being raised regarding the role the party should be playing in Lebanon at this stage, and how far this role clashes with the Lebanese government which closely coordinates its stands with Syria's. Although Shaykh Fadlallah is called by party members "al-Sayyid" [master or lord], he does not have any official or organizational title. He introduces himself as a worker in the Islamic movement. Yet the great influence he wields in the broad intellectual field and the political and media contacts in Lebanon makes him the actual leader of the party whose secretary general is Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah. In his speeches and statements Shaykh Fadlallah rejects the coming peace and believes that if the Lebanese Government were to sign a peace agreement, its signature would be that of a government not recognized by its people. Therefore, whether the government signs an agreement or not is immaterial, because the people reject all that. Shaykh Fadlallah has close ties with Iran that date back to school days in al-Najaf where he established close ties with Khomeyni when he was in exile there. He also established contacts with Iranian leaders of various inclinations. In al-Najaf Fadlallah was taught by leading Shi'ah scholars including Ayatollah Montazeri, Muhsin al-Hakim, and Abu-al-Qasim al-Khu'i. When he returned to Lebanon in 1966, when the Shi'ah tide was not what it is today, he began his social activities in an easter Beirut suburb (Hay al-Nab'ah). After the inhabitants of the area were evacuated from there, he moved to the southern suburb where he is still there. Fadlallah was the target of an assassination attempt carried out by the CIA near his house in Harit Hurayk quarter, following the destruction of the Marines headquarters in Beirut. Hizballah was then accused of being the perpetrator. Fadlallah is 57 years old, was born in 'Aynata town in southern Lebanon. He is married with 11 children.
