The crux of the negotiations remains the need to increase the majority of the Freedom Alliance -- something that Silvio Berlusconi is trying to achieve by winning over the Italian Popular Party and Mario Segni's Pact for Italy in order to gain their support for the future government. Rocco Tolfa reports: [Tolfa] To the Center! To the Center! This is the litany of Silvio Berlusconi's men, who are desperately trying to put together a solid majority so that they can govern. Mario Segni has already said no. [Begin Segni recording] There are profound differences between ourselves and Silvio Berlusconi. His is a right-wing movement that was created with the direct support of the Italian Social Movement. It has an institutional and economic program that does not convince us in any way whatsoever, and so we certainly will not enter into, nor will we support a Berlusconi government. [end recording] [Tolfa] However, there is a cautious opening as far as institutional reform is concerned. [Begin Segni recording] We are asking for the same changes as Berlusconi on some points, in other words, voting over two rounds rather than one; antitrust laws to be brought in for a number of different sectors, above all as far as the mass media and private television stations are concerned; and in addition we are asking for the reorganization of RAI's shareholder syndicate. [end recording] [Tolfa] The door remains closed as far as economic policy is concerned; their policies would lead us to ruin, Segni said. On the other hand, Michelini, also from the Pact for Italy, has left the door open for Berlusconi. He wants to compare plans with Forza Italia. Roberto Formigoni from the Italian Popular Party has not ruled out an alliance with Berlusconi. [Begin Formigoni recording] If the positions, the proposals of the government were seen to be particularly clear as far as what we regard as important for the country is concerned, then we could decide on a technical abstention during votes. [end recording] [Tolfa] Opposition! Opposition! This is the cry of the Italian Popular Party's left wing. In this way, Berlusconi is dividing the remnants of what was for so long the white armada [against communism, i.e., the Christian Democrats].
