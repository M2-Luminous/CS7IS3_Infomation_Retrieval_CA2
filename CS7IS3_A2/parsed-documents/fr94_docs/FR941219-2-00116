Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Plan is defined contribution plan having 63 participants and total assets of $4,621,936 as of September 39, 1995.

The Department granted two previous exemptions (Prohibited Transaction Exemption (PTE) 82&hyph;9, 47 FR 2431, January 15, 1982 and PTE 87&hyph;77, 52 FR 29905, August 12, 1987) to permit loans (the Exempt Loans) by the Plan to the Employer. Under the terms of the exemption, the Plan could make loans on a recurring basis to the Employer for a period of five years. The proceeds from the Exempt Loans were used by the Employer for the purchases of machinery and equipment. Each Exempt Loan was collateralized by specific equipment and assets owned by the Employer. The maximum length of any Exempt Loan was 48 months, and the interest rate was one percent above the prime rate. The balance on total Exempt Loans did not exceed 25 percent of the fair market value of the Plan's assets. An independent fiduciary acted on behalf of the Plan and certified that each Exempt Loan was an appropriate investment for the Plan. The Trustee has confirmed that all payments of principal Loans were received by the Trustee on a timely basis and each Exempt Loan was paid in full in accordance with the terms of PTE 82&hyph;9 and PTE 87&hyph;77. 4. The Plan now proposes to make a series of Loans over a five year period to the Employer. The proceeds from the Loans will be used by the Employer to purchase the Equipment. Each Loan will be collateralized by a promissory note and security agreement which provide the Plan with a first lien on the Equipment. In addition, the Loan will be collateralized by specific equipment or assets which are owned by the Employer. At all times each Loan will be collateralized in an amount at least equal to 200 percent of the outstanding balance of such loan. The amount of each Loan will not exceed 80% of the purchase price of the Equipment excluding tax and transportation. In addition, Mr. Berdass will personally guarantee each Loan. The maximum length of any Loan will be 48 months and will have an interest rate of at least one percent above the prevailing prime rate of interest of the Trustee which is the prevailing interest rate earned on similar loans made by the Trustee to unrelated third parties. The outstanding Loan balance will not exceed 25 percent of the market value of the assets of the Plan. The Employer will adequately insure the Equipment and all other collateral against fire and all other relevant hazards with the Plan being named beneficiary of the insurance. 4.
