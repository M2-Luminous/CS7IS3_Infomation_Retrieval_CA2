It has been reported that the messages Ankara has conveyed to the EU countries at various levels can be taken to mean that the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] will unite with Turkey if the Greek Cypriot side is admitted into the EU as a full member. Turkey defends the view that the Greek Cypriot side becoming an EU member will mean the de facto annexation of south Cyprus to Greece. Meanwhile, a number of officials in Turkey have maintained that several points in UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report on Cyprus, which has elicited strong reaction in Turkey, can be justified. A Turkish Foreign Ministry official has said that the fact that Butrus Butrus-Ghali has agreed that the Cyprus problem has continued for 30 years is "a very positive development." The Greek Cypriots have maintained that the Cyprus problem was created as a result of Turkey's intervention in the island in 1974. Furthermore, Ankara has regarded Butrus-Ghali's view that "the limited UN resources may be used to resolve other disputes" as a positive suggestion.
