There were a total of six petitioners. The commission reviewed the complaints of five yesterday. So far, only one candidate--Gennadiy Gordiyenko--was granted registration after the city commission decided that the district commission had invalidated too many signatures without sufficient grounds. The refusal to register one contender, who collected part of the signatures outside of his district, was upheld. The review of other complaints has been moved to today. The commission will consider the claims of Konstantin Ivanov, whom the district commission has accused of bribing voters, as well as of Vladimir Radushnyy and Feliks Sagaydakov, with respect to whom the district commission has annulled a considerable number of signatures from the lists on the grounds of suspected falsification. The Electoral Commission Chairman Vladimir Fomichev reported that, by preliminary data, about 750 candidates will be in the running for 50 deputy seats in the City Assembly. Of them, 500 have been nominated by electoral coalitions, and the rest are running as independents. By profession, administrators, businessmen, and white collar workers comprise the greater part of contenders. The overwhelming majority are male.
