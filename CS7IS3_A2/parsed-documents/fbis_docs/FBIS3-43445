In a statement on Thursday, she said the reports in the SOWETAN and NATAL MERCURY on Wednesday were based on an incorrect interpretation of comments she had made at a news conference on Tuesday. Mrs. de Lille had said the PAC's armed wing, the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army, had temporarily suspended its armed struggle pending negotiations with the government and South African Defence Force on a mutual cessation of hostilities. She said further meetings to discuss the ending of hostilities could be held within the next two weeks.
