There is the same generosity and the same impetuosity, without which the PDS would never have been born. Achille Occhetto is certainly no conservative, either in politics or in his life. Nor has he ever been attached to power. He likes pure politics, he likes to challenge conservatism of every kind. This cultural, even more than political, attitude has enabled him to make difficult choices at the right time. To look back now over the years of his secretaryship causes a feeling of seasickness, inasmuch as the waves were high and the navigation difficult. And yet at times of great difficulty Achille Occhetto succeeded in making the right choice. Some examples? The response to the bloodthirsty events of Tienanmen, the decision to "remain within" the institutional referenda, and support for the Ciampi government. Indeed, he has never lacked that rare gift in politics, courage, the willingness to take personal risks. As he did in November 1989 when he took prime responsibility for a task of political innovation that would have frightened anyone -- the transformation of the PCI [Italian Communist Party] and the building of the PDS. Occhetto and his youthful leadership group in Rome and throughout Italy devoted their best energies to that task. The fact that there is now a strong left-wing force is due to that courageous choice. And in subsequent years Occhetto acted on the basis of a correct motivation -- to build a modern Left capable of uniting and capable of governing. The course that was pursued was not always straight; the fact that there is now a strong left-wing force is due to that courageous choice. And in subsequent years Occhetto acted on the basis of the right motivation -- to build a modern Left capable of uniting and capable of governing. The course that was pursued was not always straight; there were errors and delays. But it was the right course, in a rough sea. And major successes were scored on the basis of that motivation -- in the 1989 European elections, the referenda, the municipal elections. The last two elections, however, have revealed a major difficulty within the Left, an inability to interpret the demands for change and innovation. Of course, not all the responsibility lies with Occhetto. Nevertheless the PDS secretary has decided to facilitate the innovation of his party and of the Left with his gesture. But the main issue is not leadership. There are other more difficult, and certainly more worrying problems. For instance, how to initiate a process of genuine policy innovation, based on the ability to identify the major options of "innovation" on which to challenge the Right. I would cite, for instance, working hours and related issues, federalism, the regulations governing the media, and the strategic option for the so-called "information highways." Convergence must be developed between a government of the Left and a democratic Catholic center that must individually seek possible understandings on legislation and policy. The language and political forms of the Left must be rebuilt. The party must be reshaped, with a new and strong organizational network capable of inventing new forums for politics, new centers where citizens can gather according to their interests and professions. Finally, we must carry out our opposition to the right-wing government tactically -- not filibustering to prevent it from governing, but rather waging tough battle on issues and principles placed on the agenda by the progressive forces. That is no small matter. But it is urgently necessary, right away. If we want to grant the supporters of the Left and of the progressive forces new pride in their support and a new desire to win. Come what may, Achille Occhetto will contribute to this quest. This is a "difficult time" for me; there are ties that bind people who have lived through the same experiences and the same political situations. These ties are created by days spent together, difficult moments, disappointments, enthusiasms, difficult tests, and courageous decisions. Disputes and solidarity. Ties that are not easily broken.
