FR940317-2-00050 FR940317-2-00037 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION [FCC 94&hyph;27] EEO Policy Statement AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission (FCC). ACTION: Policy statement. SUMMARY: This Policy Statement establishes non-binding guidelines for assessing forfeitures for violations of the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) broadcast Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) rule. The EEO rule prohibits discrimination and requires affirmative action by broadcast stations in hiring. The new guidelines provide greater guidance to stations and the public about what sanction may result from different types of EEO violations. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roderick K. Porter at 202&hyph;632&hyph;6460. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Adopted: January 31, 1994; Released: February 1, 1994. By the Commission: Commissioner Quello issuing a statement. I. Introduction 1. In this Policy Statement, we establish non-binding guidelines for assessing forfeitures for violations of the Commission's broadcast Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) rules. 1 1 See 47 C.F.R. 73.2080. 2. The Commission's broadcast EEO rules and other policies which promote participation by minorities and women in the broadcast industry are vitally important. They further the Commission's goals of promoting diversity of programming on broadcast stations. See NAACP v. FPC, 425 U.S. 662, 670 n. 7 (1975); Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547 (1990) ( Metro ). And, as the Supreme Court has noted, ``[s]afeguarding the public's right to receive a diversity of views and information over the airwaves is *␣*␣* an integral component of the FCC's mission.'' Metro, 497 U.S. at 548. We reaffirm our commitment to this bedrock goal underlying our broadcast EEO rules and believe that the Policy Statement we adopt here will further achievement of that goal. 3. In addition to promoting program diversity, our broadcast EEO rules enhance access by minorities and women to increased employment opportunities. Increased employment opportunities are the foundation for increasing opportunities for minorities and women in all facets of the communications industry, including participation in ownership. 2 Those who have access to employment opportunities are able to develop experience and expertise that can be put to beneficial use in a variety of communications enterprises, in a variety of ways. Thus, by combating discrimination and other arbitrary barriers to employment, we contribute to the development of the broadcast industry and ultimately promote the further development of the broader communications infrastructure. 3 2 The Commission seeks to promote minority ownership of broadcasting facilities. See Commission Policy Regarding the Advancement of Minority Ownership in Broadcasting, 92 FCC 2d 849 (1982); Statement of Policy on Minority Ownership of Broadcasting Facilities, 68 FCC 2d 979 (1978). 3 We note, in this regard, that Section 309(j)(4)(C) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, directs the Commission to promote economic opportunity in competitive bidding among applicants proposing to use the spectrum ``by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants *␣*␣* including businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.'' II. Background 4. In 1989, Congress amended the Communications Act of 1934 to increase substantially the maximum dollar amounts of forfeitures the Commission could impose on broadcasters under Section 503(b) of the Act. 4 The Commission's forfeiture rule has been amended to reflect the higher forfeiture amounts. 47 CFR 1.80(b)(1). 4 Pub. L. No. 239, 101st Cong., lst Sess. 103 Stat. 2131 (1989) (amending, among other sections, 47 U.S.C. 503(b)). Amended Section 503(b) provides the Commission with authority to assess forfeitures of up to $25,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation against broadcasters, with a limit on forfeitures for continuing violations involving a single act or failure to act of $250,000 for broadcasters. 5. On August 1, 1991, in order to assist both the Commission and licensees in adjusting to the statutory increases, the Commission released its Policy Statement, Standards for Assessing Forfeitures (1991 Policy Statement). 5 The 1991 Policy Statement provided general, non-binding guidance regarding the assessment of forfeitures. It established base forfeiture amounts for a wide range of violations. For violations of broadcast EEO rules, the Commission set a base amount of $12,500. The 1991 Policy Statement also provided that the base forfeiture amount for any violation could be increased or decreased by applying adjustments to the base amount as relevant to the facts in any particular case. On August 12, 1993, the Commission released its most recent forfeiture guidelines. 6 Among other actions, the 1993 Policy Statement deleted the broadcast EEO violation category and indicated that the Commission would issue a further policy statement on broadcast EEO forfeiture matters at a later date. 7 5 6 FCC Rcd 4695 (1991), modified in part on recon., 7 FCC Rcd 5339 (1992), petition for review pending sub nom. USTA v. FCC, No. 92&hyph;1321 (DC Cir. filed July 30, 1992). 6 8 FCC Rcd 6215 (1993) petition for review pending sub nom. USTA v. FCC, No. 93&hyph;1526 (DC Cir. filed August 23, 1993) ( 1993 Policy Statement ). 7 Id. at n.1. The forfeiture amount for violations of the Commission's cable EEO rules is set at $500 per day by section 634 of the Act and is addressed in the 1993 Policy Statement.
