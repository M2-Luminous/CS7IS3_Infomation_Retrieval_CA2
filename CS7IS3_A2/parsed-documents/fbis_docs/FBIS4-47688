FBIS4-47688 "drafr084_cs94010" FBIS-AFR-94-084-S Daily Report 1 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IFP Leads in Natal IFP Leads in Natal MB0105195594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1902 GMT 1 May 94 MB0105195594 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Report by Greg Arde] [Text] Durban May 1 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] was leading the election race in Natal on Sunday [1 May] evening but the rival African National Congress was optimistic that its support would reflect well when counting ended in the province, conservatively estimated to be late Monday. IFP spokesman Peter Smith said his party was tentatively optimistic at 8 PM Sunday, when he said 20 percent of the Natal vote had been counted. On Sunday afternoon the IFP had at least 60 percent support. By 7 PM the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said that while the IFP had only gained just under four percent of the national vote counted at that time, the party led in Natal. In KwaZulu/Natal the IFP had 81,459 votes (54.6 per cent) and ANC 32,976 (22.1), the IEC said. At 7 PM Sunday over 1,000 counting officials were queuing at Durban's Expo Centre in preparation for their 12-hour shift. A third of Natal's votes are expected to be counted there. Earlier reconciliation of ballot boxes there was delayed because of a dispute over pirate voting stations, which were allegedly operated in Natal. The IEC said it was investigating the issue, and reports had been submitted for consideration by the commission in its assessment of whether the elections were free and fair. By noon on Sunday the IEC said counting was on track at most stations in the province, but the results were only expected in 36 hours -- if there were not any major hitches in the process. Meanwhile, the ANC's election co-ordinator in southern Natal, Mr Nhlanhla Ngidi conceded that early indications did not give his party a good showing. "As of now we are not doing very well, the IFP lead is about 50 percent. But I think we are steadily going to rise. We expect a lot of votes in mainly urban areas and in southern Natal," he said. "Voting appears to have generally gone along racial lines and we are planning to get a majority among Africans," Mr Ngidi said, adding that the National Party and the IFP appeared to have won the support of minorities. But, he noted, only 100,000 votes had been counted in Natal, of an ANC estimated 4.5 to 6 million voters. The IFP's Mr Smith said: "Until you start reaching a far higher percentage it's difficult to draw conclusions, but it looks like we're on a winning streak." He said the IFP would probably be "neck and neck" with the ANC in urban townships of Natal. The IEC reports that counting in certain smaller rural stations in Natal like Babanango and Pongola was completed on Sunday. Counting at the bigger stations was on Sunday night still continuing at a steady rate. It's acknowledged that the outcome in these areas could dramatically affect the final Natal result.
