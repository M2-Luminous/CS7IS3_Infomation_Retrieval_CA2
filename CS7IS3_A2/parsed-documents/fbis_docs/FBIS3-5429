Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad said that in this way the BN will be able to ensure that each communal group has a responsibility for bringing Sabah into a new era. We feel that this is a sincere effort by the BN to stand up for the people of Sabah so that they will not constantly be mired in narrow communal politics full of deceptive personal interests. We agree that the country's success up to now has been because of, among other things, leaders who are not only capable and dedicated, but who are also sincere and honest in serving the people. In truth, there is nothing worse for a country than having leaders who are greedy for power for the sake of personal interests. Beginning with the Alliance and continuing through the BN, our success in overcoming communal problems is because of a spirit of cooperation among leaders and party members representing various communal groups. Such tolerance and consensus can resolve any problem and create political stability for developing Malaysia. We believe that if this concept had not been introduced and nurtured, Malaysia would have been multicommunal country facing frequent disturbances. As a result, every citizen of this country would have been left behind by the development process. We are sure that the Sabah United Party (PBS) will use Dr. Mahathir's guarantee to inflame the sentiments of the people of Sabah, particularly the Kadazan community. That is the normal political practice of the PBS when under pressure, but we believe the people of Sabah have discernment. Their evaluation of the BN is not merely at election time, but they look at its "track record" throughout the era of its governance since the days of the Alliance. The BN's concept is measured by its success. The BN has proved its ability to unite a multiracial people and manage the country's economy efficiently and wisely. For us, there is no alternative to the BN. This is because the pact among its parties is constant and lasting, unlike the confusion of pacts among opposition parties that are made only when elections take place. Afterwards, they scatter to themselves and their differences. The failure of pseudopacts among opposition parties is because their leaders are not honest and are interested in their own pockets. This disease has clearly spread to Sabah. What we see are former USNO [United Sabah National Organization] leaders conspiring with the PBS. In order to have power, they are willing to try to win the hearts of the people, even though, having left the BN, they are forced to ride the PBS symbol in this election. This situation is very different from that of the BN. Because we believe that the interests of the people are above everything, we do not object to compromise. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was willing to pull its candidate to make way for the Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP) to run as an assurance that the Sabah Chinese community will be cared for. Similarly, the MCA [Malaysian Chinese Association] adhered to the BN concept and was willing not to run, although SAPP had not yet been accepted into the BN. All these things were done because of the realization that politics for the sake of one communal group, one party, or one group of leaders will not last. It is the opinion of those parties that PBS leaders manipulate the Chinese community, not for the sake of the Kadazans, but for their own interests. The BN will always adhere to this principle of tolerance, because if we bow to an individual or a group, the BN will face destruction. For us, the victory of the BN in this election is very important for the sake of restoring Sabah's economic excellence and the advancement of its people. We admit that there are sometimes "minor ripples" in the BN, but they do not hurt it. On the contrary, its situation is further strengthened when a problem is resolved in a spirit of solidarity. What is even more important is that all communal groups must try to increase unity and understanding. Although it is difficult for us immediately to eliminate the identity of a particular communal group and replace it with the sense of a single nation, we must not inflame communal spirit, which would bring tension to the country's political and social climate. We need to remember that all communal groups can together obtain greater benefit from national stability than from a single communal group's seizing everything for itself. Therefore, there is no reason why the citizens of the Peninsula, Sabah, and Sarawak should fail in jointly achieving greater success for a brighter future.
