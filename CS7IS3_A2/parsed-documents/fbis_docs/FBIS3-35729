Those who have left accounted for 60 percent of air crews of the Belarus Air Force, the RESPUBLIKA government newspaper reports today. The Belarus Airborne Assault Troops have also been considerably weakened by the mass exodus to Russia: 339 officers have joined the Russian forces. The republic's Committee for the Social Protection of Servicemen reports that a further 2,500 officers want to go to Russia. The problem is made worse by the fact that over half the Belarus men graduating from Russian military colleges in 1994 have already signed up to serve in its' Armed Forces. The main reason for this is that a higher level of social guarantees are enjoyed there.
