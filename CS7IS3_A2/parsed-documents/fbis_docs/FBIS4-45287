Dinar [National Narcotics Directorate] and the Paraguayan branch of the DEA are participating. A cocaine processing laboratory was destroyed near the Paraguayan border, some 40 km from Gabino Mendoza. It is presumed that another laboratory is located somewhere on Paraguayan territory. Several cars that had been stolen in Paraguay were found in a sales lot owned by Bolivian drug traffickers. The Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) broke up one of the most powerful international drug trafficking networks. The network was based in San Matias, some 180 km southeast of Santa Cruz, and included Brazil and Paraguay. The FELCN also localized and destroyed a clandestine cocaine laboratory near the Paraguayan border. The FELCN operation, which included the assistance of DEA agents, began on 24 May. The Special Forces raided various cattle stations, shops, and car sales lots, particularly those selling Japanese cars which were presumably stolen in Paraguay. A laboratory was found south of the Parapiti River, some 40 km from the Paraguayan border. At the time of the raid the laboratory was processing 84.5 kg of cocaine base and 800 grams of "angel dust." The laboratory was owned by brothers Mario Enrique, alias "Quique," and Luis Alberto Arteaga Seleme, alias "Pelon." Once refined, the drugs were transported to San Matias, where they were prepared for shipment to Brazil (Corumba cartel) and Paraguay. The drugs were also shipped by air through the Chaco region, entering Asuncion from different directions. According to official reports these operations involved Paraguayan antinarcotics forces--possibly Dinar. This association made possible the capture of the individuals responsible for carrying the drugs to Brussels (Belgium) and Madrid (Spain) for distribution on the European market, where prices are higher than in the United States. Stolen Utility Vehicles On 25 May the FELCN raided the "Autoshoping" [as published] car sales lot located at the corner of San Aurelio and Segundo Anillo Avenues in Santa Cruz. The police found several Japanese-made four-wheel-drive utility vehicles that had presumably been stolen in Paraguay and paid for with cocaine. In the yard, owned by "Quique" and "Pelon" Arteaga Seleme, the police seized two Mitsubishi Montero utility vehicles, one jeep of the same maker, various Honda vehicles, one new Toyota minivan, and other vehicles. The police seized a total of 15 vehicles in the yard. The confiscations continued at other premises owned by the brothers Arteaga Seleme and their partners, the brothers Wilfredo, Robin, and Ruan Rosales Agreda. The police also raided the premises owned by a well-known high society family, the Pedraza Ribera family. The FELCN and the DEA also seized a "Beechcraft Bonanza" light plane, equipped with a single engine BE-36, and with license number CP-854. In the plane the police arrested Mario "Quique" Arteaga Seleme, who was carrying thousands of dollars in a sack, and another five individuals whose identities were not revealed. The operation continues, and NOTICIAS will today receive more information about it.
