ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) proposes to amend the regulations for the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), child care serving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) families, the Transitional Child Care program (TCC), and At-Risk Child Care program. The purpose of this proposal is to support States, Territories and Tribes in their efforts to increase the availability and quality of federally-subsidized child care, develop more coordinated delivery systems, and improve child care opportunities for families, providers and communities. The proposed rule is presented in a single package because of our intent to remove regulatory barriers to program coordination, to increase flexibility across the four programs, and to promote common goals. The proposed rule addresses certain key areas of mutual concern for operation of these programs: Accessibility to higher quality care through amended payment rates; adaptation of payment policies for children with special needs as a result of the Americans with Disabilities Act; impact of the Fair Labor Standards Act and other Federal and State statutes on in-home care; and deletion of provisions, known as the effects test, which may be construed as minimizing regulatory protection for children in care concerning State implementation of health and safety standards.
