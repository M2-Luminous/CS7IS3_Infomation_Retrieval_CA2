FR941202-0-00082 FR941202-0-00010 (ii) Demonstrate that their solvent cleaning machine can achieve and maintain an idling emission limit of 0.10 kilograms per hour per square meter (0.021 pounds per hour per square foot) of solvent/air interface area as determined using the procedures in ยง63.465(a) and appendix A to this part. (2) Each owner or operator of a new in-line cleaning machine shall comply with the requirements specified in either paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section. (i) Employ one of the control combinations listed in table 4 of this subpart or other equivalent methods of control as determined using the procedure in ยง63.469, equivalent methods of control section. Table 4._Control Combinations for New In-Line Solvent Cleaning Machines 1Option 1Control combinations 1 Superheated vapor, freeboard refrigeration device. 2 Freeboard refrigeration device, carbon adsorber. 3 Superheated vapor, carbon adsorber. Note: Unlike most of the control techniques available for complying with this rule, carbon adsorbers are not considered to be a pollution prevention measure. Use of such units may impose additional cost and burden for a number of reasons. First, carbon adsorption units are generally more expensive than other controls listed in the options. Second, these units may present cross-media impacts such as effluent discharges if not properly operated and maintained, and spent carbon beds have to be disposed of as hazardous waste. When making decisions about what controls to install on halogenated solvent cleaning machines to meet the requirements of this rule, all of these factors should be weighed and pollution prevention measures are encouraged wherever possible.
