According to the latest press reports, not only the chief but also leading functionaries of the North Rhine-Westphalian land association were involved "in crimes and the covering up of crimes." The reports are based, among other things, on a comprehensive dossier from the Duesseldorf Interior Ministry. According to it, several documents seized from Republikaners prove that the right-wing extremists "discussed" behind closed doors "the potential origin, accomplices, or prevention of the clarification of crimes." One North Rhine-Westphalian functionary, among others, is suspected of having planned and, together with others, carried out the arson attack in Bergheim-Zieverich. In addition, the dossier reportedly also contains indications of further "readiness for violence" of the right-wing extremists. These include one "mock execution" by two members of the Muehlheim district Republikaner, which caused the death of a Turk with a heart condition. Schoenhuber, Mr. Clean, is getting into a dubious light because, like the land association, he reportedly knew about the events in North Rhine-Westphalia, but did not do anything about it. TAGESSPIEGEL bases its report on a former member of the Republikaner, who claims to have sent corresponding minutes to Schoenhuber and repeatedly phoned Schoenhuber's office, calling on the party chairman to expel the accused party colleague and contact the police. Schoenhuber denies it. Schoenhuber's attempt to present his party as extreme right wing but still conforming to the Constitution and to separate it from those rightist parties that are clearly hostile to the Constitution threatens to fail in other respects, too. Not only parts of the German People's Union (DVU), but also the neo-Nazis of the National List (NL) are calling for active election support for the Republikaner. Says an NL strategy paper: "If Schoenhuber gets about 30 deputies into the Bundestag with perhaps 5 percent, there will be some `deviants from the right' among them. Having only one single (autonomous) ultra-radical-nationalist deputy there would be a similar advantage for the `National Opposition' as Christian Democratic Union Deputy Krause, who has changed over to the Republikaner." In Saxony the Office for the Protection of the Constitution now uses intelligence service means to monitor the Republikaner and has noticed that leading Republikaner cooperate with neo-Nazis. This was announced by CDU Interior Minister Eggert on Wednesday [13 April]. Nine of the 16 laender are now using intelligence service means against the Republikaner.
