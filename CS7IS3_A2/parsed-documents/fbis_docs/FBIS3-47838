Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, told reporters the coalition will resume bargaining with the LDP over the package of four bills designed to revamp Japan's electoral system for the House of Representatives and alter political fund-raising methods. Ichikawa made the remarks minutes after Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the main opposition LDP, told a news conference that the ruling coalition should accept three out of the 10 demands it had put forward to the coalition Monday. The first of the three demands calls for increasing the number of single-seat lower chamber constituencies from the government-proposed 274 to 280 out of a proposed 500-seat chamber, while reducing the number of seats to be appropriated under proportional representation to 220 from 226. The second is for splitting up a proposed nationwide proportional representation constituency for the 220 seats into several regional electoral blocs. Political analysts say many LDP legislators fear the package might force them to run in alien constituencies located far from their home based electoral districts where they have a well-cultivated network of supporters. The third demand calls for authorizing business firms to hand over donations to the fund-raising organizations of individual politicians by dropping the proposed legal requirement to unify fund-raising channels into a political party. In contrast, the government-proposed bill would obligate potential corporate donors to give money to a political party, which would then be entrusted with distributing the money to individual politicians. Mori said, "If the LDP and the coalition could strike a broad agreement to accept the three demands, including the bloc-based proportional representation constituency, the two camps would have to work out, in a next Diet session, the details of modifications that may not be hammered out due to technical and time constraints." Mori said the LDP leadership would instruct its legislators to vote for the government-proposed package in Wednesday's vote in a crucial committee of the House of Councillors, if the coalition accepted the three demands. The LDP wants to finalize the details of the compromise deal in a proposed summit between LDP President Yohei Kono and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, expected to take place Wednesday, LDP sources said. The coalition decided to resume bargaining with the LDP in view of a growing number of dissident socialist legislators who have remained adamant in rejecting the Social Democratic Party (SDP) leadership's calls to vote with the coalition, Diet sources said. The SDP is the largest in the seven-party coalition. Political analysts predicted that if more than 10 SDP legislators voted against the reform package in the 252-member upper chamber, the package could be rejected. The coalition has only a slim majority. The coalition also fears that if it agrees to give too much ground to the LDP, it might antagonize the SDP legislators who have called for minimizing the number of seats to be contested at single-seat constituencies, the sources said. Meanwhile, the leaders of the coalition partners decided to try to strike a compromise by arranging a meeting between Juro Saito, chief of the group of the LDP's upper chamber legislators, and Manzo Hamamoto, Saito's SDP counterpart, coalition officials said. If necessary, the officials said, the coalition will seek to reconcile differences that may remain unresolved even by the Saito-Hamamoto talks, by arranging another bargaining session between Mori and Ichikawa or even the summit between Hosokawa and Kono. The coalition leaders also confirmed that they will not scrap their own parliamentary schedule of trying to push the package through the upper chamber committee on Wednesday, whatever developments might occur at these forums for a compromise. They said the coalition will try to push the package through the plenary session of the upper chamber by Friday.
