Commenting on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's idea of introducing the national welfare tax, Mori stated: "The goal of the financial authorities is to increase the consumption tax. That counters our demand that income tax reductions be implemented to stimulate the slumping economy. The proposed rate of 7 percent for the welfare tax means the government will make clear gains after stop-gap national bonds are reimbursed." The LDP secretary general thus expressed his opposition to the idea of introducing a national welfare tax. Regarding the procedure for deciding on the new tax plan, Mori severely criticized the government stance, saying: "The problem is the government is being led by the Ministry of Finance. We see the weakness in deciding on the policies of the Hosokawa administration which fails to assert that the consumption tax should not be increased at the expense of implementing tax reductions." On the LDP's future policies toward the Hosokawa administration, Mori said: "At the recent meeting with Prime Minister Hosokawa, Kono did not accept the prime minister's call for holding such meetings repeatedly." Thus he denied the possibility of taking a cooperative line with the coalition administration. At the same time, Mori said: "Boycotting the Diet sessions last time did not prove to our advantage, and we have lost trust in the LDP. Taking the stance of opposing all policies and fighting against them is inappropriate." Mori stressed that the LDP would take a free and unbiased stance depending on the policies, while maintaining a certain distance from the coalition administration for the time being.
