Experts say that the increasing forests greatly helped improve the local ecological and living environment as the coverage rate grew from 12.9 percent to 28.7 percent during the past four decades. A leading industrial province in China, Liaoning has one of the highest proportions of urban population among China's provinces. However, great efforts have been made to grow and protect the forests, whose acreage has risen from 1.87 million ha to 4 million ha. Officials from Liaoning Afforestation Bureau said that a total of two million ha of forests has been growing in the mountain areas in the eastern part, which protects about 80 percent the sources of water supply in the central industrial part of the province. Major reservoirs like the Dahuofang, which supplies water for Shenyang and other leading industrial centers in the area, contain the lowest level of sand among China's large reservoirs because of the protection of forests. In the western part of the province, which used to be plagued by soil erosion and sandstorms, large numbers of trees and shelterbelts have been planted since 1978. As a result, rainfall increased by 30 percent and the amount of sand borne in water decreased drastically. In addition, the groundwater table rose in some areas by three to four meters. Areas around such major cities as Chaoyang, Jinzhou and Fuxin, which used to import a large amount of grain, have been turned into rich land and grain has begun to be exported. Forests-protecting farmland in the plains also increased to 67,000 ha. Experts say they are protecting a total of 1.33 million ha of farmland. Experiments have proved that shelterbelts can reduce wind speed by 27 percent and improve the earth temperature by 1.7 degrees centigrade. Another one million ha of forests in the coastal areas have also greatly reduced the damage from the sea winds, experts say.
