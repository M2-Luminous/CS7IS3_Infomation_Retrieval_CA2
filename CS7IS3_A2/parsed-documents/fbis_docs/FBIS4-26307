Su Chi, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, criticized the mainland's handling of the case, calling it "improper." He said many suspicious aspects about the case have not been resolved. A news release issued by the mainland's Hangzhou Intermediate People's Court said Wu Lihong, Yu Aijun and Hu Zhihan, who were convicted last week for robbing and setting fire to the tourists and crewmen, were executed at 10:30 A.M. Sunday. The intermediate court sentenced the trio to death for robbery and murder on June 12. The Hangzhou High Court approved the death sentences Saturday. Many family members of the Taiwan tourists killed in the disaster insisted that the crimes could not have been committed by only three people, adding that the case is not likely to ever be resolved now that the three men have been executed.
