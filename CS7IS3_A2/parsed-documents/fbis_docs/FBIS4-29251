The current food situation is getting worse than ever before, causing dire social and political problems. Statistics show that the world's grain output has diminished each year. In the past 8 years the world's per capita grain output has decreased by 8 percent on the average. It plummeted sharply last year in particular. According to an estimate by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization [FAO], the world's grain output in 1993 fell 3.5 percent from the 1992 level. The drop in the grain output is not limited to any one country, region, or continent, but it is becoming a global phenomenon. Last year the grain output fell sharply in major grain producing countries in particular. In 1993 the U.S. corn output fell 54 million tons from the preceding year, and in Russia the grain output dropped by 6.8 million tons in the same period. Japan's 1993 rice output was 25 percent below the 1992 output, registering the lowest level since the end of World War II. In the Sevilla area in Spain the rice output dropped by one-third last year. The situation in Africa is the same. Some African countries are producing only less than half of the amount of grain needed. With the annual grain output diminishing each year, the world's total grain stock has shrunk to critical proportions. The world's current food reserve is estimated at only 17 percent of the total demand, the lowest point in 10 years. The worldwide food shortage is creating a tragedy in which a countless number of people are dying from starvation. Since early this year quite a few countries have asked for emergency food aid to tide over their food shortage. Reportedly, 46 countries currently need 4.5 million tons of food aid for their hungry children and women. According to statistics, currently 1.5 billion people go hungry worldwide, and children suffering from malnutrition number 200 million. Each year more than 20 million people die from starvation. In developing countries 550 million people are on the verge of starvation, the number of deaths from hunger reaching between 13 and 18 million. In Africa, 80 million people are in the immediate danger of starvation. One in every three Africans is suffering from malnutrition. The hunger in capitalist countries is also serious. In the United States more than 30 million people go hungry. The number of hungry people is also increasing in the former Soviet Union now under capitalism and in East European countries as well. The food shortage is causing social disorder and confusion, and even political crises, in a number of countries. There are several reasons for the worsening food situation. First, because of the inadequate soil conservation and management, a lot of farmland has been made unfit for farming or washed away by the floods. Statistics show that in the past 10 years 150 million hectares of tropical forests have disappeared worldwide. This decrease in the forest acreage has caused a serious flood and drought damage and a massive washing away of arable land. Each year 6 million hectares of land is turning into a desert worldwide. Each year 9 million hectares of arable land becomes unfit for farming because of the poor fertility of the soil. Another reason for the diminishing grain output is the inadequate irrigation. The total acreage of world's arable land is 1,475,420,000 hectares. Of this total only 15 percent is under irrigation. The acreage under irrigation is less than 2 percent in the sub-Saharan Africa. According to agricultural experts, water-related problems, such as drought, flood, and contaminated underground water, account for 80 percent of the damage to the growth of farm crops in developing countries. Even a slight drought causes a serious damage to the crops in unirrigated areas and ruins the farming. In some parts of the Middle and Near East and Africa, the farm output has been minuscule because of the perennial drought. Another reason for the failure to increase the farm output is related to the low level of scientific and technological knowledge of the rural population. The question of boosting production depends in no small measure on the ability of the people directly involved. But in most countries in the world the general level of knowledge of the rural population is very low. There are 948 million illiterate adults worldwide, and most of them live in rural areas. Incessant conflicts and armed clashes arising in many countries in the world are also causing serious losses to farm production. Numerous farmers abandon their devastated land to escape from the bloodshed, and a considerable acreage of farmland is diverted to the construction of military facilities. There is a little prospect for improving the world food situation in the foreseeable future. The FAO warns that unless there is a drastic change in agricultural production, humanity would face a far more "serious food shortage" in the year 2000. The current food crisis which is threatening the very existence of humanity must be overcome.
