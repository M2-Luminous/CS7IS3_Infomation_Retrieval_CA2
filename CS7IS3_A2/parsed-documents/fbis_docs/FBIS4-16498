In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX Hryb said it was impossible to amend the fundamental law on the first day after its introduction, if it cost the national legislature more than two years of hard work to phrase it. On 15 April Hryb and Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich met in Moscow with Russian head of government Viktor Chernomyrdin. They agreed, said Hryb, that Article 5 of the merger agreement would be amended in keeping with the Belarusian Constitution. Under Article 5, the assets and liabilities of the National Bank of Belarus make part of the assets and liabilities of the Central Bank of Russia. That lays a groundwork for the merger of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. On 12 April, Stanislav Bogdankevich of the Belarusian Bank agreed to sign the merger agreement only if the objections in principle against Article 5 were taken into consideration. He said that under Belarus' new constitution the National Bank emerged as the central bank of a sovereign country. Hryb also opposed Kebich's proposal for a nationwide referendum on the merger of thee Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. In Hryb's view, a referendum would confuse the Belarusians. The decision to call a referendum rested exclusively with the Belarusian parliament. Hryb made it clear that his objections were not intended to spark a conflict between himself and Kebich, let alone a conflict between the Legislative and Executive Branches of power. What he said should not be seen in the context of a new electoral campaign.
