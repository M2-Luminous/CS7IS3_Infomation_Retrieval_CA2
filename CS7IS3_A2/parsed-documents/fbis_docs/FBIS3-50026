Slovak Television reported that Kovac today received the organizers of the January 8 meeting of elected representatives of the Hungarian ethnic minority from southern Slovakia in Komarno, south Slovakia, which was initiated by the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny Ostrov (ZMOZO). Originally it was said that the Komarno meeting would declare autonomy in southern Slovakia and elect a 100-member assembly. Eventually, the meeting decided to push for the minority's demands in the Slovak Parliament. Some 560,000 ethnic Hungarians live in Slovakia, most of them in the south. They constitute 11 percent of the country's population. Kovac's Spokesman Anton Bodis said that Kovac would comment on the resolutions from the meeting, which he obtained today, after he had thoroughly studied them. The meeting called for collective rights of the Hungarian minority to be embedded in the Slovak Constitution, and demanded that the Hungarians be allowed to use their language in official contact at any place where they make up at least one-tenth of the population, that they be represented in state bodies and public institutions proportionately to their number, and that they be allotted a relevant share of the state budget.
