A Jewish immigrant arbitrarily fired at Palestinians who were saying morning prayers in Hebron, on the west bank of the Jordan River. Some 50 persons were killed and some 300 persons were injured in the crime committed by the Jewish person. This awful massacre is an act of violent terrorism against Palestinians and deliberate provocation to create an artificial obstacle to the ongoing Middle East peace process. We severely denounce the massacre by Israeli extremists [kuktan punja] as a grave crime. This tragic incident at a mosque on the Jordan River's west bank is a direct consequence [chikchopchok hugwa] of Israel's occupation policy. It shows that Palestinian's cannot remove the element of danger from their lives nor free themselves from their miserable lot, unless Middle East issues, including the Palestinian problem, are resolved. In order to guarantee durable peace in the Middle East, Israel must withdraw from the occupied Arab lands, and Middle East issues must be resolved in a fair and comprehensive way [kongjonghago pogwalchoguro] in the interests of the people in the region. Israeli authorities must punish those responsible for murdering and wounding innocent Palestinians and must take steps to help the victims. At the same time, they must ensure that no act contrary to the Middle East peace process is conducted. We will continue to send our active support and firm solidarity to the just struggle of the Palestinian people and the entire Arab people to restore their legitimate national rights and to accelerate the peace process in the Middle East.
