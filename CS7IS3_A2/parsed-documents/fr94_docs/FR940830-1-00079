FR940830-1-00079 FR940830-1-00012 D. E.O. 12612, Federalism NHTSA has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612 and has determined that the proposals in this notice do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. No state laws would be affected. E. Civil Justice Reform These proposed amendments would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103(b), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state or political subdivision of a state may prescribe or continue in effect a standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of a motor vehicle only if the standard is identical to the Federal standard. However, the United States Government, a state or political subdivision of a state may prescribe a standard for a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment obtained for its own use that imposes a higher performance requirement than that required by the Federal standard. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. A petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings is not required before parties may file suit in court. V. Comments Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the amendments proposed in this rulemaking action. It is requested but not required that any comments be submitted in 10 copies each. Comments must not exceed 15 pages in length (49 CFR 553.21). This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in concise fashion. Necessary attachments, however, may be appended to those comments without regard to the 15-page limit. If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, 3 copies of the complete submission including the purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA at the street address shown above, and 7 copies from which the purportedly confidential information has been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the information specified in 49 CFR 512, the agency's confidential business information regulation. All comments received on or before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal will be considered, and will be available to the public for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after the closing date. To the extent possible, comments received after the closing date will be considered. Comments received too late for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. Comments on the proposal will be available for public inspection in the docket. NHTSA will continue to file relevant information in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue to monitor the docket for new material. Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments the docket supervisor will return the postcard by mail.
