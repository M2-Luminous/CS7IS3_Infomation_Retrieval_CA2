The concentration of oxygen at the combustion temperature was controlled because of the attraction of oxygen to a magnetic field. NIMC plans to study applications of this technology to internal-combustion engines including turbines, hoping to be able to eventually develop a universal technology for increasing combustion efficiency. Atmospheric oxygen is a magnetic material that is attracted to a magnet. In contrast, atmospheric nitrogen, which accounts for 80 percent constituent of the atmosphere, is hardly affected by a magnet. Based on these facts, NIMC controlled combustion by burning fuel where only oxygen can be constantly supplied with the aid of a magnetic field created by an electromagnet or a permanent magnet. NIMC carried out combustion experiments in air with a platinum catalyst and checked variations in the combustion temperature. A 1 x 2 cm piece of asbestos was placed between the N and S poles of an electromagnet, more specifically, near the end of the magnet where the magnetic field strength changes suddenly. This is the place that is said to be most suitable for promoting combustion with oxygen's circulation activated by the magnet's attraction. A constant amount of fuel, butanol or gasoline, was fed to the asbestos piece with the attached platinum catalyst from the side that is within a magnetic field. Oxygen was introduced from the other side (no magnetic field) of the asbestos piece. The combustion temperature was measured at a point 70 cm away from the asbestos piece. As a result, it was discovered that gasoline, which burned at 440�C prior to the application of a magnetic field now burned at 480�C with the magnetic field, showing a 10 percent increase in combustion temperature. In the case of butanol, a 30 percent increase in combustion temperature was reportedly observed. At NIMC, Chief Researcher Nobuko Wakayama says, ``It appears possible to use a magnetic field to improve combustion efficiency.'' She adds that in the future, attempts will be made to apply the technology to chemical reactions including electrolysis and oxidation-reduction processes, and combustion under microgravity. Although there had hardly been any precedent of practical application of a magnetic field to control chemical reactions, NIMC is hopeful that the technology can be effective in fuel consumption and diesel exhaust treatment because nitrogen oxides (NO[.sub]x[/]) and hydroxides, in addition to oxygen, can be attracted by a magnetic field.
