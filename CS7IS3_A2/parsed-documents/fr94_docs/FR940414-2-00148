Guidelines for Cancellation of Claims for Shortage, Irregular Delivery, Non-Delivery or Delivery Directly to the Consignee of In-Bond Merchandise (19 CFR 18.8) A. Documents filed late or merchandise delivered late. 1. Modified CF 5955A. Notices of liquidated damages incurred for this violation may be issued on a modified CF&hyph;5955A. If a modified form is issued, it shall specify two options from which the petitioner may choose to resolve the demand. a. Option 1. The bond principal or surety may pay a specified sum within 60 days and the case will be closed. By electing this option in lieu of petitioning, the principal or surety waives his right to file a petition. He may, however, file a supplemental petition, if he does so in accordance with the Customs Regulations and has some new fact or information which merits consideration in accordance with these guidelines. b. Option 2. Petition for relief. The bond principal or surety may file a petition for relief. By filing a petition for relief, the petitioner will no longer be afforded the Option 1 mitigation amount. The district director shall grant full relief when the petitioner demonstrates that the violation did not occur or that the violation occurred solely as a result of Customs error. If the petitioner fails to demonstrate that the violation did not occur or that the violation occurred solely as a result of Customs error, the district director may cancel the claim upon payment of an amount no less than $100 greater than the Option 1 amount. 2. If merchandise is delivered untimely to the port of destination or exportation (not within 15 days if transported by air, 30 days if transported by vehicle, or 60 days if transported by vessel) but is otherwise intact, cancel the claim upon payment of an amount between $100 or $500, depending on the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors. 3. If merchandise is delivered timely but the documentation is not filed with Customs within 2 days of arrival in the port of delivery, cancel the claim upon payment of an amount between $100 and $500, depending on the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors. 4. If the bonded carrier consistently fails to deliver paperwork timely and Customs business is impeded by these repeated failures, the district director may cancel any claim upon payment of a higher amount than the guidelines generally permit. The advice of Headquarters, Office of Regulations and Rulings, Penalties Branch, may be sought to determine appropriate mitigation. B. Failure to deliver or shortage. 1. If the carrier shows that the merchandise was entered and duties, fees and taxes were paid (on any Immediate Transportation bonded movement) or that the merchandise was exported but not in accordance with regulation (on any Transportation and Exportation or Direct Exportation bonded movement), the claim may be cancelled upon payment of an amount between $100 and $1,000 depending on the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors. 2. If the bonded carrier can prove that the merchandise was never received or landed, the claim should be cancelled without payment. 3. If the carrier cannot prove that the merchandise was entered and duties, taxes and fees paid or that it was properly exported or that it was never received or landed, the claim may be cancelled upon payment of an amount equal to the duties, fees and taxes that would have been due on the subject merchandise had it been entered for consumption plus an amount between $100 and $1,000. 4. If the merchandise delivered short is restricted or prohibited, and the carrier proves that an entry summary was filed, estimated duties were paid and the merchandise was deemed admissible with that entry summary, Customs will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount between $100 and $1,000. 5. If the merchandise delivered short is restricted or prohibited, and the carrier does not prove that an entry summary was filed, estimated duties, taxes and fees were paid or provide a showing that the merchandise was deemed admissible, Customs will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount equal to the estimated duties plus an amount between 25 and 50 percent of the value of the merchandise, but not less than $250. 6. If the bonded carrier consistently has shortages and failure to deliver cases and Customs business is impeded by these repeated failures, the district director may cancel any claim upon payment of a higher amount than the guidelines generally permit. The advice of Headquarters, Office of Regulations and Rulings, Penalties Branch, may be sought to determine appropriate mitigation. C. Delivery of merchandise directly to the consignee. 1. If the carrier can show that the merchandise was entered and duties, taxes and fees paid, the claim may be cancelled upon payment of an amount between $100 and $1,000 depending on the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors. 2. If the carrier can prove that the merchandise was never received or landed, the claim should be cancelled without payment. 3. If the carrier cannot prove that the merchandise was entered and duties, taxes and fees paid or or that it was never received or landed, the claim should be cancelled upon payment of an amount equal to the duties, fees and taxes that would have been due on the subject merchandise had it been entered for consumption plus an amount between $100 and $1,000.
