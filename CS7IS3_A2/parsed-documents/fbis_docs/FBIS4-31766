At the same time Kolodziejczyk distanced himself from the text of Rozbicki's article published in the Thursday issue of GAZETA WYBORCZA. According to Kolodziejczyk, Rozbicki's putting the signature of "The Defence Ministry's Press Spokesman" under the article without permission, was an abuse of his official post and a violation of journalistic ethics by using the post of the spokesman to express his personal opinions. In the article "We Have Disarmed Ourselves" Rozbicki argued that Poland's signing arms reduction agreements was unjustified. He also claimed that shifting the military information service WSI (Intelligence and Counterintelligence) from the ministry's civilian structures and making it subordinate to the general staff may bring positive results as, according to him, for the sake of state security it would be better if a civilian minister would not have full access to information delivered by the WSI. Kolodziejczyk expressed regret at the "incident." The spokesman's opinions attest to the fact that "he does not understand the principle of a full control of the state authorities, including parliament, over the armed forces, the principle obeyed in democratic countries," the defence minister wrote in a letter to Head of the Sejm Defence Committee Jerzy Szmajdzinski. The committee Saturday charged Rozbicki with "incompetence," "disrespect for civilian politicians" and "lack of understanding of the fundamental principle of full control of the state authorities over the armed forces."
