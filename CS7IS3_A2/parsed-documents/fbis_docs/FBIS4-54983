FBIS4-54983 "dreeu089_c_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 CZECH REPUBLIC _O_OECD Assesses State of Czech Economy _O_OECD Assesses State of Czech Economy 94P20731A 94P20731A CSO [Editorial Report] A recent OECD study of the Czech economy positively assesses its current condition and foresees continued improvement. The OECD report, which was summarized in the 25 March edition of the Prague business daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, credits the Czech Republic's recent success in part to its "surprisingly smooth" separation from its former sister republic and to the stabilization and privatization policies of the government of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. The report notes that the Czechs have succeeded in compensating for a sharp decline in sales to Slovakia since the separation by increasing exports to Western countries by 19.5 percent last year, while, at the same time, allowing imports from the West to rise by only 5.2 percent. The OECD experts attribute the Czech Republic's abilities to maintain strong foreign currency reserves and to achieve a favorable trade balance to its exceptionally stable fiscal and monetary policies and its low inflation rate. They warn, however, that the Czech Government should exercise caution with its wage regulation policy, even though this acts as a brake on inflation, because pent-up demand for wage increases could eventually lead to an explosive situation, especially in areas of labor shortages. The OECD report praises the Klaus government's coupon-privatization policy for permitting the rapid privatization of over 36 percent of state-owned properties without arousing popular discontent, but it warns that the government's efforts to keep down the rate of bankruptcies (only 20 were declared in the first five months after the government's new bankruptcy law went into effect in mid-1993) could backfire as the number of insolvent firms accumulates. The general macroeconomic picture is seen as promising, aided by a balanced government budget, a foreign-payments surplus, and the neutral monetary policy of the Czech National Bank. Industrial production is expected to increase, although only at a modest rate, while growth of 2 percent in 1994 and 5 percent in 1995 is predicted for the overall GDP. Nevertheless, unemployment will probably increase as the expected wave of bankruptcies starts to have an impact. (A study by the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies also warns of increasing unemployment this year, according to the 6 April HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. The Vienna Institute attributes the current low unemployment rate to a sharp drop in the size of the labor force, from 5.7 million in 1989 to a current 4.8 million. The drop is mainly the result of ending the artificially high work-force participation rate of 87 percent under the communist regime and of absorbing displaced industrial and agricultural workers in the rapidly developing service sector. The study sees both of these trends as essentially played out, making a doubling of the unemployment rate possible in 1994.) The OECD experts said they expect a small surplus in the 1994 balance of payments, particularly due to net income from services and tourism. They warn, however, that this surplus may drop to near zero in 1995 as a result of increasing imports due to an expanding economy and continuing improvement in living standards. Their report notes that foreign currency reserves of $6.5 billion have been accumulated so far. (This was criticized by economic journalist Jan Kukacka, who described the foreign currency reserves as "dead" capital that is not being used for economic development and must, on the contrary, be "subsidized" by Czech citizens because it earns no interest and leads to higher prices. Writing in the 5 April HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Kukacka also suggested that the surplus could be an indication of undervalued currency, a conclusion that was also reached in the Vienna Institute study.)
