FR940610-0-00049 FR940610-0-00023 Effective Dates These regulations are generally effective in the case of annuities, interests for life or terms of years, and remainder or reversionary interests created after April 30, 1989. The regulations provide certain transitional rules intended to alleviate any adverse consequences resulting from the statutory amendments. Several principal provisions of the regulations were announced in Notice 89&hyph;24, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 660 (which announced the change from the 10 percent fixed rate of interest to the section 7520 floating rate of interest), and Notice 89&hyph;60 (which announced the change in mortality tables) (See ยง601.601(d)(2)(ii)( b ) of the Statement of Procedural Rules). A transitional rule in the final regulations provides that, for valuation dates of transfers after April 30, 1989, and before June 10, 1994, a transferor can rely on Notice 89&hyph;24 or Notice 89&hyph;60 in valuing the transferred interest. For gift tax purposes, a transitional rule in the final regulations provides that if, after December 31, 1988, but before May 1, 1989, a donor transferred an interest in property, retaining an interest in the same property, and the donor later transferred the retained interest in the property after April 30, 1989, and before January 1, 1990, the donor may elect to value the transfer of the retained interest under either the 10 percent tables or the section 7520 tables (whichever is more beneficial). For estate tax purposes, a transitional rule in the final regulations provides that the estate of a mentally incompetent decedent may elect to value the property interest included in the gross estate under the mortality table and interest rate in effect at the time the decedent became mentally incompetent or the mortality table and interest rate in effect on the decedent's date of death if the decedent was under a mental incapacity that existed on May 1, 1989, and continued uninterrupted until the decedent's death. For purposes of determining the value of the remainder interest in a testamentary charitable remainder unitrust or annuity trust, a transitional rule in the final regulations provides that the mortality table and 10 percent interest rate in effect before May 1, 1989, or the mortality table and interest rate under section 7520 may be used if the decedent was mentally incompetent on May 1, 1989, and (1) such incompetency continued uninterrupted until death, or (2) the decedent died within 90 days of first regaining competency after April 30, 1989. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is William L. Blodgett, Office of Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.
