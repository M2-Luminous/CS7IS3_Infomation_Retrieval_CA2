China is planning to build a second nuclear power plant in Guangdong and to carry out the second phase in the construction of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang. China's nuclear power departments are also planning to build several nuclear power plants in Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian, and other coastal areas. During an interview with a MING PAO reporter yesterday, a person in charge of a certain design institute in China's nuclear industry said that his institute will help design a third nuclear power plant in Guangdong. (It has been reported that Lingao in the vicinity of Daya Bay has been selected as the plant site.) The nuclear specialist said that the second nuclear power plant in Guangdong will use large generating units. There are currently two different plans and views regarding the installed capacity of Guangdong's third nuclear power plant (that is, the Yangjiang Nuclear Power Plant). Some specialists want to install four 900,000 kw generating units, while others think that it is advisable to first install four 600,000 kw generating units. The specific plan for the Yangjiang Nuclear Power Plant has not yet been determined. He also said that the second phase of the construction of China's Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant includes the construction of two 600,000 kw generating units. Most of the equipment will be made in China, but some of it may be imported. Since it officially started generating electricity and sending electricity to the power grids many years ago, the 300,000 kw generating unit of the first phase construction of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant has been operating smoothly. The entire plant was designed by Chinese specialists. He continued to say that, at present, the electricity supplied by thermal power plants accounts for more than 80 percent of the total amount of electricity generated. Hydropower ranks second. The amount of electricity supplied by nuclear power plants accounts for only a very small portion. If the two 900,000 kw generating units of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant -- which will begin operating in June -- are included, China's total installed capacity of nuclear power plants is only 2.1 million kw. Most of China's coal mines are distributed in areas north of the Huang He, and hydropower resources in the southwest and northwest. The eastern coastal areas, which account for more than two-thirds of the output value of China's national economy, have been suffering electricity shortages for quite some time. Transporting coal from the north to the south and transmitting electricity (hydropower) from the west to the east can only solve part of the problem. Therefore, the development of nuclear power is the best option; it is the most economical and causes less pollution. An official from the State Nuclear Accident Emergency Office told MING PAO that stringent checks are carried out in the selection of the plant site and on the design when building a nuclear plant. He said that, since the first phase of the project of the Daya Bay Nuclear Plant was put into operation, the Hong Kong Royal Observatory and China's astronomical departments have not observed anything abnormal in their tests. He said that, as compared with the successful experience of the west, China is at present one of several countries which have mastered nuclear technology. China has many talented people and it is only natural for it to develop nuclear power.
