FBIS4-33528 "drlat110bb_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS OAS Meeting Opens, Discusses Intervention in Haiti OAS Meeting Opens, Discusses Intervention in Haiti Caputo: Issue `Diplomatic Ultimatum' PY0706135494 Madrid EFE in Spanish 0002 GMT 7 Jun 94 PY0706135494 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Belem do Para, 6 Jun (EFE) -- Former Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo, who is the OAS and UN special envoy to Haiti, stated today -- 6 June -- that there is very little time left to find a peaceful solution to the Haitian crisis. Upon urging 34 foreign ministers of OAS member countries who are attending the 24th OAS General Assembly to issue "a diplomatic ultimatum" to the Haitian military to relinquish power, Caputo said: "We do not have a year left; we only have a few more weeks to resolve the crisis peacefully." Caputo, who gave a detailed account of the Haitian situation and reported numerous human rights violations in that country, stated that the international community must issue an ultimatum to the Haitian military because "we only have a few more weeks to resolve this peacefully." Caputo indicated that if the international community continues to let time go by without taking action, armed intervention in the Caribbean island will become necessary. He said: "Just as we condemn armed interventions, we should also condemn the lack of action that is leading us to a void. We cannot simply condemn intervention while doing nothing to prevent it." Speaking at an ad-hoc meeting of OAS foreign ministers on Haiti, Caputo bluntly stated that it is "intolerable that only 7,000 armed men (the Haitian military) are forcing the will of the entire international community." Caputo, who admitted to having overlooked diplomatic practice to urge the OAS states to decree an ultimatum against the Haitian military, stated that the UN sanctions and those recommended by the OAS are not yielding the expected results. He added that action should be taken to enforce those measures adopted earlier, which are not being observed, before discussing the adoption of new ones. After reviewing the Haitian situation and the Haitian military's persistence in staying in power, Caputo stated that three main objectives must be accomplished: force the generals to leave power, reinstate democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and send an international mission to the island to guarantee protection to the new authorities and provide assistance to the population. Caputo reported that the mission of human rights observers to Haiti reported 210 out-of-court executions from 1 January to 13 May this year, and that there are countless cases of other human rights violations committed by the military forces. Commenting on the Haitian domestic situation, Caputo stated that the appointment, a month ago, of a provisional president by the military was not supported by leading Haitian businessmen themselves, who have been allies of the coup plotters, thus showing that there is no consensus within the island. Caputo added that the worst thing is that General Cedras "is convinced that he will remain in power until 1997 -- when Aristide's constitutional term expires -- and that no one, not even the international community, will force him to relinquish power." In his closing remarks, Caputo said that he believes "there is still room for a diplomatic solution," but there is not much time left to achieve it. Caputo added that the sanctions that have been adopted must be enforced, and that an ultimatum must be given to the military. Caputo said: "We must make the Haitian military understand that we are giving them a last chance, and that if they do not leave...." Caputo noted that if the international community fails to find a peaceful solution to the Haitian crisis, it would be proof that "we have failed in building the much-desired international system to defend democracy." Caputo addressed the ad-hoc meeting of OAS foreign ministers a few minutes after President Aristide suggested the need for an armed action against the coup plotters who usurped power in 1991. Speaking to the OAS foreign ministers, the Haitian constitutional president stated that the international community must take quick, powerful action to overthrow the military who had forced him out of power. The other speaker at the special meeting was OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares himself, who advocated a peaceful solution to the Haitian crisis.
