FR940622-1-00005 FR940622-1-00002 Regulatory Analysis The Commission has prepared this proposed regulation to clarify its decommissioning funding requirements for persons licensed under Parts 30, 40, 70, and 72. Although it does alter existing requirements, regulatory analyses developed in support of prior decommissioning regulations remain valid and appropriate for this rulemaking because these analyses assumed that all licensees would submit a certification of financial assurance to the NRC of a rule prescribed amount, or licensee estimated and NRC approved amount, necessary to provide adequate funds to decommission the licensed facility and that licensees would have complied with the decommissioning funding requirements prior to ceasing operations and commencing decommissioning. These prior analyses, developed for the rules on expiration and termination licenses and financial assurances for decommissioning, remain available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. This discussion constitutes the regulatory analysis for this proposed rule. Regulatory Flexibility Certification As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the NRC carefully considered the effect on small entities in developing the final rule on decommissioning funding and scaled the requirements to reduce the impact on small entities to the extent possible while adequately protecting health and safety. Therefore, it is not expected to have an impact on licensees not already analyzed in the regulatory flexibility analysis for the decommissioning funding rule as published in the Federal Register on June 27, 1988 (53 FR 24018). Accordingly, the Commission certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted, will not have any additional significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities. Backfit Analysis The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this rule, and therefore, a backfit analysis is not required for this rule because these amendments do not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).
