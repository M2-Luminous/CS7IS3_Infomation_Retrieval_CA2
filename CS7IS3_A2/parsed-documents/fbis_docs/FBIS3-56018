The TOKYO SHIMBUN reported that North Korea had signed a contract with the Russian Far East-Pacific fleet headquarters to buy four fox-trot submarines in the Vladivostok naval yard. The source said that a North Korean naval delegation visited the naval headquarters in Vladivostok last September. Another North Korean high-level naval delegation secretly visited Moscow in November, apparently in connection with the submarine purchase. The source said he believes that the Russian Far East-Pacific fleet has recommended sale of the submarines to naval headquarters in Moscow. The fox-trot class submarine is generally classified as an attack vessel and therefore, if Russia proceeds with the sale, Moscow will be reneging on its promise to South Korea that it would not offer any offensive weapons to North Korea, the source said. President Boris Yeltsin, during his visit to South Korea in December 1992, had affirmed that Russia would never supply offensive weapons to North Korea. North Korea was understood to have explained to Russia that it planned to buy the submarines and disassemble them to use scrap iron. But since the submarines are still in usuable shape, the North Korean explanation is unconvincing, the source said. The price of the submarines and other conditions of the sales contract are being kept secret, he said.
