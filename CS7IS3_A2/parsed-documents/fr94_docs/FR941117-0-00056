FR941117-0-00056 FR941117-0-00010 The Advocates also believe that the waived drivers could have been ``grandfathered'' into a qualified status, and, indeed, that such an alternative is still available to the FHWA. It is unclear how the effect of this approach would differ in any significant degree from that of the route chosen by the FHWA. The Advocates contend that the FHWA misused the data from the vision waiver study, ignoring the advice of its own experts in the process. We believe the AHAS is confusing the basis for a ``consistent with safety'' determination to justify the issuance of the waivers in order to conduct the study with prejudging the outcome of the study. As mentioned above, the FHWA concedes that the study, as currently designed, will not produce, by itself, sufficient evidence upon which to develop a new vision standard, and the FHWA has never claimed that the study was intended to create a standard, per se, for issuing waivers. Finally, the AHAS criticized the FHWA for not being candid with the data it has obtained during the course of the vision waiver study. It claims that the FHWA has underreported fatalities. The FHWA has made every attempt to be forthcoming regarding the data and accident information compiled. In fact, the State police and accident reports referred to in comments by the Advocates were provided promptly and directly to the AHAS by the agency. This issue, however, has convinced the agency to take steps to improve its monitoring systems. The Fourth Interim Report has been completed by the contractor and covers cumulative activities and mileage through June 30, 1994. Since the June 30 date, another waived driver has been involved in a fatal accident. As of June 30, the fatal accident rate for waived drivers is 0.034 per million vehicle miles travelled (VMT) as compared to the national rate computed from GES data of 0.026. The total accident rate for drivers in the waived group is 1.636 per million VMT compared with the rate of 2.531 per million VMT computed from GES data. Given the small number of fatal accidents that have occurred, these rates can represent only approximate estimates of what may actually be expected to occur on the highways. Therefore, conclusions drawn solely from them must be cautiously interpreted. Additionally, the fatal accidents that have occurred were not necessarily related to the drivers' vision impairments. The most recent fatality, which was promptly reported by the waived driver involved, occurred when an automobile collided with the rear end of the truck operated by the waived driver. The police accident report indicated there was no fault on the part of the truck driver. A review of the police accident reports of the previous 6 fatal accidents in which waived drivers were involved also reveals that none of the waived drivers was found to be at fault by the reporting police officer. Status of the Waived Drivers The FHWA has reviewed all the comments carefully, conferred with its contractor administering the agency's vision waiver program and conducted peer reviews regarding the studies and other evidence submitted by the commenters. The FHWA believes that continuing to allow those drivers operating commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce while holding Federal vision waivers is consistent with the two-pronged test set forth in the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 (49 U.S.C. 31136(e) (1994)). As discussed above, even the comments opposing the vision waivers did not refute the premise upon which the ``consistent with safety'' determination articulated in the October 6 notice was based. The studies referred to by the FHWA to support the proposition that a group of experienced drivers with clean driving records over a 3-year period will present less of a risk than a group of drivers selected from the general truck driving population to replace them over a similar 3-year period were not contradicted. In fact, studies referred to by some of the commenters opposing the vision waivers bolstered this position. The opposing commenters did, however, point out some weaknesses in monitoring the performance of the waived drivers which can be corrected to assure the continued safety of these drivers. To correct these and assure the continued safety of the drivers, the FHWA will, within the next 60 days, undertake a close review of the data gathered thus far and develop additional criteria which the waived drivers will be required to meet as conditions of retaining the waiver. These conditions will be communicated directly to the waived drivers. In those 60 days, the FHWA will also improve its monitoring systems to enable the agency to more promptly identify subpar performers among the waived group to ensure that safety is maintained. Determination The FHWA has determined that the issuance of waivers to the 2,399 drivers remaining in the study group is consistent with the public interest and the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles. This determination is based on studies referred to herein and data gathered during the course of the last two years which support the proposition that a group of experienced drivers of commercial motor vehicles with clean driving records, including both accident and citation records over the previous three years, will present a lower risk to safety over the following 3 years than a group of the same size comprised of drivers representing the general truck driving population, including new drivers, over the same 3-year period. The statistics that have been gathered from the waived drivers to date indicate that this class of drivers has performed and continues to perform more safely than those drivers in the general population of commercial drivers.
