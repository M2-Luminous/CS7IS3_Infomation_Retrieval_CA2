However, the main strategy of Luanda is to continue exterminating the populations within the framework of the prolonged political and tribal genocide, while it falsely sings the song of negotiations. Our central news desk yesterday received reports from Uige that two SU-22 fighters coming from Luanda dropped a deadly cargo of bombs over the cities of Uige Negage and Quitexe. Many civilians were killed and others wounded. However, we do not have exact information and numbers of casualties caused by yet another barbarous action by the Futungo de Belas Palace.
