Often through tears, the question could be heard: "WHAT IS GOING TO BECOME OF US SLOVAKS?" People's fears are justified. Power has been seized by politicians who did not even move a finger for the independent Slovak Republic. Vladimir Meciar, the architect of Slovak independence and for three years the most popular politician in Slovakia, has had to vacate the prime minister's seat under the influence of a Czechoslovakist, communist, and Hungarian conspiracy. Who deserves the greatest credit for this political reversal on Slovakia's political scene? First and foremost, the Slovak president and representatives of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] and the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. Henceforth, the life of the Slovak society will be influenced, for example, by Peter Weiss, an heir of the communists from whom we have not heard one word of a sincere declaration of affection for the Slovak nation. Jan Carnogursky, who had voted against Slovak sovereignty, may return to the Slovak Government. While the Slovak Metropolitan Archbishop Jan Sokol was praying for sovereignty, this Christian politician voted against it. Apparently from shame, the archbishop hid his face in the palms of his hands. These people, together with the hate-filled [Alliance of Democrats Chairman Milan] Knazko and, of course, with exemplary irredentists, will lead Slovakia from now on. Where do you think they will lead it? They may want to steer the ship back to Czechoslovakist or other dangerous waters. Fortunately, there exist politicians, writers, members of the intelligentsia, journalists, and, most important of all, Slovaks who will carefully monitor their actions. For the time being, there also still exists the editorial staff of REPUBLIKA. The present victors will surely try to liquidate our newspaper and break up the editorial team. They broke us up once before, but we came back. We will not surrender. The fight for Slovakia continues.
