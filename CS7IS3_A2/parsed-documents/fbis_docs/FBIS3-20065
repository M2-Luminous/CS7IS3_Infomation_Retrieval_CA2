"No one can honestly talk about falsifications," Ciampi said in a statement, referring to Berlusconi's allegations in a televised debate with Achille Occhetto, leader of the Democratic Party of the Left, that Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa had doctored the deficit figures. Spaventa and Berlusconi will be facing off in Rome's downtown first-past-the-post constituency for a seat in the Senate. "Last night the government was accused by a political candidate of having presented false budget figures, in contempt of parliament," Ciampi's statement said, adding: "In the face of this very grave affirmation I am forced to break the silence I had imposed on myself during this election campaign." Ciampi also cited his decision not to take part in the campaign's closing forum, broadcast on public television Friday night and traditionally attended by the government chief. In his statement, Ciampi reiterated that the cabinet's budget figures were compiled by the three finance ministers together, were approved by parliament and were in line with forecasts and calculations made by major international institutions. Upward revisions of the forecast 1994 deficit made earlier this week, he said, were in line with lower projected growth figures made by the same international organizations (European Union, OECD, IMF). That part of the higher forecast deficit (14 trillion lire above the December forecasts) not caused by external economic factors amounts to some five trillion lire (3.1 billion dollars), Ciampi continued, but since revisions of this size, "considering payments of 700 trillion lire and revenues of 540 trillion lire, happen in all countries, and no one can honestly talk about falsifications." Ciampi then defended his government's economic policies, citing the renewed trust of foreign investors, successful privatizations and substantial interest rate cuts, which have reduced interests on debt servicing.
