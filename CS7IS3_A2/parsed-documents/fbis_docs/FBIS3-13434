In view of the policy of erecting barriers against Iran as announced by the Bill Clinton Administration, the remarks by the high-level U.S. officials are worth pondering over for the following reasons: Three views can be presented with regard to Washington's latest stance: 1. The victory of Russian President Yeltsin's opponents--that is, the communists and the nationalists--in the Russian parliamentary elections and the daily mounting impact of their viewpoints on the domestic and foreign policy making which has inspired apprehension in the United States and its allies. Washington is concerned over the possibility of Yeltsin's opponents taking over power and the resumption of worldwide confrontation, which could endanger its interests. This is why in the past months we have witnessed moves by the United States, including suggested plans for collaboration for peace and extensive activity to prevent the revival of Russian influence in these regions. These moves, which are aimed at creating a security belt as well as a quarantine around Moscow, encounter a vacuum in only one area -- that is, Iran. This is because in the event of any anti-Western moves in Russia and the possibility of cooperation between the new leaders in Moscow with Tehran, the balance of power in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East will shift to the detriment of the West, especially since the oil routes in the Persian Gulf pass south of Iran. 2. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Central, and Southern Asia faced a power vacuum. The U.S. relations with Pakistan became strained. It does not have any influence in this particular region at present, and this situation has made its effects felt on other regions. Meanwhile, even though the United States has endeavored to implement plans for the breakup of many countries in Asia, this is still the beginning. The efforts by the PRC, Iran, and India to initiate joint cooperation in the region can endanger U.S. interests. Meanwhile Washington is reviewing its frigid relations with Pakistan and by supporting it on the Kashmir issue it is seeking to fill the power vacuum. However, this will not give it much clout over the power triangle of Tehran, Beijing and New Delhi. Such a power triangle can shatter Washington's goal of domineering on the Asian continent. 3. The rising tide of Islamism in the Middle East has increased the danger of the downfall of the reactionary regimes, and this threatens the interests of the United States and its international allies, who are all seeking to serve their own interests. In addition, the rising tendency among the Palestinians to join groups such as the Hamas in the wake of the Hebron massacre could, in the view of the United States, be repeated in every part of the Middle East. It is in the above perspective that we can view the renewed request on the part of Washington for talks and improved relations with Iran. This is an issue which by itself indicates the importance of Iran in international relations; and this will be enhanced further in the event of any regional or international upheaval. Therefore, it is from this vantage point that the United States -- taking into account the existing distinctive circumstances -- wishes to create conditions necessary for an improvement of relations with Iran so that in the future it will not encounter dangerous situations on strategic issues. This demands twice as much vigilance on our part so that we can utilize our geopolitical [preceding word in English] position in our approach to regional and international developments and be alert to U.S. ploys.
