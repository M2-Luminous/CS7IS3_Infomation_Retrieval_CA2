[Klepsch] I am convinced that the European Parliament [EP] has gained significantly in importance and influence since the last direct election of June 1989. This is an essential understanding that I have gained during my official visits to the 12 European Union members states, the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries, and outside Europe. In many countries outside the EU, the European Parliament is regarded as a model and symbol for democratic parliamentary activities, as a guarantor for democratic control and the protection of human rights. The long, untiring efforts by the European Parliament for stronger, extended powers is reflected in the Maastricht Treaty. The important thing now is for the European Parliament to do justice to its new role and contribute to the solution of pending problems in cooperation with the other EU institutions. I hope that the citizens of the EU now understand that this Parliament supports their causes and interests. The voters should make themselves aware that disenchantment with politics or with Europe will not get us anywhere. On the contrary, the fourth direct election to the European Parliament in mid-June will offer an opportunity for everybody to co-determine the course of the further process of European integration. [Hausmann] What were for you personally the highlights of your presidency in the past two and one-half years? [Klepsch] Two essential events for the entire history of the European Community, the signing of the Maastricht Treaty on 7 February 1992 and its implementation on 1 November 1991 [date as published], took place during my presidency. In September 1992, the European Parliament itself could celebrate its 40th anniversary. In six summit meetings -- another one will follow in late June -- I was able to contribute to the future shaping of the EU together with the heads of state and government of the 12 EU countries. In a number of meetings and talks with leading politicians from Europe and other continents I was able to experience that the EU can and must assume a leading role in international politics. [Hausmann] The Maastricht Treaty offers the European Parliament the basis to strengthen and considerably extend its powers of democratic control. As important examples I would like to mention the European Parliament's right of consent to the nomination of the president of the Commission and the entire European Commission, which currently consists of 17 members. So far, the Parliament only had the possibility to remove the entire Commission via a vote of no-confidence. The Maastricht Treaty also adjusts the terms of the Commission to the legislative term of the Parliament, which means it will be extended from four to five years. That is also of relevance for the political work. Maastricht also authorizes the European Parliament to ratify all EC agreements with third countries that focus on political, economic, of financial issues. So far, the European Parliament has had the right to consent to agreements on associate membership and full membership to the EU -- which is what some people have not been aware of. The position of the European Parliament as a democratic control body will be strengthened in the future also by establishing the post of ombudsman, who will be elected by the Parliament and is accountable only to Parliament. The creation of investigating committees is an additional example regarding the extension of democratic powers of control. The European Parliament will thus be enabled to comprehensively control the bureaucracies of the Commission and the Council of Ministers -- which is where the representatives of the individual governments make their decisions. Finally, the Maastricht Treaty concedes to the European Parliament the right of co-decision, that is to say co-decision on an equal footing with the Council of Ministers for the latter's decision with a qualified majority. This power of consent -- with the absolute majority of 260 deputies -- remains, however, for the time being limited to decrees and guidelines related to the single market, which was implemented at the beginning of last year, and to some framework laws, such as the Fourth Research Framework Program, which was just discussed by Parliament in the second reading. The European Parliament has called for the extension of the right to co-decision to all legislative activities in which the Council adopts majority resolutions. This extension may be implemented at the revision conference, planned for 1996; yet it can also be done without an amendment of the treaty through the evolutive clause [Evolutivklausel], which is contained in the Maastricht Treaty. With the regulations of the Maastricht Treaty, the catalogue of demands of the European Parliament is still far from being fulfilled. The essential objectives are and remain: - Full right of co-decision in all activities of the Community, that is to say in the entire law-making process; - The full budget right -- to be able not only to decide on spending but also on revenues; - The right of consent in the case of amendments to the treaty. "Interinstitutional agreements" have been concluded, that is to say agreements between the Council of Ministers, the Commission, and the European Parliament, for the important areas of the annual EC budget and the medium-term financial planning up to the end of the decade, and for everything that was discussed and negotiated under the headlines of "more democracy, full transparency, and subsidiarity principle." This has significantly strengthened the importance of our Parliament. Still pending are the necessary agreements on setting up investigating committees and the shaping of the necessary consultative procedures between the Council and Parliament in the spheres of common foreign and security policy, economic and monetary policy, and measures in the domestic and judicial areas, the three pillars of the Maastricht Treaty. [Hausmann] Apart from the increase in power for the legislative procedures itself, Parliament can now exert an indirect influence on the creation of draft laws, because the Commission has become dependent on Parliament. Is this not a shift of power in the institutional balance to the disadvantage of the Commission? [Klepsch] I regard that as a justified enlargement of powers in favor of the European Parliament and not as something to the disadvantage of the European Commission. It is a procedure to restore a new balance between EU institutions. [Hausmann] The greater legislative powers in some traditional spheres of European policy now contrast with stripping the Parliament of powers in new spheres of responsibility of the EU. Foreign and security policy, as well as domestic and legal policy were placed outside Community procedures. Why does the Parliament put up with this disrespect for the elected deputies? [Klepsch] The European Parliament is certainly not ready to put up with such disrespect. On the basis of the Martin Report, we criticized the deficiencies and shortcomings of this treaty in the first resolutions to the Maastricht Treaty in April 1992. This includes the planned procedure in domestic and legal policy and in foreign and security policy. The European Parliament has called for full integration of treaty pillars number two and three into the EU sphere of powers and the appropriate cooperation of the Parliament. We will not put up with the fact that the right to co-decision is limited only to the single market and some framework sectors. On the contrary, we are calling for an extension of the right to co-decision to all legislative activities. [Hausmann] Some French politicians reject further powers for the European Parliament arguing that even today it has more rights than the French National Assembly. Denmark has also assumed a negative position in this issue. How much room do you still have for more democracy? [Klepsch] The European Parliament will not abandon its course because of criticism and opposition from national parliaments to make the activities and decisions of the EU all in all more transparent and easier to understand, and to increase the level of democracy. In doing so, we do not act against the interests of the national parliaments, but we are seeking close cooperation with them. At the level of national parliaments, too, the understanding should begin to prevail that more democracy will ultimately be beneficial to everybody. The implementation of the Maastricht Treaty stipulations will certainly help to make EU more democratic to the benefit of all citizens. [Hausmann] In 1996, a new government conference is to work out an internal, institutional reform of the Union. Even now, a working group consisting of members of the Council, Commission, and Parliament should work out proposals. Why before the election, and what are the Parliament's minimum demands? [Klepsch] We very much welcome the idea of a working group begining its activities at this early stage. I myself repeatedly emphasized the necessity of tackling a comprehensive institutional reform even before the government conference, scheduled for 1996, and best with the participation of the current membership candidates. The European Parliament's basic demand has always aimed at making an enlarged EU able to act and work. This requires reform at all levels of EU institutions. This affects especially the mechanism of decisionmaking in the Council of Ministers. For the European Parliament the necessary resolutions or provisions have already been made with the Edinburgh decisions on increasing the number of deputies from 518 to 567, and the Brussels summit decision of December 1993 on the number of deputies for the membership candidates. [Hausmann] In the view of the European Parliament, the EU should develop into a federal state in the long run. Yet, the German Constitutional Court thinks that this is incompatible with the current Basic Law. Will the Parliament now revise its objective? [Klepsch] As president of the European Parliament I welcomed the ruling of the German Constitutional Court of October 1993 and described it as being "largely consistent with the ideas of the European Parliament." I think that the question whether the EU should develop into a federal state, a confederation, or a union of states, which is how the Federal Constitutional Court has defined the current state of integration, is not of primary importance at this moment. In my view, the most important thing is now the practical implementation of all regulations of the Maastricht Treaty on shaping the EU. The European Parliament will stick to its plan of drafting a "EU Constitution." Work on it will continue rapidly. [Hausmann] Despite the summit decision of 1992, according to which Strasbourg is the seat of the European Parliament and 12 weeks of plenary sessions should be held there, only 11 sessions took place under your presidency in 1993, with only 11 being planned for this year, too. Why is the decision of the heads of state and government not respected, and why are plenary sessions held in Brussels instead? [Klepsch] One cannot say that the resolution of the heads of state and government of the December 1992 Edinburgh summit is not respected. The only reason the second regular plenary session on the Community budget in 1993, normally scheduled for the end of October, was canceled was that the budget consultations had made good progress and could be concluded without a second plenary session in October. This year, the June plenary session in Strasbourg has to be canceled because of the European election. Besides, the European Council summit in Edinburgh also ruled that "additional plenary sessions are to be held in Brussels."
