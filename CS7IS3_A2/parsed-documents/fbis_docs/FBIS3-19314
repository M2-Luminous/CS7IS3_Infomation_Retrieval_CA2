According to the Pact leader, "it is possible that after the elections these forces will fall apart and that a stronger and more united center will thus have a greater ability to attract centrists from either side." Segni stressed that he does not intend to maintain "political relations" with [PDS Secretary] Occhetto ("we will never join a government with the PDS, unless it is an institutional government") or with the right-wing front. He received a polemical response from National Alliance coordinator Gianfranco Fini in Gorizia: "Center voters must realize that by voting for the PPI, they are voting for a carbon copy of Occhetto's party." But Segni went further than that, accusing [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi on the one hand and the PDS on the other of maintaining a similar stance with regard to their conflict-ridden relations with the judiciary. Segni, speaking at a public rally with [Italian Republican Party Secretary] Giorgio La Malfa, cited the statement submitted by Silvio Berlusconi to the head of state to criticize the action of the Milan judges, describing it as "a serious matter, a very serious matter." He added: "Occhetto used to praise the judges when they arrested his adversaries. The moment he is affected in some way, he starts attacking them. Berlusconi, however, started right away. You have to decide: Either you respect the judiciary or you do not. We do respect them, and we act in such a way as to enable them to do their job freely." This elicited an immediate response from PDS headquarters: "Segni, that soul in torment, has decided to step into old Forlani's shoes. But apart from being a diehard Forlani-like man, he is also a liar. And you cannot build anything on lies." "If Berlusconi feels that he is under attack, he can respond however he likes," Giorgio La Malfa commented, "but he must realize that these are the pains of political life. Perhaps, being a businessman, he is not accustomed to this kind of atmosphere." Mino Martinazzoli reaffirmed his fear that "some coarse victor may imagine that the issue of the power of the judiciary can be resolved by reducing their autonomy and independence." The Popular Party secretary stressed: "When the hunt for Christian Democrats began, everything was fine, because the judicial instrument was being used in the political struggle. We never indulged in insults and invective, so we are entitled to express amusement at the fact that certain other people start shouting the moment any initiative impinges on their territiry."
