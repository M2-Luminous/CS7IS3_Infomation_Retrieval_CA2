Quoting slanderous charges made by a Thai citizen, Mr. Anonglak Khambunruang, 23, the newspaper reported that the said Thai citizen accused Lao authorities of failing to look after and torturing Thai citizens who are arrested and detained for illegally entering Laos. The truth is that Mr. Anonglak Khambunruang was recently detained by Lao authorities in Champassak Province for committing violations against the laws of the Lao People's Democratic Republic. The Lao authorities, however, later released and sent him back to Thailand. KPL categorically denies the allegations published by the BANGKOK POST which irresponsibly quoted the fabricated charges made by Mr. Anonglak Khambunruang. We hold that the slanderous charges are baseless and have been fabricated to purely serve certain bad elements in Thailand who are intent on undermining the relations of friendship and good neighborliness between the Lao and Thai peoples which are currently developing favorably.
