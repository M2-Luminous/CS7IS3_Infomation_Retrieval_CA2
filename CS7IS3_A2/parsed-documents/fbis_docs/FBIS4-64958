Like Prosperity Party leader Nacmettin Erbakan, he has an air of Islamic conservatism tinged with new radicalism. The following discussion took place between myself and Kazan: [Madani] What do the recent wins by the Prosperity Party in the municipal elections mean to you? [Kazan] The West has brought Turkey to this juncture. Every infant draws his first breath in this country with 50 million Turkish liras of debts to the West. In the forties we were making weapons. In the fifties, the Marshall Plan destroyed our military industries. Without the Marshall Plan, we would have been making our own weapons now. He added: They destroyed our ability to work. We needed weapons during the Cyprus crisis. When we entered Cyprus, the United States imposed an embargo on us and we responded by confiscating U.S. bases. Three years passed without us getting any assistance. Those were hard times. Then the doors opened again and we turned once more to the Western military industry. Right now we are using tanks against the Workers Party of Kurdistan, but Germany says that we should not be using those weapons against the Kurds. However, those are tanks that we bought with our own money. He asked: Why is the West afraid of us? The West is always working against the Islamic world through NATO, the United Nations, the Council of Europe, and other international forums. Muslims constitute one fourth of the world population. Why is there not a single Islamic country in the UN Security Council? It is only natural and fair that we should have a representative in the Security Council. Sometimes, a stray Muslim country finds its way into the Security Council, but without the right of veto. Therefore, we cannot expect anything good to come out of the United Nations in anything that concerns us. He added: This is why we call for the establishment of a United Nations belonging to the Islamic world. The Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] is just a ceremonial forum. I wonder what this ICO has done for the Bosnians. I promise you, once the Prosperity Party comes to power, we will establish a United Nations. That is not all. An Islamic common market should be formed. We do not have to remain dependent on the West. God Almighty has given the Islamic countries plenty of resources. Once we form an Islamic common market, the European Common Market will be a thing of the past. A third point on the Prosperity Party's platform, if it reaches power, is the establishment of an joint Islamic defense pact, an Islamic NATO. A fourth point is the unification of the Islamic currency, a move that would free us of the domination of the U.S. dollar. A fifth point is the establishment of an Islamic UNESCO, a cultural union among Islamic countries. This is why the West does not want the Prosperity Party, because its accession to power will upset the global balance of power. About a week ago, an Israeli bank chairman came to Turkey. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres came today. They told the Turkish officials: Whatever financial backing you need we will give you, so long as the Prosperity Party does not come to power in Turkey. We tell them that these people cannot be bought. [Madani] I have understood from your program that you intend to go back to the notion of the Ottoman Empire and the Sublime Porte. [Kazan] We will not be an Ottoman state. It had its day, and we have ours. We are at the end of the 20th century, and no country can stand alone. The same as the West unites to serve its interests, the Islamic nation should unite for its own good. This is both the logical and the reasonable thing to do. This will save us not only in this world, but also in the one to come. [Madani] How do you explain the victory of the Prosperity Party? [Kazan] It is natural. Since the seventies we have been gaining more votes in every election we enter. In the coming elections, we will get more than 35 percent of the votes. The gain in votes made us develop the party, the same as it dictated that the other parties decline in votes and in popularity. The True Path Party and the Motherland Party won about 20 percent of the votes in this election, but in the next one they will not win more than 15 percent, if that. We could have gotten more votes, but the media was very much against us. I hope our people will not trust the media from now on. I would like to give you an example about the media. The newspaper SABAH, one of the most widely circulated papers in Turkey, published results of an opinion poll it conducted one day before the election. In Istanbul, it expected the Social Democratic People's Party to gain 25 percent of the votes and the Prosperity Party to gain 16 percent and to rank fourth. In Ankara, the paper predicted the Social Democratic People's Party to gain 35 percent of the votes and the Prosperity Party to come in fourth with 14 percent. We know what the results are and what the results of such media was. The other papers were not much different. The election was a war between the media organs and the people. We have won six central municipalities out of 15. The total number of municipalities we won throughout Turkey is 325. [Madani] Do you expect a collision between you and the regime when you try to reach power, as happened in Algeria? [Kazan] Turkey is not Algeria. This is not the first time we have won municipal elections. We took over municipalities that were billions of liras in debt. Now these same municipalities are not one cent in debt. God willing, the same will happen in the other municipalities we have taken over, which are also in debt. As for the collision you mentioned; that is with the Army; there is no separation between the people and the Army. The Army is part of this people. The Prosperity Party has won in several military areas. There is no conflict between the people and the Army. [Madani] But former President Kenan Evren warned the Turkish Army and people about you. [Kazan] Evren has become a rich man. He belongs in the history museum, and his time is over. He is the last person to speak like this because nobody in Turkey listens to him.
