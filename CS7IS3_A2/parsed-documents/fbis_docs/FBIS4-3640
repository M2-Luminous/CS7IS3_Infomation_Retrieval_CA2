At the weekly press conference here this afternoon, Wu made the statement when asked to comment on a lengthy report on Sino-British relations issued on April 13 by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons. In disregard of the fact, Wu noted, this report confuses the right and wrong and insists on supporting the erroneous policy of the British Government on the issue of Hong Kong and supporting its continued confrontation with China, thus fully revealing the true intention of the British side to prolong its colonial influence in Hong Kong by creating chaos there. Wu stressed that Hong Kong will return to the motherland, which no force whatsoever can stop. The Chinese Government has the resolve and the capability to resume exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled, pursuing "One Country, Two Systems", implementing the basic law and maintaining the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong, Wu said. Wu pointed out that the report, while recognizing China's economic success and the importance of its international role, makes irresponsible remarks about China's internal affairs and even made an attempt to meddle in them. "We would like to remind the authors of this report that one has to have some sense of history and reality," said Wu, adding that today's China is no longer what it used to be when it was "bullied and lorded over at will." He went on to say that people can "never forget" the role Britain played on the issue of Tibet and can only hope it will "draw lessons" from history and adopt a "prudent attitude." Any attempt to create "Two Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan" runs counter to the principles governing the establishment of the diplomatics relations between China and Britain and therefore "will meet our firm opposition," the spokesman said.
