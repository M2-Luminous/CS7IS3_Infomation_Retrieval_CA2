IF Note: The possibility of a special Ukrainian-Russian summit was reportedly discussed during a Monday telephone conversation between Kravchuk and the Russian Prime-Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. On 10 April some 120 Ukrainian troops stormed a group of conservation ships of the Black Sea Fleet in Odessa. Several naval officers were detained. Later they were released at the demand of the Russian government. A high-ranking Ukrainian government expert has told the press in Kiev that the leaders of the two countries will hopefully find a way out of the present situation. He said Ukraine continues to insist on resolving the problem on the basis of Yalta, Zavidovo and Massandra agreements. (In Zavidovo it was agreed that the fleet would be equally divided between Ukraine and Russia while the Massandra protocol implied the surrender of the entire fleet to Russia -- INTERFAX.) The expert said it is impossible to drag out the solution of the situation any longer. He hoped that both sides will have enough common sense to prevent an open armed conflict. He said that during the Tuesday talks in Kiev with a Russian delegation that included the Chief Commander of the Russian Navy Feliks Gromov and the ambassador at large Yuriy Dubinin no decisions were made. The expert believes that the aggravation of the conflict benefits "pro-imperial" forces in the Russian leadership. He said that there are people in the Russian presidential council, in particular Sergey Karaganov and Andranik Migranian, who want to strip Ukraine of its independence.
