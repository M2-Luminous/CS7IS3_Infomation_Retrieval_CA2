Pollution from England and East Europe has made the snow extremely acidic. Tonsberg--The snow that fell over the southeastern part of the country earlier this week was extremely polluted. At the regional college at Bo in Telemark the pH value of the precipitation measured 3.4. The pH value shows how much acid there is in the water. The lower the number, the more acidic the water. "We took a sample of the precipitation on Thursday [2 December], after personally observing how dirty-grey the snow was," says teacher Synne Kleiven in the Department of Environment Protection at the regional college. "The tests we made show that the pH value of the precipitation was 3.4. The normal pH value of precipitation over Telemark is 4.4. This means that the snow that fell this week is 10 times as polluted as normal. In a fishing lake anything alive will die long before the water becomes as acidic as the snow was this week." Kleiven says the water has been filtered and great quantities of soot particles have been found. "The filter we used became completely grey as we filtered the water," she says. There is a layer in the snow almost 2 centimeters thick that is almost completely grey. We think this is the snow that fell the night before Wednesday. "So far the pollution remains in the snow. The problem arises when the snow melts in spring. If this happens rapidly water and rivers will get an acidic pollution shock that might result in the death of fish and great damage to the environment," says Kleiven. The National Pollution Inspectorate (NPI) has also received reports about the extremely acidic precipitation. "We received the statistics from some 30 measurements carried out by the Norwegian Institute of Atmospheric Research (NIAR) yesterday. The numbers show a concentration of acid that is up to five times the normal amount in the precipitation that fell this week," Chief Engineer Tor Johannessen of NPI says. "The measurements show a pH value ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 in the snow that fell last week. This is far below the normal value. The tests also show large concentrations of soot particles," says Johannessen. Johannessen says that the acidic precipitation has fallen all over the southeastern part of the country, from the Agder counties to as far north as Osen in Hedmark. "Periods with an extreme amount of acidic precipitation are something that we experience from time to time," he says. This is no acute crisis, but it might result in a large amount of local pollution when the snow melts. It might be especially bad if large amounts of acid collects in the snow during the winter. The fact that there is so much soot in the snow indicates that the pollution is coming from East Europe where cleaning of emissions is quite poor. According to the Meteorological Institute the precipitation of the last few days has come from both the southeast and the southwest. This means that large amounts of pollutants have come down over Norway from both East Europe and England during the last days. [Box, p 3] This Is Acidic Precipitation - Acidic precipitation is polluted snow or rain. It is first and foremost sulphur that pollutes, but there can also be large amounts of soot particles in the acidic precipitation. - The pollution is coming from heat-generating stations and industries that use oil or coal as a source of energy. Sulphur is released into the air and then comes back down as sulfuric acid along with the precipitation. - England, Germany, Russia, and the other countries in East Europe are the greatest users of coal and oil. - The Agder counties and Telemark in particular have been hit by acidic precipitation, but such pollution has been registered as far north as Sogn and Fjordane.
