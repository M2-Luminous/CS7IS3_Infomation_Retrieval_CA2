Generally speaking, as relatively close attention has been paid to the work of assisting the poor and developing the poverty-stricken areas, the work has been performed very well. Thanks to the intensified leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, the enthusiastic support of various departments and people from all walks of life, and the assiduous work of the vast numbers of cadres and masses, the population of poor people living in rural areas across the country who have not totally and steadily settled the problem of having adequate food and clothing has been reduced to 80 million at present. This is a tremendous, historic achievement. In attaining this achievement, we have gained rich experiences, the most important of which, in my opinion, is that we have defined a new working principle under which the original pattern of assisting the poor by providing relief has been changed to giving assistance by way of development. Practice has proved that as the new principle is oriented to market demands and aimed at developing and utilizing local resources to boost commodity production through the application of scientific and technological advances, it will not only resolve the problem of providing people with adequate food and clothing, but enable people to get rid of poverty and become prosperous. In this way, very good results have been achieved in the production and development of the impoverished areas by integrating the assistance and support of the state with the self-reliance and hard work of the cadres and masses in light of actual local conditions. Just as many comrades have said: "The practice of assisting the poor by way of development has made people diligent, and the more diligent they are, the richer they become." I have been to Yanan Prefecture in Northern Shaanxi. People there built terraced fields to grow grain and resolved the problem of having enough food to eat. They also developed four major backbone industries -- tobacco, fruit, sheep, and potatoes, and resolved the problem of having money to spend. The apples produced there are very nice and have reached the export level. The principle of assisting the poor by way of development is a fundamental change as well as a momentous creation in this work, so it must be upheld for a long time to come. The tasks faced by the work to assist the poor are still very arduous because 80 million people is not a small figure. Moreover, the areas which have extricated themselves from poverty over the past few years are those which have relatively less difficulty, and the remaining areas are some hard nuts to crack, as you have put it. In order to resolve the problem of having adequate food and clothing for these 80 million people in the next seven years, the State Council has formulated a "State Plan for Storming the Fortified Positions During the Eighth Five-Year Plan." This is a good and encouraging plan, but the key to its success lies in whether or not we have the spirit of assaulting fortifications. When we resolve the problem of having adequate food and clothing for the 80 million people by the end of this century, the right to subsistence -- the biggest and most fundamental issue of human rights -- of the Chinese people, who account for one-fourth of the world population, will be resolved once and for all from then on. This is not only a great event in the history of the Chinese nation, but a magnificent feat in the history of human development. Taken as a whole, the work to assist the poor has reaped remarkable results, but we are still facing very arduous tasks. Therefore, we must continue with the work conscientiously, unswervingly, and perseveringly for a long period of time. 1. We Must Further Our Understanding of the Arduousness and Importance of the Work To Assist the Poor by Way of Development in Order To Continue It for a Long Time The arduousness of the work to assist the poor by way of development can be understood from the following two aspects: 1) It is very difficult to fulfill the tasks set in the plan of storming the fortified positions during the Eighth Five-Year Plan, so great efforts are necessary; and 2) even if we fulfill the tasks set in the above-mentioned plan, we will only resolve the problem of absolute poverty, so we must continue to resolve the problem of relative poverty. As our burden is heavy and the road is long, we have to work hard for a long time. Today, although the average income in some developed countries is very high, some people still receive low pay and their problem of being relatively poor has not been resolved. Ours is a socialist country, and our goal is to achieve common prosperity for the entire people. Hence, our work to assist the poor is not an expedient measure but must be continued in for a long time. Eliminating poverty and achieving common prosperity are the intrinsic requirements of socialism, which also reflects the superiority of the socialist system. Our party has been leading the people to make revolution and build socialism for the purpose of liberating and developing the productive forces and enabling people to become prosperous. Since reform and opening up, we have allowed and encouraged some people and localities to get rich first in the hope that they will contribute to helping other people and localities become rich too. In this way, we can more effectively reach the goal of achieving common prosperity. In developing the socialist market economic structure, we should pursue the goal of allocating resources efficiently, and at the same time give consideration to the principle of fairness. We should adopt feasible policies to foster development in the impoverished areas. Eliminating poverty and achieving common prosperity are the requirements of reform and development as well as the essential conditions for maintaining stability. Development in various localities is uneven. It is quicker in some localities and relatively slower in others. This is inevitable. In this process, however, constant attention should be paid to the economic development in the impoverished areas. If these areas are always in a state of poverty, they will affect not only the realization of the objectives of our socialist modernization, but also the stability of the entire country. If people in some places are very rich and in other places are very poor for a long time, there will be latent unstable factors. At present, a considerable number of impoverished areas in China are mainly in the border regions and the regions where minority nationalities live in compact communities. Helping these areas rid themselves of poverty as quickly as possible and achieve common development is an economic issue as well as a major political issue that has a bearing on national unity, unification of the motherland, and consolidation of frontier defense. Moreover, some old liberated areas are still poverty-stricken. The people in the old liberated areas made tremendous contributions to the Chinese revolution in the war years, so it is our bounden duty to do a good job of assisting the poor in these areas in order to gradually improve the people's lives there. In short, the development of the old liberated areas, ethnic minority areas, border areas, impoverished areas, and western areas is an important issue that has an impact on the maintenance of a lasting good order in the country. 2. To Continue the Work for a Long Time, the Key Lies in the Intensification of Party and Government Leadership at All Levels The work to assist the poor is not purely economic work, but work engaged in by the masses with distinct political content covering the building of material and spiritual civilizations. Party committees and governments at all levels should, as always, make further efforts to intensify leadership in this work. The principal leaders of party committees and governments at all levels must concern themselves with the work to assist the poor, take up the matter personally, and regard it as a major activity to show concern for the sufferings of the masses and cement close ties with them. Meanwhile, they must rely on the masses, consider everything in their interests, and work sincerely for their well-being. This is the fundamental aim of our party. In the areas where the economy has developed relatively slowly and the masses' lives have been relatively difficult, it is all the more necessary for party committees and governments at all levels to show special concern for them. Whether or not a party committee or government in a region has been divorced from the masses, and stability and unity have been maintained there, will primarily be judged by whether or not it has properly performed the work for the masses whose lives and production are comparatively difficult. The principal leaders of party committees and governments at all levels must take account of the overall situation, focus their work on the weak links, and go often to the impoverished areas and ethnic minority regions to have heart-to-heart talks with the masses, conduct investigation and study, and personally help the cadres and masses resolve practical problems. Recently, the idea has occurred to me that, since people in large and medium-sized cities and economically developed regions have comparatively ampler clothes and quilts, while those in impoverished areas are short of clothing and covering to ward off the cold, can we not mobilize government functionaries and urban residents, in the spirit of unity, friendship, and mutual assistance, to donate their surplus clothes and quilts to the masses in the impoverished areas before the arrival of the coming winter? We should persist in selecting and sending cadres to work in the impoverished areas by stages and in groups. Our experience in practice has fully proved that this is an indispensable organizational measure to strengthen leadership in the work to assist the poor by way of development, because the more impoverished an area is, the greater its necessity for obtaining assistance and guidance from its higher authority. Therefore, we should transfer a number of cadres from provincial, prefectural, and county organs to stay in poverty-hit townships and villages and conduct propaganda on party policies in a bid to help them set up powerful leading bodies, discover a correct path for shaking off poverty to become prosperous, import talent and technology, and enlist the masses in their production and development. If competent cadres cannot be found in some poor villages for the moment, we may try to transfer some cadres from the county organs to work there. The practice of constantly sending cadres to stay and work in poor villages is also of great benefit to tempering cadres, training talented personnel, and changing the work style in the leading bodies of party organizations and governments. We should take the achievements in changing the backward appearance of poverty-hit townships and villages as a major aspect in the appraisal and promotion of leading cadres at township and county levels. Party committees and governments at all levels should be adept in mobilizing and enlisting forces from various quarters to initiate a new situation of assisting the poor and succoring the distressed in the entire society, which is also an important substance of intensifying leadership in the work. The Chinese nation always has a traditional virtue of assisting the poor and succoring the distressed. Today, in establishing a socialist market economy, it is particularly necessary to develop this traditional virtue. All units, including government organs, the People's Liberation Army, democratic parties, mass organizations, enterprises, and institutions, where conditions exist, should exert themselves to the utmost to give positive support to and participate in the work to assist the poor as they have done before. A certain financial input is necessary for the work, so financial, banking, and other departments should extend their support by providing funds and preferential treatment for this endeavor. We should also encourage the more economically developed areas to give assistance to the backward areas and, through mutually beneficial and reciprocal support, achieve common development and prosperity. I hope that the three municipalities, comprising Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, as well as various coastal provinces will put in a bit more effort in this. The central authorities are of the opinion that the relatively developed coastal provinces and cities should assist the impoverished areas in their localities with their own money, while funds for this purpose in the hands of the central authorities should chiefly be used in helping the central and western regions, which are in greater financial difficulty. In the meantime, we call on you to help support the impoverished areas in the central and western regions through such forms as economic cooperation, technological transfers, cadre exchange, and so on. Local party committees at all levels should positively launch activities in their own localities, through which rich counties offer help to poor counties, rich townships help poor townships, rich villages help poor villages, and rich households help poor households, so that they are formed into pairs for mutual assistance. 3. It Is Necessary for the Cadres and Masses in the Impoverished Areas To Fully Develop the Spirit of Self-Reliance and Hard Struggle for Pioneering a Cause In Order To Persist in the Work for a Long Time It is absolutely necessary for the state to give certain assistance to the impoverished areas and for the people from all walks of life in society to conduct activities of assisting the poor and succoring the distressed. However, settling the problem of having adequate food and clothing in impoverished areas and proceeding to shake off poverty and become prosperous should, after all, depend on their own efforts. This calls for the vast numbers of cadres and masses in the impoverished areas to develop the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle to combat nature and boost economy. With this spirit of working hard to pioneer a cause, it will be easier to surmount any difficulty. This is a fine tradition of our party as well as the basic experience of our endeavor to shake off poverty and become prosperous. I went to inspect work in Shanxi Province during the Spring Festival last year. In Qiaoli Village, Linfen City, the people there have changed the appearance of a poor village precisely on the strength of pioneering a cause with hard work. Although the villagers have become wealthy now, the party branch still stands together with the masses through storm and stress, and shares weal and woe with them. I hope that all the people in impoverished areas will emulate and develop this spirit. To persist in self-reliance and hard struggle, we must bring forth new ideas of assisting the poor through development. We must extricate ourselves from the shackles of traditional concepts and force of habit so that we will carry out reform, open to the outside world, and invigorate the economy in a practical manner, for which the crux lies in emancipating the mind and discovering a correct path. Quite a few impoverished areas are at a disadvantage because they failed to emancipate their minds, so that their path of economic development was too narrow. On the one hand, the barren hills and slopes were left uncultivated and the deserted shoals and water resources lay waste and, on the other, large numbers of the labor force remained idle. We must regard the labor force as our wealth rather than our burden. In many localities, the labor force was enlisted to reclaim land, build fields, construct bridges and roads, develop small irrigation works, and plant trees all the year round, so that remarkable results have been scored. Likewise, satisfactory results have also been reaped over the past few years in carrying out the policy of providing relief with grain and manufactured goods in exchange for the work of creating land and building roads, which has proved to be successful and should continue persistently. As farmland is limited but barren hills are numerous in the impoverished areas, forestry, animal husbandry, fruit, and cash crops should be developed in line with local conditions. "With animal husbandry developed here and forestry boosted there, the labor force was well utilized and economic results were instantly produced." This is also experience gained in the impoverished areas. The export of labor is, in essence, personnel training and intellectual development, because laborers will broaden their horizons and increase their knowledge after a few years of work in other places, and they will become talented people when they return. The current issue regarding the export of labor is: In face of the increasingly larger scale of "waves of migrant workers," we must intensify leadership and management of them to reduce the spontaneous blind flow as quickly as possible, while vigorously encouraging the export of labor in an organized and planned fashion. Party committees and governments at all levels, particularly those in the impoverished areas, should pay serious attention to this and sum up experience conscientiously. Otherwise, it will adversely affect the export of labor and bring about serious social consequences as well. The key to persisting in self-reliance and hard struggle rests with the proper training of qualified personnel. To transform the pioneering spirit into a material force, we must ultimately depend on the intelligence and wisdom of the laborers. Therefore, we must place the work of assisting the poor through the development of science, education, and intellect in a primary position. The Eighth Five-Year Plan stresses the need to make elementary education universal, positively eliminate illiteracy, conduct vocational and technical education among young and middle-aged people, prevent and cure endemic diseases, and take firm control of family planning work. All this is very good, so I am all for it. In impoverished areas, we should stabilize the existing qualified personnel on the one hand, and bring up new talents on the other. Practice in many places shows that by using an excellent talent, a number of people will be motivated, and this locality will prosper. We should extend assistance to the rural party organizations politically, show concern for them, and unite and encourage them to lead the masses in changing the appearance of their hometowns and shaking off poverty to become rich. Whether or not the spirit of self-reliance, hard struggle, and pioneering a cause will be brought into full play depends, to a considerable extent, on whether or not the leading bodies in the impoverished areas are really up to the mark and the grass-roots organizations are staunch. There are two focal points here: 1) We should enhance the work in impoverished counties and, in light of the requirement for assisting the poor by way of development, select and assign competent leading cadres at county level. In particular, we should select fine cadres who are capable in work, able to bear hardships and stand hard work, and have close ties with the masses to take up the posts of county party committee secretaries and county chiefs, and to remain in these positions for relatively long periods. 2) We should reinforce the building of party branches in impoverished villages. "We give money and things to them all for the purpose of building up good party branches," which is another good experience we have gained in the work to assist the poor. In order to build good leading bodies in party branches, we must select fine party members who are active, capable, honest, fair, and able to cement close ties with the masses to take up the leading posts. In short, with the necessary support from the state and the help from various sectors in society, so long as our leading cadres at all levels always have the impoverished areas in mind, share joys and sorrows with the masses, stick to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, base themselves in reality, persist in the struggle, and stress actual results in their endeavor to assist the poor by way of development, the backward appearance of the impoverished areas will certainly be changed before the turn of this century.
