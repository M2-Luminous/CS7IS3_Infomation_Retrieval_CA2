ACTION: Final rule; technical amendment. SUMMARY: The Office of Government Ethics is granting an additional grandfathering grace period extension for up to one year for certain existing executive agency standards of conduct, dealing with financial interest prohibitions and prior approval for outside employment/activities, which have been temporarily preserved. This action is necessary because many agencies have not been able to develop, with OGE concurrence, supplemental regulations for such provisions during the first one-year grace period. This additional extension will help ensure that concerned agencies have adequate time to issue successor regulatory provisions to replace the restrictions noted. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William E. Gressman, Office of Government Ethics, telephone: 202&hyph;523&hyph;5757, FAX: 202&hyph;523&hyph;6325. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is granting under the executive branch standards of ethical conduct an additional extension of time for up to one year, until February 3, 1995, for certain agencies' existing conduct standards dealing with prohibited financial interests and prior approval for outside employment and activities. When OGE published its ethical conduct standards for executive branch employees in the Federal Register on August 7, 1992 (as now codified at 5 CFR part 2635), it provided, by means of notes following 5 CFR 2635.403(a) and 2635.803, that although most existing individual agency standards of conduct would be superseded once the executive branch-wide standards took effect on February 3, 1993, existing agency standards dealing with the two types of restrictions noted above would be preserved for one year (until February 3, 1994) or until the agency concerned issued a supplemental regulation, whichever occurred first. See 57 FR 35006&hyph;35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 and 52583. Various executive branch departments and agencies have expressed an interest in developing supplemental regulations involving one or both of these types of provisions. Through OGE's liaison efforts, the Office of the Federal Register has assigned new chapters and parts at the end of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations to accommodate these agencies' future supplemental standards regulations (on these two and other appropriate subject areas), as well as any supplemental agency regulations under OGE's executive branch-wide financial disclosure provisions at 5 CFR part 2634. However, although some of the agencies have, with OGE concurrence, issued interim final or final supplemental regulations, many have not yet had the time to finalize their planned supplemental regulations. The Office of Government Ethics has therefore determined to permit preservation of existing agency standards setting forth financial interest prohibitions and outside employment/activities prior approval requirements for up to one more year, until February 3, 1995 (or until issuance by each agency of its supplemental regulation, whichever comes first), while the concerned agencies continue to work to promulgate their new provisions in these two areas. The agencies subject to this additional grandfathering grace period extension are enumerated at new appendix A, which is being added to 5 CFR part 2635, in the order of the assignment of chapter numbers at the end of 5 CFR. Agencies not listed either have not expressed an interest in issuing supplemental agency regulations pursuant to 5 CFR 2635.105 (or 5 CFR 2634.103) or have already issued final or interim final supplemental regulations. For agencies not listed in appendix A, the initial grace period for any existing standards of conduct financial interest prohibitions and prior approval for outside employment/activities expires on February 3, 1994. Administrative Procedure Act Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (d), as Director of the Office of Government Ethics, I find good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking and 30-day delay in effectiveness as to this grace period extension. The notice and delayed effective date are being waived because this rulemaking concerns a matter of agency organization, practice and procedure and because it is in the public interest that those agencies concerned have adequate time to promulgate successor provisions to their existing standards of conduct regulations in these two areas, while preserving existing restrictions in the meantime. Executive Order 12866 In promulgating this grace period extension technical amendment, the Office of Government Ethics has adhered to the regulatory philosophy and the applicable principles of regulation set forth in section 1 of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. This amendment has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Executive order, as it is not deemed ``significant'' thereunder.
