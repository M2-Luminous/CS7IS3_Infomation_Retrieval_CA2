FBIS4-59128 "drnes091dd_94013" FBIS-NES-94-091 Daily Report 9 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Jibril, Habash, Hawatimah Speak at APF Meeting Jibril, Habash, Hawatimah Speak at APF Meeting JN1005102194 (Clandestine) Al-Quds Palestinian Arab Radio in Arabic 1630 GMT 9 May 94 JN1005102194 (Clandestine) Al-Quds Palestinian Arab Radio Arabic BFN [Text] The Central Command of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] has been meeting since 1800 [1500 GMT] today at the Martyr Samir Darwish Hall in the al-Khalisah building of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] in the al-Yarmuk Camp in Damascus in order to discuss the situation of the sons of our Palestinian people in Lebanon and the diaspora and confront the conspiracy represented by the 'Arafat-Rabin agreement signed recently in Cairo. Ahmad Jibril, PFLP-GC secretary general, said in a statement before the meeting: As Palestinian alliance forces, we will discuss in this and other meetings the extent of the serious impact of the treasonous 'Arafat-Rabin agreement on four million Palestinians in the diaspora and on their future. Jibril asserted that there are multiparty conspiracies to dismiss the issue of the land with regard to millions of Palestinians in the diaspora. There are also plans to evict the Palestinians in Lebanon to states that are far away from Palestine such as Latin and North America. Jibril added: Here, I would like to clearly say that the Palestinians in the diaspora were basically the backbone of the Palestinian revolution and offered great sacrifices throughout the past 30 years. Through the Cairo agreement, we now see that those who signed it want to completely destroy the future of the Palestinian sons in the diaspora. Jibril asserted that the APF is looking into ways to confront the treasonous Oslo agreement in and outside the occupied territories. George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, also made a statement in which he asserted that the aim of the APF meeting is to discuss the threats the Oslo-Cairo agreement poses against our people in Lebanon and the dangers facing them, represented by forcing settlement and displacement on them. On the escalation of the heroic Palestinian intifadah, Habash said that the APF will work to escalate the intidafah because what happened in Gaza and Jericho is not a withdrawal but a redeployment of the Zionist enemy forces. Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, made a statement in which he said that this meeting with Palestinian leaders stationed on Lebanese territory is to discuss basically the bitter harvest of the Oslo-Cairo agreement, which is now raising its ugly head in Lebanon, and its threats to the fate of our Palestinian people in this Arab country. Hawatimah asserted that the Palestinian people in the diaspora are the losers in the Cairo agreement because they are completely excluded. The right of self-determination for the people at home has been eliminated. Therefore, the APF in the 4 May meeting, dealt with the problems at home and the self-rule in light of the practical application of the Cairo agreement. Today, the entire meeting is devoted to how to contain the Oslo-Cairo agreement's threats against our people abroad.
