He added that the only way to achieve peace is by negotiating and putting pressure on the Bosnian Muslims to make concessions and to bargain. Hamilton added that refraining from exerting such pressure will mean continued fighting in the former Yugoslav republics. Hamilton's remarks are the clearest indication of the U.S. diplomatic posture on the Bosnian crisis. They reveal the truth about official U.S. policy regarding the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Until now, Washington's public policy has been to condemn Serbian actions and at one point it accused the Belgrade government of assaulting Bosnia-Herzegovina's national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Still, throughout two years of fighting and brutal Serbian aggression, followed by Croatian aggression, against Bosnian lives, wealth, and sanctity, it became evident to all neutral observers and analysts that the United States was consistently supporting Serbian superiority in Bosnia. The United States has always worried about the rise of an Islamic government in the heart of Europe. Over the past two years, ever since Bosnia-Herzegovina attained nominal independence in the winter of 1991 and became a UN member, Washington has sought to pursue methods that would progressively weaken Sarajevo's government. Although Cyrus Vance was a UN envoy seeking to solve the Bosnian crisis, he was also a U.S. politician and for this reason evidently acted in line with U.S. diplomatic guidelines regarding this issue. He always supported and advocated Bosnia's partition and annexing the Serbian part to a Greater Serbia and the Croatian part to Croatia. He wanted a solution to partition Bosnia-Herzegovina into seven or ten isolated Islamic enclaves amid Serbian and Croatian areas. He made efforts to push through this solution at the New York and Geneva conferences. This is in line with the spirit and logic of U.S. policy on the crisis in this European republic. It is for this reason that we said at the beginning of this talk that Hamilton's remarks were truthful and reflected the political facts.
