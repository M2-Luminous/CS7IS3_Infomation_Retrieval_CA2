Leading members of these four departments -- the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Supreme People's Court, Ministry of Public Security, and State Administration of Taxation -- gathered at a teleconference today to plan the crackdown. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji attended the conference and gave important instructions. Luo Gan, state councillor and secretary general of the State Council, addressed the meeting. Luo Gan said: China's reform for building a socialist market economic system has now entered a critical period for pushing the entire project forward and achieving breakthroughs in key areas. The core of tax reform, which is one of the several major reform projects to be carried out this year, is to establish a system of indirect taxes based primarily on value-added taxes. Under this system, tax deductions are assessed according to the amounts of money noted in invoices. This is an internationally accepted norm. Working like a "chain," a special invoice for value-added tax connects all business processes -- from production to distribution, and from wholesale to retail. If problems occur in any one of the "chain's" links, it will break and cause tax losses. Luo Gan pointed out: Recently, a trend has appeared in certain areas, namely: Certain lawless elements, who are blinded by greed, have forged invoices by illicit means, and made use of these invoices for criminal purposes, such as evading taxes, swindling tax refunds, smuggling goods, and selling smuggled goods. The crime of forging, reselling, and stealing special invoices for value-added taxes, in particular, will jeopardize the implementation of the new tax system as a whole. Thus, we must come down hard on all lawless conduct of forging invoices, especially forging, reselling, and stealing special invoices for value-added taxes. Luo Gan said: All regions and departments must have a consensus of views, be more aware of the problem, provide stronger leadership over the crackdown, and work in close coordination with each other. This problem must be dealt with comprehensively and regularly. Governments at all levels must place the project high on their agendas. Each region and department must assign a leading cadre to take special charge of organizing and coordinating the crackdown. Principal leaders of public security, procuratorial, judicial, and taxation departments themselves must get involve in the crackdown, which must be meticulously organized and tightly supervised. Capable persons of public security, procuratorial, judicial, and taxation departments must be immediately assembled to play their part in a coordinated manner according to the collective plan. Firm actions must be taken to stop the criminal trend of forging, reselling, and stealing invoices. We must make sure anticipated results are achieved so that a good environment favorable for implementing the new tax system and for achieving a sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development can be created. The meeting today also urged all people's courts and procuratorial, public security, and taxation organs to do away with interference from local protectionism, from departments trying to protect their own interests, and from irregular practices in certain trades and professions; give priority to cracking down in key areas and major cases; and carry out all assignments impartially and promptly. It said: While cracking down on special cases, efforts should also be made to publicize the cases so that the people will become educated. Collective and major crackdown actions should be reported through television and radio stations, newspapers, and journals. Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court; Zhao Dengju, deputy procurator general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate; Mu Xinsheng, vice minister of public security; and Jin Xin, deputy director of the State Administration of Taxation, also spoke at the teleconference. Liu Zhongli, minister of finance and concurrently director of the State Administration of Taxation; and He Chunlin, deputy secretary general of the State Council; and persons in charge of relevant departments attended the teleconference. It has been learned that the crackdown conducted by the four departments will be carried out in large and medium cities and regions where forgery, resales, and theft of invoices have been quite serious; and the crackdown will also be carried out in other areas along with routine operations. Priority will be given to cracking down on those who forge invoices en masse in underground printing shops, as well as on lawless elements engaged in forging and reselling invoices as a lucrative profession; and on elements who forge invoices to evade taxes, obtain tax deductibles, and swindle tax refunds. Special efforts will be made to crack down on organized crimes of forging, reselling, and stealing invoices.
