Our special correspondent Pedro Cid reports: [Cid] As expected, Cavaco Silva and John Major had a lengthy conversation, most of which was devoted to matters related to the European Union [EU]. Cavaco Silva advocated no further discussion of the present EU institutions before 1996, adding that in the meantime, it was necessary to make an appraisal of what had been achieved and of the implications of enlargement. Any further enlargement should only be contemplated after 1996, Cavaco Silva said. He said that Portugal has no objections in principle to Cyprus and Malta joining the Union in the short-term future, nor, in the medium-term, to the EU being enlarged to include some East European countries such as Hungary, Poland, and the Czech republic. Cavaco Silva said that the present balances within the EU should be maintained, but added that the EU should remain an open and original model, evolving gradually and amenable to readjustments. All the above points were made during the conversation between the two prime ministers. Particular attention was also devoted to matters pertaining to southern Africa, such as the elections in South Africa -- with regard to which Cavaco Silva expressed the hope they will pass normally -- peace in Mozambique, and the situation in Angola. On the latter the prime minister had this to say: [Begin Silva recording] The Angolan situation is no less a tragedy than that in Yugoslavia. The international community ascribes great importance to, and, naturally, is very concerned about the situation in the former Yugoslavia. however, Angola's tragedy is of a much greater magnitude than Yugoslavia's. Many more people are dying in Angola than in Yugoslavia. This is the reason why I have asked several European leaders to bring all possible pressure to bear, if need be through the UN Security Council -- should this be deemed appropriate. Portugal would not oppose a further meeting of the UN Security Council -- to bring strong pressure to bear on the Angolan Government and on UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] to secure the signing of the agreement currently being negotiated, and which has been practically completed. In our opinion, with goodwill on all sides it could be signed in the not too distant future -- and to insure that this would have repercussions on the ground. The fact of the matter is that at present there are no practical implications; The situation is now worse than it was some time ago. [end recording] [Cid] Cavaco Silva further stated that Portugal is willing to commit itself even more strongly to all ongoing processes. It will not refuse its cooperation in the peace effort in Yugoslavia, and is also prepared to involve itself even more actively if required in the Angolan and Mozambican questions.
