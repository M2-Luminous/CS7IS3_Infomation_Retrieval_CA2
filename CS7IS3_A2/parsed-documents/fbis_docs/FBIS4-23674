This morning it once more tried to storm and take over the city of Malanje, but was promptly repelled by government troops. Our correspondent Francisco Curingana reports from the area: At dawn today, at 0200, a group of UNITA armed bandits who tried to murder civilians and loot their property fled in disarray when the civilians and the civilian defense members responded to the attack. In its flight the enemy left explosive devices, destroying three abandoned houses. This kind of action has been occurring frequently, shows the desperation of the enemy, since they are failing to justify to their commanders the failure in the operations against Malanje. Thirteen UNITA rebels were put out of action on 11 June in Lombe, west of Malanje, and the government forces recovered eight AKM weapons, two RPK machine guns, 1,368 rounds of ammunition, and three South African made antitank mines. The government forces regret the death of two of its valorous combatants. In the south in Quitapa, 18 km from the city of Malanje, the situation is calm and under the control of the government forces and life in the city is going on normally. All institutions are running smoothly, despite shortages of commodities in local markets and soaring prices.
