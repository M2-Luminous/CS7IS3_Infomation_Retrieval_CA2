[passage omitted] Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov "maneuvered" with the topic he was offered, and made an "European journey" on the topical issues called the "Bermuda Triangle" -- relations between the supreme commander-in-chief, the defense minister, and the chief of the General Staff. According to him, at present the issue has been placed upon a legal foundation and practically resolved to a large degree. Personal ambitions and party interests occasionally produce sparks, which also affect the so-called triangle. Minister Aleksandrov made an historical review of the issue and pointed out attempts to resolve it at the beginning of the century in Germany, Austro-Hungary, and Russia, and analyze the present situation in many Eastern and Western European countries. Until recently, a merging between a certain party and the army leadership was evident in the former states of the Warsaw Pact. The minister of defense said that this is the situation even today in some democratic countries. Colleagues in Germany, Austria, and France are also party members. However, this was dangerous at our state of democratic development, because if a member of any political party becomes the minister of defense, this could cause a politicization of the army. In the United States, the President is also the supreme commander-in-chief and prime minister. The U.S. secretary of defense is a coordinating official, while the chairman of the United Chiefs of Staffs has direct access to the supreme commander-in- chief. This is a very good model for the developing democracies. However, there is another model -- the Latin American one -- the defense minister said. There, the head of the General Staff could organize a coup whenever he wanted. Fortunately, we are far away from this model. Minister Aleksandrov said that the president would find it very difficult to be the supreme commander-in-chief in times of a war if he was not a military expert. Therefore, in the case of war the General Staff should have broader prerogatives. According to the minister of defense, the issue of the General Staff chief also co-signing ministerial orders was artificially fanned. After all, the General Staff knows the army and its officers best. Army Gen. Lyuben Petrov, chief of the Bulgarian Army General Staff, greeted the idea of the Center on Training National Security Cadres to organize a seminar for the journalists. He assured the journalists that, at present, there were no problems between the defense minister and the General Staff chief. However, this must be incorporated in a law, because there was no guarantee that if today the things in this sphere are well, the situation would remain the same tomorrow, when the circumstances and the persons involved change. Army Gen. Petrov outlined some challenges of our foreign policy, and certain risk factors related to the complex military-political situation in the Balkans. Among them he listed the imbalance between troops, arms, and military equipment that exists in the peninsula, the ethnic and religious conflicts, the crime rate, the drug traffic, and so on. He stressed that the military security guarantees will play an important role despite the political efforts to guarantee the stability. The military doctrine is a system of fundamental views related to preventing military conflicts and defending the country that have been officially accepted, Army Gen. Petrov continued. It was developed during the last year and subjected to many discussions. A theoretical conference on the military doctrine has been conducted. The Supreme Military Council and the General Staff Military Council reviewed the doctrine. After certain corrections were inserted by the Council of Ministers, the doctrine was ready, and it will be submitted to the National Assembly. The military doctrine is the conceptual foundation of both the military policy of our state institutions and the activity of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff regarding the armed forces' construction, training, and strategic use. The military doctrine is the foundation of the activity of the state leadership and the armed forces in guaranteeing the country's security. It is an open system and could be amended in accordance with the changes in the military-political situation and the strategic concepts of the state leadership, the chief of the Bulgarian Army General Staff said in conclusion.
