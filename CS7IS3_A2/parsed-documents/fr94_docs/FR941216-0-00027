FR941216-0-00027 FR941216-0-00010 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 48 CFR Parts 525 and 552 [APD 2800.12A, CHGE 59] RIN 3090&hyph;AF12 General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation; Implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding Between the United States of America and the European Economic Community (EC) on Government Procurement and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) AGENCY: Office of Acquisition Policy, GSA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule amends the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation to incorporate the temporary change made by Acquisition Circular (AC&hyph;93&hyph;1) which implemented the Memorandum of Understanding between the United States and the European Economic Community (EC) on Government Procurement and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The rule is essentially the same as the Circular that appeared in the Federal Register on December 30, 1993 (58 FR 69243), except for minor modifications. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Edward J. McAndrew, Office of GSA Acquisition Policy, (202) 501&hyph;1224. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Public Comments A temporary rule was published in the Federal Register on December 30, 1993 (58 FR 69243) in order to meet the January 1, 1994, effective date for implementation of NAFTA. The temporary rule invited public comments. No public comments were received. B. Executive Order 12866 This rule was not submitted to the Office of Management and Budget because it is not a significant rule as defined in Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act The changes do not appear to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et sequentia because they permit offerors to use EC and NAFTA country end products or construction materials above certain thresholds without application of Buy American Act preference. For this reason, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. No comments from small entities were received. D. Paperwork Reduction Act The provision at 552.225&hyph;75, Buy American Act Notice-Construction Materials, which is being modified by this rule, does contain an information collection requirement. However, the revision does not affect the information collection requirements that have previously been approved by OMB and assigned Control Number 3090&hyph;0198.
