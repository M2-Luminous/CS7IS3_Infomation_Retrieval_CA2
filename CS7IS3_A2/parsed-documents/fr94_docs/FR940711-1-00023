FR940711-1-00023 FR940711-1-00003 Under the first alternative, the proposed rule provides that if in a specific circumstance an appropriate State authority explicitly considers and deals with retail stranded costs and there is no conflict within or among State regulatory bodies regarding a State's disposition of the issue, this Commission will not entertain a request for retail stranded cost recovery. However, in the absence of a clear expression by an appropriate State authority that it has dealt with the issue, or in the event of a conflict between States 60 or among State officials within a single state, the Commission proposes to entertain requests to recover retail stranded costs. 60 For example, a conflict between States could result if State A's legislature allows a former retail customer to become a wholesale entity and the wholesale entity obtains transmission services so that it now takes only one half of its 100 MW load from its current utility supplier, which is a multistate utility. As a result of State A's action, the utility has retail stranded costs for 50 MW of generation. State A's commission allocates the utility's retail costs so that State A's retail customers are responsible for only one half of the stranded costs. State B's commission, the other State in which the utility operates, allocates the utility's retail costs so that none of the retail stranded costs are allocated to State B's retail customers. Under the second alternative, the proposed rule provides that the Commission will not entertain any request for recovery of retail stranded costs. Under this proposal, State or local authorities will be the only forum for addressing the issue. The aforementioned preference for States to address retail stranded costs in whatever way they deem appropriate, the need for regulatory certainty, and the States' knowledge and expertise regarding utility planning, investment and purchase activities arguably favors the second alterative. However, we solicit comment on whether there should be limited exceptions to the second alternative rule. As to both alternatives, the Commission solicits comments on the following questions. Are there circumstances under which it is not necessarily appropriate to defer to the States (e.g., where one State takes an action regarding retail stranded costs which has adverse consequences for another State)? Are there circumstances under which a State may not have an adequate mechanism for addressing retail stranded costs, and may want the Commission to provide a forum? If a State does not explicitly address stranded costs resulting from an action that allows retail customers to purchase from a supplier other than the franchised utility, should this Commission entertain requests from the utilities left with the stranded costs? Beyond silence from the State, are there other factors that the Commission should consider before accepting requests for retail stranded cost recovery? Specifically, would financial health and possible adverse impacts on reliability be sufficient reason for Federal action? The Commission further solicits comments on the following questions: (1) Does the Commission have legal authority to allow retail stranded costs in rates for wholesale transmission services? Should the Commission do so as a matter of policy? If so, which costs? (2) Does the Commission have legal authority to allow retail stranded costs in rates for retail transmission service? Should the Commission do so as a matter of policy? If so, which costs? (3) Does FPA section 212 give the Commission legal authority to allow recovery of retail stranded costs in rates for wholesale transmission services under FPA section 211? (4) Are there legal or policy reasons why in Scenario 2 (p. 15), the Commission should entertain requests for recovery of retail stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates, but should not entertain requests for recovery of retail stranded costs in retail transmission rates in Scenario 3 (section III.A.)? If the Commission determines that it will entertain requests for recovery of retail stranded costs through rates for wholesale or retail transmission in interstate commerce, the Commission proposes not to apply the ``reasonable expectation'' test used for wholesale stranded costs. To apply such a test would require a hearing on whether the franchise utility had a reasonable expectation, e.g., of having its franchise renewed, of municipalization occurring, or of a section 212(h) non-sham wholesale entity being created by the State or local authority. No such test appears warranted because, in general, there is at the retail level an obligation to serve which is much stronger than any contractual obligation to serve at the wholesale level. The regulatory compact that has governed provision of retail service includes an implicit obligation to purchase concomitant with the utility's obligation to serve. The Commission requests comments on whether these assumptions are correct, i.e., is the reasonable expectation test inapplicable to retail stranded costs? Are there situations, for instance, in which utilities could have expected municipalization to occur based on an established course of dealing? Based on these assumptions, if the Commission determines that it will entertain requests for retail stranded costs, the proposed regulations for retail stranded costs would require only a showing of the dollar amounts that have been stranded as a result of the retail customer no longer taking bundled service from the franchise utility's system. In essence, this results in direct assignment of retail stranded costs to the former franchise customer. The Commission requests comments on how to determine retail stranded costs as a general matter. Is there a future time when a retail customer's action of leaving a local franchise no longer has any adverse economic consequences on the franchise utility? If so, what is an appropriate way to make such a determination?
