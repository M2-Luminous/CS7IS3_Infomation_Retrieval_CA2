The gross domestic product [GDP] decreased by 15 percent in three years, although the decline appears to have stopped this year and it is possible that a solid growth will start next year. The question is how fast and lasting the upturn will be. A brief period of growth could easily be followed by another decline. In order to avoid this, the banking system has to be put in order, a further swelling of the budget deficit has to be curbed, and Hungarian exports have to increase. We interviewed Finance Minister Ivan Szabo on the chances and the effect of the factors that depend on us and that are independent of us. [Varga] Recently you said a number of times that the Hungarian economy has arrived at the threshold of growth. What is the basis for this statement? [Szabo] When we talk about the whole economy, we have to look at its various elements. One of these is industry, which started to move in a positive direction from the fourth quarter of 1992 and production has been increasing every month. It seems that, by the end of the year, industry will have produced 4 percent more than in 1992. Agriculture is in an emphatically bad situation, it has many wounds. On the basis of yields and the sown area, it can be established that the drought that has lasted many years and caused specially large damage this year caused most losses. However, it has to be admitted that the changeover also has a price: The slowest structural change is in agriculture and it is far behind the pace of industrial transformation. Services that include transport is the third big area of the economy. There is a general boom in the service sector. The small and medium size enterprises that are part of the private sphere in this sector have reached as much as 15 to 20 percent growth. On the other hand, road, railway, and water transport suffered untold losses, mainly due to the Yugoslav embargo. Therefore, we can conclude that the economy is drawn back by the low performance of agriculture and transport. Otherwise the GDP would already be showing an increase. Special Support to Agriculture [Varga] How much loss does the UN embargo cause to Hungary? [Szabo] According to calculations, this now reaches $1.2 billion. However, it has to be added that $300 million arose in 1992 and this year's figure approaches $900 million. [Varga] What does the government do to improve the situation in agriculture, which is the main crisis sector? [Szabo] The government is trying its best, but it can only be hoped that the many-years-long drought will end. The amount of agricultural support will increase by 20 percent in the 1994 budget. I expect much from the fruition of the association agreement with the European Union. In this respect, it is positive that the GATT talks have ended, which also gives Hungary more room for maneuver. Unfortunately, in the area of transport, we cannot expect significant changes until the situation outside our border changes. If Recession Ends.... [Varga] Experts also admit that a solid growth can be expected next year, but they immediately ask how lasting the growth is going to be. They mention the deficit of the state administration as the main hindering factor. [Szabo] Undoubtedly, the level of the deficit of state administration causes liquidity problems in the economy. The reason is that the state bonds tie up the mobile capital of the banks. However, two factors have to be added to this. One is that our state administration's deficit would not be one of the worst in Western Europe. It is a different matter that, in their case, the budget deficit is in an economy that is operating better than ours. In addition to this the crisis that was caused by the collapse of the Soviet Union can be felt everywhere. Compared to the GDP, the deficit is twice as much in Sweden, and one and a half to two times as much in England and Belgium. I think that we managed to stop the increase of the budget deficit this year. It seems that we will be able to keep to the level of the deficit defined in this year's supplementary budget. I honestly hope that we will also be able to say the same next year. If we reach this point, then the many- years-long process, namely that the deficit is always bigger than planned, will be reversed. [Varga] Do you feel that the economy can now start on a course of lasting growth? [Szabo] I am convinced that it can. However, it has to be seen clearly that Hungary's economy is basically dependent on foreign markets and more than half of the gross national product is sold abroad. Therefore, Hungarian economic development mainly depends on the West European countries. The fact that we did not manage to achieve growth this year is largely a consequence of the decline there. The forecasts referring to the European Union and the European Free Trade Association [EFTA] indicate that economic growth will also start there in 1994. A modest growth in Western Europe can have a decisive effect on Hungarian exports. A 1-percent growth abroad can increase Hungarian exports by as much as 25 percent. Therefore, to answer the question how lasting the growth will be, I can say that this depends very much on foreign market conditions. [Varga] Bank and debtor consolidation will be implemented in December 1993 and next year. According to the government's promise, this is the last step to putting the economy back in order. [Szabo] This is needed because all losses that have accumulated in the economy over the past years now appear as dubious or bad debts. This is where everything culminates. The majority of bad debts originate from the crisis of circular debts that has been pushed along since 1988 and 1989, and it amounted to 300 billion [currency not specified] already then. And at that time, the forint had a different value. Putting this area in order will eliminate most of the ruins forever. On one hand, bank and debtor consolidation gives an opportunity for the economy to rid itself of burdens that even effect enterprises that operate well. This helps preserve workplaces that, after a while, will lead to reducing the solidarity fund and welfare expenditure. The other result of the tidying up of banks will be that the capital ratio of domestic banks will improve. The stability of the various financial institutions will increase and the gap between interest rate on deposits and loans will narrow. The improvement of the capital ratio will also increase the privatization chances of banks. [Varga] What is needed to be able to sell the currently rather-shaky banks on good terms? [Szabo] According to European norms, a normally operating capital ratio is at around 8 percent, and banks that have less than this find it difficult to find a buyer. The capital ratio of Hungarian banks is incredibly low, it is usually under 0 percent. If we privatizaed a bank under these circumstances, I am afraid that it would have to be given away free and even then the buyer would be generous. If the state was not putting 300 billion forints into the banking sector then the buyers would have to do this. It is obvious that, if we do not consolidate the banks, then we will lose the purchase price. However, raising the capital ratio to 4 percent or even higher will make it possible for us to sell the banks on better conditions. At the same time, it is much easier to increase this figure from 4 or 6 percent to above 8 percent. In this case, it will be worth buying a bank, especially if the investor group can acquire a significant economic role through this. I believe that the technical and finance-technical conditions will be adequate by the middle of next year for bank privatization to begin. [Varga] The investors of which countries show most interest? [Szabo] Mainly European interest is big which we can also see from the fact that many foreign banks, not having found any healthy Hungarian banks, have established subsidiaries in Hungary. However, I must add that interest is shown literally from all over the world, because even a Malay bank was recently established in Budapest. Interestingly, the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] shows a remarkably great interest in bank privatization and it would like to become part owner of several Hungarian financial institutions. The Stages of Integration [Varga] Whether we look at the import of capital or the export of goods, contacts with Western Europe is the key issue of the Hungarian economy's development. In your view, when will Hungary be admitted to the European Union [EU]? [Szabo] In my view, EU membership has many conditions. One is legal harmonization, and the institutional structure also has to be set up. In my view, we are not behind in these. The transitional period while we are associate members will be enough for us to prepare for the membership. Considering all this, I expect that full membership will be possible to achieve sometime between 1997 and 2000. By this time, our institutional and economic development can reach the point at which unification will not be much of a problem either for Europe or for Hungary. [Varga] Will the political or the economic conditions of membership be more difficult to fulfill? [Szabo] Economic conditions certainly play a determining role. Politically it is also important for Europe that the countries of this region are economically solid, otherwise we can also shake their stability. This would have far-reaching negative political consequences. It is a completely different matter that economic integration has to be concomitant with some kind of integration in security policy. However, I believe it is Western Europe's fundamental interest that these countries that are economically linked to it do not belong somewhere else politically. The one supposes the other. [Varga] How do you assess the achievements so far? [Szabo] I believe that Hungary has been taking the hurdles of transition very well. The challenges in our region are huge. I think that if Hungary wants to create serious chances for itself, then 1994 will be a good occasion for this. We have to preserve the Hungarian economy from disarray, hyper-inflation, or chaos. If Hungary remains to be an island of peace, both in political and economic terms, then it can make a very big step forward. It can prove to the world that Hungary does not follow fashions and avoids right- or left-wing extremism and this meets the European standards.
