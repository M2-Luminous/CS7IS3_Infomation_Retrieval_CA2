The Black Cockerel [UNITA] has actually congratulated the United States through the voice of its spokesman Jorge Valentim who said that the important thing is to bring the war to an end: [Begin Valentim recording] We in UNITA have always wanted the United States to take this attitude. We congratulate the White House, the U.S. Administration. It is high time the war was made to stop at once. We congratulate President Clinton. [end recording] The Luanda government also agrees with Clinton but wants more international pressure on UNITA, as [presidential spokesman] Aldomiro da Conceicao has told us: [Begin da Conceicao recording] The presidency of the Republic of Angola has welcomed with satisfaction the view expressed by the United States on the question of the recrudescence of the war in Angola. However, we take the view that greater pressure should be exerted on UNITA to lead it to show real willingness to bring this conflict to an end. [end recording] The United States says that either there is an end to the hostilities in Angola or the Lusaka peace negotiations will be cut short.
