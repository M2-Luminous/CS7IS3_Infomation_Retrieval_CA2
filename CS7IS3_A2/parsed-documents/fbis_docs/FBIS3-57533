The people's deputies addressed the problems of the Belarusian Peasant Party and the Minsk Tractor Factory, and honored the memory of writer Ales Adamovich by a minute of silence. Then it was resolved to hold necessary consultations to select candidates for the post of the Supreme Soviet chairman. However, even after a two-hour break in the proceedings, during which the sessions of the Supreme Soviet Presidium and parliamentary factions took place, the people's deputies deemed this issue to be unprepared for broad discussion. They decided to fully devote today's proceedings in commissions and deputy factions to the nomination of candidates for the post of the Supreme Soviet chairman. This issue is expected to be discussed at the plenary session tomorrow.
