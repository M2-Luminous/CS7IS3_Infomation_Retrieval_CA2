The statement said taking the film cassettes and hindering television cameramen were direct obstruction of press organizations. The statement also said these incidents were not only attacks on journalists but at the same time limitations of the right to receiving news. Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP) deputy Salman Kaya was beaten by police during Sunday's May Day demonstrations. In Ankara a demonstration by the `democratic platform' which was organized by Turk-Is, DISK and Hak-Is unions, started quietly at noon, but failed to end the same way when a group of demonstrators refused to disperse afterward. Their refusals triggered a clash during which the demonstrators divided into two groups. One group started stoning cars. A man who fell over the Sihhiye bridge during the clash with the police and who was taken to hospital is not in critical condition. Officials said a number of people have been detained for `provocation of the people'. May Day was celebrated by various rallies in Turkey as `the day for international unity, solidarity and struggle.' Economic rather that political slogans were spoken during the rallies. The leaders of the Turkish Confederation of Trade Unions (Turk-Is), the Confederation of Revolutionary Trade Unions (DISK) and the Hak-Is confederation united under the democratic platform in Istanbul. Together with the three confederations, the syndicates of public employees and democratic mass organizations also held rallies in Izmir, Adana, Bursa, and Samsun.
