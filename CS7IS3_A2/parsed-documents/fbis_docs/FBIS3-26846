Ma Zhongzhi, deputy director of the Securities Administrative Commission's General Office and the relevant persons in charge of the China Securities Supervision Council, respectively, spoke in connection with stock markets and some related policies in 1994. Ma Zhongzhi said: With the approval of the State Council, China will issue 5.5 billion worth of renminbi stocks this year, roughly the same amount as last year after readjustment. This amount has been determined after taking full account of the financial capabilities of this year's stock markets. Ma Zhongzhi said: In issuing stocks in 1994, the method of controlling the total supply and demand and the method of quota administration will still be adopted. At present, the total amount of stock has been determined, but the stocks have not been distributed to localities and departments. In view of the reality that the issuing of stock in 1993 was carried out largely after August and that some enterprises have postponed their issuing of stock to this year, in issuing stock this year it is necessary to take into full account the financial capabilities of the market. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the work of reexamining the issuing of stock, enforce the examination and approval system strictly, and through the reexamination process, safeguard the state's industrial policies and the quality of companies whose stocks are listed. Turning to the listing of state stocks and corporate stocks, Ma Zhongzhi said: The majority of enterprises in China which have switched to the shareholding system have been state-owned enterprises. In this process, stocks have been divided into state stocks, corporate stocks, individual stocks, and foreign stocks according to the actual conditions and needs of the time. Both state stocks and corporate stocks, being ordinary stocks, should share profits on an equal basis. Currently, however, only individual stocks and a small amount of corporate stocks are listed on the stock market, while state stocks have not yet been listed. Ma Zhongzhi pointed out: In the long run, this problem must be solved. However, in actual operations, many problems still remain in the listing of corporate stocks, because of the lack of good, feasible laws and regulations. Ma Zhongzhi said: The State Council has ordered the State Economic Restructuring Commission and its Securities Administrative Commission to step up the drawing up of relevant laws and regulations on the basis of summing up past experimentation experiences, to expand experiments in this field after the relevant laws and regulations are approved by the State Council, and for the time being, to temporarily suspend the examination and approval of applications for the listing of new corporate stocks. Ma Zhongzhi stressed: Even if measures for administering the listing of corporate stocks are promulgated, it will be impossible to list all at once all corporate stocks, which have accumulated over the years. The listing of corporate stocks should be solved step by step while taking into account the financial and technical capabilities of the market. Because the listing of state stocks is facing an even greater number of problems, it will be impossible to list them ahead of corporate stocks. He stressed: The listing of state stocks requires a process. Turning to the problem of issuing renminbi stocks domestically by enterprises whose stocks have been listed outside the national boundaries, Ma Zhongzhi said: Last year, the stocks of six Chinese enterprises were successfully listed in Hong Kong, which attracted the attention of financial and press circles the world over. The move opened up a new path for China to attract foreign capital and also helped to speed up the linking of China's securities markets with the world market as quickly as possible. In accordance with the instructions of the leadership of the State Council, a relevant department of state has decided that 22 enterprises will have their stocks listed outside of China this year. Ma Zhongzhi said: Each of these enterprises will be transformed according to a standardized shareholding system and audited according to international practices. After that, their stocks will be listed when conditions are ripe. Their stocks will be listed mainly in Hong Kong, but a small number of them may list their stocks in the securities markets of the United States and other countries. Ma Zhongzhi noted: Taking into consideration the fact that the amount of stocks to be issued this year must be kept within 5.5 billion yuan, that enterprises which are going to list their stocks outside China are all state-owned enterprises, and that the amount will be too large if these enterprises are to issue A-type stocks, the Securities Administrative Commission under the State Council has decided that these enterprises will not issue A-type stocks for the time being and that even if they want to issue A-type stocks, they must keep the amount under 5.5 billion yuan. Turning to the administration of stocks for internal staff and workers issued by shareholding limited companies whose funds are raised directly, Ma Zhongzhi said: At present, in issuing stocks for internal staff and workers, some of these companies have exceeded the proportion and limits, have made public internal stocks, and have individualized corporate stocks, all of which run counter to the original purpose of setting up such companies. Therefore, the State Council recently issued a circular explicitly banning various areas from engaging in the high-interest-rate collection of funds in the name of carrying out experiments on the internal shareholding system. The State Council has also asked the State Economic Restructuring Commission to cooperate with the State Economics and Trade Commission and the State Planning Commission to accelerate the enactment of standard measures for administering enterprises' issuing of internal stocks for staff and workers. Ma Zhongzhi said: Before the new measures are promulgated, the state will temporarily suspend the examination, approval, and issuing of stocks for internal staff and workers. To deal with enterprises which violate these measures, the state will not reexamine their applications to issue stocks, and still less, to permit their stocks to be listed. At the news conference, the persons in charge of the China Securities Supervision Council told reporters about the illegal activities of the Shanghai securities office of the Xiangfan Trust and Investment Company under the Agricultural Bank of China in the course of serving as an agent for dealing in the stocks of an enterprise in Shanghai and the decision taken to punish the violator.
