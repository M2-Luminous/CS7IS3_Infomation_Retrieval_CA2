Several deputies are disturbed by the lack of communication with Reina, as they explained in a letter sent to his brother, Mario Reina, who works next to the president's office. Shortly after Reina was elected president on 28 November 1993, the deputies challenged him in a struggle for the presidency of the legislative branch, a position won by Carlos Flores, a politician who leads the most conservative faction within the PLH. Reina wanted to place his brother, Jorge Arturo Reina, at the head of the legislative body, but most deputies supported Carlos Flores, presidential hopeful for the 1997 presidential elections. In the end, Jorge Reina was elected Congress vice president. The loss of leadership in Congress weakened President Reina's administration. Santiago David Amador, chief of the PLH legislative wing, sent a letter to Mario Reina stating the "need to immediately establish the communication and dialogue agreed upon by the president of the Republic and the president of Congress." "I must say that the apprehension of my fellow deputies is increasing to the point that if no immediate decision is made, it would be very difficult for us to harmonize relations between our party's legislative wing and the executive branch," the letter adds. Reina is having difficulties in obtaining approximately $1.5 million to pay the employees who will be dismissed, which keeps PLH supporters from occupying those public posts. A few days ago the president was confronted with a demonstration in front of his house, where some PLH supporters threatened to withdraw from the party's future campaigns. Deputy Roberto Micheletti of the pro-Flores faction on Thursday accused Reina's private secretary Luicio Izaguirre of being "a clown who only cheered like a cheerleader" in the political campaign rallies. PLH Deputy Victoria Contreras, also a pro-Flores deputy, accused Mario Reina of not honoring a pact "to place" her supporters "in public posts." Deputy Santiago Amador said this is not a confrontation between Congress and the executive but that "blanks are being fired to convey a message." In practice, however, it has created a new dispute between the two state branches. Every four years in Honduras, the party that wins the elections usually fires the employees of the losing party to give jobs to its supporters. The government is the largest employer in the country, with a payroll of some 40,000 public servants.
