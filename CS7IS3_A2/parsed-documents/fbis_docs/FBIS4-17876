Vladimir Bezkorovaynyy's Former Colleagues Would Like To Know When He Was Honest"] [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The submariners of the Northern Fleet relate the illegal actions against Black Sea Fleet personnel directly to their former colleague, Vice Admiral Vladimir Bezkorokaynyy, currently commander in chief of the Ukraine Navy. More than 30 admirals and senior officers of the unit, which in the past was under Vladimir Gerasimovich's command, signed an open letter to "Pan Admiral" with the only aim: to understand when their former colleague was honest with them and himself. Either on the day the State Committee for the State of Emergency was formed, when he "solemnly announced before servicemen in formation the long-awaited eclipse of democracy," or four days later, when he "swore loyalty to the new ruling authority." Or maybe when he called: "Let us stand up for Russia! We shall not allow the union of fraternal peoples welded by blood to be destroyed." Or when guys in camouflage uniform committed acts of arbitrariness with respect to the families of those who only a few months ago "you called Black Sea Fleet heroes." [passage omitted]
