FR941102-1-00009 FR941102-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;12&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Beech Aircraft Corporation 33, 35, and 36 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive 92&hyph;08&hyph;07, which currently requires inspecting (one-time) the wing front spar carry-through frame structure for cracks on certain Beech 33, 35, and 36 series airplanes, and, if found cracked, repairing or reinforcing. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received 43 reports of wing front spar carry-through frame structure cracks on the affected airplanes during the inspection required by AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07. The proposed action would make this one-time inspection repetitive. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent spar carry-through structure failure, which could result in severe structural damage to the wing. DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;12&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, holidays excepted. Service information that applies to the proposed AD may be obtained from the Beech Aircraft Corporation, P.O. Box 85, Wichita, Kansas 67201-0085. This information also may be examined at the Rules Docket at the address above. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Larry Engler, Aerospace Engineer, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, 1801 Airport Road, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4122; facsimile (316) 946&hyph;4407. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA- public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;12&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;12&hyph;AD, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Discussion AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;8218 (57 FR 13004, April 15, 1992), currently requires inspecting (one-time) the wing front spar carry-through frame structure for cracks on certain Beech 33, 35, and 36 series airplanes, and, if found cracked, repairing or reinforcing. These actions are accomplished in accordance with Beech Service Bulletin (SB) No. 2360, dated November 1990. Since this AD became effective, the FAA has received 43 reports of wing front spar carry-through frame structure cracks on Beech 33, 35, and 36 series airplanes during the inspection required by AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07. Several of these affected airplanes had cracks between huckbolts that incur heavy loads and along the radius of the carry-through web in critical primary airframe structure. These cracks, if not detected and corrected, could result in wing front spar carry-through structure failure, which could result in severe structural damage to the wing. After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above, the FAA has determined that the inspection required by AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07 should be repetitive. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Beech 33, 35, and 36 airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07 with a new AD that would require repetitively inspecting the wing front spar carry-through structure for cracks, and, if found cracked, repairing or replacing. The proposed action would be accomplished in accordance with Beech SB No. 2360, dated November 1990. The FAA estimates that 11,000 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 8 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,840,000. This figure does not account for repetitive inspections. The only difference between the cost analysis for this proposed action and AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07 (which would be superseded by this proposed action) is the cost of these repetitive inspections. The FAA has no way of determining the number of repetitive inspections an owner/operator may incur.
