The Committee meeting to deliberate on the election results in the five States of the Northern belt and the future implications of the verdict for the party appears to have been dominated by the Union Welfare Minister, Mr. Sitaram Kesri, who has been highly critical in the last four days of the leadership for its failure to capitalise on the fertile ground for the Congress(I) in the Hindi heartland. To continue: The party spokesman, Mr. V.N. Gadgil, who briefed correspondents on the deliberations of the Committee meeting, said only six members of the CWC got an opportunity to express their views on the just concluded elections and the Committee would continue with the introspection session tomorrow. Mr. Kesri, who was the first speaker at the meeting, was expected to continue with his speech tomorrow as he had to leave mid-way to attend an official function. Among those who took part in the two and half hour meeting were Mr. R.K. Dhawan, Mr. A.K. Antony, Mr. Sitaram Kesri, Mr. N.D. Tiwary, Mr. K. Karunakaran and Mr. Pranab Mukherjee. Presided over by the party president, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, the meeting was attended by all the memberts barring four who were busy either in Shimla or Jaipur in managing the post-poll situation in these States. Those absent at the meeting included Mr. Rajesh Pilot, Mr. Balram Jakhar and Mr. Nawal Kishore Sharma. In response to questions, Mr. Gadgil said two members of the Committee disapproved of the letter of the Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Mr. P.R. Kumaramangalam, seeking the resignation of all members of the CWC for their collective failure in managing the U.P. Assembly election. Asked about the reported resignation of Mr. Kumaramangalam, Mr. Gadgil expressed surprise over the development and said he was not aware of any such resignation. Supports Rao: In his presentation before the CWC, Mr. R.K. Dhawan is reported to have argued in favour of Mr. Narasimha Rao and maintained that the defeat of the BJP was a historic achievement for the party. He referred to 'deliberate attempts' by vested interests to project that the Congress(I) was nowhere in the picture and said the rank and file in the party had proved beyond doubt that the party was strong and the people were behind it. Mr. Kesri in his speech is reported to have complained that the party did not succeed in projecting the achievements of the Government for the welfare of the backward classes, particularly its decision to implement the Mandal Commission report. He pleaded that Committee members take note of the changed social reality, particularly in U.P., and emphasised the need to create a more pro-backward and minorities image. A strong plea for greater representation of BCs and minorities in the party power structures was also made. The controversial issue of distribution of tickets among the kith and kin of the big guns in the party in Rajasthan and the consequent damage to the prospects of the party in the State also figured in the course of the deliberations. However, no names were mentioned in this connection. It was mentioned that the success in Madhya Pradesh was partly due to the distribution of party tickets to 80-odd members of backward classes. The Committee was told that the minorities in other States opted for the Congress only because they had no choice unlike as in U.P. A suggestion was made for strengthening the Seva Dal as a volunteer force to match the RSS. Research wing: There was a suggestion for the creation of a research wing to analyse the election results particularly in Uttar Pradesh. It was mentioned that of the 28 seats, won by the party in the State, 20 had been captured after a gap of several years. It was also said that in Madhya Pradesh, there was consistency in the performance of the party in the 1991 Lok Sabha and the current Assembly elections and a point was made whether there was any model which could be replicated from the M.P. example. A member of the Committee suggested that a three-day extended session of the CWC meeting be called after the coming session of Parliament for a detailed review of the election results. The CWC would consider the suggestion tomorrow. The ongoing session of the CWC is certain to overshadow the scheduled customary meeting of the Congress(I) Parliamentary Party coinciding with the winter session of Parliament tomorrow.
