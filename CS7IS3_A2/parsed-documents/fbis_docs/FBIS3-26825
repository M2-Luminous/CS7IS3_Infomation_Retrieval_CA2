Chen Huanyou, secretary of the provincial party committee and provincial governor, made an important speech at the conference. Cao Hongming, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and secretary of the Commission on Politics and Law under the provincial party committee, presided over the conference. After fully affirming the work done by the procuratorial and judicial front in Jiangsu in 1993, Chen Huanyou said in his speech: To fulfill our province's objectives by the end of this century, we must have a stable social and political environment as our guarantee. Reform, opening up to the outside world, and economic development on the one hand and stability on the other form a unity, and they are mutually promoting each other. Without economic development, there will be no foundation for stability; at the same time, without a stable environment, we will not succeed in doing anything, for stability is the basic condition for reform and opening up to the outside world. This year is crucial for us to push forward the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. In accordance with the unified plans of the party Central Committee, we will introduce a series of major reform measures. Party committees and governments at all levels must have a good understanding of this. They must not only seize the opportunities and accelerate development, but also stick to the principle of "grasping two links at the same time and attaching importance to both" and attach special importance to the safeguarding of social and political stability. Procuratorial and judicial departments at all levels, as the main force and the departments whose functions are to maintain social and political stability, must have a clear understanding of the situation and the heavy responsibility they are bearing. They should further enhance their sense of responsibility and their awareness of their mission, exercise their functions scrupulously, work hard, and continue to play a role in maintaining a social and political environment characterized by stability and unity. Chen Huanyou pointed out: In carrying out their work in 1994, procuratorial and judicial departments should focus on the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the main tasks set by the national conference on judicial and public security work; while concentrating on the requirements for establishing a socialist market economic structure and on the task of ensuring the smooth progress of reform, they should conduct thorough investigations and studies, closely rely on the masses, further improve their standard of implementing policies and enforcing the law, and go all out to safeguard social and political stability. Procuratorial and judicial organs must uphold the people's democratic dictatorship to fully exercise their functions and role. All localities must promptly organize forces to effectively crack down on criminal elements and to resolutely check the increasing incidents of serious crimes; do a good job of providing legal services in line with the needs of the new situation; adhere to the principle of integrating specialized organs and the masses; implement the measures for the overall improvement of social security; do a good job in reforming procuratorial and judicial work; and strive to raise the standard of their work. Chen Huanyou stressed: It is our steadfast principle to strengthen the party leadership over procuratorial and judicial work. Party committees and governments at all levels must further strengthen their leadership over this work and grasp firmly in their hands the important task of safeguarding social stability. He said: We must always concentrate on economic construction. At the same time, we must always bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's elaboration of the principle of "grasping two links at the same time and attaching importance to both," never slacken our work of maintaining social and political stability, and never allow the erroneous tendency of grasping economic work while slackening efforts to fight crime to reappear again. In the future, we must act according to the stipulations of the party Central Committee and make the state of social security an important criterion for evaluating party leading cadres. Chen Huanyou said: Party committees, governments, and leading cadres at all levels must consciously safeguard the dignity of law and help procuratorial and judicial organs to strictly exercise their functions according to law. We must strengthen law enforcement supervision. Anyone who ignores the dignity of law and interferes with the handling of cases according to law, no matter who he is, must be strictly dealt with. We must effectively strengthen the building of a contingent of procuratorial and judicial personnel. First of all, we must strengthen the leading bodies of procuratorial and judicial organs by promoting to the leading bodies cadres who are young and capable, politically sound, professionally competent, and who are impartial in exercising their functions. At the same time, we must guard against admitting bad people into the leading bodies. We should pay attention to education and training work and raise the political and professional quality of the police force. Party committees and governments at all levels should show concern for and attach importance to the solution of practical difficulties faced by procuratorial and judicial organs. Yu Xingde, member of the Standing Committee of the provincial party committee, provincial vice governor, and deputy secretary of the Commission on Politics and Law under the provincial party committee, made a summed-up report at the conference. He called on all localities to earnestly implement this conference's guidelines and ensure the fulfillment of this year's procuratorial and judicial tasks. He said: At present, it is imperative to ensure political and social stability around the time of the Spring Festival this year so as to guarantee that the people of the province will have a happy, harmonious, and peaceful Spring Festival. Also attending the conference were Cao Keming, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee; and Hu Fuming, Gu Hao, and Li Yunshi, members of the Standing Committee of the provincial party committee.
