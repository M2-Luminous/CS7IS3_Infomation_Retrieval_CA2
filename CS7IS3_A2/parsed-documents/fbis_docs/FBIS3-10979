Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 26 February reports that the Havana National Revolutionary Police arrested members of two gangs, most in their teens, who had been stealing from homes and stores in Nuevo Vedado and Alamar. These individuals comprised three organized groups of thieves who stole bicycles and other items. Before entering a house they observed it to determine the residents' goods and schedules. They operated mainly at dawn while the inhabitants slept. Most of the stolen bicycles have been recovered by the police. Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 28 February reports on arrests in connection with 32,000 liters of milk, worth over 8,000 pesos at the official price, missing from the Beatriz milk pasteurizing plant which belongs to the Havana City Metropolitan Milk Products Enterprise in Arroyo Naranjo Municipality. At least nine persons benefited from this illegal activity: the head of the distribution and sales department, an accountant, an office worker, and a driver from the factory and two clerks and three administrators from milk distribution points in Diez de Octubre Municipality. They admitted to having falsified distribution documents in complicity with the employees of the milk-selling units. "In their confessions, those incriminated said they sold the milk at prices far higher than those set by the laws of the state." "This crime shows the lack of scruples of the accused, who stole milk earmarked mainly for feeding children solely so they could enjoy a living standard far higher than their real possibilities. At the present, when the state is employing important resources to guarantee the population's food supply, in our society there still exist people who, to satisfy their appetites for material goods, are capable of stealing foods earmarked for the population." The people involved will be charged with misappropriation. "According to the penal code, whoever appropriates state property of considerable value entrusted to his care will be sanctioned by a prison term of from eight to 20 years." Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 2 March reports that the National Revolutionary Police arrested a number of people for allegedly stealing 12,000 kg of polypropylene from a plastics factory in Havana and selling it on the black market. Some of the arrested were employees of the factory. Over 17,000 pesos were confiscated from one of the arrested. Radio Rebelde Network at 1255 GMT on 9 March reports a recent attempt to steal and slaughter some oxen from the Santa Maria Cattle Farm, a Basic Cooperative Production Unit in Holguin. All the thieves were caught in the act and handed over to the police.
