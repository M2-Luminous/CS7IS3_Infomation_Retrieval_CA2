Our reporter in Oslo, Ulla-Maria Johansen reports: Fisheries Minister Jan Henry Olsen and Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland are satisfied with the negotiations' result, which the fisheries minister regards as better in many respects than the negotiations' result of 1972. According to Prime Minister Brundtland, Norway has achieved a good agreement and she recommends that Norway should now grasp the historic opportunity and take part with its Nordic neighbors in the political cooperation on our continent. Anne Enger Lahnstein, chairman of the Center Party opposing EU membership, is of a different view. One of the central issues of the agreement is the Norwegian model of control over the fish stocks, which is due to be transferred to the EU after the transitional period as part of the EU's fishing policy. Lahnstein thinks that the agreement is bad and it will turn the sea region north of the 62d latitude into an EU sea. Norway will not receive guarantees that after the transitional period it will control the fish stocks in the Barents Sea. The leader of the citizens' movement against the EU, Christen Nygaard, thinks that Norway surrendered during the talks. He regards the fishing agreement as serious for the whole coast. The leader of the European Movement favoring EU membership, Inge Loenning, thinks for his part that the negotiated fishing agreement is so good that he believes it will guarantee a majority in favor of membership in the referendum.
