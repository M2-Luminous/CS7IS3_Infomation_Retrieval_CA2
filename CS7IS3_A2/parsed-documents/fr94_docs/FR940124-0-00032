FR940124-0-00032 FR940124-0-00003 (i) The purchase price discount, as determined by the definition in paragraph (a) of this section and stated in the note as a dollar amount; or (ii) The net resale profit, in an amount to be determined upon resale by a formula stated in the note. That formula shall define net resale profit as the amount by which the gross resale price exceeds the sum of: (A) The discounted purchase price; (B) Reasonable sale costs charged to the initial purchaser upon resale; and (C) Any increase in the value of the property that is attributable to improvements paid for or performed by the initial purchaser during tenure as a homeowner. (2) At the option of the Housing Authority, the note may provide for automatic reduction of the principal amount over a specified period of ownership while the property is used as the purchaser's family residence, resulting in total forgiveness of the indebtedness over a period of not less than five years from the date of conveyance, in annual increments of not more than 20 percent. This does not require the Housing Authority's plan to provide for any such reduction at all, or preclude it from specifying terms that are less generous to the purchaser than those stated in the foregoing sentence. (3) To preclude collusive resale that would circumvent the intent of this section, the Housing Authority shall (by an appropriate form of title restriction) condition the initial purchaser's right to resell upon approval by the Housing Authority, to be based solely on the Housing Authority's determination that the resale price represents fair market value or a lesser amount that will result in payment to the Housing Authority, under the note, of the full amount of the purchase price discount (subject to any accrued reduction, if provided for under paragraph (b)(2) of this section). If so determined, the Housing Authority shall be obligated to approve the resale. (4) The Housing Authority may, in its sole discretion, agree to subordination of the mortgage that secures the promissory note, in favor of an additional mortgage given by the purchaser as security for a home improvement loan. (c) Limited equity method. As a second option, the requirement of this section may be satisfied by an appropriate form of limited equity arrangement, restricting the amount of net resale profit that may be realized by the seller (the initial purchaser and successive purchasers over a period prescribed by the homeownership plan) to the sum of: (1) The seller's paid-in equity; (2) The portion of the resale proceeds attributable to any improvements paid for or performed by the seller during homeownership tenure; and (3) An allowance for appreciation in value, calculated by a fair and reasonable method specified in the homeownership plan (e.g., according to a price index factor or other measure). (d) Third method. The requirements of this section may be satisfied by any other fair and reasonable arrangement that will accomplish the essential purposes stated in paragraph (a) of this section. (e) Appraisal. Determinations of fair market value under this section shall be made on the basis of appraisal within a reasonable time prior to sale by an independent appraiser, to be selected by the Housing Authority. ยง907.15 Use of sale proceeds (a) General authority for use. Sale proceeds may, after provision for sale and administrative costs that are necessary and reasonable for carrying out the homeownership plan, be retained by the Housing Authority and used for housing assistance to low-income families (as such families are defined under the 1937 Act). The term ``sale proceeds'' includes all payments made by purchasers for credit to the purchase price ( e.g., earnest money, down payments, payments out of the proceeds of mortgage loans, and principal and interest payments under purchase-money mortgages), along with any amounts payable upon resale under ยง907.14, and interest earned on all such receipts. (Residual receipts, as defined in the ACC, shall not be treated as sale proceeds.) (b) Permissible uses. Sale proceeds may be used for any one or more of the following forms of housing assistance for low-income families, at the discretion of the Housing Authority and as stated in the HUD-approved homeownership plan: (1) In connection with the homeownership plan from which the funds are derived, for special purposes that are justified to ensure the success of the plan, and to protect the interests of the homeowners, the Housing Authority and any other entity with responsibility for carrying out the plan. Examples include a reserve for loans to homeowners to prevent or cure default, or for other emergency housing needs; a reserve for any contingent liabilities of the Housing Authority under the homeownership plan (such as Housing Authority guaranty of mortgage loans); and a reserve for Housing Authority repurchase, repair and resale of homes in the event of defaults. (2) In connection with another HUD-approved homeownership plan under this part, for assistance to purchasers and for reasonable planning and administrative costs. (3) In connection with a State or local homeownership program for low-income families, for assistance to purchasers and for reasonable planning and administrative costs. Under such programs, sales proceeds may be used to construct or acquire additional dwellings for sale to low-income families, or to assist such families in purchasing other dwellings from public or private owners. Where this kind of use is proposed, the homeownership plan must include a description of the State or local homeownership program.
