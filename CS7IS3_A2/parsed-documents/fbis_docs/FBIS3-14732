The statement by this liberal democratic party says that the Russian Parliament ratified this document exactly a year ago, but meanwhile, it has not yet been examined by the Supreme Council of Armenia. Stressing the importance of Armenian-Russian mutual relations, the leadership of the Ramkavar-Azatakan Party of Armenia expresses anxiety regarding the Armenian Supreme Council's delay in ratifying the treaty. The party's faction in the Supreme Council of Armenia will seek to have this issue included in the republican Supreme Council's agenda, the statement says. The treaty was signed in Moscow on 21 August 1992 by Russian and Armenian Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Levon Ter-Petrosyan. It settles questions pertaining to the presence on Armenian territory of units and formations of Russian Armed Forces.
