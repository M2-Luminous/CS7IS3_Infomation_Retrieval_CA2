The most important thing that distinguishes Egyptian-Chinese relations, the roots of which go back dozens of years, is the fact that they are based on mutual respect, trust, friendship, and common interests. In order that matters be clearly and openly put on the table, we must remark that President Mubarak, during this trip, has expended all possible efforts to enable Egypt to benefit from the achievements of the Chinese economic experiment--with all of its positive and negative aspects. There also took place, during the visit, the signing of two agreements for investment and judicial cooperation between China and Egypt. In addition to these two agreements, and by means of the discussions and meetings held by President Mubarak with the Chinese leaders, a number of policies have been established for joint cooperation between the two nations in new areas. More precisely, the efforts undertaken by President Mubarak during this exhausting trip--which is only one of the dozens of trips he is undertaking for the sake of achieving advancement for Egypt's people and solving Egypt's problems--are not sufficient, because it is also necessary that the nation's executive agencies assume responsibility and move effectively in order to carry out, with the necessary speed, what was agreed upon. In order to break out of this dead-end situation, agreement was reached to form working groups to follow up on the issues of joint cooperation. The most important elements of cooperation agreed upon in President Mubarak's bilateral discussions with the Chinese leaders, which were also expanded to include the participation of 'Amr Musa, the minister of foreign affairs, and Safwat al-Sharif, the minister of information, were the following: 1. Continuation of political coordination concerning Arab, African, and world issues. The Chinese expressed their esteem and support for Egypt's efforts aimed at achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 2. The importance of working toward increasing the volume of trade between Egypt and China, and increasing the rates of Egypt's exports to a degree that reflects the strength of the relations between the two nations. 3. It was agreed that China will set up free-trade zones in Egypt for Chinese industries as a form of investment because of Egypt's location and proximity to the markets of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and it was also agreed that protocols dealing with industrial and technical cooperation will be signed. 4. Beijing's readiness to cooperate technologically with Egypt and to provide all types of possibilities that will help Egypt to achieve progress and to benefit from China's pioneering experiment in this field. Now it is up to Egypt's government organizations to move to seize this available opportunity. 5. An exchange of views concerning the problems of development and the open-door economic policy. These are difficulties that exist in both Egypt and China, and that they can find solutions for if they engage in joint efforts. 6. Judging by the meetings which took place, it is evident that most of the investments made in the new Chinese [free-trade] zones have been financed by members of the oversees Chinese communities (55 million persons). Also, a large percentage was contributed by the Chinese in Thailand and Hong Kong, in addition to the capital that comes from Japan and Singapore. From the giant nation of China--which is moving firmly and steadfastly to take its place among the great powers, which will result in the achievement of the balance which is being sought in the new world order--President Mubarak has arrived in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the fellow-Arab nation of the United Arab Emirates [UAE], which has always opened up its heart and its arms to Egypt as its Arab big brother. [passage omitted] The trips abroad that President Mubarak occasionally takes always have the aim of guaranteeing continuity and pursuing strong relations of friendship with other nations. This helps these other nations to understand Egypt's problems and needs, and creates willingness [among them] to support Egypt in many of the positions it takes that are connected with the interests of the Egyptian people.
