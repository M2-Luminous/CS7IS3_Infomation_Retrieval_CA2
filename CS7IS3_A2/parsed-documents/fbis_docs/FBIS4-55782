Although entering the elections independently the SNS will still "cooperate closely" with Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Slota says. "We decided on independent candidacy in the elections because with joint candidacy our party would lose its identity." "In every nation state a real political force should exist that protects the interests of the nation. In the case of Slovakia it is the SNS," he tells the paper. Slota says he is disturbed by the attempts of Hungarian politicians to declare the Hungarian minority living in Slovakia to be part of the Hungarian nation. "From the SNS point of view we can only talk of Slovaks who speak Hungarian," he says. Accordingly the party intends to defend the Slovaks living in the south, where Hungarians form a majority: pushing for a law protecting Slovak as the main language in all schools, armed services, in the population register and other documents. They also vow to reject an ethnic conception in the envisaged reorganization of local government. Speaking of SNS rivals in the run-up to the elections (to be held on September 30-October 1), Slota denounces parties of the right as being either manifestly pro-Czech or mere vehicles for the "personal ambition of bankrupt turncoats from the SNS and HZDS." The latter, however, will not be able to form a coalition because "they lack unified political foundations, even though many have shown that, enticed by a vision of personal gain, they are capable of selling out." He says the SNS is united and dismisses rumors he might be ousted from the position of chairman as disinformation.
