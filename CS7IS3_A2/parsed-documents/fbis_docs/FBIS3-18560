It released a survey showing that 70 of 105 channels -- 66 percent -- had obeyed the directive, which states that more than 50 percent of programmes excluding sport and news must be provided by European producers. Among those not meeting the directive, a Commission spokesman named several satellite channels in Britain and a cable channel in France. The Commission is preparing a report on the directive and possible modifications before October this year.
