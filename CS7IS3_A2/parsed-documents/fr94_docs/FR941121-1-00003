FR941121-1-00003 FR941121-1-00001 Discussion On July 15, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued Airworthiness Directive (AD) 93&hyph;14&hyph;14, Amendment 39&hyph;8638 (58 FR 39644, July 26, 1993), applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, to require initial and repetitive inspections for cracks, and removal from service, if necessary, of certain front compressor fan hubs. Front compressor fan hubs installed on engines in the No. 2 position on Boeing 727 aircraft must be inspected according to a more aggressive schedule than other installations. In addition, that AD requires shotpeening of the forward and aft rim to web radius area of hubs that pass the inspections. That action was prompted by reports of two front compressor fan hub fractures on engines operating in the No. 2 position on Boeing 727 aircraft. That condition, if not corrected, could result in a fracture of the front compressor fan hub, which can result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft. Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a report of a front compressor fan hub fracture on a PW JT8D engine installed on a Boeing 737 aircraft. The examination of the failed hardware revealed the failure mechanism to be identical to that described in AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14. The analysis conducted for that AD concluded that the vibratory stress environment that caused fan hub fractures was the most severe for engines installed in the No. 2 position on Boeing 727 aircraft. Therefore, the FAA addressed this population in a more aggressive manner than engines installed in other aircraft, or in the No. 1 or No. 3 position on Boeing 727 aircraft. The FAA determined that a similar, but less severe stress environment existed in engines installed in other aircraft or positions other than the No. 2 position in the Boeing 727 aircraft, and inspection and shotpeening requirements were specified for these engines in AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14. Since the failure of the fan hub installed in the Boeing 737 aircraft, the FAA has reassessed the risk analysis for all installations and determined that the predicted risk level should be reduced. Therefore, the FAA proposes to supersede AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14 with a reduced initial fan hub inspection requirement for engines installed in all positions of all applicable aircraft, by requiring engines removed from the Boeing 727 aircraft No. 2 position to adhere to the Boeing 727 aircraft No. 2 position inspection requirements, and by establishing a compliance end-date. The FAA has received comments from operators that the wording of paragraph (b)(4) of AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14 is confusing. The FAA has revised the wording to emphasize that the repetitive inspection is required at the next opportunity when the front compressor fan hub is accessible at the detail level in the shop only after accumulating 2,500 additional cycles in service (CIS) since the last inspection. In addition, the FAA has revised the wording in paragraph (d) that defines a shop visit as an engine removal for engine maintenance that cannot be performed while installed in the aircraft. Since publication of AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14, PW has issued Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6104, Revision 3, dated June 16, 1994, that describes the reduced initial inspection intervals for the applicable engine installations. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14 to reduce the initial inspection interval for front compressor fan hubs installed in all positions of all applicable aircraft, revise the compliance requirements for repositioned engines, establish a compliance end-date, and clarify the wording of the compliance requirements. The FAA estimates that 1475 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry and 690 domestic uninstalled engines would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 12 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,428,900. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
