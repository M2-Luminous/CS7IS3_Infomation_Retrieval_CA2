The results for the other classes can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those referenced for the representative classes. The representative classes for water heaters are electric storage water heaters and gas storage water heaters, which are the most prevalent classes of water heaters. For electric storage water heaters, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by the use of heat traps and by reducing heat leaks; level 2 increases the insulation level to R&hyph;25; at level 3 the insulation is reduced back to the baseline level of R&hyph;16, but an add-on heat pump is added; levels 4 and 5 increase the insulation back to R&hyph;25; and levels 6, 7 and 8 assume the use of an integral heat pump. For gas storage water heaters, trial standard level 1 is the same as the baseline, trial standard level 2 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement by the use of heat traps and by reducing heat leaks, levels 3 and 4 increase the insulation level to R&hyph;16, levels 5 and 6 increase the insulation level to R&hyph;25, at level 7 the insulation level is reduced back to R&hyph;16 but electronic ignition is added, and at level 8 the flue gases are assumed to condense. Similar design options are used to achieve the above efficiencies for the other classes and are found tabulated in Sections 1.5 and 1.6 of the Technical Support Document.
