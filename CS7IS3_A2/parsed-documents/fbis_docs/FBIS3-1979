With 42 percent of its population being of the Tibetan, Hui, Tu, Salar and Mongolian nationalities, Qinghai has made much headway in education. The province now has 1,598 schools for people of minority nationalities with a total enrollment of 250,000. The enrollment of school-age children in the province has reached 85 percent, meeting the target set by the state Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95). However, the pace of educational development still cannot meet the needs of local economic and social development, especially compared with the country's developed areas. The provincial government has worked out an educational development program to boost education of people of minority nationalities. The program includes concrete measures and policies mainly for solving existing problems such as low popularization rate of primary education, slow progress of technical training, illiteracy among peasants and nomadic herdsmen, poor school facilities and the lack of teachers. Governments at several levels will make joint efforts to place priority on building six key senior middle schools, 30 key junior middle schools and 191 key primary schools in the province's six minority nationality autonomous prefectures. Preferential treatment in funds, facilities and training teachers will be granted to the six prefectures. Universities and teacher's schools in the province are urged to help the six minority nationality autonomous prefectures train more teachers. Local governments should work out preferential policies to raise teachers' salaries and improve their living and working condition. Those teachers working in remote areas for over 15 years will have more favorable treatment in work, and their children will be able to take part in university enrollment examinations. The provincial government has decided to allocate 6 million yuan for ethnic education each year and provide free textbooks in minority nationality languages. A fund for development of ethnic education in Qinghai will be established to attract both domestic and overseas funds. Special concern will be given to education of girls of minority nationalities, especially students in girls' schools for Hui and Salar nationalities, most of whom are Muslims. School fees can be waived for girl students whose families have financial difficulties. Morning and evening classes will be given to the girls. Preferential policies will be given to minority nationality students to enter institutions of higher learning, in particular to enter teacher's universities. Legal and other documents will be published to ensure smooth progress of minority nationality education.
