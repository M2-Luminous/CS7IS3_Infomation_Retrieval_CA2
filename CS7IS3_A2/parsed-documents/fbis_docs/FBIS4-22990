Nagorskiy, Moscow, Mashinostroyeniye, 1991, 320 pages] [Text] Increases in society's demand for transportation have always stimulated the search for new transport vehicles and technologies. Scientists and designers in various countries have, since the beginning of the 1960s, concentrated their attention on creating diverse ground contactless (wheel-less) transport systems. Since that time, both in our country and abroad various types of systems have been developed, theoretical research has been conducted, and prototypes and experimental full-scale vehicles have been manufactured and tested. Studies of technical-economic, energy, and ecological indicators have established the superiority of ground transport with magnetic suspension, a linear traction electric drive, and an automated system to stabilize the vehicle's position in space as it moves at speeds up to 500 km/h. The timeliness of the book being reviewed here is dictated not only by the tasks entailed in researching and developing such transport but also by the prospects of its wide-scale use. The book's appearance is tied to the need for advance formulation of the theoretical and experimental foundations of this direction of transport technology. It analyzes the results of R&D conducted in our country and abroad. Its primary focus is on the developments achieved by a group of higher educational institutions and organizations under the direction of the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Electric Locomotive Construction [VElNII]. The book is intended for scientific workers involved in solving the specified problem but may also be useful to graduate students and students enrolled at higher educational institutions. Its purpose is to acquaint interested readers with the advantages, current status, and prospects of transport with magnetic suspension and, above all, with those theoretical and experimental foundations of contactless motion that are most important and necessary to the study and creation of such transport. Chapter one contains general information about ground transport for contactless motion. Specifically, it gives a classification of levitating transport systems and examines the functional and pictorial diagrams and singular features of contactless rolling stock with various magnetic suspension systems (electromagnetic, electrodynamic, combined, and permanent magnet-based suspension systems). It also presents a classification of linear traction motors and assesses the effect that the type of magnetic suspension system and linear motor have on the sphere and efficiency of the use of contactless transport. Chapters two, three, and four are devoted to an examination of the foundations of the configuration and theory of magnetic suspension systems, linear traction motors, and electric drive and electric power supply systems. In the second chapter, the electromagnetic and mechanical diagrams of a magnetic suspension system are analyzed, and a procedure for selecting the type of suspension, refining electromagnets' characteristics, determining braking and lifting forces during motion, and creating automatic suspension control and vibration protection systems is set forth. In addition, a comparative analysis of combined suspension and traction systems is conducted, an electrodynamic suspension system with a complex drive belt is examined, and its levitation quality is evaluated. Attention is paid to the transitional processes occurring in electrodynamic suspension and measures to make the vehicle comfortable. The chapter concludes with material regarding the sphere of use of permanent magnets for transport suspensions and the design of suspension systems based on them. Chapter three examines the singular features of the use of linear traction motors and their thermal state and presents a comparative analysis of their indicators and ways of improving them. Also examined are the operating modes of motors in electric drive systems; methods of controlling speed, frequency, and voltage; and the singular features of control and power supply systems and transformer and cryogenic equipment and its effect on the transport's technical and economic indicators and characteristics. Chapter five is devoted to the electromechanical characteristics of a linear traction electric drive in traction and braking modes. Chapter six presents the singular features of the aerodynamics and dynamics of the motion of a contactless rolling stock. Examined here are disturbing forces as a vehicle moves, the principles of its aerodynamics and aeromechanics, and the problems involved in selecting the geometric shape of a vehicle and its track and assessing the dynamic qualities of vehicles with variously designed running gears. Presented in the seventh chapter is a substantiation of the technical requirements of both a rolling stock with magnetic suspension and its route and track structure, the methodological foundations of a technical and economic evaluation of contactless ground transport, and a technical and economic comparison of its different systems and design versions. The book's limited size prevented its authors from devoting more attention to the problems of technical and economic comparison of the new type of transport with familiar types of passenger transport or to specifying those areas in which its use would be feasible. Also not reflected in the book are combined magnetic suspension and linear electric drive systems, with the exception of systems with linear induction and inductor-type synchronous motors that combine the functions of suspension and traction. Overall, the book now being reviewed is an original and sufficiently complete summary of research on the problems of transport with magnetic suspension. COPYRIGHT: ``Izv. vuzov.
