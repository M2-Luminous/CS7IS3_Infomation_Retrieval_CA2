In a signed article for the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU (Saturday's [8 January] edition), Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev warns against "fragmentation tendencies" in Europe. If NATO expands towards the east "over-hastily," a dangerous situation will arise in Europe -- like the one that arose from the Treaty of Versailles after World War I. Kozyrev said that admitting Poland or other Central and East European states to NATO would mean shifting the "guardhouse on the Rhine" to the "banks of the Bug." The core of the Russian proposal was the idea of taking all steps towards a "new European architecture" on a joint, equal basis. Regional organizations such as the EU [European Union], NATO, or the WEU [Western European Union] had to be open to all democratic countries. Even Russia did not rule out a priori that it could apply for admission to NATO at some stage in the future, Kozyrev announced. Kozyrev says that the "guarantee of the same security level for all European states" and the "exclusion of territorial claims" were among the principles of the partnership strategy proposed by him. The Russian Government's specific proposal was that the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, in which all NATO and former Warsaw Pact countries are represented, should be made into a central organization for military cooperation.
