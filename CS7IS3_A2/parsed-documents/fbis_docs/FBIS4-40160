During his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, the Bosnian Serb leader called the Russian people "friends of the Serbs for centuries." Karadzic, who arrived in Moscow for receiving Mikhail Sholokhov Literary Award conferred on him by the Writers' Union of Russia, said that he plans to meet with representatives of different political movements. At the same time the Serb politician emphasised that he does not intend to forget the important role played by the Russian Government and Russian diplomacy in the search for a peaceful solution to the Bosnian conflict. According to Karadzic, the Bosnian Serbs are aware of Russia's objective stand, and do not expect any one-sided or unbalanced approach to events in the region. "It is very difficult to end the civil war, because not only armies, but civilians are also involved in combat actions," Karadzic said. "We are getting tired of the crisis which continues for several years. We need peace, so as to construct a democratic society and a free economy," he said.
