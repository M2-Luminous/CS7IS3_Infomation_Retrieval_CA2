A collectively-owned enterprise with 388 employees, the No. 7 machine tool factory had suffered losses for eight consecutive years. The losses for the eight years totalled to 560,000 yuan in all, and the factory in addition was saddled with debts totalling 2.24 million yuan. But the factory's fixed assests were only about 240,000 yuan. When Tian Shuangquan, director of the factory, signed an adjudication paper in court, some of the employees wept. But some of the employees in court were glad. They said that if the enterprise was not declared bankrupt, they could not apply for relief funds from the insurance company. In August, 1986, Shenyang was named as an experimental city where bankrupt enterprises could be shut down. A government official said that before the law on enterprise bankruptcies came into being, Shenyang decided about bankruptcy of an enterprise by administrative means. Since 1993, the city has begun to handle the problem through the courts. Shenyang Intermediate People's Court has so far declared 13 enterprises bankrupt. The official said that about 8,000 employees of bankrupt enterprises have been well looked after. Most of them have been re- employed by other enterprises or social services and about 200 laid off people each got 100 yuan per month. Now a legal procedure must be followed by any enterprise on the verge of bankruptcy, including application for bankruptcy, a court declaration of bankruptcy, check on the assets of bankrupt enterprises, and paying off creditors by using the property and other assets of the bankrupt enterprise.
