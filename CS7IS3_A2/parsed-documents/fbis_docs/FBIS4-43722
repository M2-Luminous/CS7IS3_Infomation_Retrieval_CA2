Even though the liberals are currently still getting 5 percent of the votes, the party is in acute danger. This assessment was given by Forsa chief Manfred Guellner to DIE WELT. In his view, the FDP is developing into the sole source of danger for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, since the Christian Democratic Union /Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] is constantly rising in the voters' favor. In Guellner's view, Chairman Klaus Kinkel is to be blamed for the problems. Before his election as party chairman, the FDP had a stable nationwide reservoir of voters of about 9 percent. Afterward, the party slid down to 5 to 6 percent. It has not been able to make good this "negative Kinkel effect" again. In particular, its attitude at the presidential elections has caused great damage to the FDP, according to Guellner. In the week after Herzog's election, it fell to 3 percent all over the country for the first time, because the voters no longer saw the FDP's election behavior as an independent decision. Forsa also gives bad marks to Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping. "Today, he is already as weak as Oskar Lafontaine was in 1990 during the final stage of the election campaign." In this respect, Chancellor Kohl need not fear his challenger anymore. According to the Forsa analysis, the decline of the SPD has been caused by the bad presentation of Scharping's tax plans. Guellner: "This was perhaps the decisive turning point from which the SPD and Scharping have never recovered." In contrast to his internal party rival, Gerhard Schroeder, Scharping did not symbolize the competent SPD for the voters that they wanted. This means: "Because Scharping is so weak, Kohl is so strong again," the election researcher explains. While the Greens get a stable 9 percent, according to Guellner's polls, the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] could become the second surprise of the Bundestag elections, apart from the FDP. After the European election, there are signs that the successor of the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] is also gaining followers in the west. The PDS has "good prospects to get three or more direct mandates." If the SPD grows even weaker, the PDS could jump over the 5-percent threshold at the national level, Guellner predicts.
