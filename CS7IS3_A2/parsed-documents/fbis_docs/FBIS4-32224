The fiercest attacks are taking place on the Ozren-Vozuca front, where the Muslims are trying to breach the Serbian defense lines from the direction of Zavidovici and Banovici and thereby link the Zenica and Tuzla regions. In addition to the Serbian lines, they are also targeting civilian settlements using shells of every caliber, filled with chemical agents and chlorine. In order to protect civilians, some 1,200 children of 1-15 years of age and over 1,000 old and exhausted elderly people and women have been evacuated to Mount Ozren. The tough Serbian fighters from Ozren, residents of Vozuca, are in position. They are fighting so that their families can return home. Unfortunately, among the Muslims there are also the so-called peacekeepers. The Muslims were not only satisfied with attacks on Vozuca. After their attacks on the Teslic front failed, they turned their guns on Teslic itself and have intermittently, every hour, been shelling the city center. They have been mercilessly pounding the town since this morning and using chemical agents. The command of the army of the Serbian republic in Teslic has evidence of this. The residents are in shelters, but the damage to property is enormous. Civilian casualties have fortunately been only slight. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] helicopters have been carrying out reconnaissance flights on the Trebava front, east of Doboj. The visible concentration of Muslim forces from the direction of Lukavac indicates that major attacks will take place there, too. The fighters of the army of the Serbian republic are firmly holding their lines, ready to launch counterattacks if these attacks on the headquarters of the army of the Serbian republic continue. This afternoon, Croats, the 110th Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council from Tesanj, attacked the city center of Doboj, forcing guests visiting from the Athens district of (Halgoris), Doboj's twin town, to take refuge in shelters. The shells, which are still landing on the town, have wounded three civilians, one seriously.
