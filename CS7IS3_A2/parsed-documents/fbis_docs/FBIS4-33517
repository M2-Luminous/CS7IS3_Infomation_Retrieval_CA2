During the whole of the month of June, and prior to the implementation of the real on 1 July, Lula will try to consolidate his lead in the opinion polls. The PT will create People's Committees [Comites Populares] to promote party activism on the streets. It will launch the first of its long-term programs, the job program, and will unveil an alternative to the economic program of his main opponent, Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. In addition, Lula will take new trips. On 6 June, he will visit Espirito Santo, the only state he has not yet visited. All this seeks to counterbalance a possible negative impact on his candidacy if the implementation of the new currency leads to economic stability. A source close to Lula has reported that "to counterbalance the real, on 9 June, Lula will launch a job program, showing that curbing the inflation rate is not enough to improve the standard of living of the people." He added that "promoting the People's Committees throughout Brazil will be a way to take the presidential campaign to the streets because up to now, the campaign consisted of Lula touring the country by bus. Gilberto Carvalho, one of the presidential campaign coordinators, reported that within the next few days, the PT will disclose an alternative economic plan to the dollarization of the economy, in opposition to Cardoso's plan. The idea is to propose another currency backing; and to show that Cardoso's economic plan caused losses in converting prices to Real Value Units on the basis of the peak inflation rate of the four previous months, while salaries were converted on the basis of the average inflation rate of the four previous months. It also intends to prove that Cardoso's economic plan does not foresee a solution to the job problem or the achievement of economic growth. In Espirito Santo, Lula plans to hold rallies in Vitoria, Linhares, Sao Mateus, Colatina, and Cachoeiro de Itapermirim. He will also meet with business and religious leaders. He will be in Porto Alegre from 10 to 12 June, and is scheduled to hold a rally on 12 June at Vale de Anhangabau in the city of Sao Paulo.
