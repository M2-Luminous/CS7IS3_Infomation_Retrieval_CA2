FR940323-1-00012 FR940323-1-00005 Section 6401 of OBRA '89 also made conforming changes to section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) (excluding the mandatory group of children in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) from the group of optional categorically needy), other parts of section 1902(1) (changed the descriptions of low-income groups of pregnant women, infants, and children), section 1902(e)(7) (added the new group of mandatory children to the continuation of inpatient hospital services for infants and children who have reached the maximum age for eligibility), section 1902(r)(2) (made the use of less restrictive income and resource methodologies than cash assistance methodologies apply to the new group of mandatory children), and section 1903(f)(4) (exempted the new group of mandatory children from the limitations on Medicaid payments). In addition, section 6411(i)(3) of OBRA '89 amended section 1925 (a)(3)(C) and (b)(3)(C)(i) to require States to determine if children who would cease to receive extended Medicaid under section 1925 may be eligible for Medicaid under sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(i) (IV) or (VI) or 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) before terminating eligibility based on section 1925. The changes made by section 6401 applied to payments for medical assistance for calendar quarters beginning on or after April 1, 1990, with respect to eligibility on or after that date. The effective date applied whether or not we had promulgated final rules to interpret the provisions by that date. However, a State could, under certain circumstances, request a delayed implementation date in order to enact State legislation. Section 6411(i)(3) was effective as if enacted as part of the Family Support Act of 1988. Section 4601 of OBRA '90 established a new mandatory group of low-income children under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII) of the Act. This group described in 1902(l)(1)(D) of the Act includes children born after September 30, 1983 who have attained age 6 but have not attained age 19. The State must establish an income standard for this group of children which equals 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. Section 4601 made conforming changes to section 1905(n)(2) of the Act which defines qualified children. Children born after September 30, 1983 who have not attained age 19 are now included in the mandatory group of qualified children. In addition, States have the option to choose an earlier date of birth if they wish to phase in this group more quickly. Section 4601 made additional conforming changes to (1) section 1902(r)(2) to allow States to use less restrictive income and resource methodologies than those used under the cash assistance programs in determining financial eligibility of the new group under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII); (2) section 1903(f)(4) of the Act to exempt the new group of mandatory children from the limitations on Medicaid payments; and (3) section 1925 of the Act to require that States determine whether a child is eligible under this new mandatory group before terminating eligibility based on section 1925. The changes made by section 4601 applied to payments for medical assistance for calendar quarters beginning on or after July 1, 1991. The effective date applied whether or not we had promulgated final rules to interpret the provisions by that date. However, a State could, under certain circumstances, request a delayed implementation date in order to enact State legislation. Section 1902(l) of the Act, as added by section 9401 of OBRA '86 and amended by section 4101 of OBRA '87, section 302 of MCCA, section 608(d)(15) of FSA, section 6401 of OBRA '89, and section 4601 of OBRA '90, specifies the eligibility conditions for the mandatory groups of pregnant women and infants under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), the mandatory group of children age 1 up to age 6 under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), the mandatory group of children age 6 up to age 19 under section 1902 (a)(10)(A)(i)(VII), and the optional categorically needy groups of pregnant women and infants under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX). 1. Income Standard Eligibility of individuals who fall into one of the mandatory and optional groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children is based on these individuals meeting State-established income standards. States must establish their income standards at a level that does not exceed the specified percentage of the Federal poverty income guidelines for a family equal to the size of the family, including the woman, infant, or child. Because the official poverty guidelines are revised annually to adjust for inflation, States will be automatically increasing the income standards established to keep pace with inflation as a result of the changes in the poverty guidelines. (HHS determines official Federal poverty income guidelines and issues them in the Federal Register annually, usually during the month of February. See, for example, 58 FR 8287, February 12, 1993.) For optional groups of pregnant women and infants, the agency may establish separate income standards or use a single standard.
