[Hurd] Everyone today was clear on the military side. The Bosnian Serbs have to pull out beyond Gorazde, out of the exclusion zone, or they run the risk of being struck, so that's clear. [Snow] Their troops as well, their infantry, all of them? [Hurd] Their heavy weapons, the ones laid down in the NATO decision. But what we're also clear about is that the efforts being made by the Russians, by the Europeans, by the Americans for a negotiated settlement have got to be brought together, and that's the meaning and purpose of the contact group meeting here in the Foreign Office tomorrow. All of them together for the first time. [Snow] Now the other part of tomorrow night's ultimatum talks about the other safe areas which are declared outside Sarajevo, Gorazde, and beyond that. How can you declare the intention that you have of protecting those safe areas with air strikes, when it failed in Gorazde? [Hurd] Well, hasn't failed in Sarajevo and provided there are.... [Snow, interrupting] We're talking about in Gorazde.... [Hurd, interrupting] It hasn't worked so far in Gorazde and there's been hideous suffering and atrocity meanwhile. This comes down to the question of troops for the UN forces, because you need people on the ground, as well as forces in the air; it's something we discussed today. The troops contributors are not coming forward, the blockage is now the money, and it is extremely important that in the coming weeks everybody, but particularly the Americans, unloose the purse-strings so that the United Nations can actually put into the field the forces which it will need to implement peace as peace grows, as we hope it will. [Snow] But they're not there at the moment, and yet you're declaring that you will protect these safe areas. Am I right? [Hurd] They are there at the moment. Every one of the safe areas that you mentioned, except Gorazde, has UN forces in them.... [Snow, interrupting] Enough? [Hurd] Enough for the purpose of the Security Council resolution and the NATO decision. If we were to extend that principle to other areas, not named -- and you are perfectly right, we don't at the moment have the resources, which is why we are not doing that. [Snow] But let me be clear. You are saying that if the Serbs try in Zepa, in Srebrenica, in Tuzla, what they did in Gorazde -- you know you will be able to stop them? [Hurd] I believe we will be able to stop them. There are troops there, and they now have a clear warning, a clear decision about an exclusion zone. Neither of those facts were there in Gorazde last week. [Snow] Do you think on the whole, looking back over this whole thing, it was a mistake to commit yourself to principles, to policies, that you simply were unwilling to defend in practice? [Hurd] The safe areas -- the Security Council named them as safe areas and at the same time appealed for troops. We responded, the French responded, one or two other countries responded, but the total response was inadequate. So you got the situation which haunts us from Goradze.... [Snow, interrupting] Why didn't you say they weren't safe any more? Why didn't you say they are not safe, those safe areas? [Hurd] Because then that of course is an immediate incentive to overrun them, but when we got to Maglaj this year, I made it quite clear that we could not support naming new safe areas, until there were troops to make them safe. Which is what has happened in Maglaj. So there is a lesson to be drawn there. But I believe now as regards the areas which have been covered it will be possible to secure them. [Snow] So looking very broadly ahead at a timetable, this contact group sits down tomorrow, it works out guidelines for the way forward from here. When, realistically, would you hope to see a cease-fire throughout Bosnia? [Hurd] I think it's a cessation of hostilities, i.e. it's a bit more than just a cease-fire, it's actually getting the heavy weapons, it's dealing with it in the same way as Sarajevo has been dealt with. I can't tell you the answer to that. I think the Bosnian Muslims will be reluctant simply to see the Serbs sit on the existing lines with any air of permanence. Therefore one has to link the cessation of hostilities with the effort and the pressure to get the Serbs to withdraw into the sort of map which has to be agreed and gives them a fair but not excessive share of the Bosnia in which all three communities have to live. [Snow] Do you think if we look very coolly at what the Serbs have achieved so far, do you think they must be very nearly at the limit of what they actually aim to achieve in terms of conquest? [Hurd] But they won't be able to retain it. There's no real life there, and in order to get life going again for themselves and their children, they are going to have to withdraw from a large part of the territory they occupy. That is what -- the contact group is just a diplomatic technique -- but that is what the rest of the world, including the Russians, have to point out to them.
