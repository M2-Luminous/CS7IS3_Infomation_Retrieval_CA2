According to CARENA, some of the arrangements include the formation of an ad hoc government, a government of concord and of national reconciliation under Article 111 of the Constitution, in compliance with the resolution adopted at the national conference on 6-8 February. The parliament is scheduled to examine a law related to this resolution as soon as possible; all the steps toward that end were laid out by the office of the conference. CARENA also advises that it has outlined to international institutions the steps by which, on the one hand, the sanctions against Haiti scheduled since the beginning of January 1994 can be set aside and, on the other hand, the idea of not hastily reinforcing those sanctions can be maintained. CARENA asserts that contacts at the highest level have been established for the purpose of immediately supplying the local fuel market and that a solution is under study. CARENA claims it is working day and night with national and international decisionmakers on the Haitian issue and cautions that the task of national reconciliation can not be fulfilled in an atmosphere of pressure, tension, and sanctions.
