FR940919-2-00097 FR940919-2-00046 Effect of Education The statute recognizes that education may play a role in an individual's ability to perform substantial gainful activity. Experience demonstrates that educational level alone, i.e., the numerical grade level that an individual has attained, may not be a good indicator of ability to function. For example, completion of a certain educational level in the remote past, without any practical application of that education in recent work activity, has no positive effect on an individual's ability to perform substantial gainful activity. Similarly, completion of a certain grade level does not necessarily represent mastery of the subject matter. In relying on standardized functional assessments, SSA will be measuring an individual's ability to perform the principal dimensions of work and task performance, including primary physical, psychological, and cognitive processes, and the positive effects of education will be appropriately reflected in the assessment of an individual's cognitive abilities. Thus, evaluation of a claimant's educational level will be done as an integral part of establishing the functional ability of that individual. The baseline of occupational demands will not reference prior skills or significant formal job training. The issue of whether literacy and/or specific communication or language skills will be a factor in disability evaluation depends on the extent to which such skills are occupational demands of work existing in significant numbers in the national economy. In conducting the necessary research to identify the occupational demands of baseline work that represents work existing in significant numbers in the national economy, SSA will need to consider whether literacy or specific communication and language skills are required as occupational demands. Effect of Age The effect of aging on the ability to perform substantial gainful work is very difficult to measure, especially in the context of today's world when individuals are living longer than preceding generations. Despite this change, the demographic characteristics of those preceding generations continue to provide the framework for disability decisionmaking because SSA's approach for deciding disability has changed little since the inception of the DI program. The statute recognizes that age should be considered in assessing disability on the assumption that the ability to make a vocational adjustment to work other than work an individual has previously done may become more difficult with age. In determining the impact of age, recognition should be given to the changes that occur with each succeeding generation. Accordingly, in the new process, SSA will establish an age criterion in relation to the full retirement age. The full retirement age will gradually increase over time, based on the recognition that succeeding generations can expect to remain in the workforce for longer periods than the preceding generation. In applying age criterion under the new process, an individual who falls within the prescribed number of years preceding the full retirement age will be considered as nearing full retirement age.'' In establishing what the prescribed number of years should be, SSA will conduct research and consult with outside experts on the relationship between age and an individual's ability to make vocational adjustments to work other than work the individual has done in the recent past. SSA will rely on the age of the individual in relation to the full retirement age to decide which of two decision paths to follow as described in the next two sections. Individuals Not Nearing Full Retirement Age For an individual who is not nearing full retirement age, SSA will compare the individual's functional abilities against the functional demands of the baseline work. The ability to perform the baseline work will represent a realistic opportunity to perform substantial gainful activity that exists in significant numbers in the national economy and a finding of disability will not be appropriate.
