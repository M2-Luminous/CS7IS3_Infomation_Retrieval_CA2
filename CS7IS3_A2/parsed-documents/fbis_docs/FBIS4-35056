This would mean transferring to the CVG some of the powers now exercised by the Ministry of Energy and Mines. The document contains a recommendation that the national nature of property ownership should be retained in the mining sector, which has a great deal of potential for the country. For this reason, administrative procedures should be adopted to assign to the CVG all tasks related to the administration, provision of services, control, supervision, and monitoring of mining properties. The commission, which was headed by Asdrubal Baptista, minister for economic reform, suggested in its report that the Ministry of Energy and Mines should maintain control over the granting of mining concessions, and that improvements should be made in the legal aspects of that mechanism. The CVG would deal with administrative matters as well as monitoring and overseeing mining, in accordance with legislation. The report contains an expose making it clear that not enough control has been exercised over the mining areas in the region, and that functions should be clearly delineated and carried out more strictly. "It is a question, then, of designing a system in which the Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana carries out all administrative procedures with respect to investigating and confirming compliance with regulations, and improving the legalities of granting mining concessions should be left up to the Ministry of Energy and Mines. Moreover, in this model, the CVG would be responsible for all monitoring and overseeing of the mining itself." [passage omitted] Guarantees for Workers Another important conclusion in the Evaluation Commission's report -- although it has not received a lot of attention -- has to do with industrial management. It proposes that a significant percentage of the shares in the industrial firms of the CVG be used as compensation in lieu of benefits to public employees who opt for early retirement. The clarification of providing a guarantee for workers can be deduced from one of the well-publicized conclusions of the report, the one referring to the privatization of basic industry enterprises. The offer of shares would be limited, in this case, to employees who retire from their jobs, and would serve as partial payment of the various benefits to which they are entitled. In addition, to keep the CVG from completely abandoning social and labor programs after the decentralization and privatization take place, the commission proposes that a significant amount of the proceeds the state receives from the sale of its property be used to finance a Permanent Occupational Education Plan, as well as job retraining and continuing education programs, in which private industry would participate. One noteworthy aspect of the report is that it does not rule out the possibility that the entities associated with the Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana may be privatized under the Privatization Law. The document, signed by Minister for Economic Reform Asdrubal Baptista, states that "the legal nature of the process that will lead to the desired objectives should be made very clear, and it should be established whether the provisions of the current Privatization Law, which could hinder the process, are to be applied here, or whether other, more effective and expeditious avenues can be opened up." Another major difference between this plan and the ones the CVG has advanced so far is the fact that it does not exclude the possibility that even electric companies could be privatized some day, once total maturity is achieved, without harming rational economic interests.
