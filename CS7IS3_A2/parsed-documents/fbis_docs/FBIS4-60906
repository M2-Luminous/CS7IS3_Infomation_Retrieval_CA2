He said that an absolute majority of the heads of political parties, socio-political organisations, territories and regions had signed the document. Speaking before the beginning of his talks with South Korean Defence Minister Yi Pyong-tae, who is in Moscow on an official visit, Grachev expressed the hope that other socio-political organisations would sign the agreement in the near future. Those who did not sign the document will be regarded by Russians as forces "which are not striving towards accord and peace". Touching on the May 1 Labor Day holiday, which last year was marked by a bloody confrontation between demonstrators and police, Grachev hoped that everything would be peaceful this time.
