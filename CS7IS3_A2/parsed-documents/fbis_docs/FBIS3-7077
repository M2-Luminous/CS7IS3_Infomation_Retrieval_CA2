Finance committee directors of the House of Representatives approved the proposal to add to the special income tax reduction bill a provision calling for further income tax cuts in 1995 and beyond. The proposal was made by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in an amendment to the bill submitted to the committee earlier in the day. The current bill calls for an income tax reduction only for 1994. The amendment is due for approval at a lower house plenary session on Friday evening. The ruling coalition earlier agreed to decide on a sweeping tax reform plan, including additional income tax cuts, by the end of the year.
