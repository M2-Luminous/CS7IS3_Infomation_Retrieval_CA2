"Osijek is the best!" the residents of this city finally shouted, but the excitement subsided when they realized that Osijek is in fact at the top of the welfare and unemployment list. This was the effective conclusion drawn by Ivan Parac, minister of labor and social welfare of the RH [Republic of Croatia], during a visit to our city and vicinity. Still, such a situation is normal, he continued, because this city was on the front line of the fighting, but since we know that we are still in that position, this situation is hardly likely to change. The city has been razed and it is necessary to invest in reconstruction, it was said at the meeting between Mr. Parac and the zupanija administration. This is because it is obvious that given the lack of economic capacities, the people who are employed have nothing to do, so that those who have had the good fortune to find work at private but nonproductive businesses are losing their jobs as those businesses close due to unprofitable operation. Since the end of May 1992, i.e., two years ago, we have not seen a single crane in Osijek, except the one at the Drava Bridge, and even that one is scarcely used. Production capacities in Osijek are being rebuilt only slowly or not at all because there is no influx of fresh capital, and there is uncertainty about whether certain outdated technologies should even be rebuilt or whether the economy should be fully reconstructed and adapted to the needs of the contemporary market. But the basic precondition for that--which is still called capital--is not present. Mr. Parac also contends that Slavonia is at the top of the list in terms of the threat to social welfare, which is illogical for this (once) rich region. But we are no longer rich. The entire city is supplied by several private gardens in Tvrdjavica and Podravlje, while everything else that arrives is rinsed like fresh lettuce in a pile of taxes and surtaxes for fools. This time, the conclusion has emerged that the rest of Croatia should help Slavonia, which once fed all of Croatia and then some, but it is already too late for such a conclusion. We have already swallowed our share of heavy wartime and postwar calamity, and now we are coping practically on our own. For two years we have survived on rice and noodles, but now, in any event, we also have vegetables. Indeed, Minister Parac emphasizes that it is illogical that Osijek and Slavonia are in this position, and says verbatim "that there have been structural dislocations in the overall economy, infrastructure, education system, health care, and elsewhere in this region." What interests us in particular is the question of what should be done after the city was systematically shelled for a year and a half by "acquaintances" who knew very well where they were aiming. Perhaps someone could call the sweeping destruction of the Osijek economy a "structural change," but at the very least that is a ludicrous academic buzzword for what has happened to us, about which Croatia has remained silent for two years now. It cannot even be said that the people in Zagreb knew nothing about this, because we have made plenty of noise, but until it became more or less popular to descend on Slavonia and individually shudder at the situation, which Croatian ministers have been doing lately, no one recognized this about us out loud. If this results in action, and not only reaction, then we will be satisfied with that, because better late than never; but if it has become fashionable to visit Slavonia and experience revulsion, then that is worse than the blissful ignorance demonstrated thus far by individuals from the metropolis. We are in fact no longer the rich Slavonia of immeasurable natural beauty and endless fields of grain, but rather the disfigured vestibule to Croatia which many people are sweeping under the rug because of peace in their own home. Unfortunately, we are not able to do that, because we live here.
