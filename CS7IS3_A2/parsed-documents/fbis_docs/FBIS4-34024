A visit to Cuba can never be considered a mere stopover en route to other nations, even for a Mexican president. It is a vital visit. Just being here makes a statement. I want this visit to be deep and broad in content and not just a formal visit. In summarizing what has been discussed and agreed upon over this long and intense period, I would said that two essential elements turned this visit into a very important state visit for the Mexican president. First, we have reaffirmed what is clear to many: No one should forget the affectionate, lasting, and permanent relationship between the Cuban and Mexican peoples, a relationship that is neither affected nor diminished by circumstances or events. [applause] Second, the intensity, depth, and significance of this visit have translated into specific results in the effort to strengthen ties. Cuba and Mexico have established economic, financial, and commercial ties to their benefit. On this occasion, I am pleased to note that we were able to realize what took months of intense talk and negotiation among several Mexican businessmen, namely a Cuban- Mexican association. This alone is a great step forward and shows that we can build this relationship with solid brick, on a strong foundation and with deep roots. There will always be a place in the Mexican people's heart and mind for the beloved and respected people of Cuba. [Castro] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, esteemed Mexican and Cuban brothers: I knew I was not going to get out of having to speak. [laughter] We are true slaves to the clock and must stick strictly to the agenda. This is why I will only say that we have broken several Olympic records here. First, this is the shortest official visit we have had. This must be noted in the Guiness Book of Records. Second, many things have been accomplished during this visit. President Salinas' ability to do things quickly is truly admirable. Third, another Olympic record involves the friendship, warmth, trust, and brotherhood which President Salinas has given to every issue and aspects he has already explained. This is not a stopover. A stopover is what I am doing here, at the Mexican Embassy, before moving ahead. [laughter] This outstanding official visit has been very good and productive. Visiting Cuba today is an act of courage, given the magnitude of the campaign against Cuba. Therefore, the Mexican president and his delegation have carried out a courageous and admirable act. [applause] We will always remember and be eternally grateful. Looking at the clock, we will have to run as fast as we can, without getting ourselves killed, to meet the agenda and be at the airport by 1700. [laughter] Another record has been set: I have delivered my briefest speech ever. Thank you. [laughter, applause]
