But In Two Months the Situation Could Change"] [Text] The question of dual citizenship, which in the last few months (especially since Kazakhstan introduced its own currency) has become one of the most problematic issues in the dialogue between Moscow and Alma-Ata [Almaty], was also a central point in the Russian-Kazakh talks that have just ended. The Russian delegation at the meeting in Alma-Ata was headed by Abdulakh Mikitayev, chairman of the Commission on Citizenship under the Russian Federation president. Acting also as Boris Yeltsin's personal envoy during this visit, he conveyed a message from him to Nursultan Nazarbayev. Mikitayev also met with representatives of Russian public organizations from Alma-Ata and Taldy-Kurgan. Judging by the results of the talks, the main Russian-Kazakhstan contradictions were not resolved this time either. Alma-Ata still does not accept the idea of dual citizenship while Moscow (true, not so decisively as before) is trying to keep this subject on the agenda of the negotiations. "We believe," Abdulakh Mikitayev stressed after the meeting with Kazakhstan officials, "that this institution will become a token of trust between states. Therefore the signatories to this agreement will confirm to their citizens that they will live in peace and friendship in the future." The Kazakhstani officials' main argument against dual citizenship is that it could affect the evolution of the young state. Alma-Ata also maintains that in this event, more than half the Kazakhstan population would be placed in a privileged position compared to the indigenous population. But, according to Mikitayev, all these problems could be settled through separate bilateral agreements. Speaking about the problem of loyalty which could emerge, according to some experts, the head of the Russian delegation said that the Russian draft resolution on the issue "contains no such notion as 'dual loyalty'; at any rate, we do not stipulate it. Loyalty can be only with respect to the state where a person resides permanently." Legal grounds for such a formulation of the question could be provided by Article 4 of the Kazakhstan Constitution which says in particular: "A person who is a citizen of the Kazakhstan Republic is not deemed as enjoying the citizenship of another state with the exception of cases stipulated under the present Constitution and the state treaties of the Kazakhstan Republic. All the republic's citizens who were forced to leave its territory, as well as Kazakhs living in other states, shall have the right to hold citizenship of the Kazakhstan Republic along with citizenship of other countries provided that this does not contradict the legislation of those states whose citizens they are." Incidentally, Kazakhstan officials have more than once tried to give an excessively "liberal" interpretation to this article which, as international observers have noted repeatedly, has an ethnic coloring, stressing primarily the formulation: "Citizens who were forced to leave its territory." The absurdity of such an approach, renowned Kazakhstani lawyer Vitaliy Voronov noted at a recent international human rights conference, is belied by the very practice of local and immigration authorities, whose arbitrariness had to be curbed by President Nazarbayev himself with a special edict which defined the limits of kinship to help overcome ethnic and bureaucratic barriers for reunification with relatives. The "expanded" wording again refers only to the ancestors of "indigenous" representatives of the republic's population who were forcibly moved, mainly to China after 1917 and after the well-known famine in 1930-33. However after 1917, as is known, many representatives of other ethnic groups left Kazakhstan as well, in particular, Uygurs and Tungans. Also Cossacks. Yet today everybody in Kazakhstan (even officials) understand very well that it is virtually impossible for these immigrants who "have temporarily left" Kazakhstan territory to come back or acquire Kazakhstan citizenship (let alone dual citizenship, under Article 4). Furthermore, Mikitayev noted, the sides could start implementing Nazarbayev's idea about creating "a single citizenship space" even now. As concerns an exodus to Russia, this process also worries the Russian side greatly. According to Moscow, in 1988, 23,600 people left Kazakhstan; in 1989, 53,000; in 1990, 306,000; in 1992, 369,000; and in the nine months of 1993, 247,000. It needs to be noted that these figures hardly reflect the true picture of emigration because the Russian embassy in Alma-Ata registers far from all those leaving. Nonetheless, Abdulakh Mikitayev was optimistic and assured that an agreement regulating the question of citizenship will be concluded within the next two months.
