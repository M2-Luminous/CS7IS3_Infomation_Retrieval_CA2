[Bayramov] Relations between Iran and Turkmenistan are broadening day by day and this is a source of much pleasure to us. As you are aware, last October the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Hashemi-Rafsanjani, visited Turkmenistan and the officials of the two countries discussed numerous issues. The visit by President Niyazov is a follow-up to the agreements reached during that visit and it is being viewed as extremely important. President Niyazov is scheduled to visit Esfahan, Shiraz, Kish, Gonbad-e Kavus in addition to Tehran. We believe this will be an opportunity for the Turkmen President to view the economic issues and capabilities of Iran at close quarters and this would benefit both countries. I have just taken over this assignment and now that I am in close contact with Iran I feel that the understanding between the officials of the two sides is much stronger. In my opinion, both countries are keen on the progress of their respective countries and nations. The former Soviet Union kept the Iranian and Turkmen nations segregated for a long time but after independence, the two countries have become closer to one another and this is a source of much pride and joy to us. The fact that the Iranian officials express their affection for us and consider us a friendly fraternal country gives us immense happiness. [KEYHAN] What is the level of economic and commercial ties between Iran and Turkmenistan? [Bayramov] At present Iran has some centers for the sale of its goods in Turkmenistan, which has been warmly welcomed by the Turkmen people. These centers will be expanded in the future. Of course, we are not going to content ourselves with trade only. It has been decided that factories will be jointly set up by the two countries in Turkmenistan with Iranian and Turkish investment. Products from these factories will be for domestic consumption as well as for export by Turkmenistan. The relevant ministers regularly exchange visits and study the conditions and feasibility of the projects. For example, Turkmenistan has very rich mines that yield construction stones and Iran is able to set up factories to polish these stones and to prepare them for decorative use. These stones can be used in Turkmenistan and can be valuable exports as well. Numerous other factories will be set up in Turkmenistan and Iran will provide the technology and machinery for these factories. At present the Tejen-Sarakhs railroad is under construction and is a joint project. Agreements on other projects are expected to be signed between the two sides during the course of President Niyazov's visit. In our opinion the agreements of the two countries that are on paper are not of consequence but it is the follow-up and practical measures that will be implemented. [KEYHAN] In view of the travels of citizens of the two countries, what measures have been envisaged by the Turkmenistan Government for providing facilities for Iranian passengers? [Bayramov] We respect passengers who come to our country with noble ideas and objectives and we believe in providing them with all possible facilities. If their objectives can prove effective and beneficial for the interests of the two countries, such as setting up factories, or for trade and so on, we welcome them especially. Our country is still young but wishes to have relations with all countries. I stress that if one does not interfere in our internal affairs, one is free to travel to our country. The majority of the Iranians travelling to Turkmenistan have sincere and noble intentions and only come to get acquainted with our country and to meet their relatives. Others come to set up factories and for business purposes and we welcome them wholeheartedly. [KEYHAN] What steps have been taken to abolish visa restrictions between the two countries? [Bayramov] Talks are in progress on the subject and visa requirements will be waived. [KEYHAN] What is the nature of the relations between Turkmenistan and the Western countries? [Bayramov] As I said earlier, Turkmenistan's border is open to every country. We will enter no political bloc. We want to have reciprocal relations with every country, just as we have with Iran. Numerous political and economic delegations regularly visit Turkmenistan from France, Germany, Canada, the United States, Italy, Argentina, and Japan. We are not a closed country. Relations with these countries have led to some valuable industrial and economic agreements. We grasp the hand of every country that comes to us with noble and pure intentions. [KEYHAN] Have your warm and close relations with Iran affected your relations with other countries? [Bayramov] No country has the right to interfere in this issue. Similarly, no country can question why we have close relations with, say, Iran. This has had no impact on our relations with other countries. [KEYHAN] Do you have relations with Saudi Arabia and Israel as well? [Bayramov] We have no embassy in Israel. As I stated earlier, if a country comes with noble intentions and with plans and projects to benefit both sides, we will study them on condition that their intentions are sincere and positive. We have relations with Saudi Arabia but we have no embassy there yet. [KEYHAN] What kind of economic and cultural relations do you have with Turkey? [Bayramov] As with Iran, we have cordial fraternal relations with Turkey. We have set up factories with Turkey's collaboration and we have bilateral commercial relations. Our students study at cultural and university centers in Turkey. [KEYHAN] Do you have any particular pattern in mind for the political administration of your country? [Bayramov] We copy no country's system. We are independent and we have our own distinct national policy. We do not emulate the model of any particular country. From every country with which we have relations, we adapt things as we see fit to the conditions in our country. [KEYHAN] Since Turkmenistan joined organizations such as the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and the Caspian Sea Organization after becoming independent, how do you see the future of such cooperation? [Bayramov] We attach immense importance to regional cooperation, especially economically. Such cooperation certainly benefits all regional countries. If we can get gas to transit through Iran and export it to the world, it will benefit everyone, including Iran. If we expand the communication routes among regional countries, it would certainly benefit them all. If the Turkmen railroad is extended to join Iran's, we can link ourselves with Pakistan, Turkey, and Afghanistan. We believe that organizations for regional cooperation such as the ECO and the Caspian Sea Organization will bring immense benefits to the newly independent countries such as Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. [KEYHAN] How are your relations with Russia? To what extent has economic and cultural dependence on Moscow been eliminated? [Bayramov] We do not depend on Russia. We have not severed our links with it; we have cordial economic and commercial relations with all the newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union. But we cannot tell Russia what to do and they cannot tell us either. It makes no difference to us whether a country is big or small. We may feel overwhelmed by larger countries in the same way that we feel no sense that smaller countries are great. [KEYHAN] What is your opinion of the political adversity in Tajikistan? Does it have any fallout effect on your country? [Bayramov] In our opinion, events in Tajikistan are a purely internal affair and no country has the right to interfere. We believe the Tajiks should solve their problems themselves.
