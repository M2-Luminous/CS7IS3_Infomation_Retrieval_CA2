The Ecobalance Is Becoming a Decision-Making Tool"; first paragraph is VDI NACHRICHTEN's introduction] [Text] Stuttgart, 7 Jan 94 (VDI-N)--"Avoid Using and Disposing Of" goes a well known motto of the German environmentalists on the way toward the recycling economy. The recycling of materials is accordingly a duty. But Professor Peter Eyerer, a doctor of engineering, wonders whether the devil is not being cast out by Beelzebub here. Together with his team of experts at the Institute for Plastics Testing and Plastics Science (IKP) in Stuttgart, in what follows he advocates the trend that has begun toward comprehensive balancing of the environmental impact of products. The recycling of used materials into the production cycle is certainly a sensible move toward reducing the quantities of waste that accrue. But if the logistical expense to be incurred or the energy requirement for returning materials to the materials cycle go beyond a justifiable level, the reasonableness of such a course of action has to be examined. This applies likewise to recycling procedures or processes whose consumption of energy and emissions are higher than those of the primary process of producing the material. Every individual angle has to be weighed here. For this reason a suitable aid has to be developed in order to make transparent and to categorize the individual benefits or burdens: The ecobalance will become a decision-making tool. For it will be possible to arrive at a judgement only by the complete consideration of every relevant aspect, i.e., the technical, economic and ecological viewpoints, and not just from a single-cause viewpoint. But the ecobalance cannot be a sole aid as an assessment method for environmental aspects. Though it is excellently suited for showing the appropriateness of individual process options, nevertheless it fails when it is a matter of considering the overall model taking economic and technical criteria into account. For instance, plastics recycling is today largely well masterable technically and sensible when true-to-type clean waste whose composition is known is at hand. But problems arise when economic limiting conditions, like the recyclate's price compared to the new product, for example, speak against the use of recycled materials. For instance, today 1 kg of polyethylene (PE) from East European countries costs around one German mark [DM]. The comparable product from West Europe is quoted at almost DM1.10 per kilogram. And by contrast polyethylene from recycled material costs about DM2.5 per kilogram today. Is it sensible all the same to recycle popular plastics like polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene? Certainly not at all from an economic standpoint! But the material is indeed too good to throw away, and also too expensive at today's dumping costs. But the consumers or, as the case may be, buyers of plastics users are not willing to fall back on secondary products. Technical specifications are often even worded so that the use of secondary raw materials is not even possible. Of course, with that a sales market at the going price anyway also needs to be able to be obtained. Thermal recycling presents itself, especially for popular plastics like PE and PP. Instead of burning petroleum in the form of heating oil, petroleum in the form of plastics can be burned just as well, only with the difference that here still another mission would be fulfilled as well in the meantime. But thermal processes are still encountering rejection because of the strong feeling of insecurity among the public. This debate is based for the most part on a large deficiency of information that is attributable on the one hand to the lack of education by operators, but on the other hand also to strongly politically motivated opinion molding. Factual arguments are often too weak in this subject area to get around the emotionalizing of the groups concerned. Hence comes the need basically to compare all waste disposal and recycling technologies and to examine the suitability of the individual processes for the most different waste products or old components that accrue. Transparency for operators and the public has to be provided precisely here by way of an all-embracing consideration of every aspect. Accordingly, an ecobalance that describes just environmental aspects is not an adequate tool. Rather, the system description has to come after a comprehensive way of viewing the question. For example, for metals there has been recycling for decades, motivated by economic factors. However, very often there has been no direct recycling (closed-loop recycling) for a particular use, but the recycling of materials in other fields of use (open-loop recycling). However, there have been strong efforts to recycle for the same use scrap that accrues from primary uses. Far greater success has been achieved here for metallic materials than for polymer materials. But is this effort also really sensible? Why does high-grade steel absolutely have to be remade into high-grade steel? When there is a market for less exacting uses, one has to consider well what expense matches which results. The problem for metals, of amassing individual particular alloys separately and true to type, is similar to that for plastics. Proportionate expense has to be incurred here too in order to achieve closed-loop recycling. As are plastics, metals are also used mostly in composite designs and less frequently in pure form. On the one hand it is precisely these uses that result in special problems for recycling, but on the other hand it is also these uses that are distinguished by exceptional property profiles. But worth the real attention here is the question whether the closed- loop recycling of metallic materials for a particular use is sensible as a principle. A worldwide market for secondary uses, i.e., uses having lower requirements for the materials, has developed over the course of time for metals. The decisive problem to be solved is whether the introduction of the material into a recycling cascade or, as the case may be, the approving acceptance of a putative material assessment generally represents a worse solution. The answer to this question can be given again only by considering every important influencing factor from ecology, economics and technology. The comprehensive balance will become the valuable aid toward getting a more complete picture of the situation. One-sided and single-cause mentalities are not suited for solving complex circumstances like the problems of recycling. Firm solution possibilities will be found only via a comprehensive way of viewing the question that includes economic aspects too in addition to the technical and ecological aspects. Comprehensive balances by way of ecobalances expanded in important aspects are such a tool. This decision-making tool must be applied separately for company-, product- and site-specific aspects. In addition, the entire product life cycle must be considered. Sound materials and process decisions can be made only on this basis. In addition to optimization in the purely materials area, however, work also has to be done on a resource-minimized product cycle for components already at the design stage. In addition to the avoidance of non- disassembly-friendly designs, the use of specific combinations of materials in composite components and the general selection from the diversity of materials has to be thought over, both for polymer materials and for metals. The advantages and disadvantages of individual options must be submitted to a comprehensive balance already at this early stage of product development, in order to be able to reveal weaknesses in good time or to make sound selection decisions. For this reason the comprehensive balance takes on central importance as a tool in the development process and in simultaneous engineering.
