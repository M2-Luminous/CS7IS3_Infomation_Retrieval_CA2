Therefore, the provincial CPC Committee and government have decided that government organs at all levels throughout the province are to fully implement the state civil service system and fulfill this task within a few years. The provincial CPC Committee and government have urged the relevant units to properly perform the work of making arrangements for the placement of those who lose their jobs due to reduced staffing and link this work with the development of the social productive forces. Structural reform and streamlining overstaffed organs should be carried out through various channels and at all levels.
