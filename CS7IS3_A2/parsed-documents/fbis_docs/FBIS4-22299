Perhaps He Will Indeed Become a Candidate, but President--Hardly"] [Text] One of the most fascinating occupations engaged in by people who take an interest in politics is calculating who will attempt to become president in the next presidential elections. Recently, rumors have circulated that Ilya Konstantinov was preparing to embark upon this arduous path and that he was planning to take with him for company Valeriy Zorkin, former chairman of the Constitutional Court. The team of rivals inclined to fight for the presidency has more or less been formed. The only ones who are still holding back with their bids are the "die-hards"--Yeltsin, Gorbachev, Chernomyrdin. But the rest are "pawing the ground." Yavlinskiy, Zhirinovskiy, Shakhray, Rutskoy, Gaydar, Travkin.... Generally speaking, one can put on the list any Russian politician who is the slightest bit famous--you will not go wrong. Judging by everything, at the presidential elections the situation be a repeat of that before 12 December--no general candidates, no one will yield to anyone and withdraw their candidacy for the benefit of a more popular like-minded candidate, everyone for himself. If there are many candidates, that means that there is no generally accepted leader. If there are many claimants, that means that there is not one, after all. His Favorite Clothing--the Peacemaker's Toga Valeriy Zorkin is in an unusual position. He is one of the few whose name is at this point not associated with one of the parties, and not even with a political force. Although a fairly wide spectrum of parties considers him one of their own. But right now he is not interested in them, but on the contrary, they in him. During the period of the parliamentary election campaign, he received offers to be entered on the election lists of Civic Union, Aksyuchits' Christian-democratic movement, and the Agrarian Party. But he, thanking everyone for the honor, declined the offers, since he was still a member of the Constitutional Court. Today his name is being counted upon by Ilya Konstantinov, who has been freed from Lefortovo and has conceived the plan to resurrect the National Salvation Front. And in principle, this fact evokes no surprise. If we recall the recent past, the National Salvation Front should be experiencing a special feeling of gratitude toward Valeriy Zorkin. After all, in its time, the Constitutional Court, under Zorkin's leadership, declared unconstitutional the edict of the president that banned this same front. Of course, Zorkin considers that this gratitude is inappropriate--he was only carrying out his duty, checking the actions of the president with the Constitution. But nevertheless, the front owes its existence to the Constitutional Court and its former chairman. Is Valeriy Zorkin himself up on these plans for the future? He declares that he is not. "I am flattered, it is an honor for me, that Konstantinov has raised me to his level.... But for me, this is a complete surprise." Of course, these self-abasing curtsies to Konstantinov and his "level" should not be taken literally--Valeriy Zorkin is simply a very well-bred and modest person. It seems to me that he would answer any offer in this way, regardless from whom it came. Or not? Valeriy Zorkin was always not simply a jurist, not simply a judge, not simply the chairman of the Constitutional Court, but a man endowed with a political temperament. The role of the chairman of the Constitutional Court, to which he came as a result of purely political actions--an expert of the Constitutional Commission, an elaborator of the law on the Constitutional Court--was, as is now seen perfectly distinctly, always perceived by him as a political post. The Judge of All The thesis of the political sterility of constitutional judges seemed to many a bit of craftiness about which it was indecent to speak aloud. With tacit silence, everyone pretended that, yes indeed, the court is outside of politics. But admit it, if you become judge of the president and of the deputies, if you have the right to tell the head of state, "You are wrong," or if you do the same with regard to those elected by the people, and if your decision is not subject to discussion, then that elevates you in your own eyes and even makes you sort of their equal. It is an insidious thing, judging. How sweet for an untempered man.... Without a doubt, this role was very, very much to Valeriy Zorkin's taste. He considered it his calling--not calling in our everyday vernacular, which has lost its innermost, sacral sense and signifies only a talent, an inclination for something. But Calling with a capital C, that is, a concept from among the class of divine categories, a manifestation of a higher will. Valeriy Zorkin does not particularly conceal that he believes in divine providence and that today he has not drawn back from politics but cocks his ear to fate. He is frozen in expectation--how will his life be ordered? It is partly from this--the man does not belong to himself and does not himself choose a path for himself--that his passive position also results. Zorkin considers it unacceptable to offer himself and his name to various political forces and to engage in trade with the aim of reaching the highest quotation of his own political stock. So, judging from everything, Zorkin perceived the role of the chairman of the Constitutional Court as a calling also to embody a measure of morality in politics. He saw himself not as a political leader, but as a spiritual one, as a person who shows what is good and what is bad, with everyone hearkening to him.... A judge and a spiritual authority are two incompatible things. A spiritual leader is strong not in the lines of a verdict, but in the entire scope of his personality. It cannot be denied that Zorkin did not attempt--I do not even know how to say this--to acquire, to play, to imitate this scope of personality. In general, to be at the level of the ideal that lived in his soul. But the results would hardly convince even him himself. And he is hardly to blame for this. Piecemeal Centrism The fact is that, for reasons of the most objective of circumstances of political life, the perfectly honorable role of peacemaker that he chose was an absolute failure. During Zorkin's tenure as chairman of the Constitutional Court, events developed according to a confrontational scenario, and not because of the perniciousness of the interested parties (although this was also present to a small degree), but by virtue of the fact that the political opponents were striving for opposite and incompatible things. Even if civil peace was, at great effort, preserved, there was no peace in hearts and minds. And there is none now. And to represent the matter as such that we will take a little bit from the leftists and a little bit from the rightists, and we will have centrism and political splendor--that is either uncommon naivete or conscious game-playing. Zorkin is not the only one who has been caught up in this. But it is not just that the role of peacemaker is not yet a timely one in our country, and therefore, it cannot be crowned with success. Zorkin was not even able to create the image of a peacemaker. Zorkin demonstrated exceeding verbosity, fussiness, partiality, and involvement in conflict. He remained simultaneously judge to the president and the deputies, judge to himself, and a sort of head of a "quick reaction" corps in the development of the political situation. And for that reason, he very quickly began to be used toward political ends. Contradictory ambition led to Zorkin's getting embroiled up to his ears in political squabbles of the day, and he began to play a strange role--something like a pawn in other people's hands, something like a typical representative of the restless intelligentsia, which is eternally afraid of everything, can never decide to do anything, and strives to dump this decision in someone else's lap. The position of a peacemaker both before the referendum and in October could have been the same--a call to all the participating sides: "Refrain from violence at any cost." A political peacemaker, a spiritual leader, even a simple politician (but a politician!) should think about to what, to which consequences, his decision, his word, his action, will lead. A judge should not. What am I leading up to? To the fact that Zorkin is not this nor that nor the other--not a peacemaker, not a spiritual leader, and not a politician. He is a very capable, qualified jurist with a striking need for self-expression and self-assertion. With certain huge ambitions that are eroded, not concrete, but lying more in the realm of politics. Are these ambitions fated to be realized? It would not seem so. Outside of Realism. That Is Typical Why? The opinions of Valeriy Zorkin on politics create the impression of being too banal, declarative, and abstract. For example, Zorkin is convinced of the necessity for the creation of a broad centrist coalition, which could include (if we orient ourselves on the Duma factions) communists, agrarians, a segment of Yavlinskiy's bloc, part of Shakhray's party, and Travkin's party. And Baburin and his group, too. This coalition will create a government that will lead the country out of the blind alley into which it was led by Yeltsin, Gaydar, and their like. It is completely unnecessary to hand out posts to Travkin, Lapshin, and Shakhray (who is not doing without as it is, incidentally) in order to see that this will change nothing. In this sense, Chernomyrdin's government is ideologically a completely coalition one. It includes representatives of Shakhray's party and of the agrarians and of the communists. "If you promised the people something and you were not able to come through, then retire, let someone else try," Zorkin says to the democrats, forgetting that Gaydar has in fact left and that everything that is happening today in the economy is happening without his participation, and Yeltsin's term expires only in 1996 and there is no reason for him to step down sooner--even according to the Constitution, which we all, taking our lead from the constitutional judges, honor. And besides, it was precisely Yeltsin who formed the currently working, essentially coalition government, of whose necessity Gennadiy Zyuganov and Valeriy Zorkin are constantly talking. Valeriy Zorkin considers the main task of state power to be the struggle against corruption, which the president has promised to conduct; meanwhile, the corruption has not been done away with.... Well, what can one say to that? That the coalition government will not be able to do away with it either, and, in order to be convinced of this there is no need to experiment with ministers? That we will not be able to triumph over corruption, but only to localize it, when a civil society, a stable multiparty system, and an effective economy are created? And to "triumph over" corruption is possible only with universal repressions, and even then.... Finally, that it is not the president who fights corruption, but the security organs, the procuracy, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which are demonstrating no inclination to engage seriously in this? Incidentally speaking, the security organs, the procuracy, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs are completely "coalition," because they are composed of those same people who were there under Soviet power. There Are Also Those Who Are `More Ours' The Constitutional Court now finds itself in a strange position. The former law is not in effect, but the Duma is wrapping up the draft of the new one with unmitigated stubbornness. In the court, the matter is represented in such a way that neither the president nor the deputies need the Constitutional Court--it will just get underfoot in the coming slingfest. Valeriy Zorkin, however, acknowledges that "while the volcano continues to erupt," perhaps there really is no sense in the Constitutional Court's beginning to work--the legal grounds have not yet become set, one edict supersedes another, and the Duma still has not managed to adopt a single law, and therefore ought to feel uncomfortable in front of the Constitutional Court. Will he be able to satisfy his thirst for self-realization in such a court? And the answer suggests itself of its own accord: No. Most likely, he will also not be able to withdraw into the quiet of a judge's chambers. And he himself will not be able to. Zorkin does not want to guess at future events. But, most likely, his name will be uttered more than once toward the presidential and parliamentary elections. He hardly has a serious chance at the presidency--one would think that he is an intelligent person and understands that himself, although perhaps in his heart he cannot agree with such a fate. The voters are unlikely to evaluate his moral castings in the field of politics--for many people, after his chairman's epic he is "neither fish nor fowl" and you cannot figure out what he wants; for others, he is an apostate; for others, maybe he is in fact "one of ours," but there are those who are "more ours." But Zorkin could perfectly well become an independent and fairly influential deputy. If that will satisfy him.
