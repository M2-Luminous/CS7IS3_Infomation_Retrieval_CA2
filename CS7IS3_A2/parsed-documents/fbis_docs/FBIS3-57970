The government's draft budget was rejected, then a no-confidence vote garnered 34 ayes and 25 noes, giving a fortnight for the formation of a new executive. The ouster was the first-ever by the regional assembly of the regional government. The vote represents a new set-back for the previously all-conquering Northern League, which swept much of the board in Northern Italy in local elections held in June, but then failed to build on its breakthrough in voting in a group of major and less important cities early this month. The majority that downed Friuli Venezia Giulia's government consisted of Left and Christian Democrats, Socialists, the Communists, the Friuli Autonomy League, the Greens, and a couple of independents. Opposition to the no-confidence motion came from the League, the Republicans and the Liberals, who formed the governing alliance, plus the neo-Fascist Italian Social Movement and the Slate for Trieste. The political parties have been negotiating for the formation of a new majority for several days. One idea is a Christian Democrat-League alliance, which is being urged by the neo-Fascists and the Slate for Trieste, and another a Left Democrat-led coalition including the Communists, the Greens and the Friuli Autonomy League with support from Christian Democrats and Socialists.
