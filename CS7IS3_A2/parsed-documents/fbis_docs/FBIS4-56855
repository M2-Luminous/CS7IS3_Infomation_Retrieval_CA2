At the opening session for the academic year of the School of Political and Managerial Science in the Academy of Christian Humanism, Arriagada lectured on "Public Probity and Ethics," noting that the country has a deficit in the development of its public ethics. "We do not have a sick, but rather a developing country, with good intentions but without experience in matters like this, vital and dynamic, but fragile," he said. He added that "we are not clearly aware of the limits of power, the rules and criteria that must be observed by politicians, public servants, and citizens in case of conflict of interest. We have a legalistic mentality coupled with the idea that violating the law is not something serious." He said that many of the cases that the press has reported as being instances of corruption "do not originate with a deliberate desire to acquire wealth, but with the ignorance of elected authorities -- especially those in municipal governments -- who believe they can manage power as liberally, and as free from any rules as they run their small private businesses." He said that the border between power and money is hazy, "to the extent that leading entrepreneurs usually boast of the political power they have acquired by financing political campaigns, while there is a dangerous lack of definition of incompatibility." He added that in light of this situation, the government has created a high-level commission to focus on the problem from the viewpoint of a state policy, beyond partisan confrontation and beyond the disputes between the government and the opposition. He said that public servants, because of their being in government, have stricter obligations in their public and private lives, despite the fact that the country demands high levels of morality in all areas of activity. He added that corruption originates not only in the weaknesses of human nature, but also in the faults of the political, institutional, and administrative systems. Referring to the state's relationship with the economy, Arriagada said the greatest risks of corruption are hatched in this relationship, as there are private agents seeking illegitimate influence in their favor, and also state agents -- in what is considered true corruption -- who sometimes also receive private benefits. Arriagada said that in order to fight this potential threat, it is necessary to combat obscurity in the decisionmaking procedures, and where there is ample room for public servants to exercise discretional power. He added that the third source of corruption is the monopoly public officials have in allocating funds. Arriagada also referred to the relationship between money and politics, stating that this is a problem that is common to political parties, movements, and any political system, and which if not controlled and clarified greatly harms respect for politics as well as the legitimacy of the resources. He said that in order to solve this problem, laws must be created to reduce the costs of political campaigns, and in addition establishing forms of public, state, or private financing. "Any form of financial aid, whether it come from private enterprise, international political organizations, the abusive use of state resources, or any other imaginable resource, must be carefully controlled." Arriagada ended by stating that democracy requires clear, powerful efforts and results in this regard. "In many countries of the world, upholding the superiority of democracy as a form of government is not, in the eyes of the public, currently based on the capacity of democrats to establish an open style of political and governmental action, with the sole purpose of serving the people they represent."
