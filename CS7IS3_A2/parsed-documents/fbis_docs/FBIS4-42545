The defeated majority inevitably took issue with the referee of the match they had just lost in the Senate. They accused [Senate speaker] Carlo Scognamiglio of ignoring the fouls committed by the Left, by permitting the establishment of a new parliamentary group which at the last moment disrupted the precarious balance among the committees. Giovanni Spadolini's successor as speaker of the Senate was not troubled by the criticisms or surprised by the outcome. Before attending the dinner given in Clinton's honor, in his first interview with IL GIORNALE he explained why the controversial clash in the Senate may in fact have buried associationism forever. "The British would argue that `rule abuse' [two preceding words in English], what we Italians would call a trick, occurred in this instance," he said. "But abuse of the rules cannot be sanctioned by the speaker. The obvious shortcomings of regulations that are now obsolete permit a group of 10 senators to be represented on all 13 committees. The opposition exploited this fact. But the craftiness displayed -- and of course we may not have a good opinion of it -- was not decisive." [Guiglia] Why was it not decisive, if the government forces were defeated? [Scognamiglio] It was not the numbers that were the crucial factor in the majority's defeat. Proportionately, the government forces obtained more or less their due number of votes in the Senate. Nothing different happened from what we already know. People place too much emphasis on the committees, forgetting that the Senate as a whole is independent. Now the Senate can act as a "cooling chamber": The majority will have to reflect on what measures to present. With no excesses. [Guiglia] Having left through the door, is associationism reentering through the window? [Scognamiglio] On the contrary, we are moving toward a complete democracy. The minority's rights are protected, just as the government majority is now encouraged to make good laws. [Guiglia] Let us try to undermine your optimism: The Senate is turning down that which the Chamber of Deputies approves, and vice versa. Are we moving toward an early election? [Scognamiglio] If there is a threat of filibustering, it means that the minority will have abused its rights, by not permitting the normal functioning of democracy. In such an eventuality, all the necessary conclusions will have to be drawn. [Guiglia] But will the Marxist Carpi, the new chairman of the Industry Committee, ever be able to agree to privatization? [Scognamiglio] The same rules apply to him as apply to me. Since becoming head of the Senate I have ceased to be a Liberal. I hope that Senator Carpi will do the same with Marxism. [Guiglia] With regard to ideology, how to explain the anti-Italian campaign unleashed abroad under the banner of antifascism? [Scognamiglio] I have no idea how it originated. Be that as it may, a section of the foreign press is misrepresentating the real situation in Italy. Italy is suffering an injustice, which will be remedied in time and in practice. [Guiglia] This prejudice is taking root in Europe, but not in America. Is this a coincidence, or is there a historical and political difference? [Scognamiglio] In the United States, as in Italy, there is no danger of the growth of a nondemocratic right-wing party. Unfortunately this danger does exist in France, Germany, and Denmark, and it is probably this that causes the greatest anxieties. [Guiglia] You were elected as an innovation in the Second Republic. What changes have there been, will there be, in the proceedings of the Senate? [Scognamiglio] No laws have been passed yet. I think I have displayed respect for the rules and for the people's will, which is an area in which it is better that there be no "innovations." [Guiglia] Well, Irene Pivetti, the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, is proving more active than her predecessors. Which are better: "figurehead" speakers, as in the past, or "interventionist" ones? [Scognamiglio] If you are referring to Pivetti's initiative in favor of Rwanda, I consider it appropriate. The two parliamentary houses have the power to "address," and the appeal made to the government by the Chamber of Deputies Speaker certainly expressed the general feeling of the nation. I would not talk in terms of activism and passivity. With the end of associationism, the speakers of the assemblies no longer have the sole role of mediating between majority and opposition. They now have the role of guaranteeing the diversity of expression of majority and opposition. [Guiglia] Has the time come to carry out the grand reform, or has that time passed? [Scognamiglio] I believe that the Italian people voted pragmatically. Senators and deputies were elected in order to have a good government, not in order to carry out the grand reform. If the government does well, the changes will come in due course. Otherwise, the issue of the major rules will return to the forefront. [Guiglia] Can President Scalfaro remain in his post after his statements last Sunday [28 May] about "institutional purposes?" [Scognamiglio] I have already said that the president remains the focal point despite the evident inconsistencies introduced by the first-past-the-post electoral system. If the president were to resign, his successor would be the expression of a political majority to which he would ultimately be "subordinate." The very fact that Scalfaro is the expression of a political majority that no longer exists ensures that this hypothetical problem does not arise. I fully agree with what the haed of state said: He can only be set aside if and when there are changes to the Constitution that affect the presidency. [Guiglia] But is there not an "ethical issue" regarding the president? [Scognamiglio] I see no ethical issue regarding the president. [Guiglia] In abstract terms, are you in favor of the direct election of the head of state? [Scognamiglio] I would say that it is consistent with the method for electing parliament.
