FR941205-1-00034 FR941205-1-00013 FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION 46 CFR Part 552 [Docket No. 94&hyph;07] Financial Reporting Requirements and Rate of Return Methodology in the Domestic Offshore Trades AGENCY: Federal Maritime Commission. ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rule; Enlargement of Time. SUMMARY: The Commission is extending the time for reply comments in regard to its proposed rule on financial reporting requirements and rate of return methodology in the domestic offshore trades. The Commission also is permitting NPR, Inc., a new participant in the domestic offshore trades, to comment generally on the proposed rule. DATES: Comments due January 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: Send comments (original and fifteen copies) to: Joseph C. Polking, Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol Street NW., Washington, DC 20573&hyph;0001, (202) 523&hyph;5725. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard R. Speigel, Bureau of Trade Monitoring and Analysis, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol Street NW., Washington, DC 20573&hyph;0001, (202) 523&hyph;5845 C. Douglass Miller, Office of the General Counsel, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol Street NW., Washington, DC 20573&hyph;0001, (202) 523&hyph;5740 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission, by notice published November 4, 1994, 59 FR 55232, invited reply comments on four specific issues raised in this proceeding. Counsel for NPR, Inc. now seeks an extension of time in this proceeding from December 5, 1994, to January 27, 1995, to submit reply comments and ``such further comments on the issues as the Commission is required to consider under the terms of the Administrative Procedures Act.'' The upshot of this request is that NPR seeks to comment on any issue raised by the proposed rule, not just the issues on which the Commission specifically sought replies. The basis for the request is that NPR has only recently purchased the assets of Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Authority, a major participant in a domestic offshore trade, and has not had a prior opportunity to comment on the proposed rules. The Commission has determined to grant the request in part, extending the reply comment date to January 6, 1995. Additionally, since NPR, Inc. has not had a prior opportunity to comment on the proposed rule, its comments will not be required to be limited to the specific issues on which replies are sought. By the Commission. Joseph C. Polking, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29759 Filed 12&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6730&hyph;01&hyph;M
