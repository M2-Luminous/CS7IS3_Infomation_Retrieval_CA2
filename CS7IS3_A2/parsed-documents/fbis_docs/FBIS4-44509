In 1991, the said court adjudicated six fraud cases, in 1992 the cases had doubled to 12, and in 1993 is was a multiple of the 1992 figure again; these cases are increasing in a geometric progression. 2) Increasing magnitude of the objects involved. Few fraud cases were for less than 1,000 yuan, they were generally for several thousand yuan, and frequently even cases involving over ten thousand and several hundred thousand yuan. Cases involving more than 10,000 yuan accounted for 36 percent of the total cases. The defrauded sums of the cases adjudicated during the first quarter of 1993 amounted to 244,800 yuan, which is already 1.4 times the amount of involved in all case of 1991. 3) The scope of such cases has widened. Criminal elements from abroad have entered this country and are committing fraud on the mainland. Their activities have occurred in many different provinces and cities. 4) Losses due to these fraudulent activities have become serious. Objects of these frauds have been public and private property. Once accomplished, the victims will suffer losses to different degrees, and in some cases the consequences are very serious indeed. 5) In most cases of fraud village and township enterprises and individual contractors had been victimized. Among 25 fraud cases, 15 of the victims have been of the mentioned categories, accounting for 60 percent. The following are the methods used in the commission of fraud in these cases: Use of false documents to commit fraud. This is the main method used by defrauding criminals. The false documents are in the majority of cases false letters of introduction, false contracts, false testimonials, false resident's identification papers, and false seals of office. The use of false documents is always the easiest way for defrauders to succeed. Exploiting psychologically the strong desire of factories or owners of commodities to sell their goods, using sweet and enticing words to hoodwink the sellers. This kind of criminals will often exploit psychologically the great eagerness of owners of commodities to market their goods, and they will thus worm themselves into the confidence of the owners of commodities in order to achieve their intended objective which is fraud. Utilizing the opportunity presented by the great need of some enterprises to import technologies, criminal elements will commit fraud by first pretending to be able to provide or transfer such technologies. This kind of fraudulent criminals will often outwardly appear as honest gentlemen, who will pretend to be willing to help backward regions and willing to support the development of village and township enterprises. They will act ostentatiously, looking for a chance to swindle people, boasting of their own capabilities, and thus entice people by guile or flattery to fall victims to their fraudulent machinations. Exploiting psychologically the eagerness of some people to acquire certain commodities, criminal elements will deliberately make deceptive statements as to the commodities they offer, and thus accomplish their fraud. On the pretext of helping in the management of affairs, they will wantonly defraud people of money and possessions. Defrauders will often brag and boast about themselves as having certain backing and relations that would enable them to help in problems concerning registration of domicile, employment as cadres or workers, and will in this way swindle some people who have had every good intention. Swindling people of money and valuables by banking on the greed of some people. A criminal will purposely discard something on the street that looks valuable but is a fake. When a passerby picks it up, a group of accomplices will suddenly appear on the scene and demand a share of the find. As the value is shared among everybody involved, the fake item remains in the hands of the passerby, who will have had to pay out cash to the swindlers as their "share." Swindling people of money and possessions by means of superstitions. Cases of this nature occur mostly in the countryside and among people of a low level of general education; such cases tend to become more frequent almost daily.
