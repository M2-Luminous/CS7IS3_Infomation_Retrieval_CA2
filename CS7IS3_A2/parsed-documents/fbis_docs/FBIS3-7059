Hosokawa and Kim also agreed in a meeting at the Akasaka state guesthouse on the importance of building future-oriented bilateral relations based on the history of the past, the officials said. Talks between the two leaders, held amid mounting tension on the Korean peninsula, focused on issues concerning North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development, according to the officials. Hosokawa and Kim, who arrived earlier in the day for a three-day stay in Japan, agreed that the international community should take a firm stance against North Korea while leaving the door open for dialogue and handling the situation step by step, they said. Kim described the situation as "very serious," citing Pyongyang's refusal to allow full inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its recent aggressive postures, such as threatening to destroy Seoul "in flames," they said. Although South Korea will always hold the door open to dialogue with the North, there are limits to its patience if Pyongyang remains obstinate and tries to procrastinate, the officials quoted Kim as saying. Kim told Hosokawa that South Korea has a good security system, taking into account the possibility of various "accidental" situations occurring, and that it will do its utmost to maintain stability on the Korean peninsula, the officials said. He explained the decision to deploy Patriot missiles following talks with the U.S., and also said Seoul and Washington plan to resume the joint Team Spirit military exercise unless North Korea changes its attitude, they said. The president said he will decide on the specifics of the Team Spirit exercise after he returns home from Beijing, where he will fly on Saturday. He did not specify when the Patriot missiles would be deployed, the officials said. Hosokawa said Japan will take a "responsible" measure within the spirit of the Constitution if the problem of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons is brought to the United Nations Security Council, according to the officials. Hosokawa, who returned on Monday from a three-day visit to China, briefed Kim about his trip and said he conveyed Japan's strict view of the situation and the importance of China's role in solving the problem, they said. In connection with the nuclear problem, Hosokawa touched on some allegations that Japan intends to build its own nuclear weapons, saying it would be impossible for Japan to do so because of its three-point nonnuclear policy and because it is the only nation to have suffered atomic bombing, the officials said. He also said Japan supports the peaceful unification of the Korean peninsula in the future. In their meeting, which lasted over 90 minutes, Hosokawa and Kim, who met last November in Kyongju, South Korea, also agreed on the importance of building a future-oriented relationship by looking correctly at history, the officials said. The reference was to the 1910-45 Japanese colonization of the Korean peninsula. Kim was quoted as saying such future-oriented bilateral relations would have great meaning for Asia nations as well as the rest of the world. Hosokawa and Kim also agreed that Japan, South Korea and Russia should make efforts to effect as soon as possible measures to solve such problems as the return of Koreans left behind on the Russian Far East island of Sakhalin to their homeland, the officials said. Japan forcibly took tens of thousands of Koreans as laborers to Sakhalin, whose southern half it ruled from 1905 until the end of World War II, but left them behind when the island came under Soviet rule. About 43,000 ethnic Koreans are currently living on Sakhalin, according to Sakhalin government statistics. Hosokawa said his heart aches to think of the hardships the people left on Sakhalin suffered. Also during their talks, Hosokawa and Kim exchanged views about their respective political and economic reform efforts, the officials said. Kim and Hosokawa are scheduled to hold a second round of talks on Saturday to discuss mainly economic matters. They also agreed to discuss the North Korean problem again if necessary, the officials said. Later Thursday evening, Kim attended a dinner hosted by Emperor Akihito. On Friday, he will deliver speeches in the Diet and at Waseda University.
