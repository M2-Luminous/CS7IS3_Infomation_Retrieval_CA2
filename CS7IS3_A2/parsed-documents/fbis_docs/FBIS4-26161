She made the remark at the luncheon hosted by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in her honor when answering a question from an Indian journalist. China is trying to build a socialist market economy and India's economy is a market one, she said, adding that the nature of the market economy is competition. The Chinese minister said that cooperation and competitions are inter-dependent and there exists a certain competition between the two countries in the international market. "But that is a friendly competition and the cooperation between China and India exceeds competition actually," she said. In her speech, Wu Yi elaborated the Chinese Government policies on foreign investment and joint ventures and answered questions from Indian businessmen present at the luncheon. Today, the Chinese minister also met Indian Minister of State for Coal A.K. Panja and Indian Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas S. Sharma. Both sides discussed matters relating to the further development of cooperation between the two countries in the areas of coal, steel as well as petroleum and natural gas. Wu Yi will be leaving here this evening for the next and last leg of her four-Asian-nation visit, Singapore.
