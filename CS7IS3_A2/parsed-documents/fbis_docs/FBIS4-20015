Sutherland revealed his intention at an informal meeting of the heads of delegations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), citing "personal" matters as the reason for his possible resignation. The GATT director general, however, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that he will not officially express his desire to resign soon. "I cannot say anything now," he said. Sutherland succeeded his predecessor Arthur Dunkel in July last year and helped lead the Uruguay Round of global trade talks to a successful conclusion last December. His term will continue until the end of June next year. There have been talks in the last few months that Sutherland may leave GATT halfway through his term to land positions at bigger international bodies such as the European Union. An Asian diplomatic source said Sutherland said he wants to quit after the preparatory work for the World Trade Organization [WTO], scheduled to be formed on January 1 next year to replace GATT, is completed. Analysts said Sutherland's remarks will soon prompt countries planning to participate in the WTO to search for other candidates for the chief of the new trade body.
