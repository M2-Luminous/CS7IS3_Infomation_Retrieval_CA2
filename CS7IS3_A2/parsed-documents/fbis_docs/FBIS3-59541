At least from the organizational standpoint. The group's new structure is built around a new management committee that has been baptized the "Bull Executive Board." It consists of 11 members, including Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the new CEO [chief executive officer] since the eviction of Bernard Pache last October. This Executive Board has in turn formed an operations council -- the Bull Operating Council --consisting of approximately 100 members. The group's operations units are also reorganized. The Bull group will now consist of seven major divisions, each financially autonomous. These units will concern themselves with the company's products (servers, open systems and softwares, microcomputer systems), its services (integration of systems, maintenance, and multivendor services), and its industrial activities. Through this reorganization, Bull clearly hopes to recover financial equilibrium in 1994, thanks also to the support that will be generated by its forthcoming recapitalization of 8.6 billion francs. And thanks also to implementation of its staff-reduction and assets-divestment plans. The first to be affected by these plans will be its artificial intelligence activities and its in-house printing activities.
