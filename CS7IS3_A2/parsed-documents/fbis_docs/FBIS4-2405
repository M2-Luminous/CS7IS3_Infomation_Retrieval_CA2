The arteries will run from Tongjiang in Heilongjiang Province south to Sanya in Hainan; from Beijing south to Zhuhai in Guangdong; from Lianyungang in Jiangsu west to Huoerguosi in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous Region; and from Shanghai west to Ghengdu in Sichuan. They are expected to be completed by the year 2000, according to Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong. The roads, with a total length of 140,000 kilometres, will go through more than 20 provinces and autonomous regions and link more than 100 major cities and important hubs. Huang told the China Bidding Magazine that by the year 2000, China's roads will stretch 1.2 million kilometres, of which 18,500 kilometers will be of high grade. To speed up the construction of roads, which are still the lifelines of the country's communications system, China is poised to encourage more foreign investment and co-operation, Huang said. The minister said a big influx of overseas capital is expected this year as investors from the United States, Canada and Western Europe swarm in seeking business opportunities. "China not only welcomes foreign investors to co-operate with Chinese partners to invest in, construct and operate the roads, but also supports foreign involvement in the development of communication infrastructure through the `Build, Operate and Transfer' arrangement," Huang said. "Build, Operate and Transfer" refers to a scheme in which foreign businessmen invest in the construction of a project, manage it for a fixed time, then hand over management and ownership to Chinese hands. Huang said foreign investment has helped China build 1,700 kilometres of roads, of which 370 kilometres are expressways or high-grade roads. From 1991 to 1996, another 1,600 kilometres of highways and high-grade roads are expected to be completed with foreign co-operation. During this period foreign investment will also help build 3,000 kilometres of roads in rural areas and ordinary roads, Huang said. Meanwhile, 23 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have used or will use loans from international financial institutions and foreign governments to build 7,000 kilometres of roads. The total value of these loans amounts to about $1.7 billion. In addition, Huang said that the construction of ports, which was opened to foreign investors before road work, has also absorbed significant foreign investment. To lure more overseas capital, he said, China now allows foreign investors to co-operate with their Chinese partners in building and operating public wharves, loading and unloading cargo, and leasing docks. They are also allowed to build wholly-invested special channels and docks that are limited to the use of the owners. Huang said that by the end of 1992, $1.66 billion in foreign capital had been used in building 29 ports. Of the 29 projects, nine have been completed. Huang said that by 2000, China will have 1,100 berths of at least medium size, of which 650 will be in deep water.
