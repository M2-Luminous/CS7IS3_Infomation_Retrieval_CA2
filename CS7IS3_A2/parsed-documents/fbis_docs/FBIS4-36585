[Al-'Attas] This is due to the ambiguities of the current situation. But now that the issue has been discussed by the UN Security Council, I believe the time is very appropriate for Arab and friendly countries to explicitly specify their stand in order to avert further destruction of our people, which the northern leadership carries out. [passage omitted] [AL-YAWM] Do you believe recognition of the DRY will increase the chances of halting the war? [Al-'Attas] Recognition will keep Sanaa from continuing what it insists on carrying out. [AL-YAWM] What is the actual number of dead and homeless? [Al-'Attas] There are no accurate figures about how many have been killed. But we estimate the number of dead at 60,000 and those made homeless at hundreds of thousands. [AL-YAWM] What do you have to say to Sanaa's statement that the southern forces were the ones to hit the Aden refinery? [Al-'Attas] Two northern Air Force squadrons, each comprising four planes, raided the refinery. These are lies. It is very shameful for them to resort to such lies. [passage omitted] [AL-YAWM] What about the shortage of medical and food supplies? Is there any assistance in this respect? [Al-'Attas] The war in Yemen has resulted in an acute shortage of medical and food supplies. We do not have the medical supplies needed to treat those wounded in the war that was ignited by the Sanaa leadership against our people in the south. There is also a shortage of food supplies as a result of the war that obstructs their shipment to southern Yemen. We appeal to our Arab brothers and our friends to send us medical supplies and food. [AL-YAWM] Will you ask Sanaa for war reparations? [Al-'Attas] Certainly. Although the war has harmed all the Yemeni people, the Sanaa leadership launched it. [passage omitted] [AL-YAWM] Are there foreign elements other than the Iraqis within the northern forces? [Al-'Attas] Yes, there are Sudanese elements, beside the Iraqis. Iraq assists the northern forces. Jordan also provides spare parts for aircraft and other equipment. We have information that they received new aircraft and spare parts for the Phantoms they have from Jordan. They also received other forms of technical assistance and pilots. We know the pilots that carry out the raids are not Yemenis but are Iraqis and from other nationalities.
