Speaking in debate on the president's speech, Mr Nzo said South Africa should strive to live in harmony with its neighbours and should conduct a foreign policy aimed at the promotion of the well-being of all its people. "As an African country with a rich international heritage, we should promote Africa's interests, not only its immediate economic and social needs, but also the continent's long-term wellbeing in all spheres." South Africa's foreign policy would be guided by the promotion of freedom and democracy and commitments to human rights, the principles of justice, to the interests of Africa, and to expanded regional and international economic co-operation. South Africa would seek to promote unity among all the peoples of Africa. South Africa's first step in realising the ideal of African unity was its acceptance as the 53rd member of the Organisation of African Unity. "Africa has taken us to her bosom with overwhelming warmth and friendship. We are now part of Africa." A regional security mechanism was important to deal with regional conflicts.
