CONTENTS: 1. Anger Over Lawyer's Death 2. Eyewitness Account of Detention, Torture 3. Islamic Writer Banned From AL-AHRAM 4. Sudanese Minister Interviewed 5. A Muslim Brotherhood Version of Pluralism ANGER OVER LAWYER'S DEATH Expressions of anger by the Bar Association and other quarters over the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani while in police custody is featured in more than one article. A front-page banner headline reads "Madani's Death Marks a Climax in Government Terror." A 300-word front-page report by Ashraf Khalil and Khali Yunus describe a gathering at the Bar Association on 12 May and a planned demonstration on 17 May. The report notes that: "The Arab Bar Association issued a statement denouncing the crime and stressing its full solidarity with the colleagues at the Egyptian Bar Association." A 600-word letter by the New York-based human rights group Middle East Watch to President Mubarak appears on pages 1 and 7. The letter calls on President Mubarak "to take immediate action to reveal the cause of death of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani and ensure that those responsible for the incident will receive the harshest punishment under the law." A 3,000-word report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im, Ashraf Khalil, Khalid Yunus, and Tariq 'Abd-al-Hamid on page 3 describes a rally held at the Bar Association in Cairo on 10 May to denounce Madani's death. Various prominent lawyers, including a member of the People's Assembly, Kamal Khalid, speak on the occasion, denouncing "police brutality" and "human rights abuses." Labor Party Secretary General 'Adil Husayn, in a wide-ranging 5,000-word commentary on page 5, finds an epic dimension in the lawyers' anger: "Let the upcoming strike by the lawyers be a roaring expression of our pent-up anger. Let all other sections of society come to the lawyers' support. Heads of professional associations and of parties should march with the lawyers in protest. "Yes, we have to answer a challenge with a challenge. They [the government] wanted to intimidate us, but we, God willing, will turn this into an epic that will lead us to restore human rights in this country." EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT OF DETENTION, TORTURE An unattributed 350-word report on page 3 cites a former detainee recounting his experience while in police custody. The former detainee, Midhat Khalil Jalal, was also "the last witness who saw martyr 'Abd-al-Harith Madani before his death." Jalal says that he was arrested on 26 April 1994 on charges of distributing leaflets "warning of sectarian strife" in the al-Haram neighborhood of Cairo. He adds: "Two days later, I was taken to the State Security Intelligence building on Jabir Ibn-Hayyan Street. There, I was blindfolded. An officer came into the room who asked me a lot of such questions as: What group do you belong to? What books do you read? What mosques do you go to? When he did not like my answers he gave me a good beating, shouting insults I had never heard before. He also said that detention would do me good." Jalal then says that he was taken to an overcrowded cell, where on the night of 26 April [contradiction with the dates mentioned above is as published] he met lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. He says that Madani "stayed with us in the cell for one hour. We asked him why he was arrested and he said: I do not know. He was self-composed. An hour later he was taken away. We did not see him any more. Later I heard news of his death on radio London [the BBC]." Describing torture in the "terror cell," Jalal says: "Every time the cell's door opened, we would die of fear, particularly at 1200 and 2300, the times of the `torture shifts' when some of us would be led away after being blindfolded to a room on top of the cell. The detainee would be suspended at the door and a bout of terrible torture would begin, including electric shock and whipping. When the victim fell silent we would know that he had fainted. He would return in a terrible state, not even able to drink water. "I helped one of the detainees drink water because his hand `was too stiff' from frequent `hanging' at the door. The bodies of the victims were full of bruises and cuts. I was released on Friday, 29 April, but before that one of the officers told me that if I was ever seen again in the mosque to which I go, I would be thrown into jail for life." ISLAMIC WRITER BANNED FROM AL-AHRAM As part of his lengthy and versatile page-5 commentary, 'Adil Husayn denounces the banning of Islamic writer Fahmi Huwaydi from the semi-official newspaper AL-AHRAM. He writes: "Who decided to ban the distinguished writer Fahmi Huwaydi from writing in AL-AHRAM? Fahmi Huwaydi is an internationally acclaimed writer and to prevent him from writing is to deal a savage blow to the country's modest scope of free expression. "The ban was preceded and accompanied by a campaign in pro- government newspapers attacking everything Huwaydi writes. The campaign targeted not only Huwaydi but anyone writing about Islam without exception. The campaign did not spare al-Azhar ulema and the worst insults were leveled at the Awqaf minister himself." Having thoroughly denounced what he sees as a government-blessed press campaign against Islamists, Husayn sees the campaign from an international perspective: "Some may imagine that questioning and attacking Islam is a form of free expression. But what we are faced with today is much more serious than a view expressed in a number of articles or books. We are facing a premeditated and unabashed onslaught by the forces of international arrogance, including Zionism, against the Muslim people. What is being published in Egypt is a mere translation of what is being written abroad. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent to finance such writings. We are not facing just a number of deviant individuals but a diabolical foreign scheme that some of our writers, knowingly or unknowingly, are colluding with." SUDANESE MINISTER INTERVIEWED A 2,500-word report on an interview with 'Ali 'Uthman Taha, Sudanese Minister of Social Planning, by Qutb al-'Arabi in Khartoum appears on page 8. The date of the interview is not given. Early in his report, al-'Arabi informs us that the Social Planning Ministry is "a ministry created to carry out the task of social changes based on an Islamic foundation." The Sudanese minister is cited as saying that the "stability of the domestic regime is no longer in question," that "opposition at home and abroad is weakening," and that "military resistance" is waning. The minister argues that the Islamic regime is gaining popularity and elaborates on several steps that the government is pondering to fortify the Islamic character of the state. "As for popular response to the Islamic propositions of the Salvation Government, Minister Taha said: The popular movement response to Islamic slogans outstripped the actual political reach. The political regime is still taking gradual steps but various sectors of society, including the general public, social organizations, tribes, intellectuals, and popular figures, are all joining the Islamic trend with a zest hard to accommodate within the framework of the national conference or popular committees. The response is massive, the prospect promising, and the urge strong." As examples of government efforts to encourage piety, the minister mentions that the cabinet is examining proposals to start the working day with the dawn prayer and to train professionals, such as doctors and engineers, to spread the word of Islam within their professions. A MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD VERSION OF PLURALISM A 2,000-word essay entitled "Muslim Brotherhood: A Brief Word on Consultation [shura] in Islam" and signed "the Muslim Brothers" appears on page 13. In a language that is part theology and part modern political jargon, the essay provides the group's view of government. It fails to point out whether this view is a recapitulation or a revision of the group's position and does not clarify whether it is part of any political initiative. The essay opens with a Koranic verse often cited to indicate the democratic nature of Islam: "Those who hearken to their Lord, and establish regular prayer; who conduct their affairs by mutual consultation; who spend out of what we bestow on them for sustenance." This verse, the essay tells us, means that "the people are the source of powers." The essay then briefs us on the lives of the early Caliphs, who, it argues, came to power through "selection by the general Muslim public." Since then, the Muslim people have had many rulers, some good and many bad, but "never has the Islamic shari'ah been abandoned, neither as a faith, nor a reference nor a constitution." Islamic rule, good or bad, only ended with the crusades: "Never has a ruler or an Islamic people adopted a reference other than shari'ah until the Islamic people were visited by the imperialism of the crusaders. The crusaders invaded them, ruled them, and imposed their laws and principles on them. A procession of agents, following on the footsteps of the crusaders, then came to power." From this, the essay concludes that Muslim rulers should be selected by the people from among the capable and devout: "The people have the right to select, with their good judgment, those whose piety, probity, knowledge, and efficiency are commensurate to the tasks of office." Also, the state needs to have a constitution based on the Koran. "We believe--although the Koran and the teachings of the prophet are the supreme constitution of Muslims and that whoever or whatever challenges them is wrong--that the nation should have a written constitution. The nation should formulate and agree upon that constitution, which should be inspired by the texts of the lofty shari'ah." The essay proposes that a parliament is needed to implement the constitution. The constitution, it says, should "contain enough principles and guarantees to protect public and private freedoms of all people--Muslims and non-Muslims alike--and make the government a consultation affair [shura] based on the power of the people. The constitution should define the rulers' responsibility before the people. It should state a way of questioning and correcting the rulers peaceably and successfully if they go wrong and change them if needs be. This requires the presence of a representative council with effective legislative and control powers, a council embodying the true will of the people as expressed through fair and free elections. The resolutions of such a council should be binding." Having expounded its view on the constitution and the parliament, the Brotherhood's essay proposes limited-term presidency: "We are also of the opinion that--considering that the president of the state is just an elected official--the presidency must be for a limited term and must not be renewed except for a limited period to avoid despotism." After giving a mix of theological and common-sense arguments, the essay recommends a pluralism that resides within the confines of shari'ah: "We, therefore, believe in the plurality of parties in Islamic society and that the authority need not place restrictions on the formation and activity of political groups or parties. Every group should be left free to advocate its views and expose its method... [ellipsis as published] So long as Islamic shari'ah is the ultimate constitution and the law is applied by an independent and protected judiciary, away from the influence of any authority or side, and so long as the judiciary is intellectually, scientifically, and theologically capable, this should be sufficient to guarantee the probity of society and its commitment to the right path." The essay concludes: "We also see that the acceptance of the multi-party system in the Islamic society, in the way that we just stated, involves the acceptance of the fact that power may change hands among political groups and parties through periodic elections. May God be blessed first and foremost. God's prayers be upon Prophet Muhammad and his scions and disciples."
