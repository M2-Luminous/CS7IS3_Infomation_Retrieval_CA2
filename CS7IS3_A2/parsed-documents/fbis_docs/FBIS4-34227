We are here today, on this generous Colombian soil, to continue to strengthen our relations, to progress in our commitments, and to project our presence toward Ibero-America, and through it to the rest of the world. We have a large task before us. We share the challenge of achieving greater economic growth and more justice for our people in a more competitive world. It has been said, and with reason, there are no sole solutions. This is why the diversity that characterizes us, due to the cultural background we share, demands joint efforts in areas that are indispensable to expand the domestic progress of each of our nations. This is where we find, amid other shared concerns, trade and investment, the two topics suggested for this meeting. This fourth summit offers us the opportunity to seek agreements regarding these issues. I am convinced we must continue to promote our current regional agreements and draft new treaties that will better coordinate economic policies and expand the margins of exchange, investment, and the creation of jobs throughout Ibero-America. Many of these agreements encourage trade liberation and allow a more efficient participation of our countries in international markets. This is why we view with optimism the progress made within Latin America to form subregional trade zones. Likewise, bilateral commercial agreements on the continent and in the Iberian countries are important. These agreements allow the whole region to grow closer. Far from being centrifugal forces, these bilateral and multilateral agreements can become the foundation for a new concept of regional integration. Mexico has promoted commercial agreements to the north and south of the continent, in Europe, and the Pacific Rim. This is why we welcome the talks among our peoples, as we are doing today, to enrich ourselves with all the diversity that makes us different and to take advantage of all that we share. The most encouraging thing today is the shared certainty that free and just exchange of capitals, assets, and services is helpful for us all. The signing of the agreement that ended the GATT Uruguay Round on 15 April opens new doors in international economic relations, because it better defines the legal framework that regulates international trade, and today, for the first time, includes the agricultural sector in commercial negotiations. We must make more progress in certain aspects of multilateral trade, however. It is important that we give greater recognition to the efforts being made toward unilateral opening and change. It is necessary for us to expand the agreement to include services and labor and environmental issues. It is essential to progress by making larger adjustments in monetary policies, technological exchange, and shared production in order to broaden trade openings and investments. Ibero-America must intensify its influence at multilateral forums, especially at the new World Trade Organization. Messrs. chiefs of state and government, I also want to congratulate and commend President Cesar Gaviria for his new job as OAS secretary general. We feel his job is ours. When we began holding Ibero-American summits in 1991, we stated their original purpose was to become a regional and political forum by acknowledging common historical roots and making future tangible proposals. As we have rightfully insisted, the Ibero-American community's pivotal point lies in the convergence of trade and social, cultural, and educational commitments. Our nations' priority is to guarantee the welfare of the less fortunate. We cannot progress if we have inefficient and isolated economies, but we cannot move forward if we have global yet socially irresponsible economies. We must insist that economic recovery go hand in hand with a deliberate social reform and a pluralistic democratic progress. It is necessary to strike a balance to ensure that economic growth, social welfare, democratic progress, and an efficient entry into the world economy will come about together. This has been one of Mexico's deliberate objectives: to embark simultaneously on an economic reform to guarantee a great social reform and a pluralistic progress, as well as to diversify our relations to promote internal transformation efforts. Other Ibero-American nations have progressed with their own projects that meet their peoples' needs. Their efforts strengthen our common goals. Each effort at integration among our nations should not become a pretext to avert the flow of trade or create nontrading blocs. We can reach GATT-compatible agreements that will become the engines of economic activities, investments, job creation, and income distribution, which is what matters the most. With this in mind, we will augment our voice in the region, thereby linking Ibero-America together, crossing seas, sharing our concerns and reaffirming our world presence. The possibility of reinforcing our world efforts lies in our resolve to work together. This is why, taking up the liberator's ideal, we can certainly say what he did: "I take this hope as a revelation." Thank you very much.
