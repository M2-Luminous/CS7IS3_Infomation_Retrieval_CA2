Speaking in Bisho on Friday [9 April], joint administrator the Rev Bongani Finca said the search was still on for 103 firearms issued to youths in the force. "It's these boys who were taken from the villages, trained for two weeks to shoot and kill, and given weapons and deployed in the villages." The administration did not know who commanded them, but it was aware that they had been issued with state ammunition. Mr Finca appealed to community structures to help the administration reclaim and account for all the missing weapons. The reclamation had to be accompanied by a call on the community to ensure there were no attacks or reprisals on headmen or political parties. It is understood that one of the aims of the formation of the auxiliary force was to protect headmen who supported the Gqozo government. Mr Finca said all political parties had to be given a chance to campaign for the elections and hold meetings.
