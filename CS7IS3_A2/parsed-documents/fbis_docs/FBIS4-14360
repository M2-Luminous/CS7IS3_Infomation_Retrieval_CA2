FBIS4-14360 "drnes083_o_94002" FBIS-NES-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 SYRIA Expectations Surrounding Christopher Visit Viewed Expectations Surrounding Christopher Visit Viewed JN2804151094 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 28 Apr 94 JN2804151094 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] Under the headline "The Results of the Test Will Not Change," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: Israel's rulers always precede U.S. envoys' visits to the region with intensified media campaigns designed to throw dust in the eyes of the international community, creating the deceptive impression that Israel is being flexible and that it is willing to pay the price of peace. AL-BA'TH adds: In light of Warren Christopher's current visit to the region, Israel sparked and guided a media campaign throughout the world to cast the rulers of Israel in a favorable light, portraying them as taking peaceful regional initiatives. At the same time, this media campaign seeks to portray Syria as the party that fails to offer initiatives, or what the rulers of Israel call concessions for peace. The paper explains that mere talk about Israel's willingness to abandon the settlements within an unspecifified period, in accordance with a list of Israeli demands and conditions, in no way changes the problem on the Syrian-Israeli track of the peace process. The paper says the obstacle to progress in the peace talks is Israel's refusal to announce its acceptance of the resolutions of international legitimacy by withdrawing from all occupied Syrian Arab territories. The peace talks will not progress without full withdrawal. The paper says Syria, as President Hafiz al-Asad has said, accepted the bases of the peace process. It is willing to offer full peace in return for full withdrawal. Syria is not avoiding a just and comprehensive peace. It has always sought this peace and is sincerely cooperating with the United States for its sake. AL-BA'TH concludes: There can be no peace without the return of all the territories, not just part of them. The territories cannot be divided, diminished, or replaced. The exercise of any kind of pressure, intimidation, deception, and threats by any party is a method that has been tried and tested more than once. The results have never changed. Under the headline "The Fact," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: Perhaps the most outstanding fact all observers realize is that the peace process needs new momentum. A propelling force has been lost due to Israel's continued intransigence, procrastination, and time wasting, all designed to entrench facts on the ground, like the partial agreements it concluded with the Palestinian side in Oslo and Cairo. AL-THAWRAH adds: New momentum requires an effective U.S. role in accordance with United States' commitments as an honest partner in the peace process, which was originally based on a U.S. initiative founded on the UN Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. AL-THAWRAH discusses Israeli intransigence and its role in blocking progress in the peace process. The paper says the policy of deception and prevarication resulting from Israel's violation on the Palestinian track -- a track that has become the prisoner of a separate and partial agreement -- is the outcome of secret hallway negotiations outside the peace process. Because of this policy, the peace process is fraught with dangers. The paper says Israel wants only the formal activation of the peace process, via the formal U.S. role regrettably expressed by Warren Christopher before his arrival in the region. This was in noticeable contrast to the optimistic statements that used to precede each of his visits to the region. The paper continues: Today, there is no way to hide from the fact that it is a priority to translate the U.S. admission of Syria's central role into reality. The paper demands an effective U.S. role in order to implement the UN Security Council resolutions. The U.S. Administration has been committed to this role. It should manifest this in its behavior and on the diplomatic and political levels. This is what the peace process needs to avoid remaining the prisoner of Israeli intransigence. AL-THAWRAH concludes by asking: Does Christopher realize that the ball is still in the Israeli court? Is he bringing any indication of the effective U.S. role that will put the peace process back on track toward a just and comprehensive peace?
