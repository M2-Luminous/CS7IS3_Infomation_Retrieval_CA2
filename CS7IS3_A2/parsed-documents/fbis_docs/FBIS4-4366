FBIS4-4366 "dreas062_h_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 15 Feb 1994 Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Malaysia * Air Force Awaits Arrival of British Hawks * Air Force Awaits Arrival of British Hawks 94SE0084A Kuala Lumpur BY in Malay 15 Feb 94 p 1 94SE0084A Kuala Lumpur BY Malay CSO [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 14 Feb (BERNAMA)--Plans are now being made to fly 10 Hawk 100 planes to Malaysia at the end of this month, a Royal Malaysian Air Force (TUDM) officer said today. These are modern jet trainers that have been by bought by Malaysia. TUDM pilots will fly the planes from Britain to the TUDM air base at Butterworth. The officer said British Aerospace (BAe) will deliver nine more Hawk 100 planes in stages before the end of this year. The first ten of the two-seat planes were accepted by Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Datuk Abdul Ghani Abdul Aziz from Kevin Smith, director of BAe Military Aircraft Division, in a short ceremony at Wharton Aerodrome at Preston in Britain last month. The Hawk 100 planes were bought under a memorandum of understanding (MOU) worth 2.4 billion ringgit signed by Malaysia and Britain in 1988. The TUDM also ordered 18 Hawk 200 planes under the same contract. The TUDM will be the first air force in this region to use the British-made planes. Indonesia reportedly will buy planes of that type, too. Both the Hawk 100, a modern all-weather jet trainer, and the Hawk 200, a light fighter plane with one seat, use Mk 871 Rolls Royce Adour engines. The first Hawk 200 will be flown here in July. Deliveries of the plane will begin in May and will be completed in February 1995. The MOU also provided for training facilities for TUDM pilots and airport staff, including technicians, under a reciprocal program. As many as 69 TUDM technicians will attend 20 types of courses. Four selected TUDM pilots, who have completed a three-year training program, will be instructors in a new squadron to be formed at Butterworth Air Base. They are now at Wharton to accept the Hawk 100's. In December 1990, Malaysia reached an agreement under a similar MOU for a 400-million-ringgit reciprocal contract involving the transfer of technology to Malaysian defense-related industries such as the Malaysia Explosives Company, a producer of military equipment in this country, and Airod Sdn. Bhd. [limited corporation], a privatized facility for overhauling aircraft. The reciprocal program for the supply of domestic airborne military equipment and weapons (bombs and guided missiles), support equipment, and repair and overhaul facilities provides Malaysia with adequate support for Hawk planes. Meanwhile, preparations for creating support facilities at Butterworth Air Base have been moving smoothly since the arrival of replacement equipment for Hawks at Klang Port last July. BAe and suppliers of other Hawk components, such as Rolls Royce and Westinghouse (radar systems), will provide field service to the TUDM for 24 months after the planes are received.
