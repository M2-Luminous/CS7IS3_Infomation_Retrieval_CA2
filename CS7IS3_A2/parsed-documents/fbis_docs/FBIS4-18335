We will form a government." This was said by Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi at the end of the much-awaited meeting between Forza Italia and the Northern League. He is optimistic about how long it will take, but said that they had not yet discussed "the premiership or names of ministers." However, an agreement has been reached to reduce the number of ministries and undersecretaries. The Northern League's Francesco Speroni pointed out that "the debate about the Constitution is continuing. We will meet again after Easter. National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini can relax -- we will speak to him too." Umberto Bossi's candidate for the premiership, Roberto Maroni, reiterated that "federalism remains the most important point," while the Northern League's Gianfranco Fini played down Bossi's absence from the meeting.
