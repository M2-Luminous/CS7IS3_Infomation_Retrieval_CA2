The murder of the British humanitarian worker, Paul Goodall, and the wounding of two of his colleagues, is a crime without precedent for which the West quickly accused members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Here is the result of a quick and successful investigation by the Ministry of Interior of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Following the terrorist attack on the UNHCR [UN High Commission for Refugees] workers in Perin Han near Zenica on 27 January this year, members of the Ministry of the Interior and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, as well as the relevant judiciary bodies from Zenica and Sarajevo, took urgent and energetic operational and other steps to clarify this terrorist act and find the culprits. Three persons, under well-founded suspicion of taking part in the attack, were arrested in Zenica. Taking as the starting point the established facts and the fact that the group that carried out this crime consisted of several people, steps were taken to find all the culprits. Reliable information was obtained to the effect that three kidnappers had set off toward Butmir in the stolen vehicle, in order to--as the Ministry of Interior of Bosnia-Herzegovina assesses--reach the airport and flee. The plan was to intercept the group on Mount Igman in order to arrest its members. However, the car failed to stop despite repeated warnings by the Army. In a contrary action, automatic weapons fire was immediately opened from the car in the direction of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army members and had to be returned. All three terrorists and one civilian, who was held hostage, were killed in the ensuing shoot-out, while one military policeman was seriously wounded. A passport issued in Great Britain and a passport that was an obvious forgery from Pakistan with an entry and transit visa of the Republic of Croatia was found on those killed. For the aforementioned reasons, it cannot yet be said for certain what kind of people this involved; nor can their exact identify be verified.
