This is untrue. I had nothing to do with that report. Second: It seems that the report did not originate from Damascus in the first place. The chief of staff in Syria holds the rank of a "lieutenant general" and not a "major general," as mentioned in the report. This makes one conclude that the author of the report is very far from understanding Syrian affairs. Third: Lieutenant General Hikmat al-Shihabi is widely respected among all Syrian and non-Syrian circles. I find it inappropriate to mention his name just like that whenever one wants to talk about the a government formation. Fourth: There is nothing in Syrian political circles to suggest any potential reshuffle in the current Syrian Government, which is headed by Engineer Mahmud al-Zu'bi, especially since it recorded several achievements which cannot be mentioned here. Sixth [as published]: The concerned circles in Damascus have not commented on this report. Nor have they reacted to similar reports published in the past. I will be grateful if you publish this clarification. With my best regards. [Signed] 'Ali Jamalu, AL-DUSTUR correspondent in Damascus
