An ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from informed sources in the oblast administration that the units of the Collective Peace-keeping Forces (CPF) deployed in Tajikistan have remained on the far side of the pass. The protection of the convoy and the safety of the drivers was undertaken by units of the mountain rifle battalion of the republic's Ministry of Defense which is manned by young people from the Pamirs and also by self-defense units of Gorno-Badakhshan oblast. This agreement was reached during talks between representatives of the CPF command, local authorities of Gorno-Badakhshan oblast, representatives of the coalition council of democratic forces, and some field commanders of self-defense units. In the opinion of Ulfat-khanum, one of the representatives of the coalition council of the autonomous region, the initial decision by the CPF command to accompany the humanitarian cargo across the territory of the oblast right to Khorog aroused serious concern among the public of the Pamirs. They thought there might be provocations from individual forces interested in destabilizing the situation in the Pamirs. Ulfat-khanum stressed that this concern had been conveyed to the CPF command and also to the representative of the UN mission in the oblast centre of Khorog and, as a result, a sensible compromise had been reached. It is expected that the convoy of trucks carrying foodstuffs will arrive in Khorog by this evening. The aid is very timely aince the population of Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous oblast is on the verge of starvation. Food reserves are virtually exhausted. The only bakery in the administrative center has been out of action for several days because there is no flour.
