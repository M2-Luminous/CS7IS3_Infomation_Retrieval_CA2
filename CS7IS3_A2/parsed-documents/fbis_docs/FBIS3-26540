Premier Li Peng, other leading comrades of the State Council, cadres and staff workers of State Council organs, and some veteran comrades happily got together to exchange greetings and usher in the new spring. On behalf of leading State Council comrades, Premier Li Peng extended his festive greetings to all cadres and staff workers of the State Council General Office, organs directly under the State Council, and relevant departments, as well as their dependents. Li Peng expressed his wholehearted thanks for the outstanding jobs they have done in the past year. In his speech, Li Peng said: The year 1993 which has just gone by was a year of unusual achievements, and 1994 will be a year with even more magnificent success. The principles set by the party Central Committee -- "seize the opportunity to deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, expedite development, and maintain stability" -- are extremely significant for China's development and progress. He said: Ever since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, China has achieved world-renowned successes in its reform and opening up endeavors, our economy has been developing rapidly, our reform policies have had the support of the people, and the international situation has always been favorable to us. Confronted with such a gratifying situation, we will continue to deepen reform and open up wider to the outside world. The series of major measures for reform to be launched this year are meant for further pushing our country toward building a socialist market economic system so that even greater successes will be achieved in our national economic development. Li Peng said: Development has always been our central task and the basic objective of all our reform projects. We must work hard to improve the people's living standards and help the whole nation to become affluent as quickly as possible. However, social stability is an indispensable prerequisite and condition for reform and development. If we fail to maintain social stability, we will be unable to launch the measures for reform, and our causes will not be able to proceed successfully. Under the current situation, therefore, we must correctly handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability so that China's economic development can proceed in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. Li Peng noted: We, the Chinese nation, are now at a period of rapid development. Cadres of state organs should feel honored and proud of being able to directly take part in making and enforcing decisions about reform, opening up, and modernization. Li Peng urged all cadres and staff members of the State Council to continue to work hard to accomplish all assignments of the party and the people, achieve new successes, and make even greater contributions during the year. Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Chi Haotian, Song Jian, Li Guixian, Chen Junsheng, Peng Peiyun, Chen Muhua, Gu Mu, and other comrades were present at the gathering, which was chaired by Luo Gan, state councillor and secretary general of the State Council. During the gathering, Chinese Coalminers Song and Dance Ensemble artists staged colorful entertainment programs.
