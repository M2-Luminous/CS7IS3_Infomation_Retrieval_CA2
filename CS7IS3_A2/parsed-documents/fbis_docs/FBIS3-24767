He was presenting the ANC's three-pillar election manifesto at Nasrec, south-west of Johannesburg, which promises good form of government, a better quality of life for South Africans and end to crime and violence. The document is moderate in tone and bases the promises it makes on a growing economy. Mr Mandela conceded that implementation and financing of the programme would not be easy. "Our objective is to use resources more efficiently and not to increase the tax burden. Large sums of money already go to education, health and other areas. But the results are poor," Mr Mandela said. The ANC would encourage an open and democratic society and would respect a bill of rights. Government corruption and dishonesty would not be tolerated. Turning to the second pillar of the manifesto, Mr Mandela warned that South Africa's economy would no longer be run for the benefit of the white minority. The manifesto prioritises job creation and better incomes in a growing economy, marked by increased foreign investment, a public works programmes providing 2.5-million jobs over the next 10 years and more roads, schools, clininc and houses. Small business would be encouraged and rural poverty eliminated through development programmes. Woman and those earning under R[Rand]4,000 a month are promised a better tax deal. The manifesto says the security forces will be refomed to reflect the national gender and character of South Africa. "Criminal behaviour in these forces will not be tolerated. Those serving today will be encouraged to continue in line with the new culture," the manifesto said. It promises that with the cooperation of commmunities, an ANC-government will ensure criminals are dealt with to the full extent of the law. "The ANC recognises the depth of our country's crisis. We are convinced that political will, an environment of peace and stability and a technically sound programme are a sure foundation for reconstruction and development. "The ANC pledges to spare no effort to reach these ideals. We are ready to tackle the problems."
