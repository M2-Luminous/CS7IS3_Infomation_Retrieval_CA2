The statement emphasized the eagerness of the cosponsors of the Middle East peace conference to realize just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the region on the basis of international legitimacy resolutions led by Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of land for peace. The importance of the statement lies in the fact that it was made on the eve of the summit between U.S. President Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, which will be held in Geneva tomorrow. Political circles attach much importance to this meeting in paving the way for serious and substantial progress in the faltering peace process. Also, the meeting comes in the wake of the ongoing problems facing the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on implementation of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. The statement's emphasis on the principle of just and comprehensive peace based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 clarifies the course of the peace process on all its tracks. These tracks are facing Israeli rejection and maneuvers regarding a comprehensive solution to the Middle East issue. Israel evades commitment to Resolutions 242 and 338, which call for its full withdrawal from all occupied territories, including Jerusalem, and recognition of the Palestinian people's legitimate right to self-determination on their soil. Israel's attempts to evade its commitment to this principle, and its positions that conflict with the Declaration of Principles it signed with the PLO which calls for full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, and its attempt to deprive the self-rule areas and their crossing points of any vestiges of Palestinian sovereignty are the strongest evidence of Israel's intentions and rejection of a comprehensive solution and the international and legal terms of reference of such a solution, as well as its contempt for the cosponsors of the peace conference and the peace process as a whole. If we take into consideration Israel's despicable rejection of even declaring commitment to withdraw fully from the occupied Syrian Golan, its placing of impossible conditions on the negotiations on the Syrian track, and its insistence that Damascus should define its concept of peace, we will conclude that Rabin's government is following a policy of maneuvering and deception regarding the achievement of serious progress on the Syrian-Israeli track. Israel is also placing similar conditions on Lebanon to obstruct implementation of Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for immediate withdrawal from occupied southern Lebanon. Therefore, the U.S.-Russian statement is a positive prelude to the Clinton-al-Asad meeting in Geneva tomorrow, which will establish the bases for activating an effective and influential U.S. role in forcing Israel to heed the will of the international community, UN resolutions, and the principles on the basis of which the Madrid peace conference was held, and to which the cosponsors were committed, and which they emphasized in their latest statement. The Arabs are not prepared to relinquish their land and rights after they have offered all they can to render the peace process successful. Washington and Moscow should not be satisfied with mere statements, and should play their role as cosponsors of this process, otherwise, the statement will be no more than worthless ink on paper.
