The Islamic Front, JUI [Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam], Nawabzada Nasrulla Khan, Balakh Sheikh Mazari, and some FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas] members did not take part in this walkout. The federal law minister had called this action of the prime opposition party to be deplorable. At the same time, to keep the parliamentary process in a healthy environment, he has expressed his determination to keep the opposition happy. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has also stressed to her parliamentary group to try to cooperate with the opposition at all times and follow the assembly rules strictly. At the same time, she also reminded the opposition to show cooperation in the parliamentary process. In our opinion, the assemblies exist just to express difference in opinion. However, every democratic country has special rules and regulations to follow in the assemblies, and every member has equal responsibility to follow these procedures. The problem with the major opposition party at present is that it considers the success of the elected government on Kashmir and nuclear policy issues to be its own defeat. Thus, it wants to blame the government on these two issues without any reason. It is insisting on opening a debate on the nuclear policy in the National Assembly for this purpose. The prime minister, the foreign minister, and the law minister insist that nuclear policy is the nation's most sensitive issue, and, while full briefing on it can be given to the assembly members, no open debate can be allowed. The prime minister has also reminded them that the present government has not formed any new nuclear policy; it is following the same policy as was in force before. It is clear that this is a fundamental issue of national importance, and the whole nation has no difference on it. Therefore, no political party should make this an issue for debate. Instead, as the prime minister has said, the opposition should fully support her government's efforts of removing the Pressler Amendment. The foreign minister has reminded us in this context that India had blasted a nuclear bomb in 1974, and there was a lot of clamor in the world about it. India still has not discussed its nuclear program in the parliament. She also reminded them of the Koranic advice to "protect your secrets." In our opinion, the opposition should show some responsibility at least on such a sensitive issue and for the sake of our nation.
