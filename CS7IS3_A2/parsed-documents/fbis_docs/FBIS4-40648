Having learned of the opportunity for acquiring housing, refugees are rushing here from the CIS trouble spots. They come knowing that the local inhabitants are subject to enforced or voluntary removal. They are fleeing poverty and dobule-dyed nationalism and, they say, are choosing the lesser of two evils. In all of last year alone, about 2,300 people including over 700 children arrived in radioactive Gomel Oblast. This year the oblast took in a further 300 refugees.
