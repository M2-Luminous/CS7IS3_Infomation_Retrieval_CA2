To raise the quality of rural laborers, Guangdong, a rising area in South China, has exerted big efforts to popularize nine-year compulsory education and promote anti-illiteracy programs among adults. By the end of 1993, nine-year compulsory education was implemented in the province's 48 counties and prefectures. In the 17 pilot counties and cities for rural education reform, the enrollment rate of middle school students reached 95 percent in 1992. In rural education, priority is given to technical training in rural primary and middle schools so that the students can put their knowledge immediately into use. Some 134 vocational schools have been set up in the 17 pilot counties and cities, which have helped trained 60 percent of the rural enterprises' employees. Rural education has always stressed the combination of education, production and scientific research. The ten vocational schools of Shunde Counties have opened 18 courses in line with the needs in the development of rural enterprises and agricultural modernization. In the past ten years, the schools have trained more than 8,000 students who have become an important force in agricultural production and rural industry.
