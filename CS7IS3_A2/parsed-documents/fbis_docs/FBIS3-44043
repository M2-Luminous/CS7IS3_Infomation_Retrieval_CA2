Such behavior is in clear violation of the Law on the Press. Radio Mozambique reporter Emilio Manhique visited Cabo Delgado Province's Montepuez District last week and he was not allowed to visit government troop confinement areas. [Begin Manhique recording] It is true that I went to Montepuez last week to tour northern region troop assembly points. Though I was carrying the necessary identification, including UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, credentials, I was not allowed to visit the troop confinement center. I was not even allowed to talk with the soldiers. Center Commander Major (Babe) showed me an order issued by radio whereby Lt. Col. Daniel Balasso Anastacio, military commander for Cabo Delgado Province, gave instructions that no journalist should be allowed to interview, film, or visit the premises where the government troops are confined. I was surprised, but I tried to convince Maj. (Babe) that such an order was at least nonsensical. Maj. (Babe) categorically replied that orders are orders and that he was there to carry them out. Nevertheless, he agreed to establish radio contact with the Cabo Delgado Provincial Command to report my presence. The Provincial Command did not budge. Then, I proceeded to contact the Unomoz forces stationed at the center and it was enough for me to identify myself to get all the information I needed. [passage omitted] [end recording]
