Some blame it on former communists who have come to power: "Their attempts to build communism didn't work, now they've jumped on the market economy bandwagon, but they've come up empty there also." Others blame the national movements, the leaders of all those political parties: "These sloganeers and populists don't know anything and never will." Still others blame everything on the government: "If so-and-so had instituted reforms and carried out privatization soon enough we wouldn't be in this fix today." I was interested in this latter and decided to meet with the republic's State Property Minister Avtandil Silagadze. Our conversation started with an unconventional question. [Khutsishvili] Batono Avtandil, is the bickering with your opponents getting you down? [Silagadze] I have to admit it sometimes does. Not because we have many shortcomings in our work and can't give an answer (I never try to conceal anything) but rather because our opponents mostly argue with me from populist sentiments and incompetence--they are so incompetent that sometimes it's ridiculous. For example, consider the sensational "incident" in which one fair-sized store on Rustaveli Avenue was sold for 17 dollars. [Khutsishvili] What really happened? [Silagadze] What happened was that last year the Tbilisi Main Administration of State Property privatized three establishments on Rustaveli Avenue in compliance with all laws and procedures. One of them was the Mukhura Wine Store (78 square meters) which a labor collective bought for one billion coupons (worth 17,429 dollars at the rate then). Another was Footwear Reception Outlet No 1 (six square meters), which was bought for 688 dollars at the current rate then, on a competitive basis, by the Mothers' and Children's Association. The third establishment was Footwear Reception Outlet No 11 (16 square meters) which was bought for 6,874 dollars by a labor collective. The collective couldn't pay that amount by the deadline and the results of the auction were annulled. Incidentally, it wasn't the space of these establishments that was privatized but rather the leasing rights and the assets in the stores, and for a period of 10 years. [Khutsishvili] I'm glad the "17-dollar deal" turned out to be just a rumor, but there have been cases where certain "influential" persons have acquired the people's property for peanuts. Last year in Rustavi, for example, 1.2 million coupons was enough to buy the Construction Mechanization Administration and its machinery and equipment. Now that amount wouldn't buy you one used tire, let alone the machinery. [Silagadze] A number of things need to be clarified regarding that case. First of all, that establishment was not sold on the basis of our privatization law but in accordance with former all-union laws. Therefore, even if our country hadn't had the law on privatization of state enterprises, that establishment would still have been privatized. Second, the leasing agreement stipulated from the beginning the establishment's purchase price of 1.2 million rubles (compare how many tires could have been bought at that price then), which was set by the book value of fixed assets at that time. Third, the payment of the amount started with rubles and ended before 3 August 1993--the period in which the ratio of the ruble to the coupon was 1:1. Let me add that the Ministry has not yet made a final decision as to the privatization of that establishment. In general we have come up against big difficulties in appraising establishments to be privatized. At the present rate of hyperinflation, it would probably be better to assess establishments first on the basis of some hard currency, for example U.S. dollars, and then sell them for coupons at the appropriate rate of exchange. [Khutsishvili] But what about so-called "covert privatization"? People have the notion that all the industrial enterprises, construction establishments, and retail trade and service outlets in the republic are privately owned. If that is so, why do you need a government-approved list of establishments to be privatized? [Silagadze] Unfortunately, that notion is not groundless. There are, in fact, persons who have taken possession of some establishment or other and acquired state property unlawfully. That, however, is not privatization; it is a crime, and anyone who commits it must be punished to the full extent of the law. We have studied the problem and turned the materials over to the Procuracy to deal with. We are going to step up our efforts along these lines. [Khutsishvili] People say all the tea factories and wineries have been sold off. [Silagadze] We in the Ministry have only registered the privatization of the Khoni Tea Factory, which was sold on a competitive basis. If any self-styled owners turn up for the others, they will answer to the law. I can say the same thing about the wineries, except for three or four which were leased in previous years with the right of purchase. [Khutsishvili] What about the hotels of Tbilisi? [Silagadze] The same as with the tea factories. Only one of them--the Achara [Ajaria] Hotel--was founded as a joint stock company, and if other people imitate that there's nothing wrong with it. In fact, we welcome it. In all the civilized countries, hotels are privately owned. [Khutsishvili] Batono Avtandil, let me turn once again to the government-approved list of establishments to be privatized. According to it, 4,950 establishments were supposed to be privatized last year, but the actual number did not exceed 902 (18.1 percent). What happened? [Silagadze] A lot of factors: the prolonged war in Abkhazia, internal disarray, the terrible crime situation, the lack of a legislative base, and, of course, our inexperience. All of these had an impact on privatization, which basically only affected retail and consumer outlets. In the first stage, of course, that was the orientation. [Khutsishvili] You have mentioned objective obstacles to privatization. Have any subjective factors been at work as well? [Silagadze] Of course there have. One major factor is a mistrust of privatization (because it's such a new thing). This may be perfectly natural: establishments are being removed from higher-level jurisdiction and beginning a new, independent life, and this certainly has to influence the activities of state structures, their functions and rights and duties. [Khutsishvili] At first many people thought that privatization in Georgia ought to take place lightning-fast, by the "shock therapy" method. But it didn't work. Why? [Silagadze] It didn't work out because it did not fit our conditions. "Shock therapy" couldn't have worked for us because the privatization law did not call for selling property directly to labor collectives and other legal and physical persons. That's why the State Privatization Program, which encompassed the second half of 1992 and the first half of 1993, was not carried out. The timeframe has been extended to the end of 1994. [Khutsishvili] The timeframe could be extended indefinitely. Do you really think that privatization ought not to be speeded up? [Silagadze] No, I'm in favor of speeding it up, but it has to be done rationally, taking account of the republic's specifics. It is especially essential to do this because all foreign investors who want to invest capital with us prefer to work with privatized rather than with state enterprises. And there's another factor: the assets of state establishments are being looted and plundered savagely these days. Once they are privately owned, this process will stop. [Khutsishvili] And despite the fact that enterprises are being looted, one might say that the privatization of the republic's industry has hardly started at all. Everybody is aware, in fact, that if private entrepreneurs don't show up and get interested, we cannot create the market economy that we are pinning our hopes on. [Silagadze] I agree. If we want our economy to grow strong, privatization really will have to be speeded up in industry, although it is also a fact that most of the joint stock companies these days (19 out of 35 in the republic) were established in the Ministry of Industry (versus five in the Agriculture and Food Industry Ministry, three in the Ministry of Architecture and Construction, one in the Ministry of Trade and Material Resources, two in the Department of Transportation, and so forth). This is the ministry that has the best privatization program. If it is implemented, our industry will soon advance to the front. [Khutsishvili] Exactly how many joint stock companies will be established in the Ministry of Industry system? [Silagadze] Around two hundred. [Khutsishvili] Does that mean you think it is possible to plan the number in advance? [Silagadze] I believe it is justified to the extent that it enables the state to carry out its policy in the privatization sphere. That is why it has adopted the criterion of the book value of the enterprises' fixed assets as of 1 January 1993. If that value exceeds 30 million rubles, the enterprise will have to be made into a joint stock company. This only applies to enterprises whose privatization is permitted by the state privatization program. [Khutsishvili] But why have we taken this figure as the unit of measurement? [Silagadze] Because many people have shunned conversion to joint stock companies. If it hadn't been established, a small segment of the public would have very easily taken possession of all the assets, while the majority would remain empty-handed. [Khutsishvili] That's understandable, but what are we to do with enterprises that are valued at less than that? [Silagadze] They are to be privatized basically by auction and on a competitive basis. But even in the case of a competitive sale, the state can play something of a regulating role on the establishment. How? The establishment is obliged to fill state orders, maintain its profile, its workplaces and so on. [Khutsishvili] It's good when the state plays a regulating role in privatization processes. But it also has its negative side. Because the state retains 51 percent of the stock package, many enterprises are refraining from privatization. [Silagadze] This motive does exist, but let's also keep in mind that it enables the state to manage the country's economy. In this case, the state retains 51 percent of the stock package, one portion of which is turned over to the labor collective free of charge, a minimum of 35 percent is sold for privatization cards, and the rest is sold for money (including to foreign investors). As I have said, this is essential to manage the process, but I don't think the state needs to retain a stock package in so many enterprises (there are about 400 such enterprises on the list). The list ought to be shortened considerably. This kind of privatization should take place basically in enterprises in which strategic goods are produced. Let me add that if the state wants to maintain its position in an enterprise it can sell a package of stocks on a competitive basis, the terms of which will be binding on the owner, and we will have to have the future owner submit future business plans. I am certain that the best program will be submitted by the enterprise's workers and that they will win the competition. [Khutsishvili] Another question: we promised the public we would distribute vouchers to them back in January of last year. But then in September.... Where did the promised vouchers disappear to? [Silagadze] I'm sorry I can't give a positive answer yet. Almost everything is in readiness to print the vouchers (the design was made some while ago), but we haven't been able to come to financial terms with the company in France that is supposed to make the privatization cards for us. In other respects, the work is proceeding rapidly, lists of residents are being drawn up, and if the finance problem is settled we will have the vouchers in hand in two months. [Khutsishvili] If privatization is speeded up but we don't have the vouchers, what will be left to give for them? [Silagadze] That just won't happen. A minimum of 35 percent of the shares of all joint stock companies are to be sold for vouchers alone. And so, the public is not going to be hurt; the portion of assets allocated to vouchers will never be sold. As far as the face value of the voucher is concerned, that will be announced prior to distribution. [end of Q and A] This, then, is the minister's, and the Ministry's, position with regard to privatization, the problems which need to be solved promptly in order to implement reforms and revive the country's economy. But what can the Ministry alone do in this big effort if the government doesn't get busy; and the government (both the former and the present government)--let's be frank--hasn't accomplished much reform. Quite apart from real accomplishments, the government doesn't even have a specific program to bring the country out of the crisis. There is plenty of debate, plenty of discussion of these issues; but nothing is getting done. Reforms aside, February is over and the amounts of goods that were supposed to have been issued to the stores in January are not there yet. Our only consolation is bread, but because we are not complying with retail bread quota terms (it is not being delivered to the stores according to stipulated schedules and amounts), it is being sold without ration coupons, there are long lines again, and all the while there are daily food commission meetings being held in the Cabinet of Ministers, and the public has had it up to here with their promises.... No country on earth can eat promises!
