ACTION: Notice of Termination of Company-Specific Administrative Review of Countervailing Duty Order. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) is terminating the company-specific administrative review of the countervailing duty order on certain textile mill products from Peru, initiated on April 15, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Martina Tkadlec or Kelly Parkhill, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230, telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 29, 1994, Credisa Division Textil, S.A. (Credisa), a producer and exporter of the subject merchandise, requested a company-specific administrative review of the countervailing duty order on certain textile mill products from Peru for the period May 18, 1992, through December 31, 1993, pursuant to 19 CFR 355.22(a)(2). No other interested party requested a review. On April 15, 1994, the Department published a notice initiating the company-specific administrative review for that period (59 FR 18099). On September 28, 1994, Credisa withdrew its request for review. Section 355.22(a)(3) of the Department's regulations (19 CFR 355.22(a)(3)) stipulates that the Secretary may permit a party that requests a review to withdraw the request not later than 90 days after the date of publication of the notice of initiation of the requested review. This regulation also provides that the Secretary may extend the time limit for withdrawal of a request if it is reasonable to do so. Because no significant work has been done on this review, Credisa's request does not unduly burden the Department under the circumstances presented in this review, we are waiving the 90-day requirement in 19 CFR 355.22(a)(3). Accordingly, we are terminating this review. This notice is published in accordance with 19 CFR 355.22(a)(3). Dated: November 1, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.
