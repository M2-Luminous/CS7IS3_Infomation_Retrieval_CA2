"Economic integration is a Jordanian requirement, but the Kingdom will not enter into economic or political groupings before preparing solid foundations for them first," said a source close to the government and the Royal court. Agence France Press reported Thursday that Jordan, Syria and Lebanon had been discussing the formation of an economic cooperation council similar to the now defunct Arab Cooperation Council (ACC) which grouped Jordan, Egypt, Yemen and Iraq. The ACC, which reportedly antagonised some Gulf states, collapsed immediately after the eruption of the Gulf crisis in 1990. The agency quoted unidentified political sources in Jordan as saying the proposed alliance would aim at "countering the repercussions of the Palestinian-Israeli economic agreement" on the economies of the three countries. The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) signed an economic agreement with Israel in Paris in April and the deal was ill-received by Syria and Lebanon and invited the condemnation of some economic experts in Jordan. Jordan's past experiences with regional alliances rendered it cautious when discussing the formation of such groupings, the source said. The source said the formation of the council was floated by Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz who was briefed by Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Birri on discussions the latter held on the issue with Jordanian parliamentarians during his visit here last month. But the discussion with Mr. Birri did not go beyond the expression of some Jordanian parliamentarians of their belief in the viability of economic cooperation with Lebanon, sources said. Other informed sources said Syria had floated the issue with the Kingdom recently, but Jordan reiterated its position that solid groundwork had to be carried out before translating such ideas into reality. "How could you have economic integration with Syria which does not have an ambassador in Jordan yet and where Jordanian television transmission is jammed?" the source said. "Syria still has strong ties with allies who would not support such a project," said the source in reference to Gulf states which worked against the Arab Cooperation Council. "But since the intention is there, technical committees could start working to discuss practical steps for realising the grouping," said the source, pointing out that Jordan believes in joint Arab action not only on the economic arena but also on the security and political ones. The source said that economic integration with Syria and Lebanon would be governed by regional and international politics and Jordan is aware of the limit to which Arab-Arab relations could go. Jordan and Syria took large steps towards economic integration in the late 1970s but the Kingdom was then punished by neighbouring countries which stopped their aid to the Kingdom in anger, the source said. "Neither Jordan nor Syria believe in taking short cuts" in implementing projects of such magnitude, added the source. The joint Jordanian-Syrian Higher Committee will hold talks on economic cooperation in Amman on Monday. In addition to Syrian Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi, Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' will attend the meeting in what was seen as an indication of the political significance that the talks would have. Sources said it is possible that ways of dealing with the economic impact of the PLO-Israel deal on the two countries could be discussed during the meeting, but they will not amount to discussing the formation of an economic alliance.
