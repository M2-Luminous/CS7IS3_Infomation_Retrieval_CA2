How much? It will be decided by the parliament. The author of the "Strategy for Poland" does not conceal that the expectations of the "uniform" ministries should be realistic. The plans for the socioeconomic policy until 1997 envisions an increase in the expenditures primarily in education, culture, and health protection. This year it takes approximately 11.4 percent of the GDP. If the expenditures in that sphere continue to increase, the "short blanket" will not satisfy the needs of other ministries. Pressure on Expenditures The deputy prime minister is not an advocate of defining permanent indexes of the share of the expenditures in the various areas of the state's total expenditures. The Ministry of National Defense [MON], however, expects that its budget will amount to at least 3 percent of the GDP. Only such expenditures make it possible to modernize the Army, which is a condition for adjusting the Army's structures, equipment, and armament to the requirements of the Western states. The sum in question is more than 10 trillion zlotys. Similar expectations are held by the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW]. Not long ago Minister Andrzej Milcznowski revealed that he would like substantive expenditures to be the same as personal expenditures (currently they constitute 35 percent of the MSW budget). At the same time, at a government session devoted to public security, he demanded raising the wages of the functionaries of special services to the level found in MON. The government's stand is that the expenditures in MON and MSW will increase at a rate close to the increase in the GDP. It plans that the GDP will be 22.5 percent higher in 1997 than it is now. Therefore, the expenditure on MON and MSW should increase 5 percent faster than inflation. Will that really happen? It seems difficult to accomplish, if for only one reason: the "Strategy for Poland" also envisions the gradual limiting of the budget deficit to 2 percent of the GDP. Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko told POLSKA ZBROJNA that the balancing of public expenditures calls for discipline and "thrift spending of resources" that the ministries have. However, the ministers demand an increase in expenditures, which can be seen at every session of the government. [passage omitted]
