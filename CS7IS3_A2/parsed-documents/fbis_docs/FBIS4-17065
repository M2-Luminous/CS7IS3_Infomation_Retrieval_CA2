In a telephone conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent today, he said that "it is necessary to hold a congress of the Chechen people in the near future to work out the basic criteria for solving the problem of Russian-Chechen inter-relations." In the words of Yaragi Mamodayev, the government he leads has already begun preparing this forum. Consultations with the chairman of Chechnya's Constitutional Court, well-known public and religious figures, and representatives of various political bodies have been held. I would like it to be understood in Moscow, Yaragi Mamodayev said, that Dhozkhar Dudayev's unjustified postponement of the beginning of the Russian-Chechen talks does not reflect the position of the whole of Chechen society. A people's congress needs to be held to work out this position. Yaragi Mamodayev again pointed out that open appeals by the Russian side to forces opposing Dhozkhar Dudayev risked aggravating the political split in Chechnya and could become an obstacle in the negotiating process. Yaragi Mamodayev distances himself from the opposition, explaining that he was appointed head of government by the legal Chechen Parliament in April of last year and therefore, represents the legitimate executive power in the republic. Yaragi Mamodayev believes that the Russian leadership should have determined at the outset which authorities in Chechnya it considered legal and only then should it have begun any talks or consultations.
