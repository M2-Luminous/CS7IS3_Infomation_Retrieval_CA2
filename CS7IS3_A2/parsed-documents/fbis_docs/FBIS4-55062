Tihomir Vinkovic reports from Vienna: [Vinkovic] The negotiations lasted a long time, and some progress was made after all. The questions of external borders with the Serbs, and of the leaderhip of the federation and the government have been been resolved in principle. The question that remains to be resolved is the number of the cantons in the federation and their borders. The maps were drafted and exchanged at the end of today's round of talks. The delegation of the Bosnian Croats, led by Kresimir Zubak, exchanged the delineation maps with the Bosniak delegation, led by Haris Silajdzic. The contentious areas are central Bosnia and the municipalities of Mostar and Stolac. The positions on central Bosnia have converged, Kresimir Zubak said. But is this enough to reach an agreement? The part of the negotiations dealing with the relations between the Bosniak-Croat federation and the Republic of Croatia passed without difficulties. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic took part in it. The only certain thing is that the negotiations will continue tomorrow.
