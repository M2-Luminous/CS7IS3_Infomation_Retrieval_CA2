With these talks ahead, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a CNN interview on 24 June, touched on the possibility of a summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton and North Korean President Kim Il-song. In light of this, public interest is arising on a U.S.-North Korea summit. When asked about the chances for a U.S.-North Korea summit, Secretary of State Christopher said that North Korea has not yet established the kind of record that would justify a U.S.-North Korea summit. But, he said that such a possibility exists if North Korea changes its present stance and starts having the kind of behavior that justifies a summit. Since he made clear that this would only come after the normalization of bilateral diplomatic ties, holding such a meeting at an early date would be realistically impossible. However, the fact that the issue was brought up hints several things. First, the U.S. Government insinuated that it has the will to normalize diplomatic ties, aside from the chances of a summit. This may promote bilateral relations sooner than expected. In other words, by partly showing a carrot, "a bilateral summit," this could induce North Korea to assume a more flexible stance. The card called a U.S.-North Korea summit is something that deserves to be considered by President Clinton, who has repeated diplomatic failures in the Bosnian crisis, the extension of China's most-favorite-nation status, and the Haitian matter. President Clinton has received criticism from both the ruling and opposition parties for being incompetent and indecisive on the North Korean nuclear issue. Under such a condition, he may attempt to get a firm political foothold with a summit with President Kim Il-song. With a nonpresidential election slated for next November, the Democratic Party is now in a weaker position than the Republican Party. For President Kim Il-song, who became a familiar face to the American people as he appeared on U.S. television day after day after Carter's visit to Pyongyang, he could bear diplomatic fruits beyond his expectations in the event the summit is held. Explaining the results of his visit to the United States, former U.S. President Carter once said that "There is something I have not talked about" and "this can only be told to Clinton and Christopher." Chances are high that it has something to do with the summit. Nonetheless, we will just have to wait and see to confirm whether or not Secretary of State Christopher's remark is mere diplomatic rhetoric.
