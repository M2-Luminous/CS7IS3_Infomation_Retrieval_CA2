This resignation, which occurred yesterday, has not yet been officially confirmed. However, the national daily L'ESSOR said in today's issue that Mr. Sow did not participate in yesterday's regular cabinet meeting. Oumar Toure has the details: [Toure] Prime Minister Abdoulaye Sekou Sow resigned yesterday. This report has not yet been confirmed by the presidency, but, according to sources close to the prime minister's office, the outgoing head of government was said to be categorical on his decision. This resignation, according to the same sources, reportedly followed a crisis of confidence between the resigning prime minister and the majority party, on one hand, and the prime minister and some political parties represented within the government, on the other. This resignation comes at a time when Mali is trying to come to equitable and appropriate solutions to the situation generated by the devaluation of the CFA franc and also at a time when high school and university students are demonstrating against the criteria for the awarding of scholarships. Abdoulaye Sekou Sow entered the first government of the Third Republic as defense minister. He was appointed prime minister on 12 April 1993, following the resignation of Younoussi Toure's cabinet. He was later reappointed on 7 November 1993 to head the broad-based democratic cabinet. According to reliable sources, talks are under way at the political level to designate the new prime minister.
