When the situation was dashing toward a catastrophe after North Korea declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty [NPT] on 12 March last year, what the people had to watch attentively was China's attitude. This was because China is the only nation that can exercise influence on North Korea and is a permanent member state in the UN Security Council whose consent is absolutely necessary when the Security Council takes procedures for sanctions against North Korea. However, as long as the North Korean nuclear issue is concerned, the Chinese side kept a consistent position, at least outwardly, whether in the situation of crisis or in the stage of negotiations. China put forward as a precondition its position that neither the North nor the South of Korea should have nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, China maintained the position that the North Korean nuclear issue is a problem which should be resolved between North Korea and the United States; between North and South Korea; and between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Proceeding from this position, China opposed referring the issue to the UN Security Council. Moreover, China maintained that the problem should be resolved through dialogue and persuasion, instead of sanctions. The past one year can be called a course of application of the Chinese-style method of solution to the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue. However, the resolution of the problem through dialogue has not been successful for the past one year. At this point, therefore, mere repetition of the Chinese side's basic position may be criticized as an irresponsible attitude of the nation with the responsibility for international problems. Some people, however, predict that although China is outwardly opposed to taking procedures for sanctions against North Korea, it would internally give strong pressure to the North Korean side. China does not want to aggravate relations with Western countries, including the United States, even while maintaining its existent position. Besides, China is expected to play an active role in leading the situation in such a way as to resolve the problem through dialogue. China presently has more favorable conditions than last year for exercising influence on North Korea. First, distrust caused between China and North Korea by the establishment of ROK-China diplomatic relations was removed last year to a considerable extent. Recovery of North Korea's trust in China would broaden the scope of China's persuasion of North Korea. Second, with persistent nuclear crisis, the degree of North Korea's economic reliance on China has been deepened. However, even if the situation comes for China to take advantage of the card pertaining to energy, China will not likely use this card as the West expects. What one should pay attention to in observing China's attitude is the issue of renewing most-favored-nation status in early June. It is expected that the issue of renewing the most-favored-nation status will cause considerable discord because the Clinton administration put forward the improvement of China's human rights as a precondition. This being the case, China will strive to gain maximum practical interest by opposing the West's method for solution to the nuclear problem to the maximum possible extent. The basic reason for China--a nuclear power--not to keep step with the West is the difference in views on whether the North Korean nuclear arms are an actual threat or a diplomatic card. Unless clear evidence of the existence of North Korean nuclear arms is revealed to the public, "China's brakes" will likely continue in the future.
