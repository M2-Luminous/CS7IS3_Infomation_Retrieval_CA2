The five-point plan is a joint initiative by President de Klerk and ANC [African National Congress] leader Nelson Mandela, as well as other political leaders. The South African Defense Force will be deployed in the area immediately, and the Internal Stability Unit withdrawn. A representative task group led by the former chief of the Air Force, General Jan van Loggrenberg, will be in control of the operation. The task group will also include members of the ANC, the NP [National Party], and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], as well as community, business, and church leaders. The plan includes the upgrading and provision of community services and the support and protection of people of all political persuasions who were forced to evacuate their homes because of the violence. Urgent steps will also be taken to restore clean administration and good government to the area. The five-point plan was approved by the Transitional Executive Council during its weekly sitting in Pretoria today. President de Klerk said in a statement that the plan was aimed at restoring stability and trust in the East Rand as soon as possible. Urgent attention will also be given to health conditions, the upgrading of hostels, and teaching in the area.
