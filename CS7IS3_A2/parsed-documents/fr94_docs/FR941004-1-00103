FR941004-1-00103 FR941004-1-00018 For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 45 CFR Chapter XIII, subchapter G, is proposed to be amended as follows: 1. Subchapter G is amended by revising the heading to read as follows: SUBCHAPTER G_THE ADMINISTRATION ON CHILDREN, YOUTH AND FAMILIES, FOSTER CARE MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS, ADOPTION ASSISTANCE, AND CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES PART 1355_GENERAL 2. The authority citation for Part 1355 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 620 et seq., 42 U.S.C. 670 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. 1301 and 1302. 3. Section 1355.10 is revised to read as follows: §1355.10 Scope. Unless otherwise specified, this Part 1355 applies to States and Indian tribes and contains general requirements for Federal financial participation under titles IV&hyph;E and IV&hyph;B of the Social Security Act. 4. Section 1355.20(a) is amended by revising four definitions and by adding one definition to read as follows: §1355.20 Definitions. (a) *␣*␣* ACYF means the Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. * * * * * Commissioner means the Commissioner on Children, Youth and Families, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. * * * * * Independent Living Program (ILP) means the programs and activities established and implemented by the State to assist youth, as defined in section 477(a)(2) of the Act, to prepare to live independently upon leaving foster care. Programs and activities that may be provided are found in section 477(d) of the Act. State means, for title IV&hyph;B, the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. For title IV&hyph;E, the term ``State'' means the 50 States and the District of Columbia. State agency means the State agency administering or supervising the administration of the title IV&hyph;E and title IV&hyph;B State plans and the title XX social services block grant program. An exception to this requirement is permitted by section 103(d) of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;272). Section 103(d) provides that, if on December 1, 1974, the title IV&hyph;B program (in a State or local agency) and the social services program under section 402(a)(3) of the Act (the predecessor program to title XX) were administered by separate agencies, that separate administration of the programs could continue at State option. * * * * * 5.

(See 45 CFR 1357.15 and 1357.16.) The State agency also must make available for public review and inspection the title IV&hyph;E State Plan. 6. A new §1355.25 is added to read as follows: §1355.25 Principles of child and family services. The following principles, most often identified by practitioners and others as helping to assure effective services for children, youth, and families, should guide the States and Indian tribes in developing and operating child and family services and implementing improvements in service delivery systems. (a) The safety and well-being of children and of all family members is assured. When safety can be assured, strengthening and preserving families is seen as the best way to promote the healthy development of children. One important way to keep children safe is to stop violence against their mothers.
