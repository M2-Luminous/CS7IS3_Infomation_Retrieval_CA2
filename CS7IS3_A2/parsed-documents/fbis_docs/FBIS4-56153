To this end, Serbian authorities have occupied the university premises through force, by not allowing over 900 teachers and over 20 thousand Albanian students to attend studies there. According to Mr. Statovci, Albanian teachers and students have not interrupted teaching. The classes are being held, for the third consecutive year, in private homes in very difficult conditions. Almost the whole Prishtina is turned into a university. Despite the conditions, work goes on for the modernization of the teaching process. A law has also been prepared for the university based on the experience of the universities of Western countries. Mr. Statovci said that they have good relations with the universities in Albania, particularly with the Tirana University, which has given them a great assistance. According to Mr. Statovci, these relations are not developing as they should for objective reasons, one of which is the impossible free movement of the people.
