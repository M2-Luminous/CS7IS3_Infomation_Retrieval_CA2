The municipal council approved the declaration by a 30-5 vote, with five abstentions. In its whereas clauses, the declaration points out that "citizen Alberto Fujimori" has damaged Lima by approving a law reducing municipal income by 40 percent, and claims that the president has refused to talk with the Lima mayor, instead meeting with imprisoned terrorist leaders. The declaration thus hints at Fujimori's meeting with terrorist leader Osman Morote last week while inspecting the Yanamayo top security prison in Puno Department, on the Bolivian border. The document declares "citizen Alberto Fujimori" to be a "persona non grata" in order to distinguish his position as president of the Republic, which according to the Peruvian Constitution "represents a symbol of the nation." The hassle between Belmont and Fujimori began three months ago, when the government decided to redistribute the national municipal promotion tax in a more equitable manner in order to allocate more funds to the poorest municipalities. This measure, however, involved a reduction in the funds allocated to the Lima municipality, which was also interpreted as a political maneuver aimed at preventing Belmont from becoming a possible presidential candidate in the 1995 general elections. From the moment the measure was implemented, the Lima mayor has been openly and totally opposing the government, while Fujimori has been refusing to meet him as he feels the mayor must reorganize his tax administration to secure more funds.
