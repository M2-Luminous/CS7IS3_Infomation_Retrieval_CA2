The elections were held in the city on 28 January. The Palestinian Engineers' bloc, which is pro-Fatah, and the unified Islamic slate, an alliance of the Hamas Movement and the Islamic Jihad, won the board's eight seats, with two candidates from the two sides being equal in number of votes. Agreement was reached that membership for them would alternate for a one-year period. In addition, Fatah candidate Engineer Sa'd Kharma won the board's chairmanship, by a margin of seven votes over his rival Hamas candidate. The Administrative Board is composed of Engineers Sa'd Kharma (chairman), Jamal al-Khadri, Rafiq Makki, Hassam al-'Alul, Nasr al-Mazini, Raf'at Rustam, Salah al-Saqqa, Jamal Abu-Kashif, Muhammad al-Wazir (first year), and 'Abd-al-Karim Muhsin (second year). Voting began in the morning and continued into the evening, until the evening curfew--imposed by the occupation authorities--ended the process. Out of the 939 engineers eligible to vote, 804 participated. Five electoral blocs competed in these elections, in addition to two independent candidates.
