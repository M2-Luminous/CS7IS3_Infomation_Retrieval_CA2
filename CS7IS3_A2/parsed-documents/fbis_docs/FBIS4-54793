He was reacting to yesterday's remarks made by ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), at the HZDS meeting and aimed against the present government coalition who, according to Meciar, are allegedly trying to render impossible the coming early elections to be held in autumn. Carnogursky said other remarks by Meciar were "embarrassing and laughable." Meciar said at the meeting that a plot had been hatched by Carnogursky and the U.S. President to reunite the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Carnogursky said the KDH manifesto was to be based on Slovak independence. Even the figures who publicly opposed the (January 1, 1993) split and who the KDH would like to see on its slate, understand that the split is permanent, he added. "Ex-Premier Meciar should realise that... he has now included in his lies the President of the United States," Carnogursky said, adding that advertising in "one newspaper alone" will cost the HZDS 2.5 million crowns (72,500 USD). The KDH has been working on a bill to limit parties' election campaign expenditures.
