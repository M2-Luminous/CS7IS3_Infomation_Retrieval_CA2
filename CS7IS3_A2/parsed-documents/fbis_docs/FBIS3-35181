The woman, whose name has not yet been released, was hit in the head. Her husband did not stop the car, and rushed to a nearby Army base, from where she was evacuated by ambulance to Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tiqva. She died soon after. Our reporter says she was in the fifth month of pregnancy. At the site of the attack, the casings of Kalashnikov bullets were found.
