An influx of foreign capital lowers interest rates and increases investment. But massive inflow of foreign capital increases money supply and puts pressure on appreciation of currency. Thus the size of capital inflow must be adjusted or the government must export capital in order to balance capital inflow. A net capital inflow of 10 billion dollars is expected for this year. To offset a surge of capital inflow, the government mapped out a series of measures to encourage capital outflow or capital exports. These measures have expanded room for overseas expansion and operations of Korean industrial companies. First of all, the government softened its control on private holding of foreign capital. A total of 1,300 enterprises with annual external trade volume of more than 10 million dollars have been permitted to hold up to 300 million dollars overseas or 30 percent of their annual external trade volume. Other smaller companies and individuals were also permitted to keep up to 20,000 dollars overseas, through a drastic easing of the foreign exchange concentration system. Second, restrictions on overseas investment in bonds, securities and real estate for portfolio management purposes have been eased. Securities companies, institutional investors and insurance companies have been authorized to invest as much capital as possible in buying foreign bonds and equities and real estate for asset management purposes. From around June, individual investors will be able to directly invest in foreign bonds and equities within a ceiling to be set later. General trading companies can also invest in overseas real estate up to 100 million dollars or within 10 percent of their annual export and import volume. Third, the government virtually liberalized its remaining restrictions on outbound direct investment by local firms. The number of sectors to be "restricted" for offshore direct investment, was reduced to 14, from the previous 17. Except for these "restricted" sectors, Korean firms can invest in all kinds of projects overseas. Outbound investment less than 300,000 dollars can be made only by reporting to banks, not to the government. About 75 percent of outbound direct investments are handled by banks. This liberalization measures will help local firms expand their offshore production base and sharpen their international competitive edge. Fourth, measures were also taken to help industrial firms make a timely settlement in external payments. Local firms will no longer need government approval when they pay royalties less than 300,000 dollars. Commercial banks, not the Bank of Korea, will be in charge of verifying the overseas remittance of funds by industrial firms for the capital increase of their foreign offshoots. Local firms can send up to 20,000 dollars per month to overseas office for maintenance expenses. When Korea eliminates restrictions on the current account transactions, including services fees payment, from June, Korean firms will be able to deal in external activities in a more liberal way that is available in Western industrialized countries. When foreign exchange restrictions are lifted, there is a worry that speculative hot money will move in and out of Korea. To prevent the movement of the disruptive hot money, the government has barred, from February, individuals from receiving foreign currency of up to 20,000 dollars without identifying their sources. Those who receive up to 50,000 dollars from overseas will be placed on the special surveillance list of the Korean tax office. Secondly, non-residents, namely foreigners, can not convert more than 20,000 dollars per month in local currency, without identifying the sources and uses. Korea is ready to push for liberalizing the foreign exchange rules for internationalizing its economy. As excessive capital inflows have many negative effects, the government must devise a mechanism to keep the foreign capital inflow amount at an optimal way. Especially, the government is promoting a policy that will encourage the outflow of capital for productive purposes that will be of long-term benefit to Korean firms and the economy, not for consumption-oriented purposes such as upward adjustment of overseas travel expenses.
