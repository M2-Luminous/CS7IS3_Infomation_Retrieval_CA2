The head of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation said that the agreement does not resolve the global issues related to the restructurization of the Polish automobile industry. He stated that the sum of 16 million German marks, which the concern promised to invest in FSO, was "no sum." He also added that he is against granting the company the guaranteed preferential system for sales of Opel Astras. He most probably meant the customs licenses for those cars and the possibility of selling those cars, just like Fiats, to those who made prepayments to receive Fiat 126's or FSO's [system of selling rationed cars under the communist system]. "Our contract has all the necessary signatures," RZECZPOSPOLITA was told by John Passadis, the GM representative in Poland; he added that "the contract is permanent and final. GM representatives have already arrived at FSO and we are getting ready to begin manufacturing." Far more painful for GM Poland was the decision by the Finance Ministry which, as of 1 February, lowered the limit for the 15-percent excise tax on imported cars from 7,000 ECU's to 8,000 ECU's. FSO General Director Andrzej Tyszkiewicz said that the implementation of the contract is in line with the schedule: The day of "closing" is scheduled for March; the installation of equipment and machines in the factory will begin in April.
