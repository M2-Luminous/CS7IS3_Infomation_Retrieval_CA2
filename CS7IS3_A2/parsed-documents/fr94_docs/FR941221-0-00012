FR941221-0-00012 FR941221-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 18 CFR Part 284 [Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;002; Order No. 566&hyph;B] Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements for Transportation and Affiliate Transactions Issued December 14, 1994. AGENCY: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, DOE. ACTION: Final rule; Order; Denying Rehearing. SUMMARY: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is issuing an order denying the requests for rehearing of Order No. 566&hyph;A. The rehearing requests deal only with the requirement of Standard of Conduct H which requires natural gas pipelines to post on their pipeline Electronic Bulletin Boards marketing affiliate discount information 24 hours after gas flows. The Commission denied the requests to institute an earlier posting time finding that posting of discount transactions after gas flows strikes the proper balance between providing public information to detect a pattern of discriminatory treatment and ensuring that the posting will not produce adverse effects on competition between marketing affiliates and non-affiliates. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426.
