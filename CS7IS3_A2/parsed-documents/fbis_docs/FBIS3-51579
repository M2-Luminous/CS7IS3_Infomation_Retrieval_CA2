The foreign minister said the crisis of Banco Latino and its subsequent intervention, which the government ordered last week, has "damaged the image" of Venezuela in the international financial world. The bank closed its doors 14 January due to a serious crisis of liquidity, after some 55 billion bolivars (some $514 million) were withdrawn over the last three months, according to reports by the bank board of directors. Ochoa said the government's intervention is aimed at protecting the deposits of depositors and defining what is the real situation of that bank. At the end of last year, Banco Latino was the Venezuelan financial institution with the largest amount of deposits and the third largest credit portfolio holder. The government intervention may have significant consequences in the national economic area. The Venezuelan foreign minister said Venezuelan authorities must establish clearly the criminal responsibilities that may exist in this case, in which the savings of thousands of depositors and Venezuelan Government institutions have been endangered. Venezuelan judicial authorities have ordered an investigation to establish if the Banco Latino directors have committed embezzlement against that financial institution.
