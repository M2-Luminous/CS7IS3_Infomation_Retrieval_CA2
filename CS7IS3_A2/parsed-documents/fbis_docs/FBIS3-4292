Delivering a speech at the famed Beijing University Tuesday morning, Kim noted that the Korean peninsula has yet to cast off the yoke of the cold war. "This state of affairs threatens to throw Asia into chaos at any moment," Kim said, adding: "This is because North Korea is still loath to ride the global trend toward reform and openness." In particular, its nuclear development program imperils peace not only in Asia but in the whole world, he said. Pyongyang is now vacillating between two courses of action: Sticking to its old policy of isolation and confrontation or embracing the world trend of openness and cooperation, Kim said. "I believe that China is a neighbor who can join us in trying to persuade North Korea to participate in the current global movement," Kim said. "I ardently hope that China will play an active role in this effort." Indeed, China may be the only country that could possibily exert influence over the communist regime in North Korea. "We have never wanted the North to be isolated, and we will spare no effort to help Pyongyang join the international community as a responsible member," said the South Korean president, who is on a five-day official visit to China. Kim said his country is stepping up development of its west coast with the aim of boosting interaction with China. "If and when North Korea also rides the global wave of openness and reform, a Yellow Sea economic zone will rapidly emerge," Kim said. The Yellow Sea would then become an expanse of peace and prosperity and Northeast Asia an even more dynamic region, Kim predicted. "The Pacific would even more certainly emerge as the center of new world civilization," he said. Korean unification would be in China's interest as well, Kim said, since it would ease tension in Northeast Asia and accelerate regional development. Korean reunification would help stabilize a new Northeast Asian order, he said. "We must live together and join forces to usher in a new era," Kim said. "By living together well, South Korea and China will be the axis for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia and thus the driving force behind the budding Asia-Pacific age." In this context, South Korean-Chinese ties are one of the most important bilateral relationships, Kim said. "There is great potential for our two countries if we combine our manpower, natural resources, capital and technology, while also sharing the benefits of developmental experience and expertise," he said. Seoul and Beijing should also step up joint efforts to develop the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum so as to enhance regional cooperation, he said. After the speech, President Kim met with Prime Minister Li Peng and Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress. Kim emphasized the need for closer cooperation between Seoul and Beijing to resolve the North Korean nuclear row. They also exchanged views on ways to boost bilateral economic cooperation. Kim was to have lunch with Korean reporters covering the presidential office of Chongwadae [presidential offices] before holding a press conference for both Korean and foreign journalists.
