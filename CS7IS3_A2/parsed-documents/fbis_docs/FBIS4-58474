The text is as follows: [IRNA] What are the results of the follow-up by the Information Ministry regarding the assassination attempt against the acting Mashhad Friday imam, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin 'Aba'i? [Musavi-Nezhad] On 22 April Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin was attacked by an armed person from among those praying after the Friday prayers ended. An investigation revealed that the assailant was named 'Ali Huri Papi, from Haft Tappeh in Khuzestan Province, who had joined the Monafeqin [meaning hypocrites--pejorative term for Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, MKO] and had managed to acquire a Makarov through some common acquaintances. The Monafeqin continue their armed terrorist actions because of their inherent nature, as they have not evolved a definite political form. [passage omitted on previous MKO operations]. [IRNA] Where did the arrest of Sa'idi-Sirjani--the well-known writer of the idolatrous [shah's] era take place? Could you give us some details of the inquiry that has taken place and its outcome? [Musavi-Nezhad] Sa'idi-Sirjani was arrested along with another person Mohammad Sadeq Sa'id, alias Niaz Kermani. He was traced to a network of drugs and immorality and was arrested by the antidrug officials. Both have confessed to their guilt. However, after an investigation into their past records, Sa'idi and Niaz Kermani were found to have links and collaboration with the SAVAK and were handed over to the Information Ministry. According to the SAVAK documents, Sa'idi-Sirjani has a shady past and was mentioned in these documents as one who had been reporting about revolutionary and combatant elements to the SAVAK. In a letter in 1348 [year beginning 21 March 1969] written to the SAVAK, he clearly admitted to writing in favor of the shah's regime and of cooperating with the SAVAK. There is also evidence of his links with foreign intelligence services. Niaz Kermani was also a SAVAK official and continued his links with the covert network of SAVAK elements even after the victory of the revolution. For quite some time, he has been living in hiding since the discovery of a coupist network [not further identified]. Both the accused have admitted to the following charges in the interrogation: 1. The transport, distribution, and use of narcotics and inducting new members into the network in Kerman and Tehran by means of clandestine agreements according to which the drugs were delivered to them. 2. The production, storage, and distribution of alcoholic beverages. 3. Indulging in immoral, obscene, and homosexual orgies codenamed "Kashk va bademjan" [literally dried curds and eggplant]. 4. Links with the network of former SAVAK officials involved in the Nowzheh coup attempt, planting bombs, and membership in the espionage network of the Rafizadeh brothers in the United States. 5. Receiving considerable sums in foreign exchange from the counterrevolutionary networks based in the United States and Europe and foreign remittances which were deposited in Sa'idi-Sirjani's accounts in the United States and Britain. [IRNA] At the conclusion of the interview, the director general for internal security of the Information Ministry clarified that the inquiries are continuing in order to identify their internal and external links. The outcome of this inquiry will be divulged at a later date.
