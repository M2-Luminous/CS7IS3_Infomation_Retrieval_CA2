We state that these statements contain no truth whatsoever, are completely fabricated, and are designed to confuse the position of the Hamas Movement, which strongly rejects the infamous Cairo agreement. The source added: The Hamas Movement reiterates its rejection of participation, in any form, in the authority of the feeble self-rule, and that no agreement was reached to hold any meetings with Fatah. Moreover, 'Abbas Zaki's claim that there is a draft covenant of honor between Fatah and the Alliance of Palestinian Forces has no truth and is designed to enhance the ugly image of self-rule and 'Arafat's leadership following the signing of the agreement of relinquishment in Cairo.
