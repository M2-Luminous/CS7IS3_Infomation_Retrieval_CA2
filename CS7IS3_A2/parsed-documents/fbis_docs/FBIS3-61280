The Communists Are Content"] [Text] In Mordovia the results of the parliamentary elections were perceived, as throughout the country, with a certain astonishment. But as distinct from Moscow, say, the people here were surprised not by the victory of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] but by the fact that the present democrats obtained any substantial votes in the State Duma at all. Two years ago, the Mordovian Soviet Socialist Republic (Mordovian Soviet Socialist today, as before, incidentally) supported President Yeltsin, elected as its republic president the democrat Guslyannikov, and interpreted the democrats' program statements as the promise of a just, replete life protected against the tyranny of both the authorities and criminals. Today, however, the electorate's party slate vote at the State Duma elections in Mordovia was distributed as follows: LDPR, 34.5 percent; Communist Party of the Russian Federation, 18.3 percent; Agrarian Party, 12.2 percent; Russia's Choice, 7.5 percent; Women of Russia, 6 percent; YABloko, 5.2 percent; and the other parties and blocs, less than 5 percent. As far as the new Constitution is concerned, it was utterly swamped in all areas of the republic (only 37 percent "for"), with an activity of the people's masses that was relatively high for that ballot--60 percent. Zhirinovskiy's victory in Mordovia was predetermined primarily by the public's distrust of both the democrats and the communists. In addition, Vladimir Volfovich came to Saransk in person and won the voters' affections, skillfully demonstrating his concern for their problems. "I had no choice," one 40-year-old man told your SEGODNYA correspondent. "Zhirinovskiy is educated and forceful. He gives the favorable impression of being a strong person who knows what he is saying. Everyone has now suddenly begun to intimidate us with Zhirinovskiy. He is a fascist, they say, he means war. No, I do not believe that he is a fascist. He is a worthy replacement for Yeltsin. He should be given power, and if it turns out that war really does come with him, we will elect someone else or will fight him. As far as the democrats are concerned, we had begun to fear them here, in Mordovia, like the plague, and as for the communists, well, we had replaced them with the democrats." This is the thinking of the majority of those who voted for Mr. Zhirinovskiy. They are not interested in what specifically Vladimir Volfovich is offering in the sphere of policy or the economy. It is enough that he is very easy to understand in his criticism and abuse of the present authorities. For example, he is promising to do away with crime, which in Saransk is considered problem No. 1, at a stroke. And no one is interested in why this cannot be done by the present authorities and in how this will be managed by the LDPR. It was said at one plant in the city: "Democracy here is something remote from the people. They cannot even meaningfully say how their programs differ from one another. But our plant is on the point of coming to a halt, and how am I to feed my family? Not with their inflation. They have not kept a single promise. The president promised to lie down on the track. The time has long since expired; why has he not done so? The people are openly disenchanted and embittered by the fact that everything is falling apart, and the people are of no concern to the democrats. Just bribes and bribes. Away with them, they are even matching the communists. Medvedev, for example. He is from Mordovia. One of ours. Everyone here knows him as a fervent communist, and he has of late been working for Yeltsin. Neither the democrats nor the communists here call him anything other than a prostitute, but the authorities are feeding him, so they need him, consequently. But they are not feeding us. So for whom to vote?" In a word, things are with the democrats in Mordovia today as clear as could be. As Sergey Serebyrakov, who ran as a YABLoko candidate, said, the democratic movement here has suffered political collapse. Not, in the main, on account here of severe impoverishment, which cannot be seen in the republic, but because of the ineptitude of the pro-reform authorities and the showdowns among them. Egon Gauer, the prominent local democrat, is convinced here that "people sincerely support democracy, for all that. But when they have to express this publicly, they are afraid of the consequences. The authorities here are simply not democratic." The communists have not gone anywhere but have continued and now continue to control the local organs of power and administration. And are shunning nothing to restore power to themselves in full. Thus, in the course of the election campaign one communist candidate frightened the people with the fact that were the democrats to remain in power, the governors would soon be "Germans." Since August 1991 Mordovia's communists have openly been making common cause with Zhirinovskiy's party. Nowhere else in Russia have the communists thus far formed a bloc with the LDPR. In Mordovia this alliance has now celebrated its second anniversary. The communists are united with Zhirinovskiy, as Ivan Dolgayev, secretary of the Mordovian Executive Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, announced, by the principles of patriotism and statehood. In the course of the recent election campaign, the communists in Saransk gave Zhirinovskiy's party organizational assistance in mounting his campaign (the LDPR's structure in Mordovia is very weak) in order to defeat the anti-communists, who are "ensconced in Moscow." It is beyond the powers of the communists themselves to overcome the democrats, even in Mordovia, where the failures of the democratic movement are obvious. The results of the choice made by the public are frightening no one. On the contrary, they are inspiring: some to struggle for the reconstitution of the Soviet Union, others to organize an anti-fascist front. Optimism commands the thoughts of both the left and the right and of those in the center also, and this optimism of the politicians is being fed not so much by their own strength as by the obvious weaknesses of their rivals.
