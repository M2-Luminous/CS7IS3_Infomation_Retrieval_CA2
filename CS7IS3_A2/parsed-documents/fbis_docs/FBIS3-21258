However, in a significant change, the Clinton administration has promised to seek a statutory change limiting the duration of U.S. technology patents to 20 years from the time of application. That provision would put the United States in harmony with Japan and Europe. The Clinton administration unveiled this shift late last month in negotiations under the U.S.-Japan trade framework. Japan and Europe have long pushed the United States to replace its first-to-invent patent system with the widely used first-to-file system. The U.S. system awards the patent to the inventor who can prove the earliest date of invention, even if it means removing the patent from its original recipient. The first-to-file system gives the patent to the inventor who files a patent application first. ``The first-to-invent system has served us well in the past, and while the United States may move to first-to-file sometime in the future, I am not convinced that enough small inventors and entrepreneurs would benefit if we made a switch at this time,'' Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said. An official at Japan's Patent Office said, ``It is regrettable that the United States still sticks to its unique system. It takes a great deal to prove who invented first. It is much easier and clearer to determine who filed the application first.'' The U.S. refusal to change the principle would stall the patent harmonization talks at the 141-member World Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva, Japanese officials say. As for the duration of patents, Japanese officials remain skeptical of the U.S. pledge. Said Hajime Aoyama, senior managing director at the Japan Patent Association, ``The White House has pledged the change in the calculation method, but it is still doubtful that the U.S. Congress will approve the change.'' Under current U.S. law, a patent is effective for 17 years--not from the time of the application but from the time of registration. In 1992, the U.S. patent authority suddenly awarded a patent to a U.S. inventor in Nevada who filed an application 38 years ago for technology to inspect parts through electric monitoring. Japanese automakers are liable to pay royalties for using the technology for 17 years until the patent expires in the year 2004--55 years from the application. Such patents are called ``submarine'' patents because they cruise submerged and then suddenly surface to hit companies using the technology with royalty charges. A 20-year limit on the validity of patents from the time of application would minimize ``submarine'' patents, Japanese officials say. Disclosure pressed On another point, Japanese officials are pressing for quicker U.S. disclosure on pending patents. The United States now discloses no information on applications until a patent is officially awarded, on the premise of protecting the inventor's interests. This means, however, other parties may not be able to find out whether a patent is being sought for a certain technology. In Japan and Europe, patent information is disclosed 18 months after the filing of an application. The United States has put a great emphasis on protecting intellectual-property rights. It excels in the development of intellectual property. In the intellectual-property category, which includes patent and copyright payments, the United States has by far the biggest surplus in world trade--about $13 billion in 1991.
