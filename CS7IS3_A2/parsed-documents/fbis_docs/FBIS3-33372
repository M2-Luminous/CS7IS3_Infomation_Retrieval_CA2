Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes [ACM] is threatening to review the PFL [Liberal Front Party]'s support for the government only a few days before the decisive battle to approve the economic plan in Congress. "The government has suffered a serious credibility crisis," the governor said on 18 February. "This is why we must renegotiate the pact that made possible PFL support for the FSE." The PFL was one of the main parties responsible for a full plenary session during the first voting session on the FSE, when the government amendment was approved. This is why ACM's threat carries a strong risk that the decisive voting session might be postponed. "It can be delayed, yes," the governor admitted. In order to have the amendment approved in the decisive session the government needs the votes of 293 legislators, which requires broad support. This support was weakened recently by Itamar Franco's behavior during Carnival and his remarks in favor of the candidacy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso for the presidency. FSE resources are essential for the government to balance the public deficit and begin the second stage of the plan providing for the implementation of the Real Value Unit (URV). Political parties are aware of the consequences if the plan is not approved by 10 March, when the deadline for negotiating the foreign debt with the IMF expires. But many politicians are willing to delay a vote on the plan to prevent the minister from running for the presidency. Tarcisio Delgado (PMDB-MG [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party- Minas Gerais]), leader of the largest bloc in Congress, is facing the possibility of a vote on 23 February with "moderate optimism." Today the PMDB will have a meeting with all its deputies and senators to reevaluate its support for the government. The mood of the party turned more serious after the president's support for Cardoso's candidacy because the PMDB is reluctant to approve measures offering electoral profit to the minister. The PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] already has announced that it will again insist on the approval of measures keeping funds for education and housing intact. That could represent a loss of $2 billion for the FSE. The party will try to close an agreement with rebellious PMDB legislators that might make the life of the government miserable. That alliance is supported even by some groups inside the PFL, which is also against Cardoso's candidacy. On 18 February, legislators again could not gather enough numbers for a quorum for a session. There were 40 deputies on the premises and only 18 of them went to the auditorium to ask if there was going to be a session.
