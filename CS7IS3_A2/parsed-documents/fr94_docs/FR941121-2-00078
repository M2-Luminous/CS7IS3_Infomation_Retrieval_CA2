FR941121-2-00078 FR941121-2-00066 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Bureau of Land Management [ID&hyph;052&hyph;1430&hyph;01; IDI&hyph;28923] Exchange of Public Land; Idaho AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice of Realty Action; Exchange of Public Land in Blaine County, Idaho. SUMMARY: The following described public land has been determined to be suitable for disposal by exchange under Section 206 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1716; T. 3 N., R. 18 E., Boise Meridian, Section 26: W1/2NW1/4, SE1/4NW1/4. The area described contains 120.0 acres in Blaine County. In exchange for this land, the United States will acquire the following described land from A & P Partnership: In fee title: T. 2 N., R. 18 E., Boise Meridian, Section 2: E1/2SE1/4; Section 11: NE1/4, SE1/4NW1/4, NE1/4SW1/4, S1/2SW1/4, N1/2SE1/4. The area described contains 480.0 acres in Blaine County. DATES: The publication of this notice in the Federal Register will segregate the public land described above to the extent that it will not be subject to appropriation under the public land laws. As provided by the regulations in 43 CFR 2201.1(b), any subsequently tendered application, allowance of which is discretionary, shall not be accepted, shall not be considered as filed and shall be returned to the applicant. The segregative effect of this notice will terminate upon issuance of patent or in two years, whichever occurs first. ADDRESSES: Detailed information concerning the exchange, including the environmental analysis and record of public contact is available for review at the Shoshone District Office located at 400 F Street in Shoshone, Idaho. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of the land exchange is to facilitate more efficient management of public land through consolidation of ownership and to benefit the public interest by obtaining important resource values. The public land to be exchanged is isolated and difficult to manage with limited resource values. The private land being offered has very important values for wildlife, and watershed, that merit acquisition for public ownership. The exchange is consistent with BLM land use plans, and the public interest would be better served by making this exchange. The value of the land to be exchanged is approximately equal, and the difference is within the legal limits. Equalization of values will be achieved through cash payment by the proponent. The exchange will be subject to: 1. All valid existing rights, including any right-of-way easement, permit or lease of record. 2. A reservation to the United States of a right-of-way for ditches and canals constructed by the authority of the United States under the Act of August 30, 1890 (43 U.S.C. 945). For a period of 45 days from publication of this notice, interested parties may submit comments as follows: David A. Koehler, Bureau of Land Management, Shoshone District Office, P.O. Box 2&hyph;B, Shoshone ID 83352&hyph;1522. Objections will be reviewed by the State Director who may sustain, vacate, or modify this realty action. In the absence of any objections, this realty action will become the final determination of the Department of the Interior. Dated: November 10, 1994. Norman L. Walker, Acting Associate District Manager. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28657 Filed 11&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;GG&hyph;M
