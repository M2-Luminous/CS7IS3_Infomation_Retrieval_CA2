But UPR and SN-D leaders, attending a discussion on local governments on Sunday, said that they did not intend to form a national coalition in the forthcoming local elections. Janusz Korwin Mikke, leader of the UPR, termed as "villainous" the recent proposal by the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SDRP) to alter the local election law several months before expected elections. According to Korwin Mikke, the idea of direct general elections for commune heads, town mayors and city presidents is an attempt to adjust the election law to the present situation.
