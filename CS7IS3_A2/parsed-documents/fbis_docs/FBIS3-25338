In the afternoon, the government delegation went to the Mulungushi Conference Center to counter the superfluous contents of the document presented by the Black Cockerel negotiators. The mediators say only two issues are delaying the conclusion of the first chapter of the fourth point of the Lusaka negotiating round. It is expected that tomorrow the mediators and troika of observers will deliver the new version of the master document to the delegations for a study, before a second meeting by the sides is held.
