Managers Have Difficulties in Acquiring the Results of Outside Research Technology transfer is discussed mostly in highly abstract terms. Meanwhile, establishing viable connections between enterprises in need of technology and institutions engaged in research involves hard work and when contact is not made, it is because of conflicting goals. KARRIERE, 26 Nov 93. First the good news: the Federal Republic, with its 20,000 industrial research enterprises, 102 industrial research consortia, over 300 colleges and vocational colleges, 16 large-scale research facilities, 66 Max-Planck Institutes and research groups, and 47 Fraunhofer Institutes, remains as before a leading research post worldwide. German basic research is the world's best. The bad news is that much of what the German researchers in all these institutes, laboratoria, and colleges develop and invent goes to waste. Valuable results get covered with dust in libraries without a follow-up with practical research and development or product development. Cooperation between state research facilities and economic management is very poor. At the same time research-intensive sectors are going through a deeper than average crisis. Forces which once stimulated growth are now becoming road blocks. Paul Krueger, Federal Minister of Research, has recognized this and calls for an "innovation initiative". His primary point of departure would be improving the contacts between science and economic management. Previous conferences, says Krueger, did not yield any concrete results. Apart from the political dialogue among a handful of top managers who for years have kept in touch anyway, the question arises as to what possibilities there are for R.& D. management in enterprises to secure the transfer of know-how from science to industrial practice. One obvious solution often resorted to in the past is personnel transfer. The training of German researchers is everywhere said to be excellent. There is, however, a negative indicator: in 1992 there were 279,000 experts engaged full-time in R.& D. and thus 17,500 fewer than in 1989. The trend is further downward. Christoph Beckmann, Chair of Technology Management and Marketing professor at the Technical College in Darmstadt, can explain this: "More and more people are being trained, but the domestic economy cannot absorb them." Thus while nominally budgets have increased, even more than in proportion to the output, personnel has not been enlarged. "Today two thirds of budgets for R.& D. cover personnel costs." Prof. Hans-Joachim Queisser, an internationally recognized physicist at the Max-Planck Institute of Solid-State Research in Stuttgart and long-time adviser to the Ministry of Research in Bonn, is not any more able to place his science disciples in the domestic economy. "Industry rather tries to let its people here go. So does Siemens, which has handed over its entire superconductor research to the Jena University." So far 30 of the Queisser staff have gone to Japan. "Here they do not have a chance, because European industry has given up entire research areas. The Japanese meanwhile envy us our sprouting talent and come running to drain it away." There would still remain the possibility of short-term personnel transfer, perhaps on a project basis. Dr. Roland Vogt of the Bremen University, where a model experiment regarding stimulation of technology transfer was initiated, had polled college placement offices and found very few opportunities of short-term transfer to business available to scientific workers and college teachers. The appropriate assistance programs offered in Bremen and in North Rhineland - Westphalia were found to remain almost entirely unutilized. While the direct personnel track is evidently not effective enough, there would still remain the possibility of intensifying the cooperation with research institutes. According to the data supplied by the founding consortium, the national economy has in 1992 spent about 56.2 billion DM on R.& D. in West Germany. This sum was split into 50 billion DM for domestic R.& D. and 6.2 billion DM for outside research. It is obvious to Queisser why R.& D. managers, faced with heavy personnel costs, do not try harder to farm out their research: "An industry which could utilize our research is almost nonexistent in Germany. We have no industry which produces personal computers, none which produces flat-panel displays, and none which produces laser diodes for modern compact-disk record players. The task of the Max-Planck Institutes is to do basic research. And while these Institutes would be partly financed by industry, there are not enough possibilities of converting this kind of research into something practical: "There are no industrial users in need of it." Dr. Tom Sommerlatte, managing director of "Europe" at the Arthur D. Little business consultants sees it otherwise: "The Max-Planck Institutes are developing future technologies, but have no way to communicate what products these will yield. Enterprises then face the results of these developments with amazement and not knowing what to do with them." And within an enterprise, continues Sommerlatte, the same barrier has to be overcome again: "Indeed, the R.& D. manager speaks the language of the Max- Planck Institute so that marketing people and technologists can not understand one another either." Today most enterprises, moreover, are run very much on the cost efficiency track: "Employees therefore are concerned more about their job security than about future products." Probably the best interaction of domestic and outside scientific research has been achieved by managers of the chemical industry. Some successes have also been achieved in machine manufacture and processing technology. On the whole, however, shortage of personnel makes it extremely difficult for industry to keep being informed. Prof. Erich Staudt, director of the Institute of Applied Innovation Research at the Bochum University, asserts: "The R.& D. departments lead their own lives almost completely insulated from the outside world." "This is particularly true of the R.& D. workers in the middle-class economy" adds Queisser: "They cannot even send their people to attend lectures. Sessions on the subject of transfer, once well attended, are today not being held any more. Says Sommerlatte: "It would be important that our natural scientists and technologists develop an understanding of industrial management and ask themselves what products the results of their research could yield." It is precisely from this point where Martin Schaettgen, business manager of the "Inno" Ltd in Karlsruhe, takes off. He advises research institutions on the possibilities of their better cooperation with industrial enterprises. The problem, he agrees, lies essentially with the researchers. "It is not easy for R.& D. managers to make the contact" suggests the adviser. "In Karlsruhe alone there are at least 18 institutions which offer a technology transfer. Very few good ones are among them. The national economy is consequently confronted by a jumble of most diverse completely unstructured information." It is very expensive, says Schaettgen, to have an enterprise itself set up such a transfer post of its own and to establish contacts via patent data banks. The most serious problem Schaettgen sees, however, in the great reluctance of researchers to cooperate. Says Schaettgen: "The manner in which a research project is managed differs fundamentally from project management in industry. The cost and time awareness is entirely different, as is also the definition of a good result. To the R.& D. manager a good result is a product which functions and is soon available at an acceptable cost. From the researchers point of view, it is a result which he or she can publish. The researcher is recognition-oriented, the manager is result-oriented."
