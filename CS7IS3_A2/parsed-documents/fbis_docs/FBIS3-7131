On behalf of the participants, Mr. Zainal Abidin Sulong, president of the GMPECC welcomed Mr Do Muoi and hailed the achievements recorded by the Vietnamese people during their current renovation process. He stressed that Vietnam has gained a number of achievements on economic, cultural and social fields. Vietnam is now a promising and dynamic country. He also praised Vietnamese open-door foreign policy and held that Vietnam has made great contribution to the stability, cooperation and development in the region as well as in the world. After that General Secretary Do Muoi addressed at the GMPECC. Followings are main parts of his speech: We Vietnamese have always been conscious that Vietnam is an inseparable part of the Pacific, and together with the peoples on the rim of this vital ocean area, we have always shared the sorrows at disasters and the joys at good opportunities brought about to the region. In observing the development curves on the Pacific Rim, we are deeply aware that as a country with thousands of years of history, endowed with rich and diversified resources, a very favourable geographic location and a people who are undaunted in struggle and industrious in labour, Vietnam has the conditions to quickly reach a high standard of development. However, for the past nearly half a century, while other nations were enjoying peace and had favourable conditions to develop, the Vietnamese had to undergo one brutal war after another and suffered from enormous sacrifices to regain and defend their national independence and freedom, and to liberate and unify their country. A huge amount of bombs and ammunitions which exceeded even that used throughout World War II, was dropped on the small country of Vietnam, leaving our people in untold sufferings and lasting heavy consequences. I have no intention to disturb your souls with this reminder amid this peaceful atmosphere in Kuala Lumpur, but only wish to say that the Vietnamese people have paid dear price to regain their most fundamental and sacred right as human beings, namely to live in independence and freedom that the Vietnamese people, not less than anyone else, long for a peaceful life to do all they can to build a prosperous country and that such an undaunted nation fully deserves a life of plenty and happiness. It is with such a consciousness that we have persistently pursued our policy of `renewal' to mobilize all resources of the society, tap to all potentials of the people and, at the same time, broaden our international cooperation along the line of diversification and multilateralization to materialize our goal of becoming `a rich people, a strong country and an equitable and civilized society'. We have made important initial achievements. Despite the major upheavals in the world, the profound changes in the countries of our traditional trading partners and the embargo, the Vietnamese economy never collapsed but has, on the contrary, shown upturns. From a country of chronic food shortages, having to import hundreds of thousands of tons of food a year, Vietnam has now become a food exporter, selling each year from 1.5 to 2 million tons of rice. The hyper-inflation which used to register at triple digits in the mid-1980's has gone down to only over 5 a year. In the meantime, the GDP has clocked an average annual increase of over 7 over the past three years and is laying the premise for a still higher growth in the coming years. These achievements result from the self-sacrifices in labour of our people, and of our persistent policy for all-round renewal that has enjoyed the warm response from, and zealous implementation by, our entire people. They also result from the heartfelt support and assistance of our friends around the world. From this rostrum, I would like to express our sincere gratitude for that valuable support and assistance. The cause we are pursuing has no precedent. We, have thus to strenuously promote our sense of independence and sovereignty, and our creativity in research and carefulness in development, giving priority to economic renewal while carrying out political renewal in appropriate forms and with suitable steps. To catch up with the common momentum of development and gradually bridge the gap between our country and others in the region, we continue to consider economic development our central task, and will persist in our policy of all-round renewal and our open foreign policy of diversification and multilateralization.
