The meeting they were attending last November was one of the group's most important for a long time: a gathering of the world's terror organisations at the behest of their Iranian paymasters. As the IRA bosses walked into the Feirouzi palace, they joined leading figures from some of the most secretive and feared groups in the world: the Japanese Red Army, the Basque terrorist group ETA, Hizballah, the Abu Nidal organisation and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- General Command. The terrorists were met by Muhsin Reza'i, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. There was only one item on the agenda: a plan by Iran to fund and arm a new "terrorist international" in exchange for the launching of attacks against western targets. The aim was to cause unprecedented devastation in western European capitals with coordinated bombings and assassinations. According to senior intelligence officials, Iran hoped to fuel revolution in Europe and make it pay a heavy price for supporting American policies in the Middle East. The meeting, the biggest terrorist gathering since the early 1970s, was closely monitored by western intelligence. Immediately afterwards agencies across Europe and the United States began a counter-terrorist drive to track the Iranian diplomats known terrorists and their contacts in Europe. The biggest undercover operation since the Gulf war, it involved satellite surveillance, intercepting telephone calls and widespread bugging. British security services were especially concerned that the Iranians pledged to supply the IRA with sophisticated weapons as well as millions of pounds. The republicans had been searching for a supply of modern detonators and ground-to-air missiles to complement their stockpile of small arms, ammunition and explosives. The IRA presence in Tehran came as no surprise to British intelligence, which had watched links developing between Tehran and Irish republicans for more than a decade. The contacts began in 1981 when an Iranian diplomat went to Belfast to attend the funeral of Bobby Sands, the first hungerstriker. He was soon followed by Hojatoleslam Hadi Ghaffari, an Iranian cleric nicknamed the "machine-gun mullah" after killing up to 60 pro-Shah officials. Although Ghaffari antagonised Sinn Fein by refusing to pay for drinks at a lunch he hosted, the republicans found the cleric sympathetic. In 1980, he told a rally in Tehran that "we are ready to blow up British factories and ships. Now is the time for the death of Thatcher." Over the next six years the two sides developed their friendship. A Sinn Fein delegation attended the Conference of World Movements in Tehran in June 1982, while Iran sent a delegation to Sinn Fein's annual Dublin conference for three years running. The relationship however, was largely political as the IRA was receiving arms and weapons from Libya. Then in December 1987, Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing flew to Tehran as the guest of the Iranian government. Exactly what was discussed is not known, but soon afterwards the first clandestine contacts between the terrorists and Tehran began. Over the next six years, both M16 and M15 tracked IRA terrorists to secret meetings in Paris, Bonn and The Hague. Each took place with accredited Iranian diplomats, most of whom were attached to the Ministry of Information (MOI) in Tehran, a cover for Iranian intelligence. Apart from Ghaffari, three key Iranians have been identified by British intelligence. They are Ali Reza Hakkikian chief MOI representative in Bonn until 1993; Vahid Attarian, his replacement in Bonn believed to coordinate operations of Iranian spies across Europe; and Amir Eravani, responsible for liaison between the MOI and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. To begin with, British intelligence was content to monitor the relationship. It wanted to track the IRA offficers responsible for negotiating arms and cash abroad and to unravel the intelligence network run by the Iranians. The tone of the operation changed when Jurgen Merx and Tunza-Anet, his wife, were arrested in Athens last year for smuggling huge quantities of heroin to Britain. The drugs were thought to have been supplied by Iranian intelligence, perhaps to generate funds for the IRA. At the same time, there was intelligence that cash from Iran might already have reached Belfast and that a big arms shipment was being planned. Then came the terrorist summit last November. It was no longer simply a British effort to control the IRA, but an international attempt to foil a threat to the security of several western European countries. The French government launched raids against Muslim extremists and members of the Kurdish Workers' party. Germany, Spain, Sweden and Italy have also moved against groups suspected of having contacts with the Iranians. For Britain, the problem was more difficult. Although many IRA terrorists are well known to the security forces and those directly involved with the Iranians had been tracked, there was not enough evidence to bring anyone to trial. Instead, it was decided to confront the Iranians directly in the hope that publicity would force the IRA to break off contacts. So, on Thursday, Douglas Hogg, the Foreign Office minister, summoned Gholamreza Ansari, the Iranian charge d'affaires, for a confrontation about his government's contacts with the IRA. The Iranian denied the links, claiming there was "no shred of evidence to support these astonishing claims." Security sources said this weekend it was too early to determine if the move has worked. The Iranian government has a long history of defiance and few doubt that the IRA will try to continue to tap the deep pockets and wellstocked armouries of Tehran.
