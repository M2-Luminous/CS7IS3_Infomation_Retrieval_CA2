French General Andre Soubirou, UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander for the Sarajevo sector, then went to the Lukavica barracks, the Serbs' main military base southwest of Sarajevo, where he briefly met with the local sector commander. The UNPROFOR-supervised meeting was to have studied implementing the ceasefire and trying to establish a number of sites where heavy artillery of both sides could be placed under UN control in line with a NATO ultimatum aimed at ending the siege of Sarajevo. Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic warned on Wednesday that the Moslem-majority Bosnian army did not intend to attend Thursday's meeting, saying it had met all its obligations and that the negotiations only concerned the Serb side. In his meeting at the Lukavica barracks, Soubirou asked the Serbs to agree to 50 heavy pieces of artillery they had handed in being guarded by armed UN forces. A Serb officer at the barracks, who asked not to be named, told AFP "armed guards are not needed here," but that "negotiations are still going on." No UN forces were in sight within the compound on Thursday morning. UNPROFOR warned the Serbs on Wednesday that all heavy weapons withdrawn in line with the NATO ultimatum would have to be put under armed UN guard before midnight on Sunday if they wanted to comply with the terms of the ultimatum and avoid air attacks. In Naples, the commander of the southern NATO zone Admiral Jeremy Boorda told journalists that the warring parties in Sarajevo had a long way to go to comply with the NATO ultimatum. "We are seeing some evidence of weapons being turned in, but we are a long way away from complete compliance," he said. However, he said "progress in the right direction is encouraging," although he emphasised, "We need real compliance by the deadline."
