According to Jerzy Chmielewski, of the MSZ European Department, the current situation, which has arisen after the expiry of the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, should be used to consolidate the ceasefire and resume peace talks between the parties involved. Chmielewski's opinion is that as a transition stage, new areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina could be incorporated into the security zones.
