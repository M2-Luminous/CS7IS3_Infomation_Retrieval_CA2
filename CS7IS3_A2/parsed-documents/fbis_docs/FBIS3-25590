"If it means going to war to keep what is mine, then we'll go to war." The prominent rightwinger, who is also the officer commanding of the Northern Natal Boerekommando said in an interview in Newcastle on Tuesday: "It's no secret that we're training them... We have trained them offensively". Newcastle ANC leader Mandla Cele said he was aware of training sites in the district and had requested the Transitional Executive Council to act against them. Mr Veenendal, who described himself as the Orde Boerevolk's chief of staff, would not reveal the camps' whereabouts or details, and refused reporters access to them. "We can not rule out the possibility of war. We're preparing for war," he said at a rightwing rally in Newcastle on Tuesday. Earlier, he marched into the local ANC offices and delivered to a surprised Mr Cele a declaration claiming "the area of northern Natal as a volkstaat". "You are the aggressors," he charged, before marching out of the office, dressed in a brown military uniform and armed with a pistol. His declaration said northern Natal had been acquired by the Boere nation through "honest hard work" and through negotiations with the Zulu nation. Anyone who attempted to deny the Boere nation this right would be regarded as an aggressor and would be met with the necessary reaction. Questioned later on the volkstaat's boundaries, Mr Veenendal said: "From here to Richards Bay." "Anything that differs with the Zulu nation, we'll take up with the king." He said the Boere nation had always had an amicable relationship with Zulu people, hence his involvement in training them. Mention of ANC support among Zulus was met with rejection from Mr Veenendal: "The ANC is not a factor. The ANC cannot make a claim, where is their support?" "Their support is through intimidation and the build-up of arms caches." He claimed Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] members and commanders had been "sent here from outside" for the "onslaught". On concessions regarding the demand for a volkstaat, Mr Veenendal said: "I don't need the ANC's concessions, it's my volkstaat." On elections, Mr Veenendal said a mood of defiance was growing in the district and "I don't see them (a newly elected government) governing". "It's one thing being a government and another thing governing," he said without elaborating.
