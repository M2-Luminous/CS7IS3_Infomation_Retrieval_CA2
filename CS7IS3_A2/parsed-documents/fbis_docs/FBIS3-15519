The program contains an interview with Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov by Ostankino Television correspondent Farid Seyful-Mulyukov. The interview was recorded after President Karimov had concluded his official visit to Moscow and is on the results of his visit, his talks with President Yeltsin, and the general situation in the CIS. President Karimov begins by saying: "I am satisfied with the results of the talks and conversations we had with President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, members of the government, statesmen, and public representatives." He continues: "I would like to draw the main conclusion on the results of my visit: Relations between Russia and Uzbekistan are entering an entirely new stage and are reaching an entirely new level. I would like to stress again that in some way it is a prototype of the relations Russia intends to have with the countries within the CIS and, thus, to give an entirely new impetus to the content of the Commonwealth in general. "In this regard, the interests of both Russia and Uzbekistan coincide. We do not imagine our future without Russia. I state this authoritatively. I am convinced that Russia's interests in Central and Middle Asia and Uzbekistan coincide with the policy we pursue, and I am convinced that Russia is interested in having Uzbekistan as its reliable long-term partner and ally in the Central Asian region." Karimov says that Russia is a great superpower, and as such, Russia has interests beyond its territory. In his opinion, Russia -- like any other superpower -- should protect its interests and state them loud and clear. He stresses that here "the main point is that there should be no imperial ambitions on the part of Russia, and that Russia's interests should coincide with the interests of the countries and states, which have become sovereign and independent today." He continues: "Then the foundation is laid for normal, equal, and mutually advantageous long-term reliable relations between these states." Karimov reiterates that Uzbekistan is interested in having such a reliable partner as Russia, and stresses that Russia should be a guarantor of stability and peace in the Central Asian region. To a question about the exacerbated situation on the Tajik-Afghan border and measures to stabilize it, Karimov says: "The border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan is not merely a border between these two states, it is the CIS border; it is the border of Russia, Uzbekistan, and all other states in this region," and everyone is interested in peace and stability in Tajikistan. "There are no effectual borders between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and everything taking place in Tajikistan today will affect Uzbekistan tomorrow without fail," President Karimov stresses. He adds that the states that are parties to the treaty on collective security have clearly stated that their interests in the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan are unshakeable, "and we will do everything possible to protect these borders as our own." Touching on the issue of reforms, Karimov explains that the purpose of reforms in Uzbekistan coincides with the purpose of reforms in Russia. Uzbekistan is in favour of a market economy. He stresses that both Russia and Uzbekistan are countries of the east and have specific features which have to be taken into account. These features are connected to their historic past, national peculiarities, and to the mentality of the people. He warns that "Russia is no Poland, or any republic where any experiments can be performed," and stresses that people should come first, because reforms are not implemented for reforms' sake, but for the sake of the people. On the prospects for the Commonwealth, Karimov says that political independence and sovereignty are not economic notions. In his opinion, political independence should be based on economic categories. "Our first principle is the priority of the economy over politics and a complete removal of ideology from the economy. Having built the economic basis of our society, we can speak about sovereignty and independence," Karimov states. He says that the Commonwealth is what was needed after the disintegration of the Union. "If there had not been a Commonwealth, we would have probably had a scenario similar to the Yugoslav one on the territory of the former Union. I have grounds for saying this. In this respect, during this time the Commonwealth has undergone certain changes and transformations. Today all the member states of the Commonwealth realize that our future lies in a closer knit Commonwealth, and we should give this Commonwealth specific forms and a specific face. The Commonwealth should work toward common goals as well as toward the interests of every state that joins this Commonwealth." Karimov says that today the Commonwealth has new goals and that everyone is convinced that "we should see our future in strengthening the Commonwealth. Russia is interested in us, and, of course, we see that our future lies together with Russia. What we signed today and yesterday is evidently the prototype of what Russia will have with all the CIS states, and this will ensure that our relations with Russia are equal, mutually advantageous, long-term, and most reliable in terms of partnership," President Karimov concludes.
