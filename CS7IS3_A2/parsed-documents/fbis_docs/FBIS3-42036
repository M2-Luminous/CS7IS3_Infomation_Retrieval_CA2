According to him, there have been no purchases of nuclear fuel since the middle of 1993 due to a lack of funds. In 1993, the volume of nuclear fuel purchases decreased twofold, as compared to 1990. The same reasons hampered the dumping of nuclear fuel residue. Kotko points out that the National Control Center of the Ukrainian Ministry of Power, the committee's primary and only consumer irregularly pays for received nuclear electric power. The ministry owes nuclear power stations some 550 billion karbovanetses. Kotko underlines that the sector has exhausted its resources and if the situation remains unchanged uncontrolled processes will begin. If fuel is not bought the industry will be unable to function.
