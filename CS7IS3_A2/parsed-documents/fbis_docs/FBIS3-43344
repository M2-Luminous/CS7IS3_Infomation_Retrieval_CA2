At a Cape Town news conference today PAC negotiator Patricia de Lille said the organization has consistently condemned all acts of violence and is busy negotiating a comprehensive mutual cessation of hostilities with the government. She says the PAC's armed wing, APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army], has declared a moratorium on its armed struggle while talks on ending hostilities are underway. De Lille says follow-up discussions between the PAC and the government, and APLA and the SADF [South African Defense Force], are to be held within the next two weeks. The PAC also strongly condemned the detention of two of its senior officials in connection with the Heidelberg attack. Michael Siyolo and Theo Mabusela were detained yesterday for questioning. Both men are being held under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act.
