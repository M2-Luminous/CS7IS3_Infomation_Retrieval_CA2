Cheng An-kuo, director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Department under Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said the review was necessary due to the rapid development of cross-strait relations in recent years and it was part of the ruling Kuomintang's "one China" strategy. A pressing issue is the renewal of the aviation treaty between Taiwan and Hong Kong in the post-1997 era because the existing agreement expires next year. According to Mr. Cheng, negotiations were already underway between Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Taiwan's national carrier, China Airlines. While Cathay Pacific wanted to perpetuate its present monopoly of the Hong Kong-Taipei air route China Airlines preferred to open the business to competition, Mr. Cheng said. The official believed the problem could be solved through further negotiations between the two companies and there was no need to raise the topics in political discussions between Taiwan and the mainland. Mr. Cheng said as 1997 neared, Taiwan would seek qualitative change in the bilateral relations instead of expanding its bureaucracy in Hong Kong. For example, Taipei used to measure the effectiveness of its Hong Kong policies by tallying the numbers of Hong Kong compatriots attending the island's National Day celebrations. "Our mutual understanding has become the new yardstick," he said. "We would like to improve Taiwan's image in Hong Kong through our new policies. To do that, we will evaluate our performance by monitoring the Hong Kong media," he said. At the same time, Mr. Cheng's office will strengthen its links with Hong Kong media. Mr. Cheng confirmed that Taipei had decided that Taiwan government offices in Hong Kong would come under the authority of the MAC after 1997. The subject was likely to be raised in future discussions between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait. However, pressure from Beijing and political changes in Taiwan were likely to prevent Taipei from maintaining an effective and influential presence in Hong Kong after 1997. Mr. Cheng said the Government had no choice but to keep a low profile in it activities in Hong Kong due to strong pressure from Beijing. "In order to be able to continue to function in Hong Kong after 1997, we have to adopt the strategy of `work hard, talk less' because we don't want to upset the Chinese Communists," Mr. Cheng said.
