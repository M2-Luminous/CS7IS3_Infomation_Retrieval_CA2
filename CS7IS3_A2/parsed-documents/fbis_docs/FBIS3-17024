Perry told reporters that the U.S. would give Ukraine an additional $50 Mn to dismantle nuclear missiles. Last December, the U.S. extended to Ukraine $135 Mn for this purpose. Perry said that American-Ukrainian cooperation was of great strategic significance and that interaction between the two countries' military agencies was important too. He also announced that an agreement had been reached in Kiev on frequent and close contacts between the Ukrainian and American general staffs. Radetskyy said that with U.S. assistance Ukraine had got out of the nuclear deadlock and signed the Moscow tripartite statement, which was an event of historic significance. He also pointed out that now nothing hampered Ukraine's joining the nonproliferation treaty. According to Interfax-Ukraine, during Perry's visit to Ukraine a number of documents will be signed on the granting of about $100 Mn to Ukraine.
