Kubilius said the LSDP statement, urging other political forces to back their initiative, lacks forecasts. "It is not hard to collect 28 votes that are necessary to start the no confidence process, but 71 votes are needed to express no confidence." This means that the no confidence vote would have to be supported by some members of the ruling majority, the lawmaker said. Kubilius did not deny reports, however, that several members of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party would back to move in secret voting. In his opinion, the rightist opposition, the social democrats and those several members of the LDLP may become "a new parliamentary majority, which will be able to form a new government." The lawmaker said the social democrats do not forecast possible steps of the president -- will he make the government resign or will he dissolve the parliament. Kubilius said he has serious doubts about the indicated motives of the initiative. "I think that the accusations against the present government should be much more serious than non-fulfillment of the LSDP's instructions."
