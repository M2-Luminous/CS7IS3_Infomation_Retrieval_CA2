FBIS4-51912 "dreas086_d_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-086 Daily Report 2 May 1994 South Korea Prosecution Questions Officers on 12 Dec Incident Prosecution Questions Officers on 12 Dec Incident SK0205085694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0748 GMT 2 May 94 SK0205085694 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Report by Hwang To-hyong] [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- Independent lawmaker Chong Tong-ho, former chief presidential bodyguard under the Choe Kyu-ha government, will be summoned Tuesday for questioning on his alleged involvement in the "Dec. 12 coup d'etat-like incident," the prosecution said Monday. The incident refers to the controversial apprehension of then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Chong Sung-hwa by a group of military officers seeking to interrogate him in connection with the assassination of former president Pak Chong-hui in 1979. Chong Sung-hwa and his followers have filed suits with the prosecution against former President Chon Tu-hwan, who was then chief of the Defense Security Command (DSC) in charge of investigating Pak's assassination case, and Chon's men, accusing them of staging a rebellion to grab power after former president Pak's assassination. Lawmaker Chong, one of Chon Tu-hwan's men who was the acting chief presidential bodyguard, will be questioned on his role in isolating president Choe by replacing guards at the prime minister's residence with presidential security guards under his control, the prosecution said. At the time Choe still resided at the prime minister's residence, although he had assumed the presidency just after president Pak's death. The prosecution has thus far interrogated 15 of the 38 people accused of rebellion by former Army Chief of Staff Chong and other victims of the Dec. 12 incident. Those already questioned include Ho Sam-su, who was then the DSC's personnel affairs bureau chief, Song Hwan-ok, then Army colonel at the military police unit of the Army headquarters, Pak Hui-mo, commander of the 30th division, and Pak Chong-kyu, a battalion commander of the third airborne brigade who actually mobilized troops to seize Chong Pyong-chu, then commander of the special warfare forces, in a bloody battle with Chong's forces who strongly resisted the apprehension of the Army chief of staff. The prosecution's probe of the case has entered a second phase with former chief presidential bodyguard Chong Tong-ho being the first high-level official to be questioned in connection with the incident. The prosecution said it would call in more than 10 high-level officials and military officers involved in the case during May. Among those to be summoned are Ko Myong-sung, who was then a senior presidential security guard, Ho Hwa-pyong, then chief secretary to DSC Chief Chon Tu-hwan, and Yi Hak-pong, then senior official of the DSC's investigation department. Also to be called in by the prosecution will be the then-commanders of the first and third airborne brigades, Pak Hui-to and Choe Se-chang, who mobilized their airborne troops to counter Chang Tae-wan, then commander of the capital garrison command, who fought against the forces of the DSC's Chon Tu-hwan to keep Chon from seizing then-Army Chief of Staff Chong Sung-hwa. The prosecution also plans to decide by June whether to interrogate three former presidents involved in the incident including Choe Kyu-ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, according to prosecution sources. The prosecution said it will focus on whether the apprehension of Chong Sung-hwa constituted a rebellion under the military criminal code. Chong and other victims of the Dec. 12 incident claim that then-DSC Chief Chon Tu-hwan and his followers violated the military criminal code by seizing Chong in an apparent effort to grab power in the vacuum created by Pak Chong-hui's death. Chon's side, meanwhile, insists that the apprehension took place in due course of investigating the incident and that they had no intention of taking power by seizing Chong.
