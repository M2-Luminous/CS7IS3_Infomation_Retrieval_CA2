FBIS4-21256 "jptdd018___94014" JPRS-TDD-94-018-L JPRS Narcotics 8 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA BOLIVIA Deputy Says DEA `Will Have Problems' If It Exceeded Duties Deputy Says DEA `Will Have Problems' If It Exceeded Duties PY2004001794 La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 8 Apr 94 Political Section p A2 PY2004001794 La Paz LA RAZON Spanish BFN [Text] The DEA "will have problems" with the Chamber of Deputies Constitution Committee if it is established that it exceeded it diplomatic duties and its role in the investigations into the alleged link between the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] and drug trafficking. This was stated by an MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] deputy and member of the Constitution Committee, Juan del Granado, who said there are rules between Bolivia and the United States regarding the DEA's duties in Bolivia. According to bilateral agreements between the U.S. Embassy and the Bolivian Foreign Ministry, DEA agents are banned from carrying weapons, participating in antinarcotic operations, and arresting and interrogating individuals on Bolivian territory. Investigations into the alleged links of some MIR leaders to drug trafficking reveal that some DEA agents exceeded their duties by institutionally conducting the investigations and influencing the report on FELCN [Special Antinarcotics Force]'s conclusions. Del Granado stated that there is strong evidence the DEA was directly involved in the subject by carrying out duties and roles not mentioned in the bilateral agreements between the two countries. He added that an attempt will be made to establish the obvious deceitful, abusive, and prepotent behavior of DEA agents in our country.
