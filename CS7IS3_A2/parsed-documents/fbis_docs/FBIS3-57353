The new body will also draft bills for parliament to debate and advise the executive branch, he told the KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper. He said that migration such as that taking place in the country was inevitable when empires collapse. In the president's words, over 200,000 Russians and still more Germans had left Kazakhstan last year. He described their departure as "a significant loss." During the same period nearly 160,000 Russians, some of them from Russia, settled in the country. Nazarbayev emphasized that he had decreed a simplification of the citizenship acquisition procedure for those who have close relatives in the country. He said that dual citizenship was an issue "imposed from outside the country" and that such citizenship was not provided for by the Constitution of Kazakhstan or Russia. If every other Kazakh resident is also a citizen of another state, the Kazakh society may be split into natives and aliens, chaos and mistrust can be created, the Kazakh leader thinks. Nazarbayev called for creating conditions within the Commonwealth for free movement and communication so that when one moves to Russia, he or she obtains its citizenship freely and, on return to Kazakhstan, that country's citizenship. He called for working out "an agreed document allowing one to live where one wants (in the CIS), whatever the citizenship." Nazarbayev said he pinned great hopes on the new parliament to be elected on March 7. He wants to work with parliament on amending the Fundamental Law and emphasized the need to specify in the Constitution that the country was a presidential republic, increase the powers of the executive branch and introduce a bicameral parliament consisting of a senate and a house of deputies. In Nazarbayev's view, parliament must have the right to discontinue the president's powers before his term expires and the president, to dissolve parliament. The president also said in the interview that "it was time that we took a wider view of land rights" and called for appointing judges for life and for removal of obstacles to entrepreneurial activities in every sphere.
