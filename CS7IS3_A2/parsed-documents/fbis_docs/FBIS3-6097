On 11 January [1994], speaker of the House of Representatives Takako Doi, who made a guest speech at the 60th Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] Convention at the Kudan Kaikan Building in Tokyo, closed her message by quoting from a poem by Robert Frost. The frame of mind of Speaker Doi, who occupies the honored position as the first woman speaker in Japan's parliamentary history to head the highest organ of state authority, is not clear when she quoted Frost's poem to the SDPJ members. Although she was given the important role of lower house speaker because the SDPJ had become the largest party in the Hosokawa coalition government, her own party--the SDPJ--has continued strife that has split the party every time it faced a crucial political issue. Judging from the confusing circumstances of choosing between support for the coalition administration or withdrawing from it, she sounds as if she was strongly encouraging it to fulfill its mission as a responsible party. Also, depending on how it is interpreted, there is a prominent theory that Ms Doi, who has powerful clout within the SDPJ as the leader of the pro-Constitution group, was conveniently promoted as speaker of the lower house where she would be unable to speak out on party management, whereas various hindrances would occur concerning coalition operations if she were to remain within the SDPJ. It is possible to interpret that Ms Doi, who was aware of such circumstances, hinted that she was prepared to relinquish her seat as speaker and take action as a savior to rescue the pro-Constitution group from its straits. However, perhaps not a few members of both the right-wing and left-wing representatives who filled the convention hall heard her message as asking how long will it take for the SDPJ to disintegrate in view of the split in the party?" The purpose of the convention, which was held amid a maelstrom and was a major turning point in the upper house deliberations on political reform-related bill as the focal point in the extraordinary Diet session, was to reach a decision on the 1994 campaign direction proposal. However, because passage of the bill depended on the response from the SDPJ, the principal aim of the Executive Division was to reconcentrate the party's will and strengthen solidarity toward passing the bill to support the Hosokawa coalition administration. The slogan, "Let us cultivate a new future of the SDPJ for the coalition government and political reform," posted in front of the convention hall vividly illustrates the enthusiasm of the Executive Division. Moves in Anticipation of a Split. However, the expectation and speculation of the Executive Division failed completely. Under the situation of a fierce confrontation within the party between the right wing that advocates maintenance of the coalition administration by passing the bill and the left wing that stresses independence of the party above the coalition administration, it was not possible to seek a union of will concerning the bill. It is impossible to expect an agreement in debates between the right wing, which supports the coalition, aggressively responds to political restructuring by introducing the single-seat constituencies with proportional representation system as the core of political reform, and seeks to rise both in form and substance to a "ruling party" and the left wing, which opposes introduction of a "proportional representation system" as leading to the destruction of the SDPJ as a "pro-Constitution party." Sure enough, it merely turned into a scenario of mutual criticism and condemnation, and the debate ended with the party on the verge of dissolution. It only amplified mutual distrust and hate and portrayed the party that was actually heading toward rupture. Already preparatory moves are seen within the party with "spliting" in mind. The moves can be roughly separated into four groups: "Democrats," "New Policy Discussion Group," "Liberal Group" and "Group To Promote True Political Reform." The "Democrats," formed by some 40 Diet members of the faction which promotes political restructuring and supports the coalition government, anticipated the introduction of a "proportional representation system" and aimed at the marshaling of "social democratic/liberal forces including Sakigake [Harbinger], the Japan New Party and a portion of the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]." It has in mind the formation of a new party by recruiting Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi as its new leader. It is the largest right-wing group with former party General Secretary Hirotaka Akamatsu as chief of the secretariat supporting General Secretary Wataru Kubo. However, Chairman Akira Yamagishi of Rengo [National Confederation of Trade Unions] waits in the wings and cannot be ignored, inasmuch as he will be the nucleus of a second phase in political restructuring. The "New Policy Discussion Group," with 30 Dietmen including lower house member Aogu Matsumae as chairman and Director Masao Sakon of the lower house Ad Hoc Committee on Political Reform as members, is more aggressive than the "Democrats" concerning political restructuring and is therefore more splinter-bent. An approach to and union with a group headed by lower house member Masayasu Kitagawa that is showing strong signs of splitting within the LDP is frequently rumored. The "New Policy Discussion Society" is a militant group that indicates a strong possibility of becoming the vanguard of splintering within the SDPJ. In opposition to the right-wing groups, more than a dozen Dietmen of the left wing centering on upper house Diet member Hideo Den of the United Social Democratic Party and led by upper house member Masao Kunihiro formed the "Liberal Group," which is actively against the "proportional representation system." It is cooperating with the "national network to revitalize the pro-Constitution SDPJ" and is expected to form a new pro-Constitution party in the future. The left-wing "Group To Promote True Political Reform," which supports Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and consists of about 30 lower house Dietmen of the neutral faction, was originally opposed to the "proportional representation system." The group emphasizes independence and had established rapport with "Liberal Group." However, Chairman Murayama has been forced to adopt the position of promoting political reform and maintaining the coalition administration, and the situation within the group is complex and deeply troubled. Defensive Evolvement Meanwhile, each of the four groups is moving in its separate way publicly and privately amid rife speculation. What they have in common is the fact that no one has the slightest idea as to how the political situation will evolve in the future and what will happen to them when they plunge headlong into the new political phase that is sure to come. Even the right-wing groups, although they announce solidarity of the "social democrats and liberals," require an adversary to justify it. Unless the Sakigake, Japan New Party, and the LDP liberals act in unison, their "solidarity" would have no practical purpose, and it would become a monodrama. How effective can cooperation in the elections be? It is the same in the case of the left-wing group. How many seats can be garnered by reuniting the pro-Constitution forces in a "proportional representation system" election? If only several seats can be anticipated in the proportional representation districts, the raison d'etre of the group itself would be questioned. As this article is being written, the fate of the political reform-related bill is unclear. However, if it is passed, the impact of introducing the "proportional representation system" will unmistakably hasten the dismantling of the SDPJ. What follows political reform is the issue of a hike in the consumption tax rate that will inevitably result in a major debate within the party. "The woods dark and deep" lie ahead of the SDPJ. How many miles to go before one sleeps?
