UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman said there were reports that Bosnian Serb forces had attacked near the town of Vrbovik in the northwest part of the exclusion zone. The report was confirmed by UN military observers and Canadian reconnaissance troops. The mainly Moslem Bosnian Army said Serbs had fired artillery from within the exclusion zone. Aikman said it was possible the artillery fire had come from outside the zone and that UN troops were investigating this. Aikman said the NATO-mandated artillery withdrawal from in and around Sarajevo and a ceasefire in effect since February 9 were being generally observed although there were minor violations.
