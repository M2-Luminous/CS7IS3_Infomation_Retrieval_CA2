The fighting is going on both on the right bank of the River Drina and on the Ustipraca side of town. This was the first information we received from Esad Ohranovic, the president of the Gorazde district executive council, who answered questions by domestic and foreign journalists through the radio-bridge with Gorazde this evening. Mr. Ohranovic goes on to say: [Ohranovic] ``The part of town on the right bank is being shelled particularly heavily. This is where the hospital and refugee accommodation are located. What we know now is that 26 have been killed and 71 wounded during the day, I mean between 0800 and now. The figures are not final. ``The hospital has been hit by at least 10 shells. All personnel and the wounded are in the cellars -- so the wounded are being treated in poor conditions. The situation is extremely alarming, particularly at the hospital.'' [Announcer] Have the defense lines been moved, and where are the Chetnik tanks now -- this was the next question Mr. Ohranovic was asked. [Ohranovic] ``The defense lines have not been moved today. The town is being shelled from tanks, howitzers, and mortars, and this from all three directions. Some residential buildings and the hospital are being targeted from three directions. It is extremely difficult. One cannot see this part of town, on the right bank, for the smoke and fire. The education center, the department store, and three blocks of residential buildings are now burning. ``From where I am now we can see three tanks, at a distance of about 1,500 meters. I am now in the part of town closer to Cajnice [southern part]. Earlier today I spoke from the area closer to Ustipraca [north east]. The situation there is unchanged.'' [Announcer] How far are the Chetnik tanks from the hospital? [Ohranovic] "About 1,000 meters." [Announcer] And the aggressor's soldiers? [Ohranovic] "Between 200 and 300 meters." [Announcer] The Serb-Montenegrin aggressor also launched infantry attacks today? [Ohranovic] "Four infantry attacks were launched during the day. They were mainly repulsed." [Announcer] The residents of Gorazde and the refugees are under constant artillery and sniper fire, with no roof above their heads. [Ohranovic] ``A lot of people, in particular on the left bank, have nowhere to go. Fifteen minutes ago I was at the UN offices. They are having problems now, because the people are trying to squeeze into their buildings, looking for protection. Believe me, that is a big problem. ``Houses that have been burned down are full of people. The street is like a cauldron. The situation is extremely difficult, caused by the withdrawal of people before the attack.'' [Announcer] Water and electricity? [Ohranovic] "The last convoy arrived in Gorazde on 22 March. All Gorazde water wells are on the right bank, where the shelling is the heaviest. You can imagine what the situation is like. The people on the streets have fled their houses, carrying perhaps an armful of supplies." [Announcer] How many foreigners are there in Gorazde? [Ohranovic] ``There are four members of the UN team, two UNHCR officers, two members of the Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF], and two members of the International Red Cross [IRC] team. They are still here, but have announced their departure. ``The IRC center was shelled several times today. Four people were wounded.'' [Announcer] Enemy propaganda tried to launch another lie today, that two MSF members had been arrested. [Ohranovic] "This is a lie. I had some coffee with these people some 15 minutes ago. It is very unfortunate for us that the only anesthetist in Gorazde has been seriously injured and cannot work. He was wounded at work, has been pulled out of the hospital and is currently with the UN team. Our hospital does not have an anesthetist at all, people who have no previous experience are doing his work." [Announcer] Are the Chetniks withdrawing? [Ohranovic] "Not for the time being. What they are saying -- that they have withdrawn -- is a downright lie."
