On the eve of ROK President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China, this reporter visited a number of institutions, enterprises, and schools in the ROK, and found that pleasant spring winds of expanding exchanges and cooperation with China are everywhere. This can be seen in a string of convincing figures: China has become the largest external destination for ROK investment, and ROK investment in China accounted for 58.6 percent of its total overseas investment in 1993. The number of ROK investment projects in China last year reached 616, exceeding the total of the previous five years. At present, China has become the ROK's third largest trading partner. Since China and the ROK established diplomatic relations in 1992, bilateral economic and trade relations have developed rapidly. According to the latest statistics of the ROK Trade Association, the total volume of trade last year reached $9.08 billion and increased by 42.3 percent. Along with the increase in trade, the ROK has also been increasing its investment in China year after year. Although there is a good foundation for PRC-ROK economic cooperation, and such cooperation has developed to a considerable scale, there remains a huge untapped potential for the further expansion of trade and of economic and technical cooperation. This is the consensus of the people in business circles. We can see the following characteristics in the development of ROK-Chinese trade and economic cooperation: First, there is a high growth rate. According to ROK customs statistics, the volume of bilateral trade increased by an average annual rate of over 50 percent between 1988 and 1993. Second, indirect trade has been replaced by direct trade. In the past, entrepot trade between the two countries accounted for over 70 percent of their total trade volume, but the proportion of indirect trade declined to 20 percent in 1992, and further fell to a lower level last year. Third, economic cooperation between the two countries has begun to develop in the capital-intensive, technology-intensive, and resource- developing patterns. Various ROK conglomerates have been carrying out their cooperation plans with China in key industries. After the Daeu Enterprise Group of the ROK invested approximately $300 million in China's Shandong to build a modern cement factory, other leading ROK enterprises, such as Samsong, Hyontae, Daeu, Sangkyong, Ssangyong, and Nakhui Kimsong, have all been seeking opportunities to expand cooperation with China in the car-making, electronics, space, passenger aircraft, and telecommunications industries with the support of the ROK Government. Along with the rapid development of Sino-ROK economic and trade relations, a new "Chinese language craze" is rising in the ROK. This reporter saw that not only large enterprises, but also a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises had set up China affairs offices, and people who know the Chinese language are being urgently employed by various institutions, organizations, and enterprises. This year, there was a tide of "recovering Chinese characters" in the Korean language. The government leaders explicitly pointed out that the past practice of eliminating Chinese characters from the Korean language was wrong and went against the trend of the times. ROK newspapers are now frequently using special columns to popularize knowledge about Chinese characters and advocate the need to master Chinese characters in order to open up the country and bring it into the international community. Designers have created rotating Chinese character tables on pencil boxes for primary school students to enable the children to learn more Chinese characters at any time. Recently, when schools enrolled new students, they required students to write their names in Chinese characters. Computer companies have also began to develop Chinese-character software. Seoul is planning to erect Chinese-character signposts for all streets. China and the ROK are two neighboring countries which are separated only by a strip of water. The two countries have a time- honored historical tradition of economic and cultural exchanges. Their mutually complementary economic structures, the two peoples' strong desire for increasing exchanges, as well as the needs in the interests of the two countries form the precondition and foundation for the development of their friendly cooperative relationship. The changes in the post-cold-war international situation and in the ROK's domestic situation and the vigorous development of the Chinese economy have also provided a new opportunity for the development of Sino-ROK relations. ROK political circles have generally held that the meeting between President Jiang Zemin and President Kim Yong-sam during the informal APEC summit meeting in Seattle last November was an important event in the development of ROK-PRC relations. Since China and the ROK established diplomatic relations in August 1992, Chinese leaders Qian Qichen, Li Lanqing, Tian Jiyun and ROK National Assembly Speaker Yi Man-sop and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu have exchanged visits, and this has played an important role in helping the ROK renew its understanding of China. As the economy in the Asia-Pacific region is maintaining its momentum of rapid growth, the new China craze in the ROK is obviously not related to short-term economic interests. The ROK looks forward to closer cooperation with China so that they may jointly make contributions to the prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.
