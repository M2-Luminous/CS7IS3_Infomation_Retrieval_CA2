Al-Hariri was on a visit to the Arab Press House and was joined there by Lebanese journalists working for AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, AL-MAJALLAH, and SAYYIDATI. As the guest of the [Arab Press] House, he met there with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Chief Editor 'Uthman al-'Umayr, AL-MAJALLAH Chief Editor 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Rashid, SAYYIDATI Chief Editor Matar al-Ahmadi, and the company's General Manager Yasir al-Dabbagh. They then moved to the conference table where Prime Minister al-Hariri discussed details of Lebanon's internal and external situations. Al-Hariri said: Lebanon is a friend of all the Arab states including those who supported it and those who did not, but there can be no doubt that the position of some states is distinguishable from other Arab states in that they fulfilled their commitments and were clearer in what they said. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under the leadership of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz spares no effort in supporting Lebanon and its causes and has fully honored its commitments, and so have Kuwait and Syria, which sent assistance at the time of the Israeli attempt to hit southern Lebanon. Al-Hariri expressed the view that the aim of the Israeli aggressions against Lebanon last July was to show that Israel would never allow any reconstruction in Lebanon and would not allow the government to begin the reconstruction process unless it concludes a peace agreement with Israel, but in practical terms the aggression achieved none of its objectives. He added: "True, it caused death and destruction but it achieved no political results because the people who had left their cities and villages in the south for a week have returned, thanks to the aid we received and the measures taken by the Lebanese state. There was one big united national workshop." Asked if there is a chance that the company which undertook the reconstruction of the commercial center in Beirut (Solidaire) could operate nationwide in Lebanon after its success in Beirut, he replied: The law creating Solidaire was introduced for all Lebanon not just Beirut. It is a general law for the entire country and therefore there is nothing to prevent its being applied to other parts of Beirut and its suburbs and also to Jabal Lubnan and Tripoli but, as a government, we wanted to give the experiment in central Beirut its full range until it becomes a proven ssuccess, and it has been successful so far. The public want to see the achievements on the ground. I expect work to begin next summer opening the way for discussion of the possibility of implementing the Solidaire experiment in other areas. Asked about the Lebanese currency improvement and whether that was based on confidence in the person of Prime Minister al-Hariri or other internal factors supporting the Lebanese pound, he replied: "It is difficult to pass judgment by saying that the matter was linked to the prime minister or to objective reasons because the currency issue has to do with confidence in the country. I should not be talking about this because it would be like someone talking about himself." Did he sense in his talks with the British officials that European confidence in Lebanon has returned? He replied: "Actually, I rarely visit Britain but the impression I had before making this visit, which I was invited to make, was that British officials were interested in the Lebanese situation but what surprised me was the magnitude of that interest in Lebanon and their willingness to contribute. They seemed to me to be very serious and that, I believe, will have an effect on us. Britain is a large state and such interest on its part in Lebanon reflects Lebanon's worth." He revealed that Lebanon received two offers from two major British companies to contribute to the work on and financing of Lebanon's electricity network restructuring. He said that Britain is willing to help in the armament of the Lebanese Army and Internal Security Forces. He said: "We are talking not about building an army that wages war but about strengthening the Army and the Internal Security Forces so that they can discharge their security duties of maintaining general order." Touching on domestic issues, al-Hariri said that the naturalization file has not been closed and is not linked to the question of Palestinian resettlement. He emphasized that the Lebanese citizenship law needs amending and that the government is serious about introducing the necessary amendments to enable the resolution of urgent cases. On the administrative purge, he said that that is an ongoing process that did not end with the dismissal of some employees. Prime Minister al-Hariri reaffirmed Lebanon's rejection of Palestinian resettlement on its territory and spoke of the negative effects that would have on the demographic, political, economic, and social fabric of the country. He pointed out that there is a provision in the Lebanese Constitution prohibiting resettlement in any form. He stressed that no such project can be imposed on Lebanon and nobody would sign anything of that kind under pressure or otherwise. He said that he has many ideas for the solution of the problem of the Palestinians in Lebanon and is ready to discuss them with any interested party. In reply to a question about calls for the amendment of the Lebanese Constitution introduced under the al-Ta'if agreement, he said that his position is that he is in favor of developing the al-Ta'if formula and constitution for the better, not turning back the clock. He said that "nobody can stand in the way or reject development." He recalled what he recently said in the House of Deputies to the effect that he is in favor of a forward development of the al-Ta'if formula on the basis of coexistence, balance, and participation. Al-Hariri will leave London today for Beirut via Istanbul where he will stop over at the airport for talks with his Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller which, according to sources close to al-Hariri, will focus on development and reconstruction issues he raised during his recent visit to Turkey a month ago. The same sources say that he might also visit al-Qaradihah to attend the ceremony marking the passage of one week since the death of President Hafiz al-Asad's son Major Basil al-Asad.
