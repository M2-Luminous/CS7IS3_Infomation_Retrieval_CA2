Our demands for compensation from HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and the Swedish Theater are high by Finnish standards, but not compared with the practice in Europe. And if damages were to be awarded in the United States another zero would be added to the figures." So said Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's legal representative, assistant district judge George Paile. He gave assurances that the cases against HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and the Swedish Theater will be pursued as private actions regardless of whether the public prosecutor supports the actions or not. This means that Jutta Zilliacus' column of 14 April will be the subjected to legal examination. Helsinki District Court will have to decide whether or not the word "madcap" [galenpanna] damaged Zhirinovskiy's good name. In the same way the Swedish Theater's use of Zhirinovskiy's voice in the play Mein Kampf will also be examined by the district court. Paile is demanding a total of 14 million markkas from HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and the Swedish Theater in damages to compensate for loss of earnings and mental suffering. Paile confirmed to HUFVUDSTADSBLADET that his boss has neither read the column in HUFVUDSTADSBLADET nor seen the play at the Swedish Theater. So in what way has he suffered harm? "I have translated the column for Zhirinovskiy so he is well aware of what it says. I have also reported how the Swedish Theater used his voice and how the theater identified him with a notorious war criminal. Zhirinovskiy has been informed that we are bringing a case and has approved our action," Paile said. According to Paile, there are also limits to how insulting one can be about politicians. "Politicians should accept more criticism and more acrimonious criticism than ordinary people, but there are limits. Politicians also have a right to defend their integrity. People should not be allowed to insult them just anyhow. If people do this in a newspaper or in a theater they must be prepared to be taken to court and ready to pay damages." George Paile said that he is considering further legal actions in Finland. ``There are a few borderline cases that I am still giving consideration to. The principle is that I will only bring an action if I am sure of winning. That is why it is possible that there will not be any more actions, this time. ``On the other hand there will be many similar actions brought out in Europe. Some of them I am involved in personally, but in countries where I cannot manage the language I am hiring lawyers. As Zhirinovskiy's representative in the West it is my job to protect his legal and economic interests.'' Is this good business? "Of course it is good business." It is still unclear when the case will come before the district court. But what does seem to be clear is that this will not be before late August/early September. Legal experts think it extremely unlikely that Zhirinovskiy and Paile will win their cases and be awarded damages. Nevertheless Pekka Koskinen, professor of criminal law, is critical of Jutta Zilliacus'column. ``I have read through her text very carefully and have to admit that the column as a whole can be seen as insulting. The word `madcap' is by no means the worst thing, but it would seem that this word alone is being used as the argument for damages. I think that to an extent Jutta Zilliacus has fallen to the same level of linguistic usage that she is criticizing Zhirinovskiy for. ``Nevertheless I could never imagine that HUFVUDSTADSBLADET would be found guilty. In 1983 a number of Eduskunta deputies from the Finnish Rural Party claimed damages from Rundradion because a program had made ironic and acrimonious remarks about them. The deputies won their case in the city court and the Court of Appeal, but lost in the Supreme Court. ``The reason for the acquittal was that politicians and public figures must be able to stand criticism and irony. In the light of this it is unthinkable that HUFVUDSTADSBLADET would be found guilty.'' According to Koskinen, as far as the Swedish Theater is concerned it is if possible even clearer that a guilty verdict is out of the question. "If the Swedish Theater only used a 10-second sound bite of Zhirinovskiy the theater could not possibly be found guilty. It is crystal clear that people can make free use of pictures of politicians and quotations from them." This has not always been the case in Finland, Koskinen recalled. "In the thirties a Finn was found guilty of speaking disparagingly about Adolf Hitler." Jutta Zilliacus cannot understand Pekka Koskinen's criticism of her column. ``It is shameless of Koskinen to say that my column is insulting. The column is watertight and it does not primarily criticize Zhirinovskiy, but more the mass media and Paile. ``Koskinen seems still to be living in the old Stalinist times when people were not allowed to criticize politicians at all. It is as if he believes that the Soviet Union still exists and that every attack on a Russian political leader leads to reprisals,'' Jutta Zilliacus countered.
