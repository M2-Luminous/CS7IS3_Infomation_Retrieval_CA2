On this traditional festival of the Chinese nation for reunion, Chiao Jen-ho, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] vice chairman and concurrently its secretary-general, and his entourage have arrived in Beijing; their arrival has added a propitious atmosphere for national reunion in the capital. The current meeting is the first between high-ranking responsible persons of the nongovernment organizations separately authorized by Taiwan and the mainland since Chiao Jen-ho was transferred from being Taiwan "Mainland Affairs Council deputy director" to the office of SEF vice chairman and concurrently its secretary-general, and since the Wang-Koo talks held in Singapore in late April last year. Some ups and downs took place before the current meeting, which is finally to be held, which is most comforting. According to the "Accord on Institutions of Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS]-SEF Contacts and Talks" reached during the Wang-Koo talks, "the ARATS acting vice chairman and SEF deputy vice chairman, or the two organizations' secretaries-general will conduct talks on routine affairs every six months in principle, on each shore on a rotating basis, or in a negotiated third place." To implement this accord, the mainland has exerted unremitting efforts. With the reshuffling of SEF high-ranking personnel, ARATS acting vice chairman Tang Shubei and its secretary-general Zou Zhekai sent a congratulatory cable to Chiao Jen-ho, who had just taken up the office of SEF vice chairman and concurrently its secretary-general, and invited him to visit Beijing to negotiate routine affairs of the two organizations. In early December last year, when Chiao Jen-ho first took office as SEF vice chairman and concurrently its secretary-general, he stated that "the tenure of secretary-general is three years, and I hope that some achievements will be scored." According to the spirit of the accord of the Wang-Koo talks on regular reciprocal visits between the two organizations, Chiao Jen-ho decided to set Taipei as the place for the third ARATS-SEF work negotiations; at the same time, he twice invited ARATS Acting Vice Chairman Tang Shubei to visit Taiwan. Although no accord was reached during the Taipei ARATS-SEF talks, results of a certain stage were scored, and laid a foundation for work negotiations from now on. Regrettably, a precondition of Chiao Jen-ho's invitation to Tang Shubei to visit Taiwan was that an accord should be reached in the Taipei talks; consequently, the purpose of the trip was not fulfilled. Even so, when Chiao Jen-ho expressed the hope that he would visit Beijing to meet ARATS Acting Vice Chairman Tang Shubei when the Taipei talks had just concluded, the mainland side expressed its consent, taking into consideration the overall situation of cross-strait relations. Just when the ARATS and the SEF had officially settled that the "Tang-Chiao talks" were to be held in Beijing in late January, the Taiwan "Mainland Affairs Council" raised unexpected trouble, saying that the signing of a joint communique by China and France in which France pledged that it would no longer sell weapons to Taiwan, and China's restoring diplomatic relations with Lesotho were "various unfriendly actions" by the mainland toward Taiwan," and stated that it would "reassess" the "Tang-Chiao talks." For a while, there was an uproar in Taiwan public opinion. Under pressure from the people, the Taiwan "Mainland Affairs Council" made another decision to authorize Chiao Yen-ho to go to Beijing to talk with Tang Shubei, and thus the storm was pacified. The ups and downs of the "Tang-Chiao talks" gave people much food for thought. To my mind, mutual trust is today still not on the horizon in cross-strait relations; and one of the important causes is that there have been insufficient ties between them, especially comparatively high-ranking exchanges. In the "Accord on Institutions for ARATS-SEF Contacts and Talks," meetings of ARATS and SEF responsible persons of various levels are stipulated. However, it is not very easy to implement the accord, which more often than not is subjected to interference from artificial factors. At the press conference held at the conclusion of the third session of the first council of the association for cross-strait relations last 13 January, a reporter asked ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan what his deepest experience had been during his two years in office as ARATS chairman. He answered: Taiwan and the mainland should augment ties and exchanges; constant contacts and ties between high-ranking responsible persons would be helpful to removing misunderstanding while deepening understanding, expanding common understanding, and pushing forward the sound mutual development of cross-strait relations. Wang Daohan's experience reflected the universal aspirations of people on the two shores as well as his expectations on augmenting the contacts and ties between the ARATS and the SEF, these two authorized nongovernment organizations. At present, the regular, institutionalized ARATS-SEF ties and contacts are just a beginning. A good beginning means something is half done. It is expected that during the new year, the cooperation between the ARATS and the SEF, these two authorized nongovernment organizations, will take on a new atmosphere, with still greater progress in the comprehensive implementation of the accord of the Wang-Koo talks, especially in augmenting cross-strait economic exchanges and economic and trade cooperation. We sincerely hope that the "Tang-Chiao talks," the first round of talks between responsible persons since the Wang-Koo talks, will score positive results.
