The same area was shelled by 60-mm mortars and later came under antiaircraft-gun fire. Meanwhile, the Chetniks from (Lemizovo Brdo) were hurling grenades at the area of Izvor. Chetnik snipers have also been used this morning; the one on Spicasta Stijena has been particularly active. Citizens are warned to be cautious if they must move around the city. The Chetniks have not only violated the cease-fire this morning but have also been seen openly reinforcing their positions on several locations from where they can attack the city.
