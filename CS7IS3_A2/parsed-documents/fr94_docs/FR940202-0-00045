FR940202-0-00045 FR940202-0-00006 (f) Aggregation rule. For purposes of this section, all contracts calling for deferred payments arising from the same transaction (or a series of related transactions) are treated as a single contract. This rule, however, generally only applies to contracts involving a single borrower and a single lender. (g) Debt instruments denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. This section applies to a debt instrument that provides for all payments denominated in, or determined by reference to, the functional currency of the taxpayer or qualified business unit of the taxpayer (even if that currency is other than the U.S. dollar). See §1.988&hyph;2(b) to determine interest income or expense for debt instruments that provide for payments denominated in, or determined by reference to, a nonfunctional currency. (h) Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this section. Example. Allocation of unstated interest to deferred payments _(i) Facts. On July 1, 1996, A sells his personal residence to B for a stated purchase price of $1,297,143.66. The property is not personal use property (within the meaning of section 1275(b)(3)) in the hands of B. Under the loan agreement, B is required to make two installment payments of $648,571.83 each, the first due on June 30, 1998, and the second due on June 30, 2000. Both A and B use the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and use a calendar year for their taxable year. (ii) Amount of unstated interest. Under section 483, the agreement does not provide for adequate stated interest. Thus, the loan's yield is the test rate of interest determined under §1.483&hyph;3. Assume that both A and B use annual accrual periods and that the test rate of interest is 9.2 percent, compounded annually. Under §1.483&hyph;2, the present value of the deferred payments is $1,000,000. Thus, the agreement has unstated interest of $297,143.66. (iii) First two accrual periods. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the issue price at the beginning of the first accrual period is $1,000,000 (the amount described in §1.483&hyph;2(a)(1)(i)). Under paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of interest that accrues for the first accrual period is $92,000 ($1,000,000×.092) and the amount of interest that accrues for the second accrual period is $100,464 ($1,092,000×.092). Thus, $192,464 of interest has accrued as of the end of the second accrual period. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the $648,571.83 payment made on June 30, 1998, is treated first as a payment of interest to the extent of $192,464. The remainder of the payment ($456,107.83) is treated as a payment of principal. Both A and B take the payment of interest ($192,464) into account in 1998. (iv) Second two accrual periods. The adjusted issue price at the beginning of the third accrual period is $543,892.17 ($1,092,000+$100,464&hyph;$648,571.83). The amount of interest that accrues for the third accrual period is $50,038.08 ($543,892.17×.092) and the amount of interest that accrues for the final accrual period is $54,641.58, the excess of the amount payable at maturity ($648,571.83), over the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the accrual period ($593,930.25). As of the date the second payment becomes due, $104,679.66 of interest has accrued. Thus, of the $648,571.83 payment made on June 30, 2000, $104,679.66 is treated as interest and $543,892.17 is treated as principal. Both A and B take the payment of interest ($104,679.66) into account in 2000. (i) [Reserved] (j) Effective date. This section applies to debt instruments issued on or after April 4, 1994, and to lending transactions, sales, and exchanges that occur on or after April 4, 1994. Taxpayers, however, may rely on this section for debt instruments issued after December 21, 1992, and before April 4, 1994, and for lending transactions, sales, and exchanges that occur after December 21, 1992, and before April 4, 1994. Par. 5. Sections 1.483&hyph;1 and 1.483&hyph;2 are revised to read as follows: §1.483&hyph;1 Interest on certain deferred payments. (a) Amount constituting interest in certain deferred payment transactions _(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, section 483 applies to a contract for the sale or exchange of property if the contract provides for one or more payments due more than 1 year after the date of the sale or exchange, and the contract does not provide for adequate stated interest. In general, a contract has adequate stated interest if the contract provides for a stated rate of interest that is at least equal to the test rate (determined under §1.483&hyph;3) and the interest is paid or compounded at least annually. Section 483 may apply to a contract whether the contract is express (written or oral) or implied. For purposes of section 483, a sale or exchange is any transaction treated as a sale or exchange for tax purposes. In addition, for purposes of section 483, property includes debt instruments and investment units, but does not include money, services, or the right to use property. For the treatment of certain obligations given in exchange for services or the use of property, see sections 404 and 467. For purposes of this paragraph (a), money includes functional currency and, in certain circumstances, nonfunctional currency. See §1.988&hyph;2(b)(2) for circumstances when nonfunctional currency is treated as money rather than as property. (2) Treatment of contracts to which section 483 applies _(i) Treatment of unstated interest. If section 483 applies to a contract, unstated interest under the contract is treated as interest for tax purposes. Thus, for example, unstated interest is not treated as part of the amount realized from the sale or exchange of property (in the case of the seller), and is not included in the purchaser's basis in the property acquired in the sale or exchange.
