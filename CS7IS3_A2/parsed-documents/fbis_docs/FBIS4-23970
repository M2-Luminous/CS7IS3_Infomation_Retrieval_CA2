I imagine it is the same as that of most Rwandans. Given the involvement of France in the Rwandan conflict since 1990 up until the signing of the peace accord, France should not intervene, even if the resolution is presented to the UN Security Council. Second, you yourself know that UNAMIR-2 [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] exists, in accordance with UN resolution 918. This resolution should be implemented. What we might rather ask of France is to supply the logistical material so that the 5,500 troops that have been agreed on can be in Rwanda. [Diop] In other words, even if the United Nations votes for the French resolution to send 1,000 French troops, you will not hear of a physical presence of French troops? [Twagiramungu] No, indeed. I believe that there are other countries that would be rather interested in intervention, countries of the European Union -- there are some of them -- and other Western countries such as Canada. But, among European countries, for instance, we can cite the Netherlands, Italy, and many other countries that are neutral in the Rwandan conflict. Given French involvement in this conflict, I guess that it would be necessary for France to be able to make this proposal, but it should refrain from intervening in any way. [Diop] However, isn't the French proposal in response to an emergency? [Twagiramungu] We do not deny that it is important to intervene for humanitarian purposes, but for France to take this initiative...[pauses], but not only must some clarifications be made, we also fear that this might cause us further problems and that this might lead us to a conflict of a rather regional nature. [Diop] Do you think that this is not negotiable? Don't you think that, if you meet French officials...[pauses] won't you be able to reconsider this position? Is it an inflexible position? [Twagiramungu] What we also reject is the fact that France often takes such decisions without consulting anyone. We believe that we are responsible for our country, so, if there are decisions which can be taken, we should really be consulted, we should know the procedure used by France. [Diop] France is carrying out consultations with the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and seems to intend to do the same with the government born from the Arusha accord, that is, the government you should have led. Could you possibly reconsider your position during negotiations? [Twagiramungu] I have not been consulted and I don't think that I can reconsider this decision or this position unless I am told what is happening. The RPF, the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development, and the CDR should not be the only ones to be consulted: We too are a political force regrouping the parties which took part in the peace accord. This is why it would be necessary for us to know what France is doing. But even if this intervention takes place within the UN framework -- given French involvement since 1990 and the fact that the peace accord banned foreign intervention -- it is going to create many difficulties for us. Other ways should be found. A country other than France should be involved. [Diop] Mr. Prime Minister, this will be my last question: You are rejecting the French solution; we must perhaps wait for other countries to get possibly involved in this military action or to make up the 5,500-strong force. Apart from these uncertain possibilities, what do you suggest now for an end to the bloodshed? [Twagiramungu] First, given that UNAMIR-2 has been accepted by the Security Council in accordance with resolution 918, we believe that France should rather encourage the other countries to provide the logistic means so that those African countries which have agreed to send the troops can do so immediately. This is what must be done. Second, if France has taken the decision to influence these other western countries or even the African countries, it can also take the initiative to send equipment, that is, the logistic means, and nothing else. Third, I believe that there should be respect for the officials so that they can take part in such a decision aimed at rescuing the country from the situation where it now finds itself.
