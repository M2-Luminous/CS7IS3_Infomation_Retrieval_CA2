The admission of the Baltic states in the Western European Union [WEU] as associated members is a clear sign that the European Union considers them its future members, Luik told the news conference. He stressed that the decision had been made at the initiative of the French and German foreign ministers, although the associate membership agreements are to be concluded in the autumn only. The foreign minister added that the WEU is an increasingly defence-oriented organisation, whose membership will increase the security of the Baltic states. Most European states demand the withdrawal of the Russian forces by 31 August Luik went on. He stressed that support to the claim had been expressed by Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski and the representatives of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers at the Strasbourg session of the committee. The Polish foreign minister also recommended that the Baltic leaders should take advantage of President Clinton's visit to Poland in July and meet the U.S. President. Luik also mentioned the hope of Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Trofimov that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will attend the meeting of the Baltic Sea countries' foreign ministers meeting in Tallinn on 24-25 May.
