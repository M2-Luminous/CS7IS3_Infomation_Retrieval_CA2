This was stated yesterday by legislative sources, who explained that there is no concrete information on the positions of the members of the Health, Science and Technology, Commerce, Industry, Penal Affairs, or Prison System Commissions in the Senate, who are the ones who have to discuss the draft bill. Carlos Menem's initiative responds directly to the requirements of the government of Bill Clinton, according to the sources, which on the other hand stated that when the issue is formally debated by these commissions "there will be some who will point out at least five points of the draft bill that are harmful to Argentine interests." More than one of the legislative branch sources noted that between the U.S. position and GATT requirements there is a broad range of possibilities for reaching an "adequate" Argentine patents law that would satisfy all sectors, and would even settle the "infighting" within the national government over precisely this subject. According to speculation within the legislative branch, if the draft bill has the approval of almost all the senators -- although amended -- it might then meet serious obstacles in the Chamber of Deputies. In view of the strong pressure exerted by the United States regarding this future law, the senators wonder what joining NAFTA will mean to Argentina and "what benefits and difficulties it will hold for the country." Although it is true that Argentina has a "good relationship with the United States," it is also believed that "there is no need to join NAFTA" to maintain this relationship, as "it is not very clear what the benefits would be" if Argentina is chosen to become a member of this commercial bloc other than to "encourage confidence and the flow of capital." While these doubts exist, the Justicialist Party bloc of national senators has still not explained its stance regarding the government's draft bill, and it is believed it will not do so until after 10 April, because the great majority have decided to remain in their respective provinces to carry out their electoral campaign for the election of members of the Constituent Assembly. The senators' greatest specific objections to the PEN draft bill concern the shortening of the duration of 20 year patents, as it creates monopolies and because the speed of innovations today makes it inadvisable, according to the models of other countries that are influencing several legislators. Some senators are studying the possibility of "shortening the transition period for pharmaceutical products" or of establishing an extension for the patents for a period that could be three years, "under the condition that national laboratories be granted a license." They also propose "restricting the exploitation concept to local production, as is established in Spanish law," and allowing importation only in exceptional cases. This is a confusion that exists in the production of and trading in products from foreign laboratories. Another point under discussion is that referring to the possibility of allowing importation with the requirement of paying "royalties" in order to encourage competition and avoid the establishment of monopolies. Some legislators want to "avoid a retroactive patent and eliminate what is labeled `priority,' and only grant patents for new products." Finally they point out the need to establish "explicit mechanisms to encourage investigation and development." Several consulted senators agreed that Argentine industry is ready to investigate, market, and pull out of its isolation, and "begin to compete based on a technological plan and the country's industrial know-how, as well as defend the consumer."
