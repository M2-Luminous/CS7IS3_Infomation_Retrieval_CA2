He also said that he knew that the United States informed the ROK that it plans to hold the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks at an early date if, at a U.S.-North Korea working-level contact in New York, North Korea makes assurances for ensuring the continuity of IAEA nuclear safeguards, including a ban on refueling the five-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, a ban on reprocessing the discharged spent nuclear fuel, and permission for the IAEA inspectors now staying in North Korea to continue their work. On the morning of 20 June, the Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council reportedly held extensive discussion on this issue. Also, the meeting reportedly pointed out that it is necessary to hold North-South summit talks to hold in check the "unilateral holding of U.S.-North Korea dialogue."
