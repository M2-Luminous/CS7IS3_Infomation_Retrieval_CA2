This was stated at a joint session of the Russian Ecology and Natural Resources Ministry collegium and republic State Sanitation and Epidemiology Inspectorate. According to the collegium's data, no territory in the Volga area has health and hygiene and microbiological standards for the quality of drinking water. The ecological situation has become most unsatisfactory in the Cherepovtsy, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, Saratov, Volgograd, and Astrakhan industrial centers, where there is a high level of pollution due to petroleum products, phenols, and other compounds.
