On the line, right away, we have our special correspondents on the French side and in the heart of the Rwandan capital, Kigali. Furthermore, the only journalist on the spot there is the France-2 journalist, Laurent Boussie. [passage omitted] I am now going to talk to the only journalist still in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, Laurent Boussie. Laurent, you are in the heart of the country, in Kigali, and this morning a fearsome offensive is being carried out by the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front], the rebels, who clearly wish to take complete control of the city very rapidly. Laurent? [Boussie] Yes, Daniel. Last night there was a very big offensive, a very big artillery barrage here in Kigali. The artillery barrage ended at about 0700 or 0730 this morning and the offensive appears to have resumed at about 1100. At this time there is heavy fighting in the city. There is very heavy fighting around the Red Cross hospital, where all of the medical staff are sheltering. A shell even landed on the room where the wounded undergo triage. We have no news at this time of the number of people hurt, but it appears in fact -- and it is rare for an operation to be taking place in the middle of the day, for it to begin in the morning -- it appears that this is perhaps not the final assault, but in any case it is a very big offensive, only halted from time to time by the weariness of the men and the lack of ammunition, because the logistic channels for bringing in weapons are experiencing quite a lot of difficulty. [Announcer] Laurent Boussie, you are in the company of the RPF forces, the RPF being the rebels who are opposed to French intervention. Have they referred to the beginning of the operation by the French forces? [Boussie] This morning the RPF organized a demonstration -- there were about 2,500 people demonstrating against the French presence -- at which President Mitterrand was called a traitor, a killer, etc. So, you see, they are continuing to demonstrate. They are continuing to maintain the pressure against this French intervention, which they accuse of being aimed at aiding their enemies. [end recording] [passage omitted]
