As is known, the protocol "On regulation of problems of the Black Sea Fleet," signed by the Ukrainian and Russian presidents in Masandra in September 1993, entrusted "the governmental delegations of Ukraine and the Russian Federation with the task of studying, within one month, all questions relevant to the drafting of an agreement, in accordance with which the entire Black Sea Fleet along with its infrastructure in the Crimea can be used by Russia and bear Russian symbols, providing the Russian side will make appropriate settlements for half of the Black Sea Fleet, including its infrastructure, which by virtue of previous agreements was assigned to Ukraine" (taken from the original). Ukraine's leadership, emphasizes the recent statement of SOU Kiev branch, has declined to inform the people of the truth about the Masandra agreement in every possible way. Ukraine's Defense Minister K. Morozov, who resisted the selling of Ukrainian territory and property, was dismissed from his post. Having postponed the above-mentioned agreement (but not given up its intents), the state leadership adopted a course for transferring nuclear weapons to Russia. Through pro-Moscow specialists in nuclear weapons, a preconceived and purposeful campaign has been launched to threaten the Ukrainian people with the possible consequences of keeping warheads on the Ukrainian territory. In addition, the state leadership hides Ukraine's rejection of the proposal from U.S. firms to built a joint enterprise for reprocessing uranium from warheads into nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants, from which Ukraine could derive great profits. Moreover, public opinion is not informed of the fact that Ukraine primarily transfers to Russia those nuclear weapons whose shelf life expires in 2005, while those already unfit for use are remaining. Having acquired the Supreme Council support for the trilateral agreement on transferring Ukrainian nuclear weapons to Russia, our state leadership returned to the Masandra agreement on transferring Ukraine's part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia "to pay off debts," as well as on leasing the Black Sea shoreland in the Crimea and Sevastopol together with its infrastructure. In addition to that, our leaders do not even raise the question of Russian troops' withdrawal from Ukraine's territory. Feeling itself responsible for the destiny of Ukraine, for the destiny of the servicemen of Ukraine's Armed Forces, reads the statement, the Kiev branch of the SOU thinks that the questions of Ukraine's security and integrity (nuclear status, lease of the territory, state and administration system, deployment of foreign troops, selling of the Black Sea Fleet) should be submitted to a nationwide referendum on 27 March 1994.
