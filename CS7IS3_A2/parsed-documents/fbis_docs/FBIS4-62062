During his meeting with the deputies of the new parliament on Tuesday in Kiev Kravchuk expressed the opinion that "from the very beginning the Supreme Soviet should pay attention to the conclusion of the work over Ukraine's new Constitution." "The absence of a new Constitution makes the state's building and the work on choosing authorities for the various branches of power difficult," noted Kravchuk. In his words, under the current situation the people will come to the elections having no notion "what the results will be." At the same time Kravchuk pointed out that "it will be difficult to adopt the Constitution as a whole because "it is necessary to at least adopt serious well-balanced decrees on separate institutions of power to give reliable legal support to the election campaign."
