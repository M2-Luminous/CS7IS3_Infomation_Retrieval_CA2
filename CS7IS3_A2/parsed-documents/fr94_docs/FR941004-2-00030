FR941004-2-00030 FR941004-2-00012 National Institute of Standards and Technology [Docket No. 940967&hyph;4267] National Voluntary Conformity Assessment System Evaluation (NVCASE) Program AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology, Commerce. ACTION: Notice, Request for public comments. SUMMARY: This is to advise the public that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has received a request from the National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA) to have its recreational craft certification program recognized under the NIST National Voluntary Conformity Assessment System Evaluation (NVCASE) Program. DATES: Comments on this request must be received by November 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in writing to Mr. Robert L. Gladhill, Program Manager, NVCASE, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Administration Building, room A&hyph;629, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 or by telefax at 301&hyph;963&hyph;2871. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Either Mr. John L. Donaldson, Chief, Standards Code and Information, or Robert L. Gladhill, NVCASE Program Manager, in writing at NIST, Admin A629, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, by telephone at 301&hyph;975&hyph;4029 or by telefax at 301&hyph;963&hyph;2871. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The U.S. boating industry manufactures more than 50% of all recreational boats sold throughout the world, a considerable portion of which are sold in the European market. In order to continue to sell in the European Union (EU) market, the U.S. recreational boat manufacturing industry will soon be required to satisfy new regulatory requirements established under EU Directive 94/25/EEC relating to recreation craft. Manufactures will also be required to attest to the conformity of their products with the requirements. The NMMA operates a program to certify that recreational boats, boating accessories and components meet specified requirements. If its certification operations are accredited by NIST under the NVCASE program, NMMA will be able to provide the required certifications and thereby facilities exports of U.S. products to the EU market. the NVCASE procedures at 15 CFR Part 286 require NIST to seek public consultation when it receives requests for evaluation. This notice therefore is a solicitation for comments on the NMMA request. Contingent upon the comments received, NIST will schedule a public workshop to define general and specific criteria for conducting the requested evaluation.
