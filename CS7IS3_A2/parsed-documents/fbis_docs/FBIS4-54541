Thus it is vital to analyze the tendencies and developmental trends in this sphere. Overall, 134 enterprises of the machine-building industry (26.8 percent of the total studied; in 1991, the number was 28 percent) are on the `500 List,' and every industry sector is represented on the list by several units. The share of enterprises of the machine-building industry in the sales value of all 500 List enterprises is 19.3 percent (in 1991--20.4 percent), or one-sixth of total sales value. Of the 134 enterprises of the machine-building industry on the list, only 98 operate at a gross profit. The other 36 take a gross loss on the sale of their products. In addition, these losses are increased by the dividends these enterprises pay and by the tax on above-the-plan growth of wages [popiwek]. With these latter included, an additional 10 enterprises (for a total of 46) show negative net financial results. The 98 profitable enterprises of the machine-building industry showed a gross profit of 5 trillion zlotys [Z] (in 1991, Z6.2 trillion). However, the 36 loss-bearing enterprises showed a gross loss of Z9.2 trillion (in 1991, Z7.2 trillion), which significantly exceeded the profits of the other enterprises. Thus, these 134 showed a negative gross financial balance of over Z4.2 trillion (in 1991, Z903 billion). When mandatory costs are included, the negative net financial balance comes to Z8.6 trillion. This reveals the catastrophic rise in the machine-building industry's debt. As analysis of the data thus indicates, the machine-building industry is characterized by deficit, as in 1991, and that deficit is increasing. The profitability indicator, calculated as the relation of gross financial result to sales, equals 2.1 percent (in 1991, 1.4 percent); net profitability equaled 87.4 percent. The profitability of sales came to minus 6.8 percent. For the entire machine-building industry, the deficit earnings were even higher in 1992, coming to minus 9.6 percent (in 1991, minus 8.3 percent). So the profitability of the machine-building industry continued to worsen. Enterprises of the machine-building industry absorbed over 68 percent of supplementary payments and subsidies made to the 500 enterprises on the list; their share in costs (18.9 percent) was slightly less than their share in sales (19.3 percent). These enterprises, however, are characterized by the highest relation of costs to financial result--55 percent. The sum of these costs, Z4.4 trillion, is close to the sum of gross profit (Z5 trillion). The current liquidity indicator of the enterprises of the machine-building industry on the 500 List was higher than the average for the list, coming to 2.1 (for the 500, the indicator was 1.9). The same is true for the indicator of rapid liquidity--the so-called quick ratio (0.9 and 0.8 percent, respectively), and that of immediate solvency (0.3 percent). Such a low indicator level shows that these enterprises are encountering difficulties with the realization of current obligations and payments. Conclusions - Enterprises of the machine-building industry have a significant share on the 500 List both of value of sales (19.3 percent--second place after the food industry) and of employment (36.4 percent--first place). - At the same time, the share in payments and costs required by the state budget is similar to that in sales--18.9 percent. - The share of these enterprises in total subsidies and supplementary payments is also high, and growing, in comparison to 1991. - As in 1991, the enterprises of the machine-building industry show the second-highest deficit on the 500 List, after enterprises of the consumer goods industry. - The machine-building industry's indicators, which are unfavorable in the context of the 500 enterprises, are the more ominous because there is a clear divergence between the volume of sales and the size of financial surpluses. Many of the enterprises with the highest sales show a negative financial result and/or a very low profitability indicator. The transportation industry has both the largest share of sales in the machine-building industry and the highest deficit of gross and net sales. - Enterprises with the highest employment are often deficit operations; this may be, on the one hand, a brake on restructuring, while, on the other, indicate the necessity of such action. - Enterprises of the machine-building industry on the 500 List incur on balance a total net loss of Z8.5 trillion. The profits of the 98 profitable enterprises are thus negated in the context of the 36 unprofitable enterprises. In this sense, the situation worsened in 1992 in comparison with that in 1991. - At the same time, the link between the level of deficit and the amount of dividends and popiwek paid is clear. It is not uncommon that an enterprise earns a gross profit, which, after the payment of income tax, in insufficient to pay dividends and the popiwek; the enterprise thus enters the loss column. This is so for 10 of the enterprises with a gross profit. - Many of the enterprises that are least profitable are also payers of the popiwek--for example, most of the shipyards. At the same time, a large portion of the enterprises paying dividends and the popiwek show large sales. - One can thus formulate a preliminary hypothesis that one of the most important barriers to the development of the machine-building industry is the low productivity and ineffectiveness of the mechanisms for rationalizing employment and pay--above all, the popiwek. - The deficit situation of many enterprises of the machine-building industry and that industry's great technical and personnel potential demands careful preparation and implementation of complex programs of restructuring.
