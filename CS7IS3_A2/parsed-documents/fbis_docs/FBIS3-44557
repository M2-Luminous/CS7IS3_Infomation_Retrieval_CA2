The scientific breakthrough, scored by the Benxi Iron and Steel Company in northeast China's Liaoning Province, is claimed to have reduced the contents of phosphorus, sulphur and carbon, all detrimental to the quality of steel, to far below the international standards. Sponge iron is an important material for various high-grade alloy steel used in military, aerospace, petrochemical and other key industries. Currently sponge iron production worldwide is powered by either natural gas or coal, a method characterized by complicated techniques and high costs. According to specialists at the benxi iron and steel company, the new method is simpler and costs less. The specialists also discovered that the iron ore in a local open mine has a very low content of phosphorus, sulphur and other harmful elements, and therefore is the best raw material for the production of good quality sponge iron.
