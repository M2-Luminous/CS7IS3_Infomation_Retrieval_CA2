FBIS4-63216 "drsov098_a_94020" FBIS-SOV-94-098 Daily Report 20 May 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Russian, Kazakh Experts To Discuss Baykonur Treaty Russian, Kazakh Experts To Discuss Baykonur Treaty LD2005092194 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 0035 GMT 20 May 94 LD2005092194 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service Russian BFN [ITAR-TASS correspondents Veronika Romanenkova and Semen Ivanov] [Text] Moscow, 20 May (ITAR-TASS) -- It is planned to hold a routine meeting of Russian and Kazakhstan experts at the end of May to discuss questions of concluding a treaty on leasing the Baykonur complex. But before that, on 20 May, it is expected that Oleg Soskovets, Russian deputy premier and cochairman of the interstate commission on Baykonur, will visit the cosmodrome. Oleg Soskovets will be present at the launching of a Proton carrier rocket which is to put into orbit the second Gorizont space apparatus under a commercial contract with the U.S. company Rimsat. The deputy premier will also acquaint himself with the state of affairs at Baykonur. The agreement between the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan "On the basic principles and conditions for using the Baykonur cosmodrome" signed on 28 March by the presidents of the two countries should be ratified by the relevant state bodies of Russia and Kazakhstan in the near future. After this, the sides must conclude the actual treaty on the leasing; specialists on the interstate commission are already working on drawing up the treaty. However, the problems in "space" relations beteen Russia and Kazakhstan did not end with the signing of the agreement. The most acutely disputed issue at present is the size of the rent. The agreement sets the rent at $115 million a year. But the Kazakh side asserts that this is only the "starting price." In reality, Russia should pay $480 million a year for Baykonur. The difference between 115 million and 480 million can be made up by Russia's allocating to Kazakhstan satellite communications systems, the results of studies of Kazakhstan's natural resources, and also by training Kazakhstan's specialists in space equipment. The Russian specialists are bewildered at such an "arbitrary interpretation" of the document. They consider that 115 million is the total size of the rent which already includes the price of services provided for Kazakhstan.
