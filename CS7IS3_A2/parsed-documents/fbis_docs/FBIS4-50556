In a speech at the Royal Institute of International Relations in Brussels, the visiting Chinese official said, "Differences in the social system and ideology between countries should not stand in the way of their friendly relations and cooperation." "Mankind should discard the outworn concepts left over from history and work together to address problems which are increasing and which can not be settled without mutual understanding and cooperation," he added. Li arrived here on Tuesday [17 May] for a five-day visit to Belgium, which is the last leg of his five-European-nation tour. He indicated that one must pay attention to the objective reality in observing international situation. There are over 180 independent sovereign states, he said, "these states differ from each other in the social system, level of development, historical and cultural tradition, ethnic group and religious belief." Each country has its own distinctive features, he declared, adding, "it is these distinctive features that contribute to the diversity of our world making it a colorful one." "Given the distinctive features, countries that have strong and weak points in different areas may learn from each other and progress and develop further," Li pointed out. "And those with different social systems and ideologies should try to seek common ground while putting aside differences, reduce pointless disputes and conflicts and live in peace with each other." In fact, he continued, there are also a lot in common among different nations. "They have the same goals and something in common." He stressed, "It is this generality that lays the foundation for international cooperation and exchanges. It is the distinctive features of different countries that the generality resides. [sentence as received] And it is their enrichment and improvement that the generality takes shape and develops." "We must establish norms of conduct for all to observe through consultations on an equal footing and on the basis of full respect for the distinctive features of each country," he urged. Meanwhile, the Chinese official also briefed about the viewpoints of his country on human rights.
