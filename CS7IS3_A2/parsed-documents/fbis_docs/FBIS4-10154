Today, Ramon Godinez Flores, secretary general of the Mexican Bishops Conference, said the Catholic hierarchy will prepare a campaign with "positive" messages directed at the people of Chiapas to overcome "obstacles" in the pacification process. Camacho Solis announced in a news conference that he had asked the Mexican bishops for their cooperation to break the "vicious circle" that might "undermine" the pacification mechanism. After meeting privately with the members of the pro-Chiapas commission of the Bishops Conference, Camacho Solis said, without going into detail, that the "obstacles" and "vicious circle" in the reconciliation and pacification process in Chiapas must be overcome. [passage omitted] Godinez said Camacho Solis asked the bishops to send messages of peace and harmony to the people of Chiapas with the objective of fomenting reconciliation and making the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] more receptive [sensibilizacion] to the Catholic hierarchy. Godinez added that during the seven and one-half hour long meeting, Camacho Solis refused to mention dates for the resumption of the dialogue with the EZLN. Godinez also said the bishops see the positive side of the continuation of the virtual cease-fire. The meeting with Camacho Solis was also attended by Vatican Ambassador Geronimo Prigione and SBmuel Ruiz, mediator in the peace dialogue and bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, a Chiapas city located 1,200 km east of the Mexican capital. The meeting was presided by Adolfo Suarez Rivera, president of the bishops conference, who reiterated the Catholic clergy's willingness to support the peace process in Chiapas.
