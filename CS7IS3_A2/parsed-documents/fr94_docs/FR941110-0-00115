FR941110-0-00115 FR941110-0-00016 As discussed more fully below, residents do have opportunities for giving information to the surveyors during the survey process. Comment: One commenter believed that providing pre-hearings for monetary penalties, without providing any hearing, formal or informal, prior to imposition of harsher sanctions is irrational. Response: Pre-sanction hearings are available when monetary penalties are assessed because the provisions of section 1128A of the Act apply. These procedures require pre-sanction hearings when civil monetary penalties are assessed. As discussed above, the statute clearly provides for the immediate imposition of remedies where civil money penalties are not involved. Comment: One commenter argued in favor of a written appeals process prior to revocation of the facility's license. Response: Termination of a provider agreement is not termination of a license to do business; therefore, we do not accept the implication that pre-termination hearings should be available on the grounds that a license is being revoked, especially when the statute, legislative history and case law so clearly point in the other direction. Comment: A few commenters stated their belief that HCFA is inappropriately extending its rulemaking authority to supersede State laws which provide pre-sanction hearings. Some commenters noted that current Medicaid regulations at ยง431.153(b) allow States the option of providing pre-hearings. A few commenters stated that there was no statutory basis for HCFA's proposal to eliminate pre-sanction hearings in the Medicaid program, and no indication that the Congress intended to eliminate this State practice. These commenters noted that there is a material difference between the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the impact of not having a pre-hearing available because nursing homes usually have many more Medicaid residents than Medicare residents. They stated that loss of Medicaid reimbursement has a greater financial impact than the loss of Medicare reimbursement. A few people commented that the statutory requirement to minimize the length of time between identification of deficiencies and imposition of remedies is not a mandate to eliminate the time between the two events. A few people commented that the proposed regulation was making terminations so easy to accomplish, by providing only for post-termination hearings, that the Congressional intent to provide alternatives to termination was being undermined.
