The present head of the interim administration is Vladimir Lozovoy, who holds the rank of deputy chairman of the Russian Government. He was appointed by Russian presidential decree and placed in charge of a mixed force of servicemen. He has been vested with greater powers than his six predecessors: [Lozovoy] I have been given powers to speed up a solution to this conflict, to implement the government's decisions. We must engage the main factors -- which are political, legal, and socioeconomic. They must be uppermost in securing stability here.
