This has aroused the attention of all social circles. How can we change the situation of power shortages, which has lasted for 23 years, and move the power industry out of the difficulties making it a "bottleneck" in the national economy so that it will actually take the lead in economic development? In our opinion, to settle this problem, we must carry out in- depth reforms and take the road of "unconventional" development. The so-called "unconventional" development means that developments should be made by breaking with conventions and that a new path of reform and development should be opened toward the goal of the socialist market economy. Thus, we should make up our minds to proceed from solving the deep-level problems that have been affecting the development of our country's power industry and making major breakthroughs in updating the conceptions, rationalizing production relations, reinforcing building of the legal system, adopting the standardized joint-stock system, promoting the separation of the government from the enterprises, transforming the enterprise management and operation mechanisms, and establishing a modern system for the power producing enterprises. In particular, it is necessary to actually intensify marcocontrol, further increase investment, expand the scope of raising funds and inviting foreign investment for running power plants, quicken the pace of the electricity price reform, raise the debt repayment capacity of the power plants, promote economical and effective use of electric energy, substantially enhance the economic efficiency of the enterprises, further emancipate the productive forces in the power industry, and eventually create favorable conditions for effecting a benign cycle in the development of the power industry. Therefore, "unconventional" development not only indicates quantitative increases but also qualitative leaps; it not only requires a high growth speed but also a rationalized operational mechanism. I. The Power Industry Cannot Move Out of the "Bottleneck" Condition If It Merely Follows the Course of Conventional Development The power industry can also develop in a conventional pattern, but in such a large country as ours, it will never be able to meet the needs of economic development and the needs of the people in their daily lives. In 1949, in the mainland, the total electricity generating capacity was only 1.86 million kw, and the annual electricity output was 4.3 billion kwh. After the founding of New China, through nearly 40 years' construction, in 1987, the capacity of installed generators and the electricity output both leaped to the fourth place in the world. It is expected that by the end of this year, the national installed capacity will have exceeded 180 million kw and the annual power output will have exceeded 800 billion kwh. This means that at present, two day's average power output in the whole country is equivalent to the whole year's power production in 1949. However, while power production was increasing rapidly, most areas of the country were still facing increasingly serious power shortages. The "bottleneck" constraint from power shortages on our country's modern construction continued to be aggravated. We can say that the localities which achieved higher economic growth rates and made quicker development in the power industry were also facing the most serious power shortages. We cannot say that the state did not attach importance to the power industry in the more than 40 years after liberation; nor can we say that the investment in the power industry was too modest; and still less can we underestimate the effects of reform and opening in the last more than 10 years on the transformation of the power industry's management system. In all fairness, however, such efforts and reforms still did not break through the conventions in the development of the power industry. This was quite natural. Most of the reform measures and policies we adopted in the past were related to the traditional structure of the planned economy and were unavoidably constrained by the framework of the old systems, so they could not thoroughly overcome the problems of the traditional structure. It was precisely these problems which restrained the power industry from taking the lead in the development of the national economy. The problems of the old structure mainly found expression in the fact that enterprises were not separated from the government and the power enterprises remained affiliates of administrative institutions. First, in the structure of the planned economy, macrocontrol was never freed from some people's subjective haphazardness and this resulted in the insufficiency of investment in the power industry, which developed on a comparatively too small scale. The experts from the World Bank held that investment in power production in developing countries should account for over 2 percent of the GNP. However, the annual average in our country in the period between 1980 and 1992 was only 1.24 percent. Experience shows that in the course of a country's industrialization, the normal ratio between power-consuming equipment and the capacity of power-generating equipment should be 2:1. However, the ratio in our country was far larger than 2:1 for many years. Not only is the existing ratio much larger than 2:1 but the ratio for new equipment is also larger than 2:1. Second, the work of economizing on electric energy has never been placed in an important strategic position and there are no relevant policies and measures and no effective mechanisms and institutions for ensuring this. As a result, people in all social circles do not pay sufficient attention to energy economy. This has also made it hard to widely and effectively adopt the measures for conserving electric energy. The serious wastage of electric power thus existed side by side with serious power shortages. Third, the property rights were unclear. Responsibility, power, and benefit in power production were not unified. The enterprises had to eat from the same "big pot" of the state and workers had to eat from the same "big pot" of the enterprise. For a long time, state finances were responsible for all expenditure and revenue in the power industry. Even after the management contract system was adopted, this situation was not thoroughly changed. The power enterprises had to deliver over 90 percent of their profits to the state authorities in the form of various taxes and fees. As they were situated in the narrow crevice between the central and local financial authorities, the power enterprises basically did not perform the investing and financing functions. In foreign countries, power enterprises normally hold 50 percent of the funds invested in capital construction; and some even hold as much as 90 percent. In our country, however, the power enterprises held less than 5 percent of the funds invested. Because the power enterprises were not independent commodity producers and dealers in real terms, they were not faced with the pressure of competition. Overstaffing was a prominent and longstanding problem in these enterprises. The problems of the old structure also found expression in the serious distortion of electricity prices, which did not reflect the value of electric power nor the relationship between supply and demand. The inappropriateness of the electricity price led to a situation wherein the commodity attribute of electric power was neglected by people for a long time, making the power enterprises compete with other enterprises under unfair conditions. As a result, the power enterprises could not build up a management mechanism with perfect functions. This was unfavorable to raising funds for developing the power industry and also unfavorable to economizing on electric power and restraining the excessive demand on it. Moreover, this was also unfavorable to rationalizing the industrial structure and to expanding the use of foreign funds for running the power industry. Within the power industry, being affected and shackled by the traditional structure, people's understanding of the market economy lagged behind and the managerial personnel were not familiar with such concepts as market, competition, economic efficiency, and the input-output ratio. Thus, it is necessary to thoroughly update their mentality. II. To Effect "Unconventional" Development, It Is Necessary To Concentrate on Deepening Reform, Transforming Management Mechanisms, Optimizing the Operational Structure, and Enhancing Efficiency In 1975, when Comrade Xiaoping took charge of the work of the State Council, he pointed out the need to quicken the construction rate in the power industry to match it with the development of the national economy as a whole and to leave a certain leeway for ensuring that the power industry can take the lead in development. Putting Comrade Xiaoping's instruction into practice is the goal of the power industry's efforts under the new situation. According to our plan, in the period between 1995 and 1997, the capacity of new large and medium generating sets should reach an average of over 15 million kw annually; and in the period between 1998 and 2000, this should increase to 20 million kw annually. While the electricity sources are increasing, power technology and power grids as well as education in the power industry should also develop at the same pace. Thus, by the end of this century, the total capacity of installed generators in our country will reach about 310 million kw. If GNP increases by 8 to 9 percent annually and the power consmption of the unit output value in the whole country declines by 8 or 9 percent, then the power shortages will have been basically overcome and power supply will reach all counties. Over 95 percent of the peasant households will be able to use electricity. To achieve this objective, we must deepen reform and seek "unconventional" development. The "Decision" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee indicated that the economic reform in the whole country had entered a new stage of comprehensive, accelerated, and well coordinated development. The recent national economic work conference also advanced reform in giant strides and adopted many reform measures. This provided an unprecedentedly good opportunity for the "unconventional" development of the power industry. In order to grasp and use this opportunity well, the power industry must formulate the reform strategy, which is mainly oriented to reorganizing the power enterprises according to the corporate system and shifting them onto the path of commercial operations, as quickly as possible and effectively put it into practice. The adoption of the corporate system is a useful exploration in the establishment of the modern electric power enterprise system. The key issue is to set up a modern electric power enterprise system which is suited to the requirements of the market economy, has clear property rights, distinctly defines responsibility and power, separates the enterprise from the government, and exercises scientific management. Commercial operation is the inevitable result of the market-oriented reform in the power enterprises. The key issue is to firmly establish the concept that electric power is a commodity; create a policy environment for ensuring fair competition; and really turn the power enterprises into economic entities and market competitors which operate independently, bear sole responsibility for their own profits and losses, and have the ability to effect self-developemnt and exercise self-control. This is precisely the path of the standardized joint-stock system. The joint-stock system is a rather effective form of enterprise organization and operation as it is suited to the need, in the development of socialized production, for the rapid concentration of capital and it has been widely adopted in various countries. In addition, it is also an organizational form which can better give expression to the nature of the socialist whole people ownership system and is an effective way to effect the "unconventional" development of the power industry. According to the current condition of our country's power industry and its tasks, the joint- stock system should be adopted and experimented with; this is more urgent and more favorable in the power industry than in other industries. The primary purpose of adopting the joint-stock system in the power industry is to effect the transformation of the enterprise management mechanism and the key to its success lies in strict standardization. In essence, the so-called standardized joint-stock system must: Be in keeping with our country's specific conditions; follow the general laws governing the socialist market economy as well as the special laws governing production, marketing, and purchasing in the power industry; be in line with the state's general requirements on experiments with the joint-stock system and the state's "20-character" guideline for the power industry's reform and development; and must be favorable to the fundamental emancipation of productive forces in the power industry. In 1987, the State Council formulated a guideline for the reform and development of the power industry: "Separating the enterprises from the government, turning the provincial grids into economic entities, combining the grids, unifying power distribution, and raising funds to develop the power industry." The State Council also laid down the principle of "adopting measures in the light of the conditions of local grids." Practice has proved that this is a good guideline which is in keeping with China's national conditions and the intrinsic laws of the power industry. It systematically reveals the way to solve the deep problems affecting the development of the power industry. Under the new situation of the socialist market economy, "separating the enterprises from the government" is the orientation to which the reform and development of the power industry must adhere. "Turning the provincial grids into economic entities and combining the grids" is the conclusion drawn from the objective laws governing the development of the power industry and the reality of China's economic management. In essence, it stresses that the provincial and transprovincial power grids should all be economic entities operating independently, bearing sole responsibility for their own profits and losses, and having the ability to develop on their own and exercise self-control. At the same time, they also form an interest community composed of the interests of various quarters. "Unifying power distribution" is determined by the intrinsic law of the power industry and the complete concept of "unifying power distribution and exercising management at different levels." Raising funds to develop the power industry is a major result of the structural reform in the power industry. The power industry should develop ahead of other industries. It is necessary to use both domestic and overseas funds from domestic and international markets. The orientation of "raising funds to develop the power industry" must be maintained. The forms of fundraising to develop the power industry should also be improved and upgraded in the structure of the socialist market economy and should be gradually upgraded to the advanced form of joint ventures based on the standardized joint-stock system. The standardized joint-stock system is the advanced form of raising funds to develop the power industry. It not only has stronger investing and financing functions, and can more effectively attract international and domestic funds, but also can rationalize the complicated production relations formed in the course of raising funds to develop the power industry because it clearly defines the property rights. This provides a legal guarantee for the real separation of ownership from management power, ensuring the legitimate rights and interests of investors and the operation of managers in light of the laws and regulations. This is favorable to the standardization of raising funds to develop the power industry and using foreign funds and is also favorable to the authorized operation of state assets. Thus, the operational efficiency of the state assets and other assets will be enhanced and the value of the state assets and other assets will be better preserved and increased. "Adopting measures in the light of the conditions of the local grids" is a principle that must be followed in the structural reform and development of the power industry. As long as we constantly arrange everything according to the actual conditions, we can certainly find the path of pursuing the standardized joint-stock system suited to the conditions of various localities and various local grids, promoting the healthy development of the power industry. Following the "20-character" guideline, we can adopt various forms of the standardized joint-stock system. No matter which form is used, the enterprises must voluntarily involve themselves in the joint-stock system. For example, after the provincial grids are allowed to turn themselves into economic entities under the standardized joint-stock system, with the approval of the administrative departments in charge at the upper level, there may exist a certain number of power companies managed by investors on their own and power plants run by other industries. However, they must sign grid-connection agreements with the local grids as well as electric power purchase and sale contracts in order to guarantee their interests and clarify their responsibilities. With the approval of the administrative departments in charge of the power industry at the upper levels, experiments with newer and more dynamic management forms of the joint-stock system may be carried out within a certain scope and according to the conditions of local economic development, such as in some cities and counties in the eastern coastal areas where the economies are growing faster. They can be called power industry "development zones." It is hoped that local governments will formulate as many favorable policies as they can to encourage various quarters to run power plants. People determined to engage themselves in the power industry should fully and properly apply these favorable policies, increase their investment, and increase the production of electricity at a higher annual rate. This will bring about a chain-reaction mechanism favorable to the development of the power industry. This is a major measure for encouraging the economically developed localities to become rich first in the consumption of electric power and bear responsibility for increasing power supplies and perfecting the local power grids. III. With the Standardized Joint-stock System, It Is Necessary To Strengthen Leadership, Boldly Carry Out Experiments, and Make Steady Advances Through the market-oriented and world-oriented reform and opening in the past more than 10 years, a good foundation has been laid for us to adopt the standardized joint-stock system. On the whole, however, our reform remains in the initial stage and unevenness is prevalent. At present, the pilot schemes of adopting the standardized joint-stock system have just been started in some enterprises of higher quality and stronger competitive power, to achieve results and to accumulate experience for guiding the nationwide reform. Other enterprises should also actively create the necessary conditions, improve their quality, and make steady advances. They must not rush headlong into mass action. The enterprises which carry out the pilot schemes for the standardized joint-stock system must strictly follow the regulations and procedures laid down by the state and the ministry, advancing their work in a well planned and orderly manner by taking one solid step after another. They should act in light of their concrete conditions according to the "20-character" guideline and should actively explore the concrete forms of practicing the standardized joint-stock system which suit their own conditions. Their efforts should be focused on studying and determining the concrete organizational form of practicing the standardized joint-stock system. Various power groups should perfect their organizational structures in the light of the requirements of the modern enterprise system and also improve their functional structure according to the requirements of commercialization. The key point is to implement the State Council leading comrade's instructions on allocating part of the state investment to the power groups as their capital funds, to strengthen their investing and financing functions, and setting up a power grid construction fund so that backbone grids will be constructed and managed by the groups which are also responsible for contracting loans, paying interest, and repaying debts. The power groups must control 100 percent of the shares in the backbone power grids and should directly contract loans from the state's Development Bank. It is necessary to enliven the existing state assets in the power industry. For example, after the income from power supply is used to repay the debts and pay interest, the principal and interest payments should be reinvested in the power industry and managed by the power enterprises. The existing and added assets of the power grids should not be managed separately; instead, they should all be managed by the power group corporations. The power group corporations should input the state's capital funds to the large backbone power plants with the capacity to bear the peak load of the power grids, including the water- pumping energy conservation power plants and the power plants and nuclear power plants bearing the peak loads. They should also exercise effective control and direct management over these power plants on behalf of the state. The state-controlled power corporations with limited liabilities and limited shares should be established on this basis. It is necessary to carry out the principle of allowing various quarters to run power plants with the grids being brought under unified management. Under the premise of guaranteeing the safe operation of the power grids, we can explore various other forms of practicing the standardized joint-stock system inside the power grids. Domestic and overseas investors should be encouraged to input funds to start new power plant projects. However, investments and loans should be clearly separated. Investors may earn dividends according to the size of their shares and lenders may receive principal and interest payments. The parties contributing funds may select their roles as investors or lenders. In the next seven years, the power industry will need to use $25 billion of foreign funds in order to import 45 million kw power generation equipment. Therefore, in addition to expanding the use of foreign government loans, loans offered by international financial institutions, and commercial loans, we also need to attract more direct foreign investment in the power industry. This will promote the reasonable movement of existing capital. Foreign investors should be encouraged to launch joint ventures, start cooperation projects, or make independent investments in the field of building power plants. It is necessary to establish and perfect the legal system for the use of foreign funds in the power industry and effectively reinforce the management of the trades that need to use foreign-funded power. The state interests should be guaranteed, leadership should be strengthened, the regulations should be strictly enforced, and risks should be undertaken jointly. The foreign funds should not be used at too high a return rate or a fixed return rate in order to prevent the Chinese side from incurring losses. Reform is aimed at emancipating and developing the productive forces. It is necessary to emancipate and develop the productive forces in the power industry and to ensure that the power industry takes the lead in development. Thus, we must fully arouse the initiative of the central and local authorities and the initiative of all quarters. This is the key to the success of the reform. In order to effect "unconventional" development of the power industry and make it better serve the development of the national economy we must, under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council and with the great support of the comprehensive departments, exert ourselves, do solid and effective work, improve our work style, combine the long-term objective with down-to-earth work attitude, unite as one, and make persistent and unswerving efforts. We shall then certainly be able to achieve our goal.
