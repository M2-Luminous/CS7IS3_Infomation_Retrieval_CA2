"I am very disappointed," Walesa told the paper. "In difficult times, solidarity is necessary," Walesa said. "But here, priority is given to some particular interest over common aims. In my opinion, (the Czech politicians) are committing a mistake which will cost all of us something. If the talks fail, we will have to say that the organizers are to be blamed. Slovaks, Hungarians, and Poles wanted a joint strategy. I even proposed that Vaclav Klaus presented the joint statement on behalf of the four countries. But I did not manage," Walesa stated. Walesa is right in accusing the Czech Republic of placing Czech interests over the joint aims of the Visegrad countries, Klaus said, saying he thought that Walesa was also placing Poland's interests before the Visegrad Four's. The joint interests of the Visegrad Four are a common denominator of the four countries' interests, nothing more and nothing less, Klaus said. "The offer to present a common position of the four countries Walesa is talking about was never conveyed to me. As a result, I could not have refused it," Klaus stated. Klaus added that the Czech Republic had neither organized nor initiated the talks of U.S. President Bill Clinton with Visegrad Four representatives. The Czech Republic "only" gladly accepted the American initiative and welcomed the idea of holding the talks in Prague. Klaus said he could not see any reason why the talks should fail.
