Addressing a news conference a short while ago NEC [National Executive Committee] member Terror Lekota said the ANC had warned the police yesterday about possible violence. He said the police had undertaken to set up road blocks to disarm the Zulus but had failed to do so. [Begin Lekota recording] The ANC made every conceivable effort to obtain adequate policing measures around its premises from the earliest hours of today, in order to avert clashes and to avoid any loss of life. What is puzzling is the complacent attitude of the police who refused to cordon off streets or divert armed demonstrators away from possible flash points. [end recording] Mr. Lekota said the 10 policemen who were deployed in front of Shell House left their posts because of the threat to their lives. Security measures were left in the hands of the ANC's security personnel and according to Mr. Lekota they acted with restraint and patience and only fired when their lives were threatened.
