After a comprehensive discussion on issues the following points were approved. 1. All jihadi organizations, political parties, political and national leaders and personalities of the country are aware that foreigners cannot resolve our people's and country's problems. The oppressive and ruthless battles of armed aggressors also cannot be a solution. Therefore, all of us will believe in the following order of God: If you differ in anything among yourselves, refer to God and his Apostle, and to adhere to what are Islamic principles and laws in the eyes of almighty God and Islamic principles are acted upon in the country. 2. Under Article 42 of the law of courts' jurisdiction and organization, and Articles 397 and 399 of the penal law, and Article 433 of the law of civil litigation, the resolution of the high council of the Supreme Court -- the highest and last authority of the judiciary of the country -- dated 18 Hout 1372 [9 March 1994], which is in keeping with the principles of Mohammadan shariya and the laws of the country, on the election of the president by the representatives of the people in the Settlement and Solution Council is enforceable, and violation from it and its nonobservance is considered a crime, which is punishable under Article 285 of the penal law. Public prosecutors are obliged, in line with their duties, to deal with the violator in accordance with the law, in case of violation from the resolution of the judiciary, which is based on the distinguished religion of Islam. 3. The Afghan problem is under serious consideration and negotiations by domestic and international bodies. Those views and resolutions will be accepted provided they entail the high interests of our country and the will of the majority of the citizens of the country. Otherwise they will not be acceptable. 4. Highway security posts of jihadi forces, the Ministry of Defense, the Department of National Security, and police officials are reminded to pay serious attention to the prevention of trafficking of ancient and historic artifacts and to introduce the violators to the attorney general of the Islamic state in order that legal steps are taken for their prosecution in line with the laws.
