The director of the first IMF European department said in a letter that the organization was aware of the grave economic situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and especially of the need to focus on the settling of the serious economic problems but that the circumstances did not allow it to help Yugoslavia in its efforts. On December 28, Kontic asked the IMF to help draw up a new Yugoslav stablization programme. The Yugoslav Government has in the meantime completed its own economic programme whose essence has not yet been explained to the public. A stabilization programme is urgently needed because Yugoslavia is currently under a complete economic blockade while its rampant inflation reached the official figure of one million percent in December. In May 1992, the United Nations Security Council imposed tough economic sanctions against Yugoslavia accusing it of being involved in the civil war among Moslems, Serbs and Croats in the neighbouring former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. As part of the economic sanctions, Yugoslavia's membership to the imf has been frozen. In conclusion, the IMF expressed hope in the letter that the circumstances would in the future allow the organization to open talks on support to Yugoslavia's stabilization programme.
