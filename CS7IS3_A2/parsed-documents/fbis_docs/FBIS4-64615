No limitations are being imposed on the amount of the deposits. Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin, State Minister Aykon Dogan, Industry and Commerce Minister Tahir Kose, and Central Bank Governor Yaman Toruner, as well as other officials, held a joint news conference in Ankara today. [Begin recording] [Ciller] We have come here today to announce a decision we consider extremely important for our country. All savings accounts and deposits in all the banks in our country have been placed under state guarantee from now on. From now on, all the savings accounts and all the money deposited by the people in all the banks in the country, regardless of their size, are under state guarantee. Half of the total deposits, which amount to some 536 trillion lira -- of this amount, 255 trillion is in Turkish lira and the remainder in foreign currency -- had been insured and guaranteed. In other words, close to 270 trillion lira was under guarantee. From now on, all deposits, whether they are in Turkish lira or foreign currencies, are under state guarantee. An important stability package is being implemented in our country. Step-by-step, it will become clear in the coming days that this package will gradually yield positive results. I would like to again remind our people that there were some suspicions and hesitations in the first months of the struggle we launched against terror. We have surmounted them all. This package, which we will implement with the same determination and resolution, will also prove to be auspicious for our country. Our television and press have been issuing different reports on the issue. Our newspapers have been carrying at least two cover stories daily concerning the difficulties being faced by various banks. This atmosphere of uncertainty has put our banking community in an almost suspicious position. Given this atmosphere, the state has increased the insurance premium from 0.6 percent to 1 percent, thus placing all deposits under state guarantee. I would like to clearly state that our people can, without any hesitation, deposit any currency any time in any bank. All deposits are under state guarantee. Our country is based on a free market economy. All the rules of a market economy are fully functioning. When we look at the geographic region, we can observe economic difficulties. This is actually the case throughout the world. These economic difficulties can be observed in the United States, Europe, and Japan. In our region, however, Turkey is the only free country where a market economy is functioning. We have an economy that is freer and more secure and in which the market mechanism functions much better than all the Eastern European countries, all the former Soviet republics, and some of the Western countries. Let this be known to all. Let everyone deposit his money in any bank of his choice without fear. No one will question the citizen about the origins of his deposit. Let the citizens deposit their money without concern and be aware that their money is guaranteed by the state. The economic stability package we have been implementing is following the planned course. There is no deviation from our estimates. The projections made by the State Planning Organization are on target, and we believe this trend will continue. Therefore, I would like to reiterate that everything is under control. Our struggle will benefit the entire country. We will begin feeling its positive effects in the coming year and in the coming months. We are facing difficulties which we will surmount in a spirit of unity and solidarity, and we will continue on our path by distributing the burden of these difficulties in a just manner. This is the right thing. We will continue to distribute this burden fairly. I would like to stress once again: Our banks and particularly all the deposits in the banks have been placed under state guarantee with the aim of benefiting our people. I thank you all. The Central Bank would like to issue a statement now. [Toruner] Under the new arrangement, all Turkish lira and foreign currency savings accounts, of which only 150 million lira [as heard] were insured to date, are now entirely covered under the savings fund without any limitations. Although we have sufficient resources, in cases where the fund fails to meet all the requirements, the necessary funds will be provided by the Central Bank of Turkey in accordance with Article 66 of the Law on Banks. Therefore, there is no problem of resources. All Turkish lira and foreign currency accounts have now been placed under state guarantee. Consequently, our citizens, whose Turkish lira and foreign currency savings in the banks are guaranteed by the state, can securely deposit their savings in any bank operating in Turkey. [Unidentified correspondent] Does this include the banks that have been closed down? [Ciller] This decree covers all future transactions. Naturally, we are approaching past transactions with compassion, and investigations are continuing. This is a decision adopted today and encompasses developments and changes to occur as of today. We are guaranteeing the following: All foreign currency accounts and all other deposits are guaranteed by the state as of today. There are creditors from previous transactions with other banks. The investigation and the breakdown of all assets with regard to the reimbursement of these creditors is continuing in a very serious manner. Beginning today, we are guaranteeing all Turkish lira and foreign currency accounts in all banks, small or large. Everything is under government guarantee. Let our people relax and deposit their money in any bank they choose. Let them know that they are guaranteed by the state. [end recording]
