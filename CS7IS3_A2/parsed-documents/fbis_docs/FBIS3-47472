Hosokawa is scheduled to hold a summit meeting in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton on February 11. Hata has not yet visited the U.S. capital after becoming foreign minister last August. Ministry sources said if Hata makes the U.S. trip, he is likely to hold talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to discuss problems involving North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, the two nation's policies toward Russia in the wake of December's parliamentary elections, and policies toward China. Hosokawa is scheduled to visit Washington from February 10 to 12 for talks with Clinton to assess the progress of bilateral trade framework talks under an accord reached last July.
