The delegation's report provided an analysis of the situation in the field of drug abuse in Belarus and measures taken in this sphere at the national level. Concrete facts were cited illustrating attempts by the international drug Mafia to use Belarus for the transit of drugs from the East to the West as an alternative to the traditional Balkan path. This path is currently much more difficult to use in light of the fighting in that region. Belarusian representative Mikalay Syerada positively assessed the fruitful cooperation of the Republic of Belarus with the UN bodies and voiced hope that Belarusian efforts will receive adequate support from the United Nations.
