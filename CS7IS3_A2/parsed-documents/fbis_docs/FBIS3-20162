[Yun] The removal of such samples from glove compartments in September 1992 led to results that differed from our data. We want all these old technical questions to be settled first. [DER SPIEGEL] The IAEA accuses you of possessing more plutonium than you have reported to the organization. [Yun] This technical problem should be resolved by technical experts. We have proposed an international seminar and want to invite experts from all over the world, including Germany, to conduct a joint experiment. That will allow the truth to be established. Instead of taking up this proposal, the inspectors are using satellite photographs provided by a hostile power in their work to prove something to us. That is not permitted. [DER SPIEGEL] The IAEA is using the photographs as a basis for checking two undeclared storage points for nuclear waste. [Yun] They were shown to the inspectors once, and they were able to see with their own eyes that these are military installations. [DER SPIEGEL] That is irrelevant for inspections. Can one find proof there that your country is capable of building a bomb? [Yun] The CIA can say whatever it wants to. It is not true. We have a clear conscience. Our country has neither the intention of building a nuclear weapon nor does it has the capability to do so. We do not need such a weapon. The entire dispute with the IAEA is over 58 grams of plutonium. [DER SPIEGEL] If only such a small quantity is missing, then why do you not simply agree to the inspections that have been called for? [Yun] It is not part of our treaty with the IAEA, and it would be an infringement of our country's sovereignty. We find that totally unacceptable. [DER SPIEGEL] Are you risking war over a few grams of plutonium? [Yun] The United States has been very hostile toward us for a long time. We fear that it wants to destroy our country. They are gradually making preparations for a new war. During the Korean War in the 1950's, they killed everyone. Many of my relatives died then, although they were only children. [DER SPIEGEL] Is there no more possibility of reaching a compromise with the IAEA? [Yun] Everything has collapsed now. The matter has gotten out of control. Now, a solution can only be found through direct contacts between the United States and our country. [DER SPIEGEL] Under what circumstances would your government go to war? [Yun] If the United States tried to destroy us. [DER SPIEGEL] Whom do you mean by "us?" The inhabitants of your country? [Yun] And the political system. [DER SPIEGEL] What consequences would an economic boycott have? [Yun] It would be a measure aimed at destroying the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
