Hitler was dead nine months later and the 12-year-old Reich one week later. This is common history. However, the "Longest Day" was more than just the military turning point, more than just the largest landing operation of all time, which will be reenacted in military academies for centuries -- like the battles of Cannae or Agincourt. In the first place, 6 June was also a political dividing line in Europe's history. It was the day on which the United States became a European power -- with enormous historical consequences on which the "Old Contingent" has lived for half a century. Originally, this was not intended. The GI's who stormed the beaches of Normandy at dawn were only supposed to follow the footsteps of their fathers in World War I. They had gone to the "Great War" in 1917 -- and were back home again as early as in 1919. While the United States lapsed into furious isolationism, Europe was going to the dogs slowly and then increasingly quickly. The victors -- England and France -- were drained of their life's blood and demoralized; instead of the dreamed-of peace system, a power vacuum developed and Europe fell easy prey to totalitarianism, which started a second, far more terrible world war only 20 years later. In 1944, the Americans also wanted to play the role of the legendary lonesome cowboy who appears from nowhere, cleans up the town, and rides out into the sunset again. In February 1945, in Yalta, Franklin Roosevelt still confided to his ally Josef ("Uncle Joe") that the U.S. troops would stay in Europe at best for two years. Once again, the United States wanted to return to the tradition that former President James Madison had cast into a resolution in 1783: "The United States' real interest requires that it gets entangled in the European nations' policies and quarrels as little as possible. " Congress unanimously agreed to this first document of isolationism. The United States finally broke, though still unknowingly, with this tradition on 6 June 1944. After Roosevelt's death, his successor Truman asked the simple, but correct question, the answer to which was to determine the United States' policy toward Europe for half a century: "What is better for our country -- to spend $20 billion or $30 billion on the preservation of peace in the next four years or to repeat what we did in 1920, in order to be later obliged to pay $100 billion for four years of war?" The U.S. Double Role The fact that the Americans invested in peace in their own interest -- that is, that they stayed with their soldiers in West Europe -- does not alter the fact that the Europeans benefited enormously from this mission. Europe, the country of the 30-Years' and the 100-Years' Wars, where "peace" was only a break between two passages of arms for centuries, suddenly became the isle of the blessed (apart from the Soviet repressive actions in the GDR, Hungary, and the CSSR). Without stability made in the United States, the happy ending of 1989/90 would have certainly not gone down in the history of the continent. However, historical speculations have to go into it even more deeply and throw light on the U.S. double role: not only as a protector, but also as a pacifier of West Europe. After all, the question is: Why did the Germans and French shake hands in friendship after 1945, instead of flying at each other's throats again like in 1870, 1914, and 1940? Why were the small ones -- the Netherlands or Belgium -- able to embark on the beneficial adventure of integration with the big ones who had treated them so often as strategic playthings in the past? The answer is simple: Because suddenly a power that was bigger and stronger than all of them together was anchored in the European system. The Pax Americana worked on both sides: outside and inside -- it protected the West Europeans from others and from themselves. Guaranteed security both inside and outside was the foundation on which it was possible to erect the great structure of European unification. The West Europeans no longer had to relapse into the old game of distrust and rivalry because the great reinsurer, the United States, was among them. Dean Rusk, a U.S. secretary of state, expressed it in this way: "The presence of our troops also promoted inner-European cooperation. However, without the visible securing by a weighty U.S. contingent, old frictions could be revived and Europe be destabilized again." That was in 1967; is this insight still valid today? "Ami Go Home?" Apparently yes, because today nobody chants "Ami go home" -- although the Soviet Union does not exist any longer, and the last Russian troops will go home this summer. The left-wingers who have grown older, who demonstrated against the Pershings only 10 years ago, and against the Vietnam War in their youth, are advocating with warm words that the D-Day offspring, whose number is rapidly decreasing to 100,000 and might even decrease further, stay. The paradox is easy to crack. The Germans, the old bogeyman opponents in Europe, benefited strongly from the Americans' comforting presence. Today -- at least the clever Germans know this -- the gentle U.S. counterweight is also in the interests of the "greater Germany." For power can be exercised all the more easily if it is embedded in a stable balance of power that does not even permit the spreading of distrust. Moreover, the classic insurance function of the U.S. presence has not yet been invalidated. Russia is on the road to reform, but it continues to be an unpredictable variable in the European security equation. In former times it was Russia's strength, today it is its weakness -- its inner instability -- that weighs on Europe. Here a reliable counterweight is always useful and this is hardly conceivable without the inclusion of the Atlantic superpower. The United States' presence in Europe has not always been easy for the Europeans since the friendliest elephant is an inconvenient fellow because of its sheer power. However, if the advantages and disadvantages are added up, a sound surplus, which calls for gratitude, remains on balance. D-Day was really the beginning of the liberation, also and exactly, of the Germans. They also owe it to the Americans that they were so quickly accepted back into the community of nations after Hitler's horrors. The fact that West Europe preserved its freedom also cannot be separated from the United States' anchoring role. And what about the future? Here, only the insight from the history of the bloodiest of all European centuries remains: Europe has fared better with the United States as an anchor of stability than without it.
