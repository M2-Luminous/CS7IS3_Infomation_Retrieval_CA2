FR940720-2-00148 FR940720-2-00083 [Release No. 34&hyph;34360; International Series Release No. 683; File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;94&hyph;07] Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Options Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Flexibly Structured Cross-Rate Foreign Currency Options July 13, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on June 6, 1994, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by OCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to enable OCC to issue, clear, and settle new flexibly structured cross-rate foreign currency option contracts. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, OCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of this filing is to enable OCC to issue, clear, and settle new flexibly structured cross-rate foreign currency option contracts proposed for trading by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (``PHLX''). 2 In OCC's original cross-rate foreign currency options filing, OCC sought and obtained approval to issue, clear, and settle the following cross-rate option contracts: (1) options on German Deutsche marks with exercise prices in Japanese yen (``DM/JY'' options); (2) options on British pounds with exercise prices in Japanese yen (``BP/JY options''); and (3) options on British pounds with exercise prices in German Deutsche marks (``BP/DM options''). 3 In that filing, OCC advised the Commission that it anticipated clearing additional cross-rate option contracts in the future, including cross-rate option contracts involving different combinations of currencies. OCC stated that it would submit a rule filing with the Commission before issuing any new cross-rate option products. 2 For a description of the PHLX proposed rule change, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34308 (July 5, 1994), 59 FR 35551, [File No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;94&hyph;18] (notice of filing of proposed rule change). 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29920 (November 7, 1991), 56 FR 58105 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;91&hyph;04] (order approving proposed rule change establishing cross-rate foreign currency options). OCC was recently advised by the PHLX that it is proposing to trade new flexibly structured cross-rate options through the PHLX's customized option facility. Under the PHLX proposal, options may be traded on any combination of currencies underlying existing foreign currency option contracts. 4 For example, options on British pounds with exercise prices in French francs (``BP/FF options'') may be traded. 4 The following currencies underlie existing foreign currency options contracts: (1) Australian dollars (``AUD''), (2) British pounds (``BP''), (3) Canadian dollars (``CD''), (4) German Deutsche marks (``DM''), (5) European Economic Community currency units (``ECU''), (6) French francs (``FF''), (7) Japanese yen (``JY'') and (8) Swiss francs (``SF''). Accordingly, OCC is proposing to issue, clear, and settle these new cross-rate option contracts. OCC has reviewed its By-Laws and Rules and has determined that no changes are necessary to accommodate these new products because they will be margined and settled like the existing cross-rate option contracts. The proposed rule change is consistent with the purposes and requirements of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, because it will provide for the prompt and accurate settlement of transactions in new cross-rate foreign currency option contracts and for the safeguarding of related securities and funds. The proposed rule change meets such requirements by establishing a framework in which existing, reliable OCC systems, rules, and procedures will be extended to the processing of such cross-rate foreign currency options. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition OCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.
