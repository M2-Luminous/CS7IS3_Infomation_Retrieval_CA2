Milan Milanovic Thursday warned UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] of possible undesirable consequences if parts of Russian and Belgian battalions leave the eastern UNPA [UN protected areas] sector for Sarajevo. If that happens, Milanovic warned Commander Jean Cot, the situation in eastern Slavonia, Baranja and western Srem will be very difficult as no one will be left to ensure the disengagement of the R.S.K. (Serb state in Croatia) forces and the Croatian Army, which was precisely the reason why the two battalions had come to the eastern sector. It could also happen that the population will prevent the departure of U.N. troops, Milanovic said, adding he also believed it would be better if they remained where they are now. The UNPROFOR commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina British General Sir Michael Rose has asked for additional 3,000 troops to control the demilitarization of the 20 km exclusion zone around Sarajevo, capital of the war-torn former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, neighboring on the eastern UNPA sector. According to the eastern sector information service, French General Cot, whose headquarters are based in Croatia's capital Zagreb, is expected to arrive in Erdut on March 1 for a farewell visit to the area before handing over his duties to a successor.
