This opinion is based on NATO's old stand that only a political solution is possible in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as it was again stressed at the two-day summit. This is precisely why NATO is using threats and pressure to stimulate the three warring sides in Bosnia to lay down arms and find political solutions to their conflicts. The harsh threats made by NATO officials prior to the Brussels summit were calculated to step up pressure in expectation of a new round of peace talks on Bosnia, due to open in Geneva on January 18, and before the talks between Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic in Bonn last Sunday and Monday, the sources said. The strongest threats were again addressed to the Bosnian Serb side while the Croats were threatened with sanctions and the Moslems with a withdrawal of the United Nations peacekeepers from Bosnia. The Brussels summit has shown that the Bosnian conflict is indeed giving NATO a headache but that it is by no means its main preoccupation. No doubt, the organization finds the questions of Russia, NATO's survival and other issues relating to its operation more vital than the problem of Bosnia.
