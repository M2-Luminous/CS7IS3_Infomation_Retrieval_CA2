FR940404-0-00044 FR940404-0-00019 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Office of The Secretary 49 CFR Part 19 [OST Docket No. 49475; Notice No. 94&hyph;5] RIN 2105&hyph;AC02 Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, DOT. ACTION: Interim Final Rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim final rule is in response to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) publishing a final revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations, in the Federal Register (58 FR 62992) on November 29, 1993. The revised Circular was developed by an interagency task force for governmentwide use in a common rule format to facilitate regulatory adoption by executive departments and agencies. In the published revised Circular, OMB specified as ``required action'' that, Federal agencies responsible for awarding and administering grants and other agreements to recipients described therein, shall adopt the language in the Circular unless other provisions are required by Federal statute or exceptions or deviations are approved by OMB. This interim final rule essentially adopts the provisions of the Circular word-for-word to the maximum extent possible but documents statutory deviations. Except for controls over deviations to the rule, the Department of Transportation (DOT) operating administrations and departmental offices that make awards are responsible for all sections of the rule. DATES: This regulation is effective April 4, 1994. Written and signed comments must be received on or before June 3, 1994. DOT grantees are authorized to use the requirements of this rule, such as the higher threshold for equipment disposition, for grants awarded prior to April 4, 1994, including completed grants. ADDRESSES: Interested persons should submit written and signed comments to Docket Clerk, OST Docket No. 49475, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., room 4107, Washington, DC 20590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert G. Taylor, U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of Acquisition and Grant Management, M&hyph;62, 400 Seventh Street SW., room 9401, Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366&hyph;4289. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This interim final rule incorporates and reflects the provisions of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issuance of revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110 at 58 FR 62992 into a new 49 CFR part 19 of the DOT regulatory requirements for financial assistance. OMB Circular A&hyph;110 was originally issued by OMB in 1976 with minor revision made in 1987. The standards it contained were structured into 15 attachments lettered A-O. An interagency task force also reviewed the circular in 1987 and recommended it be combined with OMB Circular A&hyph;102, Uniform Requirements for Grants and Agreements with State and Local Governments, as a consolidated ``common rule''. In November 1988, a proposed consolidated ``common rule'' was published in the Federal Register (53 FR 44716) but, due to adverse concerns by some university groups and Federal agencies it was not finalized and issued by OMB. In November 1990, another interagency task force was convened to review Circular A&hyph;110 and a revision in a ``common rule'' format was proposed and developed. This revision was published for comment in the Federal Register (57 FR 39018) in August 1992 and over 200 comments were received from all sources.
