V. Keldysh an acknowledgement, which today is of very topical interest: "Only due to the creation in our country of powerful rocket engines has it been possible to move forward at a fast tempo towards the conquest of space." One would like to learn more about a science-production association, an organization which was headed for many years consecutively by V. P. Glushko. The story of our science-production association begins on 15 May 1929, when a group was formed in the Leningrad Gas Dynamics Laboratory to develop rocket engines. In 1934 this group became part of what became the first jet-propulsion scientific research institute in the world, and in 1941 it was reorganized into an experimental design office. During the past 60 years this organization and its staff have undergone all kinds of changes, but the subject of its work has remained unchanged--liquid-propellant rocket engines. TRUD: Please tell us, even if only briefly, the most important landmarks in the development of the organization. Katorgin: The first liquid-propellant rocket engine to be produced in this country was the ORM-1 engine, which was developed in 1930-1931 in the Gas Dynamcis Laboratory, and which devoloped a thrust of about 20 kg and a pressure in its combustion chamber of several atmospheres. As the design of the engine was being perfected it went through more than 70 modifications, right up until the appearnce of model ORM-65, which was suitable for manned flight. This engine was built in 1936. When at the end of the war V.P. Glushko on the instructions of Stalin acquainted himself with the engines of the V-2 rocket in Germany, his experimental design office had already created a series of rocket engines into whose designs at that time had been incorporated all the basic principles of liquid-propellant engines in their contemporary form. Those who today try to minimize the significance of the scientific achievement of Academician V. P. Glushko tend to forget that the decision after the war to launch the production of engines for the V-2 in the Soviet Union was inspired by completely different (although in their own way important) aims--to gain experience in the organization of such a complex and for those times unique type of production, to prepare the material base which was required for it, to forge cooperation, etc. Valentin Petrovich at the same time solved another, no less important problem. It was demonstrated and proven that any attempts to "squeeze out" of the engines of the V-2 any appreciable reserves of power, reliability, etc., had no prospect of success. Today we can say with legitimate pride that in the engines for the Sputnik and Vostok rockets, which put the first artificial earth satellite and the first man, Yuriy Gagarin, into space, were realized those same principles and solutions which were laid down and developed experimentally by V. P. Glushko and his pupils on their own, and indepedently from the Germans. These principles and solutions were also in many ways different from those of the Germans. TRUD: You mentioned an engine of the next generation? Katorgin: Yes, I mentioned the first liquid-propellant engine of powerful thrust which uses oxygen-kerosene fuel, and which was developed in the years 1954-1957 for the first stage of the carrier Vostok. In connection with it the RD-108 is usually mentioned, also a four-chamber engine, which uses the same fuel, is based on the same design and technological principles, and which made up the second stage of the rocket in question. Both of these engines and their modifications up until the present time have been in operation as part of the assortment of space carrier-rockets which are are making it possible to carry out the the Russian Program for Manned Flights..... TRUD: Were there any other landmark events in the life of your science-production association? Katorgin: Naturally! I would mention, for example, the creation of the RD-253 for the carrier-rocket Proton, the first stage of which is made up of six engines of this type. This is the most powerful existing single-chamber liquid-propellant engine, and operates on high-boiling fuel components. And take note of this: Since 1969 this engine has been operating without malfunction in the first stages of the carrier Proton, providing flights for space vehicles on assignments relating to the national economy, as well as launches of interplanetary space stations and space vehicles towards the Moon, Venus, and Mars. It has also put into circumterrestrial orbits the long-term manned space stations Salyut and Mir. And today this engine surpasses foreign analogs in its characteristics, and has good prospects for many years to come. And finally the third important stage in the creative work of the science-production association was the development, production, and putting into service of the RD-170 engine, which is recognized throughout the world as unique in its power and its design solutions. Without exaggeration it is an engine of the 21st century, and is attracting the close attention of many foreign companies who are working in the field of rocket engine building. It is a four-chamber liquid-propellant engine which posseses the highest parameters and power charactertics for rockets of its class. We are convinced that the use of the engine in question, which has no analogs in the world with respect to its combination of characteristics, will open up wide possibilities for the creation of continuously functioning orbital complexes on circumterrestrial orbits and for the actual realization of manned flights to Mars. TRUD: It is quite clear that making such a significant journey into unexplored realms, at times under such extreme conditions, as did Valentin Petrovich and his comrades at the end of the thirties and the beginning of the forties, could only have been accomplished by a collective of like-minded people. Katorgin: This is indeed true! One of the unique qualities of Valentin Petrovich as a director lay in the fact that at all stages of the work of the science-production associaiton he knew how to unite "under the banner" of his ideas a pleiad of outstanding designers, engineers, and scientists. And, incidently, this applied also to talented craftsmen and simple workers, who in no way yielded place to the legendary Levsha.....* It was specifically this approach to the solution of personnel problems which today gives our asscociation a high degree of viability, even at a time of "great shocks" in our economy. Valentin Petrovich possessed an amazing integrity of character, as well as devotion to a single great idea, which he strove to achieve under any circumstances, even to the limit of human capacities. He was without a doubt not only a pioneer, but also a great enthusiast for space. His life, as well as his thoughts and actions were all related to space. All the rocket engines which he created bear the stamp of his will and his talent. TRUD: What high-priority project is your science-production association aiming at today? Katorgin: The presently available test base of the association, which is fitted out with up-to-date equipment, can be used for conducting comprehensive tests of various kinds of products under conditions which have been made as close as possible to operational ones. This refinement, if you will, is a kind of invitation to potential partners and to collaboration. You will be surprised to learn that our interests nowadays go beyond the limits of activities which are traditional for science-production associations. I will note for a start that space is rapidly being turned into an arena of international cooperation, and is becoming a realm of politics on a grand scale. At the center of attention for world business today are projects for a global telecommunications system, a system which would be suitable for inclusion into the world system of communications based in space which is being built up today. Analysis shows that Russia today, in spite of the extreme seriousness of the general situation in our economy, has at its dispoisal all the necessary elements for its own independent organization of a system of satellite communications and for entering into competition on the world market in this field. In order to organize such activities in space, in the interests of the Russian people sensible federal programs are necessary, which would (particularly in the intiial stage of the work) be provided not simply with declared, but with real and active support from the government. Unfortunately no unifying and mobilizing initiative on the part of government agencies in this field, which is so important for Russia, can be perceived. And time is passing. TRUD: Speaking of the future, do you consider a further incrrease in the power of the rocket engines built by the association as an urgent task? Katorgin: I believe that the capacity and power engineering of the liquid-propellant rocket engines which are being built for today are completely sufficient for answering the requirements of humanity within the foreseeable historical perspective. TRUD: If it is not a secret, what do you dream of today ? Katorgin: Why should there be any secret here? I would like to believe that all we Russians recognize that in the future we simply cannot live without space. Without a recognition of this truth we cannot continue to move ahead with confidence in the conquest of space. The enormous experience which we have accumulated in the creation of powerful liquid-propellant engines and our possession of unique technologies creates a favorable basis for fruitful international cooperation. Our science-production association is open to contacts and cooperation. And we shall welcome any steps in this direction. [*Translator's note: Levsha (Lefty) is the main character in a well-known story by the Russian writer Nikolay Leskov (1831-1895)--"The Tale of the Cross-Eyed, Left-Handed Craftsman of Tula and the Steel Flea." In the story (briefly outlined) Tsar Alexander I after the end of the Napoleonic War makes a state visit to England. England was then the most technologically advanced country in Europe, and the tsar during his visit is taken on tours of English factories of various kinds. The tsar, in a tradition begun by Peter the Great, is very much of a "Westernizer"--(that is he tends to admire everything European and to disparage everything Russian). Accordingly he is very impressed with everything he sees, as are all the members of his staff--all with the exception of a Cossack officer, one Platov, who is in the habit of saying: "Yes, that's very good, but our Russian craftsmen can do just as well or better." Before his return to Russia the tsar is given a gift by a group of English steel manufacturers,--a life-sized steel flea, which, when wound up with a very small key, can hop about and move its feelers. The tsar returns to Russia and forgets about the flea. Some years later (in 1825) he dies, and is succeeded by his brother Nicholas I. Nicholas, (who is less of a Westernizer than Alexander), finds the flea, summons Platov, and asks him if he can't find a Russian craftsman who can copy it, or at least make something as good. Platov takes the flea and departs. After some weeks he returns with Levsha (Lefty), a cross-eyed, left-handed craftsman of Tula (a town famous for its metal workers). Platov tells the tsar that Levsha has improved the flea. On inspecting it the tsar can see no change from the flea's previous condition, except that, although it can still move its feelers, it can't seem to hop about as nimbly as before. On Levsha's suggestion the tsar examines it under a microscope. He now sees what the "improvement" has been: Levsha has shod the flea with tiny golden horse-shoes.
