The office of the president of the Republic of Serbia issued a statement saying that the most important issues involved in reaching a successful solution to the crisis in the territory of the former Yugoslavia were discussed during the lengthy and frank talks. President Milosevic said he expected the international community to overcome its one-sided approach in solving the Yugoslav crisis, and that in the future it will grant equal consideration to Serbian interests in its proposals for a peace plan. In that respect, the Serbian president said that the principles defined during the negotiations so far can be a good basis for a final solution to the crisis. He noted that the one-month cease-fire in Bosnia was undoubtedly not long enough for holding negotiations on the former Bosnia-Herzegovina with a positive outcome. Serbia therefore advocates the extension of the cease-fire between the warring sides and more intense negotiations in order to reach a final political solution to the crisis. In President Milosevic's view, sincere efforts to restore a lasting and stable peace imply a solution which should contain no unsolved, postponed, and open issues, and consequently it should not contain grey areas or any other undefined and partial solutions that could be potential new flashpoints. We should use this occasion to find an overall solution that will make possible a stable and lasting peace, the lifting of the economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the normalization of life in this region, President Milosevic stressed in today's talks with Owen and Stoltenberg, co-chairmen of the conference on Yugoslavia. This is how the statement from the office of the president of the Republic of Serbia ends.
