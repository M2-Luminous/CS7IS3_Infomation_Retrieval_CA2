ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) restricts the operation of longer combination vehicles (LCV's) on the Interstate Highway System and commercial motor vehicle (CMV) combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units on the National Network (NN) to the types of vehicles in use on or before June 1, 1991, subject to whatever State restrictions were in effect on that date. The ISTEA also includes special variances from the June 1 date for Alaska, Ohio, and Wyoming. As required by the ISTEA and based on information provided by the States, industry, and the public, the final rule lists applicable limitations by specific vehicle combination, by State, in effect on June 1, 1991, and does not further restrict the operation of any vehicle in lawful operation on or before June 1, 1991. This rule also establishes criteria for States to make minor adjustments to the list of limitations; defines certain terms, such as ``nondivisible load,'' ``beverage container,'' and ``maxi-cube'' vehicle; makes technical amendments to the list of federally-designated routes on the NN; and makes other minor changes to conform existing regulations to the ISTEA. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Thomas Klimek, Office of Motor Carrier Information Management, at (202) 366&hyph;2212 or Mr. Charles Medalen, Office of the Chief Counsel, at (202) 366&hyph;1354, Federal Highway Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 1023 of the ISTEA (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, 1951, codified at 23 U.S.C. 127(d)) required States, within 60 days of the date of enactment, to submit to the Secretary of Transportation for publication in the Federal Register 30 days thereafter a complete list of (1) all operations of LCV's being conducted as of June 1, 1991; (2) State laws, regulations, and any other limitations and conditions, including routing-specific and configuration-specific designations governing the operation of LCV's; and (3) a copy of such laws, regulations, limitations, and conditions. An LCV is defined in the ISTEA as any combination of a truck tractor and two or more trailers or semitrailers which operates on the Interstate System at a gross vehicle weight greater than 80,000 pounds. Similarly, section 4006 of the ISTEA (49 U.S.C. app. 2311(j)) required the States to submit a complete list of State length limitations applicable to CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units in effect on or before June 1, 1991. This section prohibits States from allowing the operation (by statute, regulation, permit, or other means) of CMV's with cargo-carrying unit lengths that exceed the length, by specific configuration, allowed and in actual, lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis (including continuing seasonal operation) on the NN in that State on or before June 1, 1991. The NN is defined in 23 CFR 658.5, and includes the Interstate System, with minor exceptions, and selected non-Interstate routes. The non-Interstate NN highways are listed in appendix A to part 658. Sections 1023 and 4006 provide that no statute or regulation shall be included on the list submitted by a State or published by the Secretary merely on the grounds that it authorized, or could have authorized, by permit or otherwise, the operation of LCV or CMV combinations not in actual operation on a regular or periodic basis on or before June 1, 1991. States may continue to issue special permits, in accordance with applicable State laws, for those vehicles and loads which cannot be easily dismantled or divided. A definition of such nondivisible loads is included in this final rule.
