Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered an important report entitled "Comprehensively Implement the Strategy of Bringing Along the Export-oriented Economy, and Pushing Shandong's Economy Onto Another New Stage." In his report, he stressed the necessity of comprehensively carrying out the strategy of bringing along the export-oriented economy with even greater courage and resourcefulness, with even greater boldness of vision, and with even more solid measures. Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of the province, presided over the meeting held on the morning of 28 April. At the meeting, Jiang Chunyun dwelt on 10 issues as follows: First, the issue of understanding. Jiang Chunyun said: In opening even wider to the outside world and developing an open economy, the most important thing is to further emancipate the mind and enhance the understanding of cadres at all levels and leading comrades, in particular. The degree of the emancipation of mind decides the broadness and quality of opening up. Second, the issue of goals. Jiang Chunyun said: To push the entire economy onto a new stage, we must first push the open economy onto a new stage. We must place opening up in an even more conspicuous position closely around the strategic goal on promoting the provincial economy and social development in three steps. We must start and promote opening up comprehensively and make breakthroughs in all areas to develop the scale and level of opening up extensively, in an effort to rapidly link Shandong's economy with the world market. In line with this general demand, we should effect a new and even greater progress in all fields of open economy, including export, earnings of foreign exchange, utilization of foreign capital, renovation of old enterprises through grafting, foreign-funded enterprises of three types, tourism, labor cooperation with the outside world, the contacts with the world market, training and absorbing of professionals, and economic cooperation with other provinces and regions. Third, the issue of overall pattern. Jiang Chunyun said: The opening up strategy, defined by the provincial party committee and the provincial government, known as opening all fields to the outside world, making breakthroughs in major areas, pressing forward the economy level by level, combining the East with the West, and commonly developing the economy, is commensurate with the realities of Shandong, and remarkable results have already been achieved in the practice of this strategy. Thus, this strategy should be carried out vigorously and continuously. In developing the economy, we should give prominence to the overall promotion and coordinated development. The head of the dragon should be raised, its body should float in the air, and its tail should sway so that we can truly form an overall pattern of the development of open economy of Shandong. Fourth, the issue of structure. We should give prominence to the readjustment of the structures of industries, trades, and export products. Fifth, the issue of systems. Jiang Chunyun said: At present, many of our systems are not appropriate and lag far behind the demands of the international practice. We must regard the difficult points hampering opening up as the focal points of the deepening of reform and readjust whichever is inappropriate so that we can instill new vitality to the province's open economy. Sixth, the issue of professionals. Jiang Chunyun said: The lack of professional personnel has become a major obstacle to the invigoration of Shandong's open economy. Therefore, we must adopt feasible measures to accelerate the training of professional personnel and accelerate the development of intellectual resources. We should open wide the province's gate to the outside world and encourage the personnel studying abroad, the students of Shandong origin in particular, to return to the province to work after completing their studies abroad. We should pay attention to attracting retired overseas high-technology experts, engineering and technological experts, and economic management experts to the province to work and encourage them to make contributions to Shandong's economic development. Seventh, the environment issue. Jiang Chunyun said: We should make great efforts to improve the environment for opening the province to the outside world. In the field of tangible environment, we should further strengthen the building of airports, communications facilities, railways, highways, ports, and power plants. In the field of intangible environment, we should attach importance on building up a fine-quality and high-efficient administrative service system, a policy and regulation system involving foreign nationals and foreign affairs that tallies with the international practice, and a sensitive and fast information system. Meanwhile, we should pay attention to comprehensive management of social order, create a healthy social atmosphere aimed at forging ahead, and form a fine social environment in which foreign traders are willing to make investment in the province and do business at ease. Eighth, the issue of rules and regulations. Jiang Chunyun said: In opening to the outside world, we should not open ourselves arbitrarily, nor should we stop managing anything. We must make clear what should be allowed, encouraged, opposed, and restricted in opening up. Ninth, the issue of study. Jiang Chunyun said: In the process of shifting from a planned economy to the market economy and from the domestic market to the world market, we are confronted with many new circumstances and problems. All people with professions and trades at all levels in the province should be determined to study again and study assiduously in order to improve their level and ability of commanding the export-oriented economy, the market economy, and the modernization drive and to improve their skills to lead the open economy. Tenth, the leadership issue. Jiang Chunyun said: Party committees and governments at all levels in the province should list the opening to the outside world as an important item on their daily agenda, should pay attention to mapping out strategies, plans, goals, principles, and policies, should be meticulous in researching situations, should adopt policy decisions in a timely manner, and should conscientiously organize the implementation of these policy decisions. All localities, departments, and units should enhance their consciousness in opening to all directions, should foster the idea of handling foreign affairs and developing foreign economic relations and foreign trade on a large scale, should voluntarily cooperate and coordinate with one another, and should bring their own development into line with the overall pattern of opening up. In conclusion, Jiang Chunyun stressed that the province's reform, opening up, and economic development is at a critical moment. In particular, the success or failure in our work in this and next year is of a decisive significance to the province's economic and social development in the future. We should comprehensively carry out the strategy of bringing along an export-oriented economy and increase the dynamics of opening up with even greater courage and resourcefulness, with even greater boldness of vision, and with even more solid measures in a bid to push the province's economy onto another new stage.
