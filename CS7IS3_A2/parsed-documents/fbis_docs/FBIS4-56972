Susano Mendoza Preja, mayor of La Quinua and spokesman for the peasant defense patrol of Huamanga Province, said "this offensive will have better results than Operation Aries (currently under way in the Huallaga Valley) because the Shining Path will have to deal not only with the Army but with organized peasants as well." Mendoza argued that any operation involving the peasants would have the advantage of the latter's knowledge of the terrain and the ability to immediately mobilize 25,000 people. Mendoza told EXPRESO: "We are prepare to fight and do away with terrorism once and for all." Mendoza and other peasant leaders, like Donato Sulca ("Gavilan Command") and Julio Enciso ("Halcon Command"), reported that Shining Path armed columns are operating in the Andean mountain range along the border between Ayacucho and Apurimac Departments. The peasant leaders warned that Shining Path forces have regrouped recently and Shining Path units were sighted in Ocros District and in rural areas of Andahuaylas. On 17 April, a group of 30 Shining Path militants attacked San Juan de Lucanas (on the border with Ica Department) and killed five people after destroying public property and several interprovincial buses. Peasant defense patrol representatives asked the central government to give them sustained logistic support to help them fight for peace. They sent a memorandum to political and military officials asking for solutions to the legal problems of nine peasant defense patrol leaders who are in prison in Huamanga (on charges of alleged homicide) and for the pardon for peasant leaders who have already been sentenced. The representatives asked for the implementation of Supreme Decree 077-DE-092, which grants benefits to members of peasant defense patrols in case of death or disablement. They also disagreed with the proposal to lift the state of emergency in Ayacucho Department because they believe that "peace has not yet taken root in Ayacucho."
