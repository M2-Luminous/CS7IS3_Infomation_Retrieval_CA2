[Serreqi] An open discussion was held there. Every minister presented his own options and ideas regarding the crisis. Since this meeting coincided with the NATO meeting and the fact that many more important decisions other than the mandate of this conference were expected, it is understandable that the importance of this conference was diminished and somewhat reduced to an informal exchange of opinions. The Albanian side, of course, presented its own opinions and options, stressing that the choices suggested so far, particularly the division of Bosnia, offer neither peace nor a peaceful solution to the region. At the same time, this is a precedence with unforeseen consequences. The meeting discussed at length the embargo, its application, and the economic consequences. We were very categorical that Albania, as one of the countries that has applied the embargo most rigorously and as one of the countries that is most affected by the embargo, insists that this embargo continues, as the only possibility and the only measure that the international community has so far implemented against Serbia. Its handling and the opinions to facilitate or abolish it should be solved along with other very important elements of the crisis, such as solving the problem of Albanians in Kosova and elsewhere. [Sokoli] Since the two meetings coincided, how did the participating sides react? [Serreqi] The participants did not maintain the same stance. Of course, we favored the already known position that Albania is deeply convinced that the international community, NATO, and the United Nations should restore its credibility and give a clear testimony that concrete measures should be taken against the aggressor. [Sokoli] What about the Greek reaction? [Serreqi] Of course, it is already well known that the Greek position was completely different from ours.
