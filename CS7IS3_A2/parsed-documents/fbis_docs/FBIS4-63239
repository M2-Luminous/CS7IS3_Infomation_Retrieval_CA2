By doing this, the present leadership in Kiev is trying to stay in power," Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS this evening. According to him, the Ukrainian leadership had made an attempt to eliminate presidential power in the Crimea in the past, and on 19 May, Leonid Kravchuk by his decrees reorganized the Crimean power ministries. These moves by Kiev, Yuriy Meshkov thinks, might seriously aggravate the situation in the republic. In his opinion, the redeployment and increased activity of the Ukrainian Armed Forces units have been noted on the peninsula's territory. Thus, on the night of 18 May, an aircraft carrying Valentyn Nedryhaylo, the first deputy interior minister, and a special purpose group, secretly arrived in Simferopol where they attempted to seize the republic's Interior Ministry. Yuriy Meshkov said that on 19 May the Crimean Supreme Council approved the ministers of internal affairs, security service, and justice and, in his opinion, this will make it possible to guarantee peace and order in the republic. "If need be," he said, "we have enough forces and equipment to prevent the situation from getting out of control." The Crimean president also said that, in order to guarantee stability, he was prepared to accept compromise decisions but not at the expense of Crimean statehood. In particular, Yuriy Meshkov said, at his request the Supreme Council suspended the discussion of restoring the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992. Yuriy Meshkov also told ITAR-TASS that he had accepted the proposal by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to send a delegation of Crimean deputies to Kiev to discuss issues of mutual interest. In the opinion of Yuriy Meshkov, in the evolved situation Russia should not allow Ukraine to resort to taking inadequate measures against the Republic of Crimea.
