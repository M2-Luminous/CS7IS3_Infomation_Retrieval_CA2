FR940124-1-00092 FR940124-1-00009 (A) Information relating to market and job availability for students in occupational, professional, and vocational programs; and (B) Information regarding the relationship of courses to specific standards necessary for State licensure in specific occupations; (9) The appropriateness of the number of credit or clock hours required for the completion of programs or of the length of 600-hour courses; (10) Assessing the actions of any owner, shareholder, or person exercising control over the educational institution which may adversely affect eligibility for programs under Title IV of the HEA; (11) The adequacy of procedures for investigation and resolution of student complaints; (12) The appropriateness of advertising and promotion and student recruitment practices; (13) That the institution has a fair and equitable refund policy to protect students; and (14) The success of the program at the institution, including_ (A) The rates of the institution's students' program completion and graduation, taking into account the length of the program at the institution and the selectivity of the institution's admissions policies; (B) The withdrawal rates of the institution's students; (C) with respect to vocational and professional programs, the rates of placement of the institution's graduates in occupations related to their course of study; (D) where appropriate, the rate at which the institution's graduates pass licensure examinations; and (E) the variety of student completion goals, including transfer to another institution of higher education, full-time employment in the field of study, and military service. Except for the following standard, the statutory provisions contained in section 494C(d) of the HEA are essentially repeated in §667.21(a). In §667.21(a)(4), the Secretary proposed to interpret the standard described in 494C(d)(2) of the HEA to require that a judgement be made regarding the effectiveness of an institution's method to assess a student's ability to complete successfully an educational program. The proposed standard would require a SPRE to measure the effectiveness of its assessment method by the completion rate of the assessed students enrolled in the institution's program. Several negotiators indicated that the proposed standard implies a highly predictive association between the institution's assessment method and the students' completion of the program. According to those negotiators, such a predictive association does not exist. Therefore, the negotiators suggested that the success of the institution's assessment method be judged by using measures other than completion rates. The Secretary invites comments on this suggestion and alternative approaches for evaluating the effectiveness of an institution's method to assess a student's ability to complete successfully an educational program. With regard to the standard described in section 494C(d)(4) of the HEA and §667.21(a)(7), the Secretary invites public comments on whether the SPRE's review of an institution should include a review of the institution's compliance with statutes and regulations governing access to disabled individuals. In §667.21(b), the Secretary has proposed a framework under which a State develops review standards. Under that framework the Secretary proposes_ (1) To permit States to develop different standards for different types or categories of institutions and educational programs; (2) That States specify the records that referred institutions would need to maintain to satisfy State standards; (3) That States must quantify certain review standards; and (4) That States determine whether a Title IV, HEA program standard would be an adequate State standard. Negotiators disagreed among themselves with regard to the proposal in §667.22(b)(1), to provide latitude to States to develop different standards for different types or categories of institutions or educational programs. While many negotiators agreed strongly with this approach, others disagreed vociferously, arguing that States would use this latitude to establish unreasonably stringent standards for vocational and proprietary institutions.
