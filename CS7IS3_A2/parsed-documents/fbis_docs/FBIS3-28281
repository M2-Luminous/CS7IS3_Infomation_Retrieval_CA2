[Takemura] Politicians, as well as political parties, will make a new start with a feeling of uncertainty. If they fail to take a careful look at a new political system and discuss ways to embrace the new political system, they will place their interests ahead of the new political system, leaving the system distorted. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Will the political parties lead future elections? [Takemura] Contesting among candidates from the same party in single-seat constituencies will disappear. Although the conservative-reformist structure will disappear, there will be a situation wherein conservative candidates with their different party affiliation fight each other in elections. Their fight in elections will create a complex situation. In future elections in which party affiliation and party platform are regarded as important factors, only one candidate will be chosen in a single-seat constituency and voters will be given more room than now to study "their choice" in elections. I believe it is highly possible that personal ties, acquaintances, and the conventional support groups will remain intact. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There is talk that ruling coalition parties will field unified candidates in future elections and a new party will be formed. How would you respond to this prospect? [Takemura] I do not know. Frankly speaking, what I am vaguely assuming is that in principle, there should be moves toward a realignment of the established political parties, including the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. In the course of realigning the established political parties, we need to closely watch how they would split in the future. They might split into two, three, or four parties or groups. It is a principle that the established political parties should be realigned not by an agreement reached between party leaders and party interests, but by party platforms, policies, and ideologies. I think that in elections, voters will choose their candidates taking into account how the parties are run and how the parties handle personnel affairs and money. If parties with different policy platforms merge, their merger would run into contradiction. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Then, will it not be possible for Shinseito [the Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito to merge? [Takemura] The two parties have shared each other's hardships for half a year and they now feel friendly toward each other. They aim for reform and share many aspects unlike other parties that are complacent about the old political system. Nonetheless, they have many different aspects because of the history of their growth. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Will the political parties start their second realignment when the demarcation of single-seat constituencies is completed? [Takemura] Yes, they will move toward realignment at that time. The political parties will make brisk moves toward realignment after this summer when the Diet passes a bill on the demarcation. Although Sakigake is in a position to shore up the Hosokawa government, if it fails to keep pace with moves that other parties make in response to a new electoral system, it would face a contradiction. Any discord within the ruling coalition parties would weaken the coalition government's foundation and there are very difficult aspects. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Prime minister special assistant Tanaka has resigned. Did the prime minister dismiss him? [Takemura] The prime minister did not dismiss him at all. I have heard some people say Mr. Tanaka has fled from the prime minister, but Mr. Hosokawa absolutely did not dismiss him. At the same time, Mr. Tanaka has not fled from the prime minister. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do the prime minister and you have any disagreement over merging Sakigake and the New Japan Party? [Takemura] I believe that there is no change in our feelings toward merging the two parties. As for the question of how and when the two parties should be merged, its interpretation has been varied by us. I and the prime minister have decided to merge our two parties and announced our decision. Our two parties have played an active part in the Diet as a unified group for half a year. Our understanding is that conditions have been created everyday wherein the two parties can be merged. We intend to merge our parties without failing to seize a good opportunity. [Takemura] It has been reported that you have been feuding with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. [Takemura] There has been no feud between us at all. I have never publicly criticized Mr. Ozawa or spoken against him. The differences between our blueprints for Japan's future and in our ways of getting things done have prompted such a report. It is all my fault. (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP] has managed to avoid another split. What do you think of moves by a reformist group led by LDP Deputy Secretary General Masayasu Kitakawa? [Takemura] Our Parliamentary Dormitory rooms are next door to each other and, in the past, we belonged to the same LDP faction. Mr. Kitakawa is a politician I know very well. I believe that we have maintained a good private and official relationship. I hope that as a reformist, he will play an active part in the LDP. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not hope that he will break away from the LDP? [Takemura] I think that he will probably do so some time in the future. I think that he is one of my most credible colleagues.
