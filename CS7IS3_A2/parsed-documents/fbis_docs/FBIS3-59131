Reporting to the secret services committee today were Sisde chief, Domenico Salazar, and the head of Sismi, General Cesare Pucci. Coming out of the meeting, committee members said that both men have made mention of an episode which occurred on December 31 when fishermen found a container containing a vest and two handguns 50 meters from the shore at Santa Severa, the town north of Rome where Scalfaro has a home. However, both secret service chiefs tended to downplay the find, saying it was more a matter for the local police force. Salazar said that whenever there is an institutional void there is always a greater risk of destabilization as subversive elements look for their chance to move. The important thing is not to let down one's guard, the Sisde chief said. Pressed by journalists to elaborate on his reference to subversive or "deviant" elements, Salazar said every now and then there was a telephone call from the "Armed Phalange," for example, and that there might well be deviant strains running through other, unspecified "forces," persons "who cannot accept the present state of things; this inevitable process of evolution." Forces different from the security services? he was asked. "That's the way it looks to me," he replied. Security is tight around the head of state, who has also been advised during this period to spend more of his time living at the Quirinale (presidential) palace.
