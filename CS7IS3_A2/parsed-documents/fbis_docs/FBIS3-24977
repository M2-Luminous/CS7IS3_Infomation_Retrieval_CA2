FBIS3-24977 "drafr024_d_94009" FBIS-AFR-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique Opposition Parties Surveyed on Economic Programs MB0202072794 Maputo DOMINGO in Portuguese 23 Jan 94 p 4-5 MB0202072794 Maputo DOMINGO Language: Portuguese Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article] [Text] If there are no further delays, 1994 should be the year of the first democratic multiparty elections in this country. In terms of the new schedule of the General Peace Accord, the Mozambican people turn out at the polls in October to choose their president and the party whose program they like and trust the most. Meanwhile, as elections approach--they are slightly less than 10 months away--people are showing a growing interest in and want to know more about the philosophy and programs of each party and candidate in the elections. With the aim of satisfying that public need, DOMINGO sent a questionnaire to the different political parties that have registered so far--namely, the People's Party for the Liberation of Mozambique, PPLM; the Mozambique Liberal and Democratic Party, Palmo; the Mozambique Democratic Party, Pademo; the Social Democratic Party, Sol; the Mozambique People's Progress Party, PPPM; the Mozambican Nationalist Movement, Monamo; the National Democratic Party, Panade; National Convention Party, PCN; the Mozambican National Union, Unamo; Mozambique United Front-Democratic Convergence and National Reconstruction Party, Fumo-PCDRN; and the Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo. Our survey contained three questions: 1. What concrete strategies should be followed to bring the country's economy out of the chaos it is in? 2. What specific program should be implemented to ensure social progress (in areas such as health, education, culture, sport, and so on)? and 3. What foreign policy should be pursued? We sent the questionnaires to 11 parties, but only five replied. They were: Pademo, PPPM, Monamo, PCN, and Unamo. Of those, the PCN gave us a negative answer, saying that the questions we asked are "of public interest and will certainly be topics for debate during the electoral campaign." This party added that such issues are part of its electoral program, which "will only be approved by a meeting of the congress to be held, in principle, in April, so we cannot divulge that information now or we would be violating our own statutes." Panade was contacted late, so it will only answer next week. We did not send the questionnaire to the Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, for reasons that we believe are obvious. As the present ruling party, Frelimo's program must be the one it is implementing at this stage. Among other things, we have the national reconstruction program, the social and economic rehabilitation program, and the industrial rehabilitation program. DOMINGO will be carrying the parties' answers over the next few weeks and it will follow the order of the questions, with answers to the first, second, and third questions, respectively. The PPPM produced a response that is difficult to grasp because it gives one four-line answer to all three questions. Our first question about concrete strategies for pulling Mozambique's economy out of the current chaos included some secondary questions: a) Concerning continuity or otherwise with the IMF restructuring program, in the event of severance, what other sources of financing would your party rely on? b) What sectorial policies (agriculture, industry, commerce, and tourism) and what priorities would you follow? c) Concerning foreign investment, what policies, strategies, or mechanisms should be implemented to benefit the country? d) What policies ought to be followed to control inflation and to improve the balance of payments? Let us see how Pademo, the PPPM, Monamo, and Unamo answered this question. 1. Concrete Strategies To Pull the Country Out of Economic Chaos Pademo a) Mozambique is already part of the world economic system, and, as such, a market economy must be the keyword. This is how our party sees it. The "Bretton Woods" institutions, notably the World Bank, WB, the IMF, and the Paris Club are, in general terms, the ones that "dictate" the rules of the game. In order to benefit from their financing, all countries that are members of those institutions must submit to their norms, but that does not mean that all recommendations issued by those monetary institutions must be followed blindly. We have always believed that it is possible to negotiate with the "big shots" [preceding two words in English]. From Pademo's point of view, our country's membership to those institutions should be planned so that the recovery of national industry can be assured, the export sector is encouraged to produce more, more jobs are created, administrative reform is implemented, and control is exerted over the outflow of foreign currency, as well as over imports. It will only be possible for this country to benefit from loans from the WB, IMF, and other organizations such as the "Paris Club" if the government draws up a plan to get the economy back on its feet, thereby allowing the gross national product, GNP, and exports to increase. Pademo believes that the relationship between the GNP and the foreign debt must be minimized and that efforts must be made for a more productive use of loans, which must not be used solely for importing luxury and unnecessary goods that can only benefit businessmen and their protectors, who are enriching themselves at the expense of the misery experienced by the majority of Mozambicans. Agrarian Policy The majority of the Mozambican population lives in the rural areas, where, coincidentally, social and economic development is poorest. It is important to work out plans for a rural sector that will be of use to the peasants and other rural people, whereby production is constantly guided by the goals that are sought in the areas of participation and division and which should be implemented through the establishment of new production relations in the agricultural sector. Given that the agrarian sector is very sensitive to climate factors and highly dependent on the degree of incentives available nationally and internationally, Pademo defends a policy of diversification of the agents who operate in that sector. In this way, the private, cooperative, and family sectors should be stimulated by the state, which will also be responsible for coordinating the work of those sectors, defining agrarian credit policies and prices, and buying agricultural surpluses to guarantee food security in the country. Agriculture currently demands the intervention of technologies, equipments, and working methods that are increasingly complex, which must be introduced for use by persons who obtain the necessary scientific and technological skills, thereby improving the levels of education at rural and agricultural schools. Furthermore, for the sector to become more dynamic, there is the need to apply specific guidance measures pertaining to agricultural, forestry, and livestock production, as well as to establish a policy that will ensure order is brought to the rural areas. Agriculture Pademo endorses the principle that the "cash crop" [preceding two words in English] and "food crop" [preceding two words in English] production areas must undergo proper planning, both at the central level and at the level of the federate states. As part of the colonial period's legacy, some parts of the country currently concentrate on "food crops" and others on "cash crops." The party will support improvements in the technologies to be used by those two agricultural production areas, because both will help the country earn foreign currency. Furthermore, there is the need to define an agricultural industrialization policy that will see such industrialization at work in the areas where those crops are produced, thereby encouraging a reduction in losses and waste of those products. To that end, the Federal Institute for Science, Research, and Technology, in conjunction with potential national and foreign investors, will define the appropriate technologies for the processing of previously identified agricultural products. In line with its land ownership policy, the party will issue land property deeds, but it will not enter into conflicts with the traditional system of each region. It will also define a land ownership policy for foreigners and for specific purposes. The most important aspects of that policy would have to be defined by the federal parliament. Any land transaction must be confirmed or made official by the Notary Services and can only be entered into by individuals in possession of a land property deed. Pademo will also promote the creation of associations for farmers or peasants who unite to defend their interests. Forestation It has been found over the last few years that enterprises, particularly foreign enterprises, have embarked on the wholesale destruction of our forests for the purpose of securing easy profits. In view of that, there is the need to define a forestation policy that will help bring order to the exploitation of those resources and that will also enhance silviculture planning. Within this context, the following are the most important points: - To define areas for production, conservation, and recreation; - To increase the area of productive forestation; - To expand tree planting areas, improve their protection, and improve pasture areas; - To exert rigorous control over landscapes, areas where land has been scorched, deforestation problems, and strive to defend local natural values; - To define a reforestation policy for wood-producing areas. Livestock Livestock helps decisively to strengthen the gross agricultural product. Its importance within the context of the agrarian economy must not be underestimated. The livestock sector is, however, one of the weakest in our country because of the effects of the fratricidal war that has decimated both domestic cattle and wildlife. The sector must receive significant investments so that priority can be given to increasing livestock numbers, sector productivity, and to foster a more correct integration of livestock into farming or other agricultural exploitation areas. Such investments must also benefit the family sector, which contributes substantially toward livestock production in our country. Within that context, the party will strive for a return of livestock to the rural areas and to the national game parks. The parastatal and private sectors must also be mobilized so they become actively involved in this area. To that end, Pademo plans to promote concrete action for a well-integrated operation. Such plans would include: - The adoption of realistic policies for the sectors dealing with resettling and feeding cattle. Nationally produced food resources must be promoted whenever possible; - With the help of cattle breeders, an effective program must be established in each federated state to provide hygiene care and protection for existing livestock; - To draw up regional plans that will guide livestock production so as to make livestock production part of development plans, but without ignoring the ecological balance of the areas involved; - To define the real potential and the correctness of livestock production in each area, as well as to place and guide intensive livestock exploitation in the areas of hog, goat, and poultry raising; - To promote the modernization of the premises and equipment used by livestock companies so as to make them technologically viable; - To promote the creation of associations of cattle farmers and livestock entrepreneurs whose help the state will seek for technical assistance and professional training purposes, thereby improving conditions for exploitation. Industrial, Natural Resources, and Environment Protection Policies Industry has a most important role to play in the creation of the material and social conditions on which the country's prosperity and the well-being of the citizens must rest. The rehabilitation of existing industrial assets and the development, or introduction, of other industries, are priority tasks for Pademo. Such operations will, to a great extent, function as the engine for the promotion of training and for the optimal use of human resources, with a view to promoting employment. Natural resources, whether they be in the mining, agricultural, or fishing sectors, must also be given attention so as to create the wealth that will absorb consumption needs. The social sector must also be expanded, whether it be housing, health care, education security, or cultural development. The country's industrial growth must be guaranteed by all federated states in a decentralized manner. Attention must always be given to the defense of the environment and industrial units must be integrated into the areas in which they operate. Within the Industrial Sector With regard to industry, the exploitation and use of natural resources, and environmental protection, Pademo plans to promote the following actions: - To adopt an industrial policy that will guarantee a balanced distribution of industries in the country, both at the level of federated states and at regional level. - To uphold an industrial policy that will be backed by a policy promoting academic, technical, and professional training, thereby ensuring that professionals find employment and that industry has the qualified workers it needs. - To define an industrial planning strategy that will take into account the fact that Mozambique is a third world country that produces raw materials for the international market. In view of that, specialization must be sought to ensure that the country produces profitable export goods. - To promote support and assistance in the form of loans and other incentives -- to be approved by central parliament -- to those large and small enterprises that give a positive contribution to social and economic development by attracting and investing capital, increasing production and productivity, and by creating jobs. - To take energetic measures, in coordination with the trade unions, against the reduction of surplus [nao justificado] labor, the closure of factories, and dismissals without just cause. The state must exert control and authority over those enterprises that show an incapacity to abide by their responsibilities concerning fiscal taxes and the payment of salaries. - To show commitment in helping Mozambican citizens establish small and intermediate enterprises by means of awarding them loans and granting them lighter fiscal duties, depending on the level of development of the areas where such enterprises are located. - To define the energy sector as decisive for a successful industrial policy and as being of strategic importance for the country's social and economic system. This sector must be strongly connected with great state corporations and the state must have powerful control over it. In this way, the oil, coal, and gas subsectors must be organized in the form of a national "holding" [preceding word in English]. The electricity subsector will also be reorganized so that it becomes a single federal enterprise that will be responsible for producing, storing, and distributing electricity throughout the country. It must also show the capacity to promote electrification throughout Mozambican territory. - To set single tariffs for the various forms of energy throughout the federation. There will be the need to review the prices currently charged to domestic and industrial consumers. - To promote and increase research concerning new ways of picking up and processing energy, particularly geothermal energy in areas where it can be put to good use, notably solar energy and in cases of regional power failures. - To promote norms and criteria that will guarantee the participation of administrative organs of the government of each federated state in the drawing up of industrial sector plans, programs, and contracts, as well as to follow up their implementation. - To define in legal terms the obligations of the larger enterprises in the training of personnel and in the areas of research and development, as well as to draw up a technology transfer code that will protect the national economy in its contracts with other countries. Within the Context of the Natural Resources Sector The natural resources of the federation are the property of the federal state and their use will be controlled by the federal state. It is up to the federated states to participate in the drawing up of plans and contracts, as well as to control the implementation of those plans and contracts. Natural resources include geothermal resources, mineral deposits, quarries, and waters (whether they be natural waters, mineral waters for industrial production, or natural mineral waters). c) [as published] Foreign investment must be attracted and encouraged by setting up an effective bureaucratic machine and by introducing a tax policy that will be both more attractive and more realistic. Pademo believes that there should be a division of the sectors where economic agents are to act and define taxes in accordance with the perceived level of risk in each given sector. d) Our party advocates a policy of economic integration for the peasant majority of Mozambican people. That majority currently contributes little toward the national economy. Inflation control requires political and economic measures that out party has already outlined and which it will submit to an elected assembly for approval. We did not think it was opportune to convey those plans to a newspaper before the electoral campaign has begun. One thing is certain: It will only be possible to improve the balance of payments by making local industry and the rendering of services both more effective and more competitive. PPPM "The specific strategy to pull the country out of economic chaos, to promote social progress, and to devise a foreign policy is to build federalism, meaning political decentralization including powers of a statutory nature, fundamental legislation, and political (?powers) in general, in addition to administrative, economic, and financial autonomy." [sentence as published] Monamo/PMSD "I. If Monamo/PMSD wins the legislative elections, it cannot, unfortunately, form a government, since only the candidate elected to the Presidency of the Republic can form the government, according to the existing political constitution which provides for a presidential regime, contrary to Monamo/PMSD's proposal for a semi- presidential regime, which combines the good aspects of both presidential and parliamentary regimes, according to the dictum "in medius virtus" [virtue is in the middle]. II. If Monamo/PMSD is called upon to form the government or even in opposition, it will always defend its political ideology, its government program of action, and its economic, political, and social plan. Having said this, we shall now answer DOMINGO's questionnaire. 1. Concrete Strategies To Pull the Country Out of Economic Chaos a) Taking into account the country's economic, political, and social situation, Monamo/PMSD feels, unfortunately, that it cannot ignore the International Monetary Fund's [IMF] conditions, since we owe a lot to this fund and other financial bodies. All the same, it will renegotiate the debt and readjust the rules of the game defining international financing to our country's realities, so that in the shortest period possible, we can establish an equilibrium and settle the debt, through surplus budgets and balances of payment. Monamo/PMSD will give priority to sources of financing for productive investment, which will check the export of foreign currency. Our country has the potential to produce cereals in abundance and, so, it does not need cereals from the international market. Even wheat can be produced in sufficient quantities to cover internal needs. We can make bread from wheat, corn, rice, sorghum, and cassava flour. The main sources of financing should be national, coming from state revenue obtained from the exploration of the Cahora Basssa Hydroelectric Dam, Pande gas, mineral resources, cashew nuts, and prawns. b) Agriculture will be the fundamental sector of our economy, in that it will absorb over 70 percent of our active population, who will be engaged in subsistence agriculture. Monamo/PMSD feels, however, that the plantation of cotton, oil-producing plants, cashew nut trees, sugar cane, tea, and tobacco should be industrialized to readjust the balance of payments. The energetic industrial sector (fuel, electricity, gas, and coal), salt pits, fishery, agricultural and livestock byproducts, exploration of precious stones and metallurgy in Tete region, which is rich in iron, coal, energy and water, are essential for the production of national steel. Trade will only be of major importance to the country if it involves internal and external trade of national food products, cereals, vegetables, meet, fish, prawns, drinks, textile, and others, without imports or with reduced imports of essential commodities, such as fuel, machinery, and technology. Tourism constitutes one of the major sources of foreign currency. To realize this, it will be necessary to rehabilitate existing hotels, offer good service, and engage in necessary advertisement and "marketing" [preceding word in English]. c) The first condition for foreign investment is the security of people and goods, economic stability, and an attractive code of foreign investment, which will also defend national sovereignty. In the field of national economics, the Mozambican state should provide certain fiscal benefits to foreign companies, as well as be willing to finance some of them, as long as they provide major opportunities for the employment of nationals. The extent of the project in national terms and its propensity to generate medium and small national satellite companies should also be considered. d) Inflation can only be controlled if there is greater productivity and subsequently greater national production, less devaluation of the metical, control in printing currency, a certain restriction in importing nonessential products and a foreign exchange policy which conforms with our financial conditions. Our balance of payments will for many years to come still be in deficit, but with a good service in our ports, railroads, revenues from emigrants, workers in South African mines, and tourism, a significant increase in the export of electricity from the Cahora Bassa Dam, Pande gas, cashew nuts, tea, sugar, cotton, manufacturing, and others, we can readjust and increase our balance of payments during the next 10 to 15 years." Unamo 1. The only strategy to remove the country from its present chaos is through a federal government. a) Mozambique is a big and rich country. There are many countries worldwide with a spirit of good will, ready to assist in the reconstruction and development of this country, in case relations with the IMF become sour. What is more, the country has its own sources of wealth. The only problem was mismanagement by the country's rulers. b) We must give priority to agriculture, small industries, trade, and tourism. The agricultural program should involve the following: Financing small farmers, small industries, small traders. Because our country is big and highly populated, it must be developed by the nationals themselves. Unfortunately, this is not being observed at the moment because of a lack of priorities. Tourism: Tourism should be encouraged by the state and supported by businessmen in the country, to increasingly attract the international community, thus enabling us to obtain more foreign exchange. c) Foreigners should be called upon to invest in the country as much as they can, considering how big and rich the country is. In turn, they should be allowed to remit a certain percentage to their home countries or where the capital came from. d) To control inflation and improve the balance of payments, we should increase production in the country. Thus, it will be easy to control foreign market forces and readjust our balance of payment accordingly. Considering that the government policy will be directed toward increasing production, it will not be necessary to import everything.
