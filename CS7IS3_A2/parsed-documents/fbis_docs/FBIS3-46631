FBIS3-46631 "dreas002__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-002-A Document Type:Daily Report 4 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Lack of Depth, Breadth in Deregulation Claimed New Procedural Law Urged 942A0017C Tokyo SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI in Japanese 2 Oct 93 pp 20-21--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0017C Tokyo SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Article by Eiichi Takahashi] [Text] Deregulation without substance will not stand up. Regardless of the changes in the text, that alone does not represent a change. The bureaucrats are good at that. This is what Chairman Masao Ogura of the Yamato Transport Co. points out. It is apropos. With the enactment of the aforementioned two laws on goods distribution, the transport charges in the land transportation industry were "deregulated" from the permit system to the notification system, but the substance has not changed at all. In the general language sense, it is normally considered that a report is complete if a cost account statement is attached and the intended date of implementation is indicated, based on the rules of the government agency. However, the language sense of the bureaucrat is different. Simply stated, the dealer submits the documents, the official checks them and, if everything seems to be in order, he stamps them as accepted. The notification is completed only if the stamp of acceptance is applied. This appears to be the language sense of the bureaucrat. In that sense, there is substantially no difference whether a permit becomes a license, or a license becomes a notification. Hidden Essence of Regulations Moreover, the problem was that the standard for the official's judgment of approval was not clear. As is well known, costs differ widely, depending on the business category, scale and management efforts of the respective enterprises. Regardless of how capable the Japanese bureaucrat, it is almost impossible for him to accurately grasp the cost structure of an individual company based on a sheet of document. Nonetheless, he concludes that it is either okay or not okay. From the standpoint of the individual company, it is natural to be dissatisfied, and it feels an urgent need to "become better acquainted" with the bureaucrat. It also results in further distrust of government agencies. What is worse is that, despite submitting documents, it does not know when it will receive a reply. When the Yamato Transport Co. acquired two route permits, the Transportation Ministry reviewed the request documents only after it became the object of administrative litigation. Also, the most insidious is the so-called administrative guidance. There is no legal basis for administrative guidance, and guidance is often offered verbally. The issuance of documents is skirted to avoid leaving evidence. During the oil black market cartel incident, and also during the recent securities scandal, the government gave its implicit approval and guidance, but when the incidents were exposed, it persisted in professing its "innocence." Also, among the established dealers were seen moves as an industry group to deter new entries, approach the agencies to protect their vested interests, and to rely on administrative guidance. An aspect of connivance between the bureaucracy and the industry from the standpoint of the "established order" cannot be denied. Transparency of Administration Is Urgently Needed Among the advanced nations of the West, most have established administrative procedural laws and freedom of information laws to prevent such evil practices. In Japan also, there is a rising demand in recent years to enact a similar administrative procedures law. In 1979, the "council on preventive measures concerning suspected aircraft scandals," which was created in reaction to the Lockheed incident, proposed strengthening the General Administrative Procedures Law. The crime by a prime minister resulted in self-reflection on unclear administration as the breeding ground for a cozy alliance between the government, bureaucracy, and industrial circles. The movement toward legislation picked up momentum after the Second Administrative Reform Council's proposal in 1983 on "the establishment of an ad hoc specialized investigation and deliberation organization" for the enactment of an administrative procedures act, and after the followup Third Administraive Reform Council submitted to the prime minister in December 1991 "a report on the drafting of a fair and clear administrative procedures law." In May 1993, the Miyazawa cabinet made a decision on submission of an administrative procedures act to the Diet. On 4 June, the gist was explained at the lower house plenary session. However, as is well known, it met a doomed fate amid the passage of a no-confidence vote in the cabinet and a tendency toward dissolution of the lower house. The administrative procedures law bill to be submitted to the Diet consists of the same content, in principle, as the previous proposal. Its characteristics are generally as follows. First, the purpose of the law is to ensure fairness in administrative actions and to improve clarity. Simply stated, the purpose is to form clear rules regarding regulations and administrative guidance, which had been left chiefly up to the convenient interpretation of the government agencies. Specifically, they consist of three pillars. First, to ensure swift and clear processing. Toward that end, 1) to publicly announce concrete judgments concerning permits and licenses; 2) to decide and publicly announce standard inspection periods from petition to disposition; 3) to begin inspections without delay on reception of petitions, and to avoid neglect of petitioned proposals and delays in processing; 4) when rejecting a petition, to indicate the reasons by letter. The second pillar involves procedures on so-called nonprofit disposition, including cancellation of permits and business suspensions. In principle, 1) the reasons for disposition are to be indicated with documentation; 2) perusal of proof materials used as the basis are to be permitted; and 3) opportunities for pleas are to guaranteed. These are all matters of course regarding disposition, but the fact that they failed to be implemented is characteristic of Japan's administration. The third pillar concerns administrative guidance. It has been decided that: 1) The jurisdictional scope will not be exceeded. 2) Administrative guidance is an action premised on voluntary cooperation by the petitioner, and unprofitable treatment based on lack of obedience will be prohibited. 3) Administrative guidance with permits/licenses as the backdrop will be banned. 4) In addition to providing documents on request, the spirit, content, and responsible official will be clarified. Because both the ruling and opposition parties have no reservations as far as the Administrative Procedures Law is concerned, "the era of `nemawashi' [spadework] has ended" (Managenent and Coordination Agency). Therefore, although an indeterminate element concerning the conclusion of the political reform act bill does exist, the probability of enactment may be considered to be good. Of course, as was mentioned before, the behavior of the government agencies will not necessarily change instantly after enactment of the bill. There is an aspect of politics and the industry circles coexisting in cozy comfort amid the permits and licenses, and a change of the established order is more difficult than the formulation of resolutions. The principal corporations licensed by MITI are listed as follows: - Japan Federation of Economic Federations [Keidanren] - Japan Federation of Employers Associations [Nikkeiren] - Japan Committee for Economic Development - Kansai Economic Federation - Japan Junior Chamber Inc. - Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry - Mutual Aid Association - Japan Productivity Center [JPC] - Business Research Institute (BRI) - Business Productivity Research Institute (BPF) - Japan Overseas Business Association - 45th Anniversary Commemorative Foundation for Promotion of Taniguchi Kogyo Company - Japan Value Engineering Association - Japan ABC Association - Association of Management Consultants of Japan (AMCJ) - Japan Volunteer Chains Association - Japan Chain Stores Association - Federation of Cooperative Associations - Japan Home Sales Association - Japan Mail Order Association - Japan Federation of Consumer Credit Companies - Japan Credit Industry Association - Distribution Problems Research Association - Japan Supermarkets Association - Sales Promotion Bureau (SPB) - Japan Self-Service Association - Store Systems Association - Japan Shopping Centers Association - Advertising Federation of Japan - Japan Advertising Review Organization (JARO) - Newspaper Advertising Review Conference (NARC) - Japan Advertising Agencies Association - Japan Magazine Advertising Association - Japan Advertising Association - Japan Advertising Council Inc. - National Federation of Product and Tourism Promotion Organizations - Japan Fair Trade Council for Tourist Souvenirs - Japan Tourist Souvenirs Federation - Japan Fitness Industry Association - Japan Resort Clubs Association - Japan Preparatory Schools Association - Industrial Health Promotion Association - Japan Safety Accessories Association (JSAA) - High-Pressure Gas Safety Association - Industrial Gas Detector and Alarm Industry Association - Japan LP Gas Plants Association - Japan LP Gas Federation - Mutual Aid Agency of Japan for LP Gas Safety - Japan LP Gas Wholesalers Association - Japan LP Gas Instrument Inspection Association For example, there are six licensed corporations in the LP gas-related field alone. Like the oil and black market cartel problems, if administrative guidance shifts by using the licensed corporations under the name of the industry's independent (voluntary) rules, the unclarity will only increase. Even if it does not, there will be criticism that administrative guidance, which previously had no legal basis, is given a "legal basis" within the scope of jurisdictional affairs by this law. However, despite considering the apprehensions and criticisms, enactment of the Administrative Procedures Law represents a major step forward. In effect, it is probably a question of implementation. The answer is the self-discipline and awareness of the industrial circles and the individual citizen.
