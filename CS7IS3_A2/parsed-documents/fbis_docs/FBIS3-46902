FBIS3-46902 "dreas004__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-004-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX Japan `Secret' Agreement on Port Relocation Alleged OW0301195594 Naha RYUKYU SHIMPO in Japanese 27 Dec 93 Evening Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0301195594 Naha RYUKYU SHIMPO Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Urasoe and the Naha Defense Facilities Administration Bureau [NDFAB] have reached a secret verbal agreement on the relocation of Naha Military Port to Urasoe. This was disclosed on 27 December by a RYUKYU SHIMPO probe. Former Urasoe Mayor Noboru Higa verbally promised Duchu Kobo, the former chief of NDFAB, to that effect; NDFAB appears to have kept this memo. The Foreign Ministry, the Defense Agency, and the Defense Facilities Administration Agency are said to be pressing Urasoe to accept relocation of Naha Military Port to the city. However, the actual relocation of the military port to the city would make it possible to link the military port directly with Makiminato Supply Depot (Camp Kinser), thereby further consolidating the military port rather than returning it. The secret verbal agreement will certainly draw a backlash from democratic organizations. Answering an inquiry from RYUKYU SHIMPO about the secret verbal agreement, Urasoe Mayor Seiko Gibo admitted the existence of the secret verbal agreement. Commenting on the relocation of the military port to the city, he stated: "I have inherited the former mayor's municipal administration, but the relocation of the military port to our city is another question." In this way, he objects to the relocation. Some businessmen and politicians in the city have also whispered about the secret verbal agreement. Naha is accusing Urasoe of committing itself to such a secret verbal agreement, saying: "Urasoe wharf is located in the Naha Port harbor area; the relocation of the military port to the wharf will only serve to consolidate the military port on Okinawa." Meanwhile, NDFAB denies the existence of the secret verbal agreement, saying: "Seven or eight years ago Urasoe made an informal proposal in connection with the relocation of Naha Military Port, but the city has since taken no follow-up actions." Urasoe is promoting the development project of western coastal regions, the most important development project for the city. The development project is designed to reclaim about 120 ha [hectare] of coastal area north of the Okinawa Wholesale and Commercial Complex in Seishu, Urasoe. However, the coastal area faces coastal areas off Camp Kinser, areas which are designated by U.S. forces on Okinawa as restricted waters. These restricted waters stand in the way of reclamation. All information RYUKYU SHIMPO has gathered indicates the "secret verbal agreement appeared aimed at swapping the U.S. forces' decision to lift restrictions on the waters for the relocation of Naha Military Port to Urasoe wharf." NDFAB is said to have asked the Okinawa Prefectural Government to secure the 50-ha site, almost the same acreage as that of Naha Military Port, in return for the relocation of the military port. The acreage exceeds the 40 ha Urasoe plans to reclaim under the first phase of the development project. Urasoe claims: "Even if we have constructed the wharf, civilians are largely restricted in using it."
