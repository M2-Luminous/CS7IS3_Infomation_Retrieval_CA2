The unidentified correspondent notes that Marju Lauristin, the minister of social affairs, was surrounded by pensioners eager to voice their grievances and she promised to convey their problems to the government, which is scheduled to meet this morning. The correspondent then interviews Lauristin who says that the pensions issue is a priority for the government but extra money is hard to find. "What we have done now," she explains, "is to provide compensation totalling 200 million kroons for domestic bills and there is a law on increasing pensions being debated now -- another 200 millions are needed for that. To the population at large this will seem like a crumb to a beggar. And public discontent is particularly bolstered by the fact that incomes have become so different and these differences in wages and incomes can be as much as 20 or 30 times."
