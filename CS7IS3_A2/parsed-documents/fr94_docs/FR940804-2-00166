FR940804-2-00166 FR940804-2-00087 Applicants' Conditions Applicants have consented to the following conditions if the requested order is granted: 1. A majority of the Board of Trustees or Board of Directors of each Fund (each, a ``Board'') shall consist of persons who are not ``interested persons'' of the Fund, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the Commission, except that, if this condition is not met by reason of the death, disqualification, or bona fide resignation of any trustee or director, then the operation of this condition shall be suspended: (a) for a period of 45 days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board; (b) for a period of 60 days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order upon application. 2. Each Board will monitor its Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests of the Contract owners of all of the Accounts investing in the Fund. A material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons, including: (a) an action by any state insurance regulatory authority; (b) a change in applicable federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action or interpretative letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (c) an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (d) the manner in which the investments of the Fund are managed; (e) a difference in voting instructions given by owners of variable annuity contracts and owners of variable life insurance contracts; or (f) a decision by an insurer to disregard the voting instructions of Contract owners. 3. The Participating Insurance Companies and MFS (or any other investment advisor of a Fund) will report any potential or existing conflicts to the Board. Participating Insurance Companies and MFS (or any other investment advisor of a Fund) will be responsible for assisting the appropriate Board in carrying out its responsibilities under these conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for the Board to consider any issues raised, including information as to a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard voting instructions of Contract owners. The responsibility to report such information and conflicts and to assist the Board will be a contractual obligation of the Participating Insurance Companies under the agreements governing participation in the Funds and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of Contract owners. 4. If it is determined by a majority of the Board, or by a majority of its disinterested trustees or directors, that an irreconcilable material conflict exists, the relevant Participating Insurance Companies shall, at their expense and to the extent reasonably practicable, take steps necessary to remedy or eliminate the irreconcilable material conflict, including: (a) withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the Accounts from the Fund and reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium including another portfolio of the Fund or another Fund, or submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contract owners; and, as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group ( i.e. , variable annuity contract owners or variable life insurance contract owners) that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to the affected variable contract owners the option of making such a change; and (b) establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account. The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a Board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under the agreements governing their participation in the Funds. The responsibility to take such remedial action shall be carried out with a view only to the interests of Contract owners. For purposes of this Condition Four, a majority of the disinterested members of the applicable Board shall determine whether any proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict, but, in no event will the Fund or MFS be required to establish a new funding medium for any Contract. Further, no Participating Insurance Company shall be required by this Condition Four to establish a new funding medium for any Contract if any offer to do so has been declined by a vote of a majority of the affected Contract owners.
