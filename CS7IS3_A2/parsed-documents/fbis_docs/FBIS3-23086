After noting some similarities between the situations of the two countries, the writer determines that "there are many differences between the two cases, both at the general social level and at the level of the confrontation itself." On the social level, Huwaydi says that, unlike Egyptians, the people of Algeria are generally inclined to extremism, largely mobilized against the government, and lack social harmony. And unlike Egypt, Algeria has a different political experience, a weaker central authority, and an Army that is the main player in the country's politics. Turning to differences in the nature of the current clash in both countries, Huwaydi notes first that unlike the Islamic movement in Egypt, Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], established in 1989, has little political experience. The 60-year experience of the Islamic movement in Egypt, he writes, "has reflected on its political language and positive attitude toward the issue of democracy. Its cadres have been active in all fields and are occupying important positions in society's institutions." Huwaydi then maintains that the parties involved in the conflict in Algeria are different from those in Egypt. He says that while the clash against the government in Algeria involves many forces and sectors, with the Islamists only at the forefront, "the clash in Egypt is not as vague. It has become clear so far that the clash is between the government and some Islamic elements; no other sectors of society are involved." The writer adds: "The Islamist group confronting the government in Algeria is primarily the FIS, which is the biggest Islamic faction in the country. But the clash in Egypt involves marginal factions in the Islamic movement, not the major faction represented by the Muslim Brotherhood. This means that while the biggest Islamic bloc is the main party to the clash in Algeria, the biggest Islamic bloc in Egypt is outside the confrontation. No matter where the Muslim Brotherhood stands in the line of political opposition, it is certainly not party to the armed violence in the country." He says: "It is astonishing that some of the media trumpets in Egypt insist on expanding the scope of confrontation between the Islamic movement and the government by insisting on abolishing any differences between the various [Islamic] factions and branding them all with terrorism and extremism." Huwaydi says the issue at the center of the confrontation is also different in the two cases: While the confrontation in Algeria is mainly a struggle for power, "the clash in Egypt is a series of settling scores and reactions, and power is not its main objective. The evidence is that the assassination of former President al-Sadat was directed against him personally. The whole government was around him, and it was easy for the culprits, if they really wanted to take over power, to take advantage of the situation and achieve their purposes in one way or another, but this did not happen." Finally, the writer maintains that the struggle in Algeria essentially revolves around the country's identity and inclinations, particularly its position toward the sensitive issues of Arabism and Islam. He notes that a powerful trend in the government adopts a negative attitude toward the two issues.
