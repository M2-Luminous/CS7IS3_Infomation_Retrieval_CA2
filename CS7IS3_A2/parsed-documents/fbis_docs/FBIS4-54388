At this important moment, it is right for the everyone, including the defense services personnel, to ask the following questions: What is happening in our country? Who are the persons most responsible for what is going on in the country? What caused these things to happen? How can the country be extricated from these crises? The political, economic, and social conditions have been deteriorating. Burma has been listed as the least developed nation in the world and the poorest nation in Asia. Amid these political crises, the government which the people are demanding and yearning for is yet to emerge. The people are facing social problems and human right violations. Dear parents and people: Who are the persons most responsible for these events? It could not denied that General Ne Win, Senior General Saw Maung, the present generals and colonels of the State Law and Order Restoration Council, and SLORC Chairman Sr. Gen. Than Shwe, the leaders of the military clique which have been ruling Burma for 30 years, are responsible for these events. These events took place because they took the wrong path after the 1962 coup. They practiced the Burmese way to socialism, which said the precepts could be observed only when the belly is full. In the end, the people have reached the point where they cannot fill their bellies nor observe the basic precepts of everyday life. Dear parents and people: The Defense Services is interfering in government administration and economy, which are irrelevant to the Defense Services, while going astray from its original responsibilities of defending the nation and fulfilling the desires of the people. The generals, colonels, and former military officers are also taking the high official positions. It is the beginning of the destruction of the country. Instead of resolving the political problems by political means, the Defense Services is increasing the military budget excessively and (?establishing militarism in the country). Now the generals have also created their own dollar market. Dear Parents and People: There is only one way to extricate Burma from all these crises. That is, the Defense Services has to stop continuing its previous mistakes and find a solution by holding discussions with the democratic force led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the national ethnic forces. This is the only answer. If the Defense Services continue to meet with only whom it wants to meet and do what it wants to do, then the national interests, including the interests of the Defense Services, will be affected. Dear parents and people: Up to this date, the SLORC has ignored the wishes of the people and the 1990 election results. It is a disgrace for the SLORC to say to the international community that the election was free and fair at first, and then to say later that a firm constitution is needed after the NLD [National League for Democracy] led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi won the landslide victory. We strongly believe that the political power must originate with the people. Due to the changes in the world and the political changes in Burma, there is no doubt that people will get the democracy which they are yearning for. Not along ago, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi mentioned that we cannot say all the problems will be resolved on their own once democracy is achieved, but when democracy is achieved all people will have the right to contribute their utmost in the development of the country. We all must understand this. Help one another. Especially, people have to be aware of SLORC's attempt to drive a wedge between the people and the Defense Services, among the people, and among the students. Continue to struggle with your unwearied diligence. Dear parents and people: I extend my best wishes for your health and prosperity.
