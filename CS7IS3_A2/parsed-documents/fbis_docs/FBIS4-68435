The highest rate of increases in prices for goods was registered in cities of the East Siberian economic region, and for for-fee services for the population--in the cities of Northwestern, West Siberian, and Far Eastern regions. Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in the consumer market were as follows (as a percentage of the preceding observation date): 03/22 03/29 04/05 Average daily price rise April March Consumer goods 102.1 101.8 102.2 0.31 0.27 and services including: foodstuffs 101.4 101.2 101.4 0.20 0.20 nonfood items 102.8 102.6 101.9 0.29 0.34 for-fee 103.5 101.6 111.9 1.62 0.45 services for the population Foodstuffs. Over the period 29 March to 5 April prices in organized and nonorganized trade rose by 1.5 percent and 1.3 percent. Price changes by main categories of food products are shown below (as a percentage of the preceding observation date): Total Including: in organized in nonorganized trade trade All food products 101.4 101.5 101.3 including: Meat and meat 100.9 100.7 101.4 products Fish and fish 101.7 101.7 98.7 products Milk and milk 102.2 102.9 97.2 products Eggs 100.2 100.4 98.7 Sugar 99.8 99.8 100.0 Bread and bakery 105.8 105.8 products Cereals and 103.4 103.4 102.4 macaroni items Vodka 99.5 99.5 98.8 Potatoes and 104.8 106.1 103.5 vegetables In organized trade, similar to the preceding month, vegetable prices rose at an anticipatory rate: onions--by 14 percent, fresh cabbage--by 11 percent, and carrots--by 7 percent. A high rate of price increases remained with respect to bread and bakery products (5-7.5 percent). A higher rate of price increases than in March was registered with respect to milk products (2.7-5 percent). There was practically no change over the week in prices for meat, butter, vegetable oil, sugar, eggs, and vodka. Similar to organized trade, the greatest price increases in nonorganized trade were registered with respect to fresh produce: prices for onions went up by 11 percent, fresh cabbage--by 6 percent, and garlic--by 5 percent. The rate of prices rises with respect to meat increased somewhat as compared to March (1.4 percent). Prices for milk products remained practically unchanged. The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs increased over the week by 2.7 percent and as of 5 April amounted to 45,500 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured a factor of 4.0; the highest cost was registered in Magadan (R122,400) and the lowest--in Ulyanovsk (R27,800). In terms of the cost of the consumer basket, St. Petersburg and Moscow ranked 33th and 37th among 132 monitored cities (R49,700 and R49,100 on a monthly basis). Nonfood Items As in March, prices for nonfood items rose at a somewhat higher rate. Prices for some medicines continued to rise at a high rate--10 percent. Prices for garments, knitwear, and footwear rose over the week by 1.7-2 percent. For-Fee Services for the Population At the beginning of April rates of for-fee services for the population increased considerably. Apartment rents in Russia on average rose 23.9 percent; the cost of urban and rail transportation--15-19 percent, and that of basic residential telephone service--12-17 percent. Rents in municipally owned residential buildings in St. Petersburg, Vladimir, Saransk, Kurgan, Blagoveshchensk, and cities in Tatarstan increased several-fold. In Surgut they jumped from R100 to R255 per square meter. The cost of municipal services also went up considerably in these cities. Urban bus fares in Belgorod, Maykop, Khabarovsk, Komsomolsk-na-Amure, and Samara increased by a factor of 2.5 to five; rail transportation fares in Orel, Yaroslavl, Saransk, Rostov-na-Donu, and Stavropol--by a factor of two to 2.5. While fees for attending preschool facilities increased in Russia as a whole on average by 13.8 percent over the week, in Tyumen, Surgut, and Maykop they increased more than twofold, and in Voronezh--fourfold. Wholesale Prices for Industrial Products The index of wholesale prices for industrial products was lower in March than in February, and measured 110 percent. Over three months of this year (as compared to December 1993) prices increased 1.5-fold. In practically all industrial sectors (with the exception of electric power generation, nonferrous metallurgy, and chemistry) prices rose at a slower pace than in February of this year. Prices rose slower with respect to fuel industry products. Oil prices increased over the month by 15 percent, petroleum products--by 6 percent, and coal--by 8 percent. At the end of March the average price of coal in the main coal-producing regions--Kemerovo and Rostov Oblasts--amounted to R16,000-18,000 per tonne, and in Republic of Komi--R22,000 per tonne; oil in Tyumen Oblast--R65,000. Producer wholesale price of gas amounted to R5,400 per 1,000 cubic meters, gasoline--R148,000, and diesel fuel--R136,000 per tonne. Overall over the first quarter, fuel industry wholesale prices increased 1.7-fold. Higher prices for fuel and products of their processing continued to affect the cost of electric power. By the end of the quarter electric power rates as compared to December 1993 increased 1.6-fold and amounted on average for all categories of consumers to about R29 per kw-hour. The main increases in electric power rates in March occurred with respect to electric power delivered to industrial consumers and municipal services--by more than 20 percent. As during the preceding two months, wholesale prices for consumer goods rose at a slower rate than those for producer goods, and amounted on average to 9 percent. Wholesale prices of milk and meat products increased over the month by 7-9 percent. Over the quarter, prices in bread-baking, butter-making, cheese-making, and milk industry rose by a factor of 1.5-1.6. Freight rates at all types of transportation increased by 8 percent in March of this year, including by rail--by 21 percent, pipeline--by 11.5 percent, and automotive--by 7.5 percent. Air freight rates remained practically unchanged. As compared to December 1993, freight rates increased 1.8-fold, including rail transport--by 79 percent, pipeline--by 75 percent, and automotive--by 73 percent. Industry In the first quarter of this year Russian industry produced R55 trillion worth of goods in current prices, including in March--R21 trillion worth. The physical volume of production declined by 24.9 percent as compared to the first quarter of last year (in the first quarter of 1993 production declined as compared to the analogous period of 1992 by 19.3 percent), including by 23.1 percent in January, 24.1 percent in February, and 27.4 percent in March. During the first quarter it became clear that the production decline is predominantly of a structural nature. This manifested itself in the fact that the volume of production became increasingly predicated more on solvent demand than on resource potential. As a result, the degree of any particular sector's reaction to the emerging market situation varied. While gas production remained practically at last year's level, sectors in the fuel and energy complex reduced production of oil and coal by 9-15 percent. At the same time the output of many basic categories of machine-building products and a number of light industry goods dropped almost by half; chemical industry output--by 25-30 percent, and that of ferrous metallurgy--by 20-35 percent. Production of basic categories of foodstuffs declined by 10-20 percent. Over January-March 1994, of 406 most important categories of products counted in periodic reports, average daily production, as compared to January-March of 1993: --increased with respect to 26 items, (including foundry machines, machines used in municipal services, production lines and automated systems for measuring and packaging dry foods, dough-making components and machines, cash registers, apathite concentrate, cinematographic and photo film, polyvynilchloride resin, freezers, cotton fabrics, cooking salt, high fat-content cheeses and feta cheese, and mayonnaise), or 6 percent of the total number; --decreased with respect to 373 items, or 92 percent of the total number. With respect to 281 items (69 percent of the total number), production declined by one-quarter or more; among them are lubricant oils, sheet rolled metal, high-grade cold-rolled steel, metal cord, fire-resistant items, low-power electric motors, light bulbs, mine electric carts, self-propelled tower cranes, elevators, freight and passenger rail cars, chemical fiber and thread, protein fodder additive, phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer, commercial wood, lumber, marches, cement, roof slate, construction brick, gypsum, asbestos, sewing and washing machines, photo cameras, woolen and silk fabrics, outer knitwear, footwear, lump sugar, macaroni items, canned fish and meat, cereals, vodka, and hard liquor. Over the elapsed period there was no production of computer control systems, coal-cutters, yard and industrial diesel locomotives, scrapers, self-propelled mower-crushers, grain loaders, and flax-harvesting combines. By the end of the quarter, stoppages at individual production facilities had occurred at almost 5,000 enterprises. And while at the beginning of last year the prevailing cause of stoppages were shortages of input materials, components, and fuel, in the first quarter of this year the main cause of enterprise stoppages were difficulties in selling output (more than 60 percent of all losses). In a number of sectors distribution difficulties were the result of lack of consumer demand stemming from a decline in public need for the output produced (conversion); in others, first and foremost those serving the consumer goods sector--reorientation of solvent demand toward more competitive imported goods. In the fuel and power generation sectors in January-March of this year extraction (production) of the main varieties of energy resources continued to decline. Overall, 75.7 million tonnes of oil, including gas condensate, were produced over the quarter (85 percent as compared to the first quarter of 1993), 76.3 million tonnes (91 percent), and 165 billion cubic meters of gas (99.2 percent); electric power generation declined by 4 percent as compared to the first quarter of last year. In ferrous metallurgy, in January-March of the year, as compared to the corresponding period of last year, production lagged with respect to pig iron smelting--20 percent, steel--26 percent, production of finished rolled metal--24 percent, and steel pipe--48 percent. In machine building, in the first quarter of this year with respect to almost half the items counted in periodic reports output amounted to 40 percent or less of the level of the first quarter of last year. Production of large electric machinery over the elapsed quarter as compared to the first quarter of 1993 declined by 46 percent, metal-cutting machine tools--by 50 percent, forge presses--by 68 percent, freight cars--by 62 percent, trolley buses--by 52 percent, and passenger cars--by 31 percent; production of electric travelling cranes and self-propelled cranes declined by almost two thirds, of bulldozers--almost by half, and production of scrapers was suspended altogether. In the chemical and petrochemical industry, overall during the quarter output of the main raw material products--synthetic ammonia, sulfuric acid, and caustic soda--amounted to 72-79 percent of the level of last year's first quarter, and of calcinated soda--51 percent. Mineral fertilizer production dropped by 28 percent as compared to first quarter of 1993; chemical thread and fiber--by 53 percent; and automotive tires--by 44 percent. In the chemical-pharmaceutical industry, production of ampicillin amounted to a little more than one-third on that of January-March of last year; validol and levomicitin--about one-half, and euphillin--two-thirds. At the same time, production of analgine, papaverine, and nitroglycerine increased as compared to the first quarter of 1993. In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry in January-March of this year, as compared to the corresponding period of last year the take-out volume of timber, including round timber, declined by almost one-third, which led to a decline in the production of lumber by 30 percent; the output of commercial cellulose dropped by 34 percent, paper--by 26 percent, and cardboard--by 39 percent. Production of effective substitutes for commercial wood, in particular, cement-chip panels and technical wood chips for the production of cellulose and wood pulp declined over the indicated period by 41-51 percent; of hardwood-fiber board and packaging cardboard--by one-third, and wood-chip board--by 23 percent. In the construction materials industry over the first quarter of this year as compared to the corresponding period of last year the output of cement declined by 35 percent, soft roofing and insulation materials--by 44 percent; brick--by 26 percent; window glass--by 41 percent; wall materials, prefabricated ferro-concrete, construction and technical lime, and porous fillers--by 29-34 percent; and high-grade asbestos and mineral cotton--by 50-55 percent. Production of home appliances and fixtures--heating radiators and convectors, gas stoves, and bath tubs--declined by 36-52 percent. In light industry in the first quarter, as compared to the first quarter of last year, output of fabrics declined by 19 percent, hosiery and knitwear--by 28 percent, and footwear--by 55 percent. There was a considerable decline in the production of most items in the garment industry: coats, short coats, and skirts--by 61-68 percent, light coats and jackets--by 53-58 percent, and slacks and suits--by 41-42 percent. In the production of complex home appliances in January-March of this year as compared to the same period of last year there was an increase in the output of freezers, two- and three-chamber refrigerators, and digital laser disk players. Output of the most important items for cultural and household use declined: washing machines--by 43 percent, tape recorders--by 60 percent, television sets--by 24 percent, and porcelain, stoneware, and majolica tableware and kitchenware--by 19 percent. Over the elapsed period of the year there was a drop in production of goods for small farms, house-adjacent plots and gardens: engines and motorized cultivators--by 10 percent, and mini-tractors--by more than one-quarter. Among food items, in the first quarter of 1994, as compared to the corresponding period of last year, there was an increase in the output of high fat-content cheeses and feta cheese, as well as mayonnaise. Production of most foodstuffs declined as compared to the first quarter of 1993: meat--by 25 percent, whole-milk products--by 17 percent, butter--by 33 percent, vegetable oil--by 11 percent, flour--by 16 percent, and cereals--by 35 percent. There was a considerable drop as compared with January-March of last year in the production of confectionery and macaroni items, canned meat, starch, and baker's yeast (by 22-39 percent), lump sugar and food concentrates (by 56 percent and 47 percent, respectively). The output of bread and bakery items dropped by 14 percent. Production of vodka and hard liquor amounted to half of that for the first quarter of 1993, including 57 percent in March. The Agro-Industrial Complex Farms in the southern regions of Russia began sowing early spring crops. According to reports from localities, because of the long spring and heavy spring high-waters, the sowing campaign in a number of territories began approximately two weeks later than last year. Readying equipment for operation is proceeding more slowly than preceding years. At this point almost one-fifth of tractors, soil-tilling equipment, and seeders are still awaiting repair at Russian farms. Industrial and distribution organizations have shipped mineral fertilizer and fuel for agricultural needs in the following volumes (millions of tonnes): January-March 1994 Including March shipped as % of shipped as % of January-March March February 1993 1994 Materials 1.2 43 0.4 37 93 containing lime--total Peat outtake 15.2 41 4.9 36 103 Automotive 0.7 50 0.3 46 121 gasoline Diesel fuel 1.4 48 0.5 39 119 The decline in shipped quantities of indicated material resources was a result of lower production volume, as well as poor solvency of agricultural consumers. As compared to the corresponding period of last year, purchases in January-March of this year dropped by more than half. As farms received credit for the conduct of the spring sowing campaign, shipments of fuel for agricultural needs increased over the past month as compared to the preceding one by 19-21 percent. Agricultural enterprises have been buying fuel and lubricants more actively lately. In March of this year farm petroleum products warehouses received 58 percent more diesel fuel and 44 percent more gasoline than in February. At the same time the volume of petroleum products purchased by enterprises as a whole over the first quarter was lower than that of preceding years.

At agricultural farms, which are the main producers of animal husbandry products, the volume of production of meat and milk declined by 15-18 percent, and eggs--by 6 percent. Production of animal husbandry products at personal plots remained at the same level as the corresponding period of last year. A decline in the animal herd is taking place mainly at agricultural enterprises where the rate of herd reduction with respect to horned cattle and swine amounted to 11-13 percent, cows--6-7 percent, and sheep and goats--22-23 percent. Remainders of fodder per standard head of cattle amounted at these farms by the beginning of April of this year on average to 6 quintals of feed units, as compared to 5.3 quintals of feed units by this time last year. In the first quarter of this year procurement organizations purchased for state stocks from all producers 28 percent less livestock and poultry, 21 percent less milk, and 6 percent fewer eggs than during the same period last year. At the same time, agricultural enterprises increased sales of animal husbandry products at farmers markets, through their own trade network, the public catering system, and other channels. Sales of Fresh Produce By 28 March of this year agricultural enterprises sold through all distribution channels 17,500 tonnes of greenhouse vegetables (24,200 tonnes in 1992). They sold 12,800 tonnes of such products to procurement organizations (73 percent of the total volume), which is one-third less than last year. Greenhouse including: vegetables cucumbers greengrocer items 1992 22.5 18.9 3.3 1993 19.9 15.8 3.9 1994 12.8 10.9 1.8 1994 as % of 64 69 45 1993 Sales of these products through other channels increased. Since the beginning of the year 4,700 tonnes of greenhouse produce (27 percent of the total volume of sales), as compared to 4,200 tonnes (18 percent) last year, were sold through farmers markets, their own trade enterprises, and the public catering system. The greatest decline in procurement of greenhouse produce (three- to fourfold) occurred in Tambov, Penza, and Samara Oblasts. Procurement of greenhouse produce at the farms in Belgorod Oblast and Mordvinia amounted to only 4-12 percent of last year's level. Standard of Living The monetary income of the population over the first quarter amounted to R53 trillion and was nine times greater than in the first quarter of 1993. The share of the payroll fund in the total volume of monetary income declined from 65 percent in the first quarter of 1993 to 59 percent in the first quarter of 1994. The population's disposable income (income less mandatory payments) increased by about 10 percent after factoring in the consumer price index. Distribution of the Russian Federation population by per capita income was as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |January-March 1994 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |million persons |as | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total population |148.4 |100.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including with per capita monthly monetary income, R thousands: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |up to 20.0 |0.7 |0.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |20.1-40.0 |10.0 |6.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |40.1-60.0 |20.7 |13.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |60.1-80.0 |23.4 |15.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |80.1-100.0 |21.1 |14.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |100.1-120.0 |17.2 |11.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |120.1-140.0 |13.4 |9.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |140.1-160.0 |10.2 |6.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |160.1-180.0 |7.7 |5.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |180.1-200.0 |5.7 |3.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |200.1-220.0 |4.3 |2.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |220.1-240.0 |3.2 |2.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |240.1-260.0 |2.5 |1.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |260.1-280.0 |1.9 |1.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |280.1-300.0 |1.4 |1.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |over 300.0 |5.0 |3.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In January-March of 1993, 59 percent of the population had a per capita income of less than R10,000 a month, 30 percent--between R10,000 and R20,000 a month, and 11 percent--more than R20,000. The change in the value of subsistence minimum of the Russian Federation population in 1994 is shown in the following table: per capita average--R thousands a month Total including: population work-eligible pensioners children population 1994 January 47.2 53.1 33.3 47.7 February 54.8 61.6 38.6 55.3 March 60.4 67.9 42.6 61.0 on average 54.1 60.9 38.1 54.7 per month over the first quarter The income of 17 percent of the population (25.2 million persons) in the first quarter of 1994 was below the subsistence minimum value; of these, the income of 6 percent of the population was below the value of the consumer food basket, which in the calculation of the subsistence minimum amounted to R37,000. Distribution of the Population's Monetary Income (in percentages): ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |December 1992 |December 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total monetary income of |100 |100 | |the population | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including population gro-| | | |ups (in 20-percent segme-| | | |nts): | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |first (with the lowest i-|9.7 |6.6 | |ncome) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |second |15.2 |11.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |third |19.7 |16.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |fourth |24.6 |23.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |fifth (with the greatest |30.8 |41.4 | |income) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Calculations show that the rate of growth of nominal income in the high-income group is twice as high as the analogous indicator within the low-income group. In the first quarter of 1994 the average wages earned by workers increased 7.5-fold as compared to the first quarter of 1993. The estimated average wage in March amounted to R160,000 and increased 6.8-fold as compared to March 1993. Real average monthly wages calculated after factoring in the consumer price index declined in the first quarter of 1994 by 4 percent as compared to the first quarter of 1993, and in March 1994 as compared to March 1993--by 3 percent. Employment The total economically active population in March 1994 numbered about 75 million, or 50 percent of the country's total population. Of them, 70.5 million persons were engaged in all categories of economic activities and 4.4 million persons were not engaged but actively searching and in keeping with ILO methodology were classified as unemployed. Taking into account those working part-time, total unemployment potential amounted to 8.8 million persons, or 11.7 percent of the economically active population. One million persons, or 1.3 percent of the total economically active population, were officially designated as unemployed by organs of the state employment service.
