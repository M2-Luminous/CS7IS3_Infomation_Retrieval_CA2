They said Hakaru Toyoda, president of the union, met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and Eijiro Hata, minister of the agriculture, forestry and fisheries. The union said it opposes the accord because it will lead to liberalization of Japan's markets for farm produce, the officials said. Toyoda urged the government to, instead, implement policies that will create a stable working environment for farmers and adopt farm trade laws that secure the survival of Japan's agricultural industry. The Uruguay Round accord, which comprises a broad range of trading rules agreed on at talks sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, will be signed in Marrakech, Morocco at a ministerial meeting to be held April 12-15.
