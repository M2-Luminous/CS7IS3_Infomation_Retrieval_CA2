Exports accumulated over the last 12 months have reached the historic level of $38.931 billion, and imports $26.537 billion. Trade volume, i.e. the two operations added, totaled $65.468 billion in this period, with the balance a surplus of $12.394 billion. Compared to March, exports increased by 8.4 percent, imports dropped by 4.4 percent, and the balance increased by 37.4 percent. Compared to 1993, during the January to May period exports increased by 1.8 percent, from $12.284 billion to $12.514 billion; imports increased 12.03 percent, from $7.356 billion to $8.241 billion; and the balance surplus decreased by 13.29 percent, from $4.928 billion to $4.273 billion.

(Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 2 Jun 94 p B11) The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, IBGE, has reported that the May inflation rate in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro totaled an average 44.11 percent, which is 0.59 percent lower than in April. In Sao Paulo the Broad Consumer Price Index totaled 44.32 percent, and in Rio de Janeiro 43.52 percent. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1727 GMT 3 Jun 94) The Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Ministry closed on 29 April an investigation into "dumping" charges against imported Greek canned peaches. The investigation was requested by the Pelotas Union of Fruit and Preserves Industries in October 1993. A lawsuit was opened one month later, and in December a 44 percent tax began to be collected on these imports. Brazil will now have to return the tax collected from December 1993 to April, as the government has recognized that this is its second mistake regarding "dumping" charges. The first was with reference to the alleged dumping of EC powdered milk imports. International trade adviser Adimar Schievelbeing insists, however, that the Greek peaches reach Brazil at the price of $0.40 per can, while the price in Greece is $1.22.

In addition to being permanently in deficit, these branches are located in towns where most of the banking operations are concentrated in branches of the Federal Savings Bank and of the Northeast Bank. The strategy for closing the branches will be gradual, but will have to be concluded by November. (Brasilia Radio Nacional da Amazonia Network in Portuguese 1000 GMT 7 Jun 94) According to data reported by the Foreign Trade Secretariat, Brazilian oil imports from January to March totaled $504 million FOB (Free on Board). This represents a 32 percent drop compared to the same period in 1993. Brazilian oil imports in April totaled $151 million FOB, i.e., 57.3 percent greater than in March, when the oil imports totaled $96 million FOB. Compared to April 1993, when products totaling $153 million FOB were imported, there has been a 1.3 percent drop. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 7 Jun 94 Section 2 p 2) As a result of exports and foreign investment, $3.62 billion have entered the country so far this year. This sum is equivalent to more than the overall amount in real cruzeiros currently in circulation. In April the amount totaled only $2.82 billion, but investment in the stock market this month alone totaled $710 million net. Despite reports of the suspension of foreign investment in the stock market in March and April, figures show that $295 million were invested in March and $415 million in April, and that no net foreign capital left the market during these months. Trade operations -- exports minus imports -- reached in May the record level of $3.02 billion, although in April they totaled only $2.61 billion. These figures, however, do not reflect the amount of exported products, but investment made in the futures market. The financial balance surplus in May totaled $610 million, while the total in April had been $45 million. The best level, however, was obtained in January, when it totaled $1.15 billion. Foreign reserves currently total $38.2 billion, and less than $9 billion will be used to guarantee the real. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 7 Jun 94 Section 1 p 4) Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero reported to the Rural Democratic Union congressional bloc on the morning of 8 June that a study conducted by Anfavea, the Applied Economic-Social Research Institute, indicates that the agricultural sector will grow 6.6 percent this year. He said that Anfavea data confirm this, and show an increase of 90 percent in the sale of tractors and of 70 percent in the sale of agricultural machinery on the domestic market. Ricupero also explained that the price of agricultural produce has remained 25 percent above the average price for the last 60 months, and that the Treasury has already allocated almost $1 billion to the sector this year, although the entire amount allocated last year was only $1.2 billion. The government plans to allocate a total of $2.6 billion to the sector this year. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1720 GMT 8 Jun 94) During the first five months in 1994 the car manufacturing industry produced a record number of 630,825 vehicles: 475,776 of them remained in the domestic market, and 148,913 were exported. Luiz Adelar Scheuer, president of the National Association of Automotive Vehicle Manufacturers, said that by December 1.5 million cars will have easily been manufactured in the country. He criticized, however, the government decision to increase interest rates before implementing the new currency. He said this will divert money from production into investment. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1720 GMT 8 Jun 94) The number of cars sold on the domestic market in May increased by 18.5 percent compared to April, and totaled 111,483 units. Compared to the same month in 1993, this number increased by 24 percent. This number includes the sale of Brazilian-made cars, of cars assembled in the country, and of cars imported by companies affiliated to the Brazilian Association of Automotive Vehicle Importing Companies, Abeiva. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 8 Jun 94 p 1) A poll conducted by the National Confederation of Industries, CNI, the results of which were announced by its President Mario Amato, indicates that competition with imported products has forced Brazilian entrepreneurs to improve their quality control and rationalize production. The opening of the national market to imported products has made companies reduce costs, increase productivity, and improve technologies. Nearly 80 percent of the interviewed entrepreneurs, who work for 1,136 different companies, said that the opening resulted in greater productivity and lower costs. Forty percent of them, however, believe there has been an increase in the number of products being dumped, or sold for prices lower than those in the countries from which they were imported. Nearly 70 percent of those interviewed, however, pointed out that profitability has decreased. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2106 GMT 9 Jun 94) An IBGE poll conducted from 30 April to 30 May indicates that the Expanded Consumer Price Index rate, which reflects the behavior of prices for families with earnings from one up to 40 minimum wages, in the month of May increased by 44.03 percent. According to the National Consumer Price Index, which considers families living on one to eight minimum wages per month, the inflation rate totaled 42.73 percent, 0.13 percent less than in April.
