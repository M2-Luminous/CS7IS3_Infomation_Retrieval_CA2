And when they graduate, they will have to find their own jobs as part of this year's reform of the higher education system. Students attending these 37 institutes will be asked to pay annual tuition of 1,000 to 1,500 yuan ($115 to $175), according to State Education Commission (SEC) officials. The new tuition policy is designed to eventually replace the current so-called "dual track system" for college enrollments and job assignments. The policy is meant to maintain higher education standards. uphold the policy of equal educational opportunities for all students and encourage collegians to study harder, according to Zhang Tianbao, SEC Vice-Minister. The Chinese Government previously paid for everything but food and clothing for college students. Then, in the mid-1980s, institutions began enrolling enterprise funded and self-funded students. These students, who pay their own way, have been warmly welcomed by colleges. Schools see them as a source of revenue. Self-funded students have increased substantially over the past few years and now account for 40 to 50 percent of some academies' enrollments. But the rise in self-funded students has come at a cost, according to Zhang. These undergraduates have actually lessened the quality of student bodies, he charged, especially at schools accepting pupils who scored low on the national college entrance exam in exchange for higher tuition fees. The practice has also kept some needy students with higher scores from going to better schools, he added. The new policy sets one cut-off score for each school and establishes a tuition standard for all new students Zhang said. Students at other colleges will abide by the old policies, he added. The universities and colleges piloting the new policy are mostly directly guided by SEC. They include Qinghua, Beijing and Nankai universities. While emphasizing that higher education is non-compulsory education, Zhang said tuition standards must be set according to the exact costs for each student as well as the resources of students' families and local economic conditions. Since some schools used to charge 2,000 to 4,000 yuan ($230 to $460) annual tuition from enterprise- and self-funded students, the incomes of some colleges will likely decrease with the advent of the new policy Zhang said.
