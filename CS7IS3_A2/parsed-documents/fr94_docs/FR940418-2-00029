SUMMARY: The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council's Mackerel Advisory Panel (AP) and Reef Fish, Mackerel, Spiny Lobster, and Stone Crab Scientific and Statistical Committees (SSC) will hold public meetings on May 2&hyph;4, 1994, to review, and advise the Council on, amendments to Federal rules affecting mackerel, reef fish, stone crab and spiny lobster.

On May 2, beginning at 2:30 p.m., the SSC will develop recommendations on an amendment that proposes to allow certain fishermen landing reef fish with traps, or investing in traps prior to February 7, 1994, to be granted permits to use fish traps during the current 3-year moratorium on issuance of such permits. On May 3, beginning at 8 a.m., the SSC will review and make recommendations on an amendment to the stone crab regulations which proposes a 4-year moratorium on issuance of commercial vessel registrations to participate in the fishery and a procedure for implementing state rules in the Federal waters. The SSC will also develop recommendations on a generic amendment that contains proposals for defining traps used in the reef fish, spiny lobster, stone crab and other fisheries, as well as areal and seasonal limitations on trap use. Beginning at noon, the SSC will review the mackerel and cobia information and formulate its recommendations to the Council. The Mackerel AP will meet on May 4 beginning at 10 a.m., to review stock assessment and social and economic information on king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, and cobia (ling). Based on this review, it will recommend to the Council levels for setting total allowable catch (TAC), commercial vessel trip limits, bag limits, and commercial quotas for these species for the 1994&hyph;95 season.
