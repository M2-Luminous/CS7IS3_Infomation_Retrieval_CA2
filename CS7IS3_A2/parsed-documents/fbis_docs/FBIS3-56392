Contract Signed to This Effect. Everyone Should be Pleased, Including Ukraine"] [Text] An executive contract between Russia and the United States on deliveries of Russian weapons-grade uranium to the United States was signed at 1000 yesterday in the secluded atmosphere of Collegium Hall of the former Ministry of Medium Machine-Building (now the Ministry of Atomic Energy). Making a short speech before the signing of the document, Viktor Mikhaylov, Russian Federation minister of atomic energy, pointed out that the ceremony was taking place in a historic room: All decisions on the creation of nuclear weapons in Russia had been made right there, and foreign visitors were present there for the first time. One should think that in citing this fact the minister wished once again to emphasize the historic importance of the event. Indeed, this contract (from the Russian side it was signed by Albert Shishkin, president of the "Tekhnosnabeksport" foreign trade company of the Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic Energy, and on the American side by the director of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation -- USEC -- William Timbers) signals the start of real disarmament. In line with its provisions, 500 tonnes of weapons-grade uranium are supposed to be sold to the United States over 20 years (Russia's aggregate stocks of weapons-grade uranium are 1,250 tonnes). Thus, more than 20,000 nuclear warheads will be destroyed. During the first five years, 10 tonnes will be sold each year, and 30 tonnes a year will be sold during the following years. This schedule is explained by the fact that neither Russia nor the United States has the production facilities at the moment for the depletion of enriched uranium (from 90 to 5 percent). Nonetheless the level of such technology in Russia proves to be higher than in the United States. To implement the contract, the world's largest joint Russian- American uranium company is being created. It should be stressed in this connection that the United States controls 50 percent of the world uranium market today; Russia controls 5 to 6 percent of the market while having the same uranium production facilities. The contract that was signed means in fact that the United States is letting Russia use one of the segments of its market. Answering a question from your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent on how it had become possible to resolve within the framework of the contract the question that proved to be a stumbling block while the document was in preparation (the U.S. Government insisted on sharing profits from the sales of uranium between Russia and Ukraine), Mikhaylov said that there too it became possible to find a mutually acceptable option. Profit from the sales of weapons-grade uranium from strategic nuclear warheads, if any, will be partially returned to Ukraine in the shape of fuel compacts for its nuclear electric power stations. As for battlefield nuclear weapons, according to the minister, experts of Russia and Ukraine are yet to determine whether any profit is possible there at all. Russia is already spending millions of dollars on the dismantling and transportation alone of battlefield nuclear weapons from Ukraine. (Incidentally, the dismantling and storing of one nuclear warhead in the United States costs between $30 and $100,000; in Russia the cost is a tenth of the amount because our personnel are paid less). Viktor Mikhaylov also stressed that, in his opinion, Ukraine should be pleased with the signed Russian-American document: "Unless this problem is solved today, Ukraine itself in a couple of years would have to pay someone who would undertake to dismantle its nuclear missiles. Neither will the United States come out a loser: during the first year alone of the implementation of the contract, weapons- grade uranium from Russia will provide fuel for 15 American nuclear reactors. Energy generated by them would provide electricity for 10 million homes. At the same time, despite the substantial sum of the contract -- nearly $12 billion -- the Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic Energy will only be able to pay part of its nuclear warhead recycling costs out of it.
