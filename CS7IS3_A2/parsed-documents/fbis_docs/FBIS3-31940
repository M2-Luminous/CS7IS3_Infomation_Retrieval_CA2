The Guatemalan Information and Press Department of the Army [Dide] reports that yesterday at 0120 a gang of criminals cowardly attacked with rifle fire and RPG-7 rocket launchers the troops guarding communities in the area of (Mayalan), (Ixcanche), where five soldiers were killed and three more were seriously wounded. This took place a few kilometers away from the last repatriation depot, which makes apparent, the Guatemalan Army states, the lack of resolve to reach a peaceful agreement for a solution to the domestic armed conflict. Dide reports the soldiers killed are Corporal Efrain Gonzalez Ramirez; Soldiers First Class Luciano Perez Chua and Jesus Arturo Najera Perez; and Soldiers Second Class Valdemar Hernandez Jimenez and Edgar Benjamin Guevara. The Guatemalan Army is informing the local and international public opinion of this cowardly act by URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] criminal terrorists so that the people may judge and condemn these stateless people, identified by the limited outlook of their criminal minds. The Guatemalan Army bulletin adds that it deeply regrets the death of the five soldiers who gave their lives to the fatherland in the line of their sacred duty, and the Army extends its sincerest condolences to family and friends, praying for Christian resignation.
