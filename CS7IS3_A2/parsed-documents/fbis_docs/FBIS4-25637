The U.S., viewing China as a special case because of its transition from a planned to a market-based economy, agreed in 1988 to revise its law. The 1988 Comprehensive Trade Law stipulated that the U.S. Department of Commerce complete studies on China's market-oriented economic reform and possible revision of America's anti-dumping law against China by August 23, 1989. The U.S. was to send specialists to China to examine production costs and export prices. However, the whole process was halted after June 4, 1989. "Now time is up for the two countries to restore contacts on the issue," said Zhou Shijian deputy director of the Institute of International Trade Research at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC). But Zhou believes the U.S. is unlikely to make its anti-dumping law against China totally reasonable in the near future, given America's concerns over its foreign trade balance and the waxing and waning of domestic trade-protectionist sentiments. "Western nations usually espouse protectionism under the veneer of protecting fair competition, and the U.S. anti-dumping law against China is unreasonable and unfair, too," Zhou said. He said exporters from a market-economy country would not be charged with dumping on the American market so long as their prices are above domestic levels, but the U.S. won't apply the same yardstick to China. Chinese exporters are given no standard price level under which they could face dumping charges. Zhou said, "How can people abide by a law which is unpredictable?" Zhou attributes the lower prices of Chinese exports mainly to cheaper labour and lower-quality products. "In disregard of this fact, the U.S. usually makes a comparison between Chinese products and their peers from developed countries, where costs are much higher," he points out. Thus, Zhou said, the results of the comparison can only be unfair: Low-priced Chinese products are judged to have been dumped. What is ridiculous, Zhou said, is that Indian exports to the U.S., which are comparable in price to China's, are not regarded as dumping items simply because the U.S. views India as a market economy and China as a planned one. "China no longer has a centrally planned economy," Zhou pointed out. "Foreign-invested enterprises, private business and township ventures have all sprouted over the past decade.
