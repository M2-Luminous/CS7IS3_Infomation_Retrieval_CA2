FR940830-1-00049 FR940830-1-00009 The acute and chronic aquatic life criteria presented in the proposed Guidance were expressed using total recoverable metal measurements, in conformance with the EPA policy at the time. In the preamble to the proposed Guidance, it was noted that a State or Tribe had flexibility when deriving criteria to choose either the total recoverable or dissolved contaminant concentrations. EPA suggested that a site-specific criteria modification procedure known as the water-effects ratio could address concerns about the bioavailability and toxicity of total recoverable or dissolved concentrations. The preamble also indicated that EPA would promulgate total recoverable metals criteria for those States and Tribes who failed to adopt the criteria within the specified time period as written in the proposed Guidance. The EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) recommended in its December 16, 1992, report, ``Evaluation of the Guidance for the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative,'' that EPA consider both the biologically active form and the total contaminant concentrations of a pollutant when establishing water quality criteria (USEPA, 1992). To further elicit comment on the use of total recoverable vs. dissolved metal concentrations in developing future National aquatic life criteria, EPA held a meeting with invited experts in January 1993 in Annapolis, Maryland. The Agency solicited comments on the recommendations made by the presenters at the meeting in the Federal Register on July 9, 1993 (58 FR 32131). Based on the data presented at the conference, and the individual opinions of the majority of assembled scientists, EPA determined that the dissolved metal concentration approximates the bioavailable fraction of waterborne metals for aquatic organisms better than the total recoverable concentration of metals. However, the scientists believed the total recoverable measurements in ambient water also have value, because exceedances of criteria on a total recoverable basis indicate that metal loadings could be a stress to the ecosystem, particularly in locations other than the water column. As a follow-up to the meeting, on October 1, 1993, EPA's Office of Water issued a memorandum to all EPA Regional Water Management Division Directors providing policy and guidance on the interpretation and implementation of aquatic life criteria for the management of metals (USEPA, 1993). The memorandum covered a number of areas including the expression of aquatic life criteria, total maximum daily loads, permits, effluent monitoring, compliance, and ambient monitoring. With regard to expression of aquatic life criteria, the memorandum recommended that State water quality standards be based on dissolved metals because dissolved metal concentrations more closely approximate the bioavailable fraction of metal in the water column than does total recoverable metal concentrations. However, because the present National aquatic life criteria were developed using total recoverable measurements, it is necessary to use a conversion factor to convert the total recoverable metal concentrations to equivalent dissolved metal concentrations. The October 1993 memorandum suggested conversion factors for 10 metals. Since that time, additional work has been completed to refine these conversion factors. Possible conversion factors for seven of the nine metals included in Tables 1 and 2 of the proposed Guidance for aquatic life are included in Table 1 of this Notice along with a conversion factor for lead. In addition, Table 1 includes preliminary conversion factors for cadmium and mercury(II). The basis for the cadmium and mercury(II) conversion factors can be found in the October 1993 memorandum discussed above. Additional tests for cadmium and mercury(II) are being conducted as described in the report ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests''. EPA does not at this time have any reason to believe that the final conversion factors for cadmium and mercury(II) will be different. EPA does not intend to provide additional opportunity to comment on the final conversion factors for cadmium and mercury(II). The methodology and data used to derive the nine conversion factors can be found in the report ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests,'' which is available in the public docket as described in the addresses section of this notice. To use these factors, a State or Tribe would multiply the criterion for a metal in Table 1 or 2 of the proposed Guidance by the conversion factor in Table 1 of this notice. For example, if the acute water quality criterion for chromium(III) based on total recoverable metal concentration is 15 ug/L and the conversion factor is 0.333, then the equivalent dissolved metal concentration for chromium(III) would be 5.0 ug/L. If EPA were to publish the final Guidance with metals criteria expressed as dissolved concentrations, States and Tribes would be required to adopt metals criteria consistent with the final Guidance. In that situation, a State or Tribe could adopt criteria expressed as dissolved criteria, or they could choose to adopt the total recoverable criteria without using conversion factors as in the proposed Guidance, since it is a more stringent approach. If a State or Tribe did not adopt metals criteria consistent with the final Guidance, EPA would promulgate dissolved metals criteria for that State or Tribe. This approach is consistent with the recommendations made by the Science Advisory Board and the scientists who attended the January 1993 meeting in Annapolis, Maryland.
