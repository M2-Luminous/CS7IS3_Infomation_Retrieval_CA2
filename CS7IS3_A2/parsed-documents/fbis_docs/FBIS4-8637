They discussed the latest situation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the attempts by international mediators and envoys to normalize the situation. After the meeting, Karadzic said, in a brief statement to correspondents, that the international community is now most concerned by our break of relations with the United Nations. "We will see whether our supreme command will make any changes to that decision tomorrow," Karadzic added. The Srpska republic president confirmed that tomorrow he will meet with Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special envoy, and that he will inform him about the supreme command's position, which determines whether there will be any contacts with the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] civilian section. Karadzic also commented on the latest situation on the Bosnian front. According to him, the first day of good weather, which had enabled U.S. NATO planes to fly "was used by the Muslim forces to try to chase us away from the right bank of the Drina River. They launched a new offensive from the left bank, accross the bridges, against our forces. They probably expected support from U.S. planes," he added. As far as Doboj is concerned it was permanently shelled, and there are losses among civilians, Karadzic commented. The Muslim offensive is now under way practically on all fronts -- near Kupres, Srbobran, and Teslic. The strongest is from Teocak and Zvornik, via Kladanj and Olovo, to Ilijas. It is an entirely Muslim offensive, Karadzic stressed. They pulled out about 20,000 soldiers from Sarajevo. They were under an obligation to keep these soldiers in Sarajevo, but they pulled them out and deployed them on other fronts. As for Tuzla Airport, cargo planes have been landing there and delivering military equipment for days. "We warned them that the airport was not open and that it would be opened exclusively on the basis of our agreement with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, envoy Vitaliy Churkin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev," Karadzic said. Before this is agreed, the airport must not be used for military purposes, but it must not be abused even after it is opened. The airport can be used exclusively for humanitarian purposes, the Srpska republic president stressed. "Two cargo planes were preparing to land at Tuzla Airport today and we warned them not to. I think this is better than shooting them down." Dwelling on the latest Russian proposals, conveyed to President Milosevic and the Bosnian Serbs by Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin, Karadzic confirmed that these proposals did exist and that they could help bring about an overall peace, but not a political solution at the same time. Only complete peace could possibly lead to the speedy attainment of a political solution. We will examine these proposals and we will see, Karadzic said. He urged a full cessation of hostilities throughout the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, stressing that he is against "a partial cease-fire," because, as he said, "if they are attacking us in Olovo we will attack them in all other areas." "We have the right to conduct a defense and a counteroffensive in all areas." "We believe that an agreement on the cessation of hostilities ought to be concluded, but it should be understood that the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are an act of hostility, and if the hostilities cease, then the sanctions should also be abolished," Karadzic concluded.
