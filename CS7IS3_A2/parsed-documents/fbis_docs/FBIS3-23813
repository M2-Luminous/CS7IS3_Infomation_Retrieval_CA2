Grigoryan: "Rumors About Azerbaijan's Arms Have Proved to Be Understated"] [Text] Reports that Azerbaijan has been supplied intensively with weapons and combat equipment by various countries have been filtering into the press lately. In particular, it reached the point this September that the MID RA [Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs] issued a statement concerning the tanks given to Azerbaijan by Ukraine. We have asked Suren Zolyan, deputy to the Republic of Armenia Supreme Soviet, to comment on new facts which became known a day or two ago. Not long ago the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially confirmed the press reports that Ukraine had shipped a large consignment of tanks to this country. This official letter from the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also confirmed indirectly by the fact that the maximum level of arms for the Azerbaijan army permitted under international agreements has been substantially exceeded, inasmuch as the amount of equipment and number of artillery systems provided by Russia was indicated in another letter. These documents were disseminated by the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs within the framework of the agreement in effect--the so-called OVSE [Conventional Armed Forces in Europe], which provides first of all for the maximum levels of weapons according to individual types of combat equipment for each member country of the SBSYe [CSCE: Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe], and secondly, the system for notification and information about the presence of their forces. First I will read out these official documents. In letter No. 174 of 3 November 1993, the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs "has the honor to inform the joint consultative group for the OVSE that the Republic of Azerbaijan received 50 T-55 battle tanks from Ukraine on 27 September 1993." Moreover, inasmuch as the OVSE had information on the weapons which Russia transferred to Azerbaijan, the following is indicated in letter No. 175 of 6 November 1993, "In July and August 1992, the Russian Federation transferred, and the Republic of Azerbaijan accepted under its jurisdiction, the following number of weapons and equipment restricted by the agreement: 286 battle tanks, 842 armored combat vehicles, 346 artillery systems, 53 combat aircraft, and eight attack helicopters." The same letter states further: "In May 1993 (that is, this year--editor), the Republic of Azerbaijan received 105 armored combat vehicles and 42 artillery systems from the Russian Federation." Three comments need to be made about these letters. First of all, this exceeds the maximum level of weapons stipulated by the agreements. Secondly, a number of resolutions by international organs, the CSCE and the UN Security Council in particular, have been violated. And thirdly, this information is inaccurate (why is stated below). I want to cite the maximum levels of weapons stipulated by the Budapest Agreement for the USSR as a whole, which were divided among the former union republics proportionately after its collapse. Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia were granted an equal number of maximum levels. I emphasize "maximum level," inasmuch as this number may actually be much lower, as in the case of Armenia, for example. Thus the Republic of Azerbaijan could have no more than 220 battle tanks. But in fact, it received 286 in 1992 and 105 in May this year from Russia, plus 50 from Ukraine in September. It could have no more than 220 armored combat vehicles. Practically four times as many were received: 842 were transferred in July and August. Further. It could have no more than 285 artillery systems. Let us count them: 346 shipped in July and August, that is, 1.5 times as many, plus 42 in May this year. Once again, this is substantially in excess of authorized levels. To be more precise, this agreement and protocol were signed in Tashkent on 15 May 1992. So there has been a significant violation of the OVSE agreement by three countries participating in the agreement: Azerbaijan, Russia, and Ukraine. Why do I think the data provided by Azerbaijan are inaccurate? Take note of this: they begin the count in July and August 1992. We know that beginning in December 1991, a vast number of weapons located in Azerbaijan were seized at random and that a large quantity of weapons were also transferred to this country in May and June 1992. But all this is not being pointed out. So these data are not authentic. Moreover, the weapons Azerbaijan received from neighboring states through other channels were not mentioned, either. It should also be stressed that the KSDL [Committee of Senior Officials] of the CSCE adopted the first decision on Karabakh on 28 February 1992, in which it stated that arms should not be delivered to the conflicting sides in the region. This was repeatedly confirmed in other documents of the CSCE, so it is obvious that the agreement has been violated since July and August last year as well. As far as Ukraine is concerned, it is violating the UN Security Council decisions, where there is a corresponding paragraph prohibiting arms deliveries to the region of the conflict (No. 822 and subsequent resolutions) in addition to this. It is interesting that Russia transferred weapons to the Republic of Azerbaijan in May this year, when the anti-Elchibey revolt of S. Guseynov began. This fact was not mentioned, although it is obvious that it definitely contributed to destabilization of the situation and continuation of the conflict. The vast number of weapons--and I think the official figures should be doubled--contributed to escalation of the hostilities, of course. In particular, the weapons transferred in May 1992 led directly to the seizure of Mardakert and Shaumyan rayons, which brought the armed conflict to a completely new level. The events of this year are a logical continuation of those military operations which began as the result of the vast supply of arms provided to Azerbaijan. It seems to me that the competent organizations should draw their conclusions and evaluate these facts. They graphically demonstrate what Azerbaijan is counting on and who is contributing to the conflict, incidentally.
