FBIS4-27472 "dreas106_m_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 28 May 1994 Thailand Court Acquits Suspected Murderer of Saudi Envoy Court Acquits Suspected Murderer of Saudi Envoy BK2805112894 Bangkok THE NATION in English 28 May 94 p A1 BK2805112894 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] The Supreme Court yesterday acquitted the man charged with killing a Saudi envoy in 1989, saying that eye witnesses could not remember sufficient detail of the gunman's face to justify a conviction. A third secretary of the Embassy of Saudi Arabia, Saleh Abdullah Al-Maliki, 35, was shot dead on 4 January 1989, in Soi Phipat 2, between Bangkok's North Sathon and Silom roads. Three bullets from a 6.35 mm pistol struck Al-Maliki in the head, right temple, and left ear, killing him instantly. Police believed the motive for the murder was the dissatisfaction of employment agencies, which were losing commission because of Al-Maliki's method of issuing visas direct to Thais wanting to work in Saudi Arabia. At yesterday's hearing, Judge Charan Hatthakam ruled that acquittal was the correct verdict because the testimony of the prosecutor's eye-witnesses was not deemed reliable. The accused, Adinan Songkoewala, 26, was arrested on 23 June 1989. The prosecution witnesses -- Thongkham Lengkham, Somwang Kritchukiat, and Lun Posayanon -- identified the accused as the man who shot Al-Maliki dead. They told the court that Al-Maliki was shot while he was walking to his residence at the PMP Mansion. The gunman shot Al-Maliki at close range and ran away. But in passing his verdict, the judge reminded the court that the eyewitnesses had also said they could not remember much detail about the gunman because they were in shock. The accused had pleaded innocence, and said he had been at work in his garment business up-country at the time of the murder.
