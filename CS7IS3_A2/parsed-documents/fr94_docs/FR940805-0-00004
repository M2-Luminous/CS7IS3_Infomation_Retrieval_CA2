FR940805-0-00004 FR940805-0-00002 Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. About 300 small nurseries and 330 producers of Christmas trees and other forest products operate in the 18 newly quarantined counties. All could probably be classified as small entities by Small Business Administration criteria (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less). While most of the small nurseries in these counties specialize in production of deciduous landscape products, some also produce rooted pine Christmas trees and pine nursery stock. This action will affect only the sale of restricted pine products from quarantined areas to non-quarantined areas. If inspected and found to be infested with the pine shoot beetle, restricted pine products can be either diverted for sale within local markets or treated in accordance with ยง301.50&hyph;10 prior to shipment to a non-quarantined area. Based on information acquired from extension agents and trade association representatives, we estimate that in the newly quarantined counties, the sale of restricted pine products to buyers in non-quarantined areas will represent less than one percent of total sales by small nurseries and less than five percent of total sales by Christmas tree and forest product producers. We anticipate, therefore, that this action will not have a significant economic impact on small nurseries, Christmas tree farmers, or other forest product producers. There are a few logging operations in the newly quarantined counties in Pennsylvania. However, these operations harvest hardwoods primarily. Furthermore, the little pine that is cut is sold locally and thus would not be affected by this action. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and there are no new requirements. The assigned OMB control number is 0579&hyph;0088. National Environmental Policy Act An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared for this rule. The assessment provides a basis for the conclusion that the treatment of restricted pine products, under the conditions specified in this rule, will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating plant pests and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on the finding of no significant impact, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmental impact statement will not be prepared. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact were prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272&hyph;51274, August 31, 1979). Copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact are available for public inspection at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. In addition, copies may be obtained by writing to the individual listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.
