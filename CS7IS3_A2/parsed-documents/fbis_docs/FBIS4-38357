It does not provide authentic information and therefore fails to promote neighborly ties between the two countries. President Leonid Kravchuk made this statement on Saturday, commenting at journalists' request on the decision to deprive several Ostankino reporters of their accreditation in Ukraine. Earlier the press service of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry deprived Ostankino reporters in Donetsk, Kharkov and Odessa of their accreditation. Nevertheless, President Kravchuk said that Ukraine is not against a unified information space. It only wants the coverage of events in that space to be objective. Leonid Kravchuk also criticized some Ukrainian news media for having a penchant for "hot" facts and for failing to present a complete picture of developments and processes in Ukraine. He did not specify precisely what publications he meant.
