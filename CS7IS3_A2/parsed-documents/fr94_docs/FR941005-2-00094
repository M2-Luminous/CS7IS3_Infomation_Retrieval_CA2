Background on Title IV of SMCRA Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) established an Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) program to reclaim and restore lands and waters adversely affected by past mining. The program is funded by a reclamation fee levied on coal production. Lands and waters eligible for reclamation under Title IV primarily are those that were mined or affected by mining and abandoned or inadequately reclaimed prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under State, Federal Tribal, or other laws. Title IV provides for State or Tribal submittal to OSM of an AMLR plan. The Secretary of the Interior adopted regulations in 30 CFR Parts 870 through 888 that implement Title IV of SMCRA. Ordinarily, a State or Tribe must have a surface mining regulatory program approved pursuant to section 405 of SMCRA prior to submittal of an AMLR plan to OSM. However, on July 11, 1987, the President signed a supplemental appropriations bill (P.L. 100&hyph;71) that authorized the Crow and Hopi Tribes and the Navajo Nation to administer AMLR programs without approval of Tribal surface mining regulatory programs. Pursuant to those provisions, the Secretary reviewed the plans submitted by Tribes and solicited and considered comments of State and Federal agencies and the public. After considering the comments received, if the Secretary determined a Tribe had the ability and necessary legislation to implement the provisions of Title IV, the Secretary approved the Tribal program and granted the Tribe exclusive authority to administer its plan. Upon approval of a Tribe's AMLR plan by the Secretary, the Tribe may submit to OSM, on an annual basis, an application requesting funds for specific projects that are necessary to implement the approved plan. Funding requests are reviewed and approved by OSM in accordance with the requirements of 30 CFR Parts 874, 875, and 886. II. Background on the Navajo Nation Plan The Secretary of the Interior approved the Navajo Nation's AMLR plan on May 16, 1988. General information on the Navajo Nation's plan, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the approval of the plan, is in the May 16, 1988, Federal Register (53 FR 17186). Approval of the Navajo Nation Plan is codified at 30 CFR 756.13. By letters dated April 7 and 22, 1994, the Navajo Nation submitted a proposed amendment to its plan pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record Nos. NA&hyph;207, NA&hyph;208, and NA&hyph;212). The Navajo Nation submitted the proposed amendment with the intent of revising its plan to make it consistent with SMCRA and to improve operational efficiency. OSM approved the plan amendments in the September 27, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 49178). Provisions of the plan, which includes the Navajo AMLR Code, that the Navajo nation amended and which are pertinent to this proposed action include: Section 409, filling voids and sealing tunnels; and section 411, certification of completion of coal reclamation, authorization to perform priorities one, two, and three noncoal reclamation, and authorization to undertake community impact assistance and public facilities projects. Provisions of the plan, which includes the Navajo AMLR Rules, that the Navajo Nation amended and which are pertinent to this proposed action include: Part D, coal reclamation priorities and noncoal reclamation priorities prior to certification; Part L, general reclamation requirements for coal and noncoal; Part M, certification of completion of coal sites; Part N, eligible lands and water subsequent to certification; Part O, exclusion of noncoal reclamation sites; and Part P, utilities and other facilities.
