FR940621-2-00122 FR940621-2-00075 VII. Proposal Review and Selection Process Facilities may submit their proposals directly to EPA after discussions with their State environmental agency, or to their State agency for forwarding to EPA. The ELP pilot project team will be using an expedited process_in partnership with EPA Regional Offices, State environmental agencies, and other OECA offices_to review proposals and to select the pilot participants. Pilot projects will be selected from the pool of proposals received based on how completely they address the seven criteria outlined above, and their potential to demonstrate possible components of a full-scale leadership program. Proposals for the initial group of pilots will be accepted for 60 days from the publication of this notice, and reviewed on a rolling basis. Final selections will be announced in the Fall of 1994. The pilot projects will have a definite life-span, most likely 12&hyph;18 months. At the end of this time, EPA will evaluate their success and determine if a full-scale leadership program is feasible, and if such a program can help improve environmental compliance.
