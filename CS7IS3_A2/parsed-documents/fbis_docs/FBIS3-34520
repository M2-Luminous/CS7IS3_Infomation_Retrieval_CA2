FBIS3-34520 "drnes027_o_94007" FBIS-NES-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 SYRIA Commentary: Geneva Summit Defines Nature of Peace JN0302151994 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1215 GMT 3 Feb 94 JN0302151994 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Station commentary] [Text] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has admitted that Syria is serious about the establishment of peace and that it has always honored its commitments and obligations. Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres cast doubts about the possibility of achieving a true breakthrough on the Syrian-Israeli track because, as he put it, the Syrian ice has not yet thawed. In fact, Peres and other Israeli officials are making contradictory statements every day and deliberately casting doubt about Syria's peaceful intentions. The Geneva summit, which has given strong momentum to the peace process and, according to Peres himself, breathed new life into the peace process, has proved Syria's credibility to the entire world. This is demonstrated by the fact that all U.S. officials, led by President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher, have praised Syria's positive and constructive stand and its determined effort to build a just, comprehensive Middle East peace. This is also demonstrated by the fact the entire international community has praised President Hafiz al-Asad's genuine interest in peace and his call to establish the peace of the brave in the region. Such a peace requires Israel to rise to the level of the aspirations of the region and the world. Syria agreed to hold the current talks in Washington in appreciation of the U.S. role and in the hope that Israel will change its previous policies, put an end to the policy of intransigence and maneuvering, and respond to the UN security Council resolutions regulating the peace process. Right from the first session, the head of the Israeli delegation to Washington said the talks were held in a businesslike atmosphere. However, the Israeli officials soon tarnished this positivity with their negative statements. Following an Israeli request, it was agreed to hold the Washington talks away from the media. This is understandable, since it is known that the Israeli rulers call for secret negotiations. However, Israeli officials are making statements daily that cast doubt on the Washington talks. Insisting on playing the same tune, Israeli officials still demand a definition of the nature of peace, despite tha fact that the Geneva summit clearly specified the nature of peace and stressed Syria's readiness to implement all requirements of a just, comprehensive regional peace. However, definitely running amid noise and clamor and deliberately raising doubts in all directions, Israeli officials want a separate deal that is closer to a spectacle than to a peace, such as the Oslo agreement. Brought about by secret talks, the Oslo agreement has faced, and its still facing, obstacles. If there is any positivity in the current Washington talks, then it is definitely the result of the positive Syrian position, not the Israeli position, which has not yet rid itself of the policy of maneuvering and procrastination. Syria has expressly declared its readiness to establish a just, comprehensive peace in the region and to abide by all its requirements. But has Israel declared its readiness to enforce UN Security Council resolutions and to fully withdraw from the Golan Heights? Syria is still awaiting the answer. If there is any ice, then it is definitely on the Israeli side, rather than on the Syrian side. If Rabin admits that Syria is serious about the establishment of peace, what prevents Israel, knowing that the ball is now at its court, from declaring commitment to full withdrawal, instead of casting doubt, raising its endless security fears, and threatening to hold a referendum on the Golan and peace with Syria? At this point, we recall statements by Rabin and other Israeli officials that Israel will not declare readiness to withdraw from the Golan before Syria defines the nature of peace. The Geneva summit defined the nature of peace. The world is still awaiting a statement by Israel on its readiness for full withdrawal. Peace in the region is a matter of occupied territories and usurped rights. Consequently, peace requires an end to occupation and the restoration of land and rights. Unless it is just and comprehensive, peace in the region stands no chance of lasting. Certainly, peace is not separate deals made behind the scenes, evading the hopes and aspirations of the region's countries. Peace cannot mean capitulation to Israel and an acknowledgement of the legitimacy of its occupation and settlements. Syria will always adhere to a just, comprehensive peace. It will never budge from this stand. No one in the world will blame Syria for this brave stand. Nay, the world supports Syria's quest for a just, comprehensive peace, especially since the world has seen the failures of separate deals. Undoubtedly, the world is expecting Israel to adopt the long-awaited positive stand.
