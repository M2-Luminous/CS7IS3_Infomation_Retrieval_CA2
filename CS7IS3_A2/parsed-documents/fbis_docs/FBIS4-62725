This means that President Boris Yeltsin will be able to partly cast off the status of a guest, which he had at the previous meetings in Munich and Tokyo, and to start feeling that he is on equal terms with the members of the prestigious world club. As much as a year ago, before the last G-7 meeting in the Japanese capital, Moscow had advocated that Russia should take a full and equal part in the political debate and that a common statement by the eight leaders should be adopted on its results. But there was insufficient time then to work out a new formula for our involvement in the work of the summit, and the scheme was not realized. Moscow has now advanced the same initiative in good time, and it has been supported, in principle, in the capitals of the seven most developed states. In fact, however, there is no full coincidence of opinions among the members of the club concerning the form of Russia's admission to it. Different opinions exist in respect of the formula for Russia's participation in G-7 conferences: "Seven plus one" or "eight," Japanese Foreign Minister K. Kakizawa declared recently. But, in any case, Tokyo believes that Russia must play a constructive role as a member of the world community. This politely streamlined wording conceals, in actual fact, the special position of the Land of the Rising Sun. A whole number of Japanese leaders, including Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, say that it is "too soon" at present to speak of granting the Russian Federation full and equal membership of the group of seven leading industrial powers and that they should confine themselves at this stage to the "seven plus one" formula, on whose basis Moscow has been admitted to regular G-7 summits since 1992. Tokyo's main argument here is that the Russian Federation is a recipient of international aid, which is being given to it precisely by members of the G-7 club. Therefore it would allegedly be strange to see donor states and a recipient state sitting at the same table on equal terms. This logic is far from impeccable, however. Russia, as our top government figures emphasize, occupies a special position because, on the one hand, it needs support for the reforms while, on the other hand, it is a donor itself in respect of the CIS republics and some developing countries. The burden of this aid is no less than that of the G-7 in respect of Russia. In order to prevent unnecessary debate and misunderstandings arising in this sphere, it is necessary to record Russia's credits to the republics of the former Union as credits of international financial organizations. This position is held both by Moscow and by the IMF leadership. While acknowledging Russia's leading role in world affairs, particularly in settling the conflict in the Balkans, nevertheless Tokyo would not like to admit it yet to full and equal participation in G-7 meetings even in a curtailed form, in other words only in the political part of the debate, until it has secured some concessions on the issue of the "northern territories." Moscow, for its part, certainly is not seeking to force events, realizing that conditions are not yet ripe for full-scale participation in meetings of the seven leading world powers -- this requires more serious market transformations in the economy. But, at the same time, Russia cannot wait, as in former times, for all the chief issues to be discussed without it and for them to invite its leader only afterward and to brief him on the decisions adopted.
