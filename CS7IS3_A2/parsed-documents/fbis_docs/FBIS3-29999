Thursday's decision, however, rejected demands for a halt to night flights at the base in line with Supreme Court decisions in February last year involving Yokota Air Base in Tokyo and Atsugi Naval Air Facility in Kanagawa Prefecture. A total of 907 residents had demanded a halt to flights to and from the Kadena base between 7 P.M. and 7 A.M., 1.15 million yen each in damages for noise-related suffering and compensation for future annoyance until a night flight ban is realized. Judge Hiroshi Segi ruled that the noise pollution at the base had "exceeded the level of tolerance" of the residents. Segi said the noise was detrimental to the residents' mental health because of disruptions to their sleep and feelings of discomfort caused by it. In rejecting the call for a ban on night flights, however, he said the actions of the U.S. military do not fall within the dominion of the Japanese state. Regarding the public nature of the base as argued by the defending lawyers, Segi said that as an important facility for the defense of the nation, the base could be recognized in a general sense as public in nature. He added, however, that the argument cannot be considered seriously in the decision on the tolerance level of the noise. Defense lawyers had argued that the noise levels were tolerable given the public nature of the base. Lawyers for the residents had argued over 55 hearings that the noise had led to headaches, hearing difficulties and other health problems among the residents and stressed that it was a violation of the residents personal rights and right to peaceful existence. Kadena Air Base is under the control of the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing and is considered a key base of the U.S. Air Force in East Asia.
