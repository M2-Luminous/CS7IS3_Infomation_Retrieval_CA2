The demand was precipitated by the government's new white book on security policy and Bundeswehr matters that declares the existence of a "modern, competitive, and efficient arms industry to be a part of security precautions." The BDI tells Bonn that this is "not possible at zero cost and without political compromise within the alliance in adjusting arms regulations." The BDI refers to the uncompromising position of some important European partner countries that have refused to follow the strict German regulations. The German arms industry will only regain its international competitiveness if the Federal Government abolishes "the marked disadvantage that German companies are experiencing."
