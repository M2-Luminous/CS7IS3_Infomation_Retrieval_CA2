Sources said the moderate Kurdistan Socialist Party (PSK) of Kemal Burkay and other peaceful movements which had joined the DEP in the past are considering setting up a separate party. Party sources told the TDN [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] on Thursday that the executive assembly had met in order to decide the fate of the DEP, which is expected to be closed down by the court at the end of April. The Constitutional Court, which was scheduled to decide on the closure next week, recently gave an additional five weeks to the party's attorneys to prepare their defense. Referring to the imprisonment of five DEP deputies by the Ankara State Security Court, the party's acting chairman, Remzi Kartal, said on Thursday that this was an act "placing the Kurdish problem in prison." He accused political leaders of adopting a negative attitude toward the DEP and said President Suleyman Demirel had given the signal "for the sentence to be passed." The DEP was first established under the name of the Peoples' Labor Party (HEP) and after this was closed down by the Constitutional Court. It reopened as the Freedoms and Labor Party (OZDEP), which was also closed down. In the new debate, party executives and the grassroots are discussing whether Turkey would tolerate the creation of a new party and how measures will be taken to protect party executives from being subject to political bans. If a decision to continue activities on the political platform is made, the DEP is expected to announce that it has "expelled" all of its provincial and district executives to avoid any legal action against them when the closure takes place. Deputies of the DEP who were members of the party when charges were filed against it will automatically lose their parliamentary status and face trial. Sources told the TDN that there were some DEP members who were supporters of the Kurdistan Socialist Party (PSK) and who wanted to create their own political--and legal--party. Supporters of the Hevgirtin [Unity] group and the Rizgari [Liberation] movement also believe that they should reorganize outside the DEP, but complain that they do not have enough grassroots support to be able to do so. However, the general feeling within the party is that none of the groups are strong enough to stand on their own. During this meeting the party assembly is also expected to decide on the fate of executive assembly member Ali Baskoylu who recently made a public suggestion that all DEP officials should seek political asylum at foreign missions in their territory. Baskoylu had called on DEP executives to enter embassies and seek asylum there and claimed that there was "no need to use the political platform." Observers say the expulsion of Baskoylu would imply that the DEP may decide to stay in the political arena despite the recent campaign of harassment it has faced.
