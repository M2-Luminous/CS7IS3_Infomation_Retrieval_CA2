The move marks a major policy shift from their longstanding support for the party, they said. It also indicates that cooperation within the seven-party coalition led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will be a factor in whether candidates get support from the unions -- the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union, the Japan Teachers' Union, the Japan Telecommunications' Workers Union and the Japan Postal Workers' Union. The sources made the remarks in reaction to a front-page article in the Monday morning issue of the ASAHI SHIMBUN, which said representatives of the four unions reached the agreement in a meeting at a Tokyo hotel on February 8. The four unions have been among the key groups within the eight million-strong Rengo (Japanese Trade Union Confederation) and have traditionally backed the SDP. But some supporters of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) inside Rengo have expressed reservations about solely rallying behind SDP and DSP candidates, a move seen as deliberately distancing themselves from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party], the ASAHI said. The SDP, the DSP, Shinseito and Komeito are members of the ruling coalition along with Hosokawa's Japan New Party, new party Sakigake [Harbinger] and the United Social Democratic Party.
