FR940503-0-00024 FR940503-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ACE&hyph;01] Establishment of Class E Airspace; Belle Plaine, IA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace at Belle Plaine, Iowa. The development of a new standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) at the Belle Plaine Municipal Airport, Belle Plaine, Iowa, utilizing the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) and the Belle Plaine non-directional beacon (NDB) on the airport as a navigational aid has made this action necessary. Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., October 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dale L. Carnine, Airspace Specialist, System Management Branch, ACE&hyph;530b, Federal Aviation Administration, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; telephone number: (816) 426&hyph;3408. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On January 21, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at the Belle Plaine Municipal Airport, Belle Plaine, Iowa (59 FR 8566). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. We discovered there was a minor error in the geographic coordinates of the Belle Plaine Municipal Airport. In addition, there was a reference to the Belle Plaine, Iowa, NDB and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, VORTAC in the official description, which is not required. They were corrected in this document. Other than these changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace at Belle Plaine, Iowa, extending upward from 700 feet above the surface excluding that portion which overlies the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Class E airspace. The development of new SIAPs at Belle Plaine Municipal Airport has made this rule necessary. The intended effect of this rule is to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the NDB or VOR/DME&hyph;A SIAPs at Belle Plaine Municipal Airport. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 CFR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
