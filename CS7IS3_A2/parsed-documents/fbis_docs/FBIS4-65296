In 48 hours, the government will go to the Senate in order to begin the debate on the confidence motion. On paper, the votes in favor of the Freedom Alliance are scant. The stakes are high and Umberto Bossi and Gianfranco Fini are not mincing their words: Either the government obtains the vote of the Senate, or new elections will be called. In the Freedom Alliance there is great optimism, despite the dramatic tones of Bossi and Fini. Silvio Berlusconi is the first to be convinced that at the end of the day many senators from the Center and the Left will give his government the go-ahead. All this despite the fact that Achille Occhetto, in the name of the Party of the Democratic Left, has rejected any talk of collaboration--on the contrary, announcing that opposition to the government will be firm. The picture from the Center is, however, a lot less clear. The Italian Popular Party [PPI] is divided: Officially both the party leaders at its headquarters at Piazza del Gesu and Nicola Mancino, the party's Senate caucus leader, stress that the PPI will vote against the government, as was decided before the election and as was promised to the electorate. The party says that collaboration with Forza Italia is possible, but certainly not at present. However, it seems that Forza Italia is making headway in the party ranks. For the time being only individual (?senators) have spoken tentatively of support, but the actual situation will only emerge at the vote. One of the theories put forward by Rocco Buttiglione and Roberto Formigoni is to abstain from voting in order to allow the government, albeit with a reduced quorum, to win the confidence motion. Ciarico de Mita has said that this will lead to the dissolution of the PPI. Instead, he floated his own idea: The PPI has to vote as a united front against the government so that Berlusconi is rejected by the Senate. However, newe elections would not be called because the largest party had the right and the duty to govern--although under different conditions. De Mita's objective is to have a government headed by a Berlusconi who would break with the Right in order to form an alliance with the PPI. The idea is appealing, but it would be very difficult to put into practice. [end recording]
