"The relations are even better than in the past. It is really an advantage for we have now a mature relations in the economic field as well as in the political field," he told ANTARA in a special interview here on Tuesday. The prime minister, who had just had a tete-a-tete with President Suharto, said that such a development had resulted in the increase of investment and trade volume between both countries. Stating that the Netherlands is in the forefront of free trade and is now increasing international trade ties, he said that there is an excellent possibilities of Indonesia and his country to go on further in that part. Indonesia and the Netherlands went through a disruption in their ties following Indonesia's decision to stop accepting all aid originating from the Netherlands to protest the interference of the Hague in Jakarta's domestic matters in 1992. The cut of the Dutch aid also signalled the end of the Dutch-led IGGI international aid consortium. IGGI was then replaced by the Paris based Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI). Some analysts believe that Prime Minister Lubber's visit to Indonesia marks a significant improvement in the Netherlands-Indonesia ties since 1992. On the occasion, Lubbers also underlined that the two countries have given more emphasis on business aspects, saying that the Netherlands always take a close watch on Indonesia's rapid development. "Your country is now in the start of the take-off era situation. In response to the situation, we will be very happy to participate in such a development," he added. When addressing an Indonesia-Netherlands Association (INA) lunch on the same day, the prime minister said that Jakarta and the Hague hold regular economic consultations at a bilateral level as well as in multilateral fora. He said that differences of opinion, when they occur, are discussed openly, frankly, and with determination on both sides to ultimately arrive at a solution that takes into account the mutual benefit of both, as partners and old friends should. He said that trade relation between the two countries are expanding and have been, for some time now, to Indonesia's advantage. In 1992, the Netherlands imported approximately 1,260 million Dutch guilders worth of Indonesian goods, while export to Indonesia amounted to 730 million Dutch guilders. In the first quarter of 1993, exports from the Netherlands to Indonesia rose by 31 percent, as compared with the same period the year before, while imports from Indonesia increased by 28 percent. In 1993, over 100,000 Dutch tourists visited Indonesia, an increase by more than 50 percent compared with that of in 1988. Prime Minister Lubbers arrived in Jakarta on Monday for a four- day visit.
