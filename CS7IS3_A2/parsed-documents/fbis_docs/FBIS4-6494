To achieve this it was imperative to have the presence not only of world leaders comprising the summit council's international commission for the peaceful Reunification of Korea, but of world media, consisting of the THE WASHINGTON TIMES, CNN, and NHK, who would reach out to all corners of the world, and give unbiased, fair, objective and respectful reporting covering your side of the story on the different issues that divide world opinion. These media came not only to hear your views directly but to report on the astounding progress this nation has made through self-reliance, rebuilding itself out of the ashes of war. The reports we have heard from around the world are that everyone is absolutely happy with the constructive media coverage generated from this trip. We feel very happy and satisfied with our work. We leave with a renewed commitment to continue our work for the peaceful resolution of the difficulties on the Korean peninsula.
