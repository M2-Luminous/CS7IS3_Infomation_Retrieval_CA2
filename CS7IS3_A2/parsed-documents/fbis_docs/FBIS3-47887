Japan has become one of the nations of the world where commodity price levels are the highest as a result of the rise in the value of the yen. 2. The domestic-foreign price differential issue is a problem which is deeply intertwined with the structural problems of the Japanese economy and there is a need for resolution of the structural problem from the standpoint of the consumer through actions such as elimination of agricultural protection policies, wholesale alteration of the indirect tax system, stricter enforcement of antimonopoly laws, promotion of competition through relaxation of economic controls, reform of social controls, increased efficiency in the consumer sector, and increased support for policies that encourage business efforts at improving efficiency and productivity. 3. These measures will not only lower domestic commodity prices, but can be expected to have the effect of shrinking the domestic-foreign price differentials caused by excessive foreign exchange valuations.] Cause Lies With Import Quotas and Price Supports The value of the yen against the dollar is currently fluctuating around 105 yen to the dollar, increasing in value 3.4-fold in 20 years since the inception of the floating exchange rate. The impact has been the placement of Japan in a status where it has one of the world's highest commodity price levels. During the days when the dollar was valued at 360 yen, Japanese commodity price levels were low compared to Europe and the United States, and Japanese tourists and officials stationed overseas were surprised by the limited buying power of the dollar in the United States compared to its value outside the United States. However, today, the situation has been completely reversed. As reflected in the following table, an Economic Planning Agency [EPA] survey of domestic-foreign price differentials revealed that commodity prices as viewed from an overall combined living expense perspective were relatively higher in Tokyo than they were in New York, London, Paris, or Berlin. Currently, the yen has risen in value in relation to all other foreign currencies, and it is anticipated that the domestic-foreign price differential will continue to expand during 1993.

Brands were not specified, but the survey covered items which traded in higher volumes. Whenever quality and standards did not match strictly, strict comparisons of individual items was difficult and attention should be focused on the fact that data on foodstuffs reflect differences in dietary habits. (3) Data on foreign urban areas were obtained from surveys conducted by the Price Bureau of EPA and the Japan External Trade Organization. Data on Tokyo were obtained from the Management and Coordination Agency's "Survey of Retail Commodity Statistics" and survey by the Price Bureau. Prices reflect retail prices which include taxes. (4) Foreign currency exchange rates reflect averages for 1992 as a whole. The question is, how was this domestic-foreign price differential created? The following three factors are conceivable, if we exclude temporary factors such as delays in making adjustments for changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The first factor concerns the issue of foreign trade goods which are exposed to international competition through export and import actions. Prices of foreign trade goods should stabilize at international price levels, unless they are exposed to special situations. However, in Japan such goods are isolated from international price competition because of import quotas and price support systems and despite efforts to lower prices through productivity improvements, the major rise in the value of the yen has caused a very sizable differential in domestic and foreign prices of such items as agricultural commodities. High tariff rates for such commodities as raw sugar ranging at fixed rates of thousands of yen per ton do not isolate specific commodities from price competition such as in the case of import quotas, but the rising yen effectively boosts the tariff rates and even if the benefits of the higher yen are passed on to the consumer, the end result is a considerable increase in the multiple of the domestic and foreign price differential. Other commodities such as textile products and liquor and petroleum products are similarly impacted in a major way in terms of tariffs and related taxes. Oligopolistic price formations by manufacturers also serve as cause for domestic-foreign price differentials. In those instances where major domestic-foreign price differentials exist despite the lack of obvious import barriers, conceivable are such actions as prevention of parallel imports by exclusive import agents, actions which restrict competition through the formation of marketing affiliations by domestic manufacturers, and the difficulties faced in arranging for parallel imports under government controls imposed on cosmetics. Lagging Productivity in Non-Foreign Trade Goods Sector The second factor concerns the problem with non-foreign trade goods which are not exposed to international competition. In the case of Japan, the differential in productivity between the manufacturing industries and other industries is conspicuously large compared to other nations. When one considers that foreign currency exchange rates are based primarily on international competitiveness in the manufacturing sector, this differential causes a disparity between purchasing parity relative to overall living expenses and the real foreign exchange rates. Further, since foreign trade goods are passed to the consumer after adding distribution costs, high marketing costs translate into high domestic retail prices. This sector is affected by dropping foreign trade goods prices, but since it is not exposed to direct price-lowering pressures from price drops by competitors, there is a lack of actions to enhance productivity through such movements as increased manufacturing efficiency, enhancement of products by high-value-added measures, and withdrawals from unprofitable sectors as seen in the foreign trade goods sector, thus leading to expanding productivity differentials between foreign trade and non-foreign trade goods sectors. The non-foreign trade goods sector is composed of many regulated industries which are subject to market controls relative to new market entrants and pricing. Such restrictions are a strong probable cause for delays in enhancing long-term productivity. Further, excessive profits accompanying controls in such industries are conceivably distributed to workers as part of their wages providing for wage levels that are higher than other industries and a situation in which such costs are transferred to the consumer in the form of higher prices. The third factor concerns the issue of production factors such as land which cannot be moved on an international basis and labor whose movements are restricted. Generally speaking, requisite prices such as for land and wages and commodity price levels have a tendency to rise in economies that enjoy high growth rates based on increased productivity accompanying economic growth. The relationship between per capita gross domestic product (GDP) as converted into gross national product and purchasing parity, and commodity price levels based on GDP have been in considerable turmoil since the foreign currency exchange adjustments agreed upon in the 1985 Plaza Accord, but it is obvious that commodity price levels tend to be higher in nations with a higher per capita GDP. A considerable portion of high Japanese commodity prices can be explained by the high income levels, but they still exceed by 12 percent the levels that can be covered by such an explanation. However, the recent rise in the yen is deemed to have caused an expanding disparity in Japanese price levels which is equal to or in excess of that of the North European nations where the degree of disparity from regression lines is the largest. When the foregoing situation and findings of the living expense survey are combined, the structure--wherein a major domestic-foreign price differential is aggravated on a living expense basis in excess of the overall economic cost basis in the form of high consumer prices for food, clothing, and footwear which are highly weighted in terms of consumer goods--becomes obvious. Additionally, high land prices in Tokyo have a conspicuous impact relative to principal urban areas throughout the world. Call for Bold Policies Emphasizing Consumer Interests A review of domestic-foreign price differential factors in this manner enables us to understand that the differentials are deeply intertwined with various structural problems. The issue of domestic-and foreign price differentials cannot be resolved through clever manipulations and requires work on solutions to structural issues from a standpoint which emphasizes the consumer. Keywords applicable to such an approach are promotion of competition and enhancement of efficiency and productivity. If I were to present a self-styled approach to reducing the domestic-foreign price differential, it would be as follows: First, I would convert the current agriculture protection policy from one of maintaining prices to one of direct aid. Current policy merely serves to expand the disadvantages suffered by consumers relative to advantages enjoyed by farmers. Second, I would completely reform high tariffs such as for textile products and the indirect tax system for petroleum and liquor. We should also study the feasibility of converting current indirect tax liabilities hidden in the prices of such necessities as foodstuffs to a tax system where the liabilities are clearly and broadly indicated. Third, I would promote competition based on stricter implementation of the antimonopoly laws and relaxation of economic controls. Especially desirable would be the establishment of a surveillance system by the Fair Trade Commission to oversee import prices and foreign prices. Relaxation of controls should include not only flexibility in price controls, but lowering of barriers to new market entrants through abolishment of restrictions on new market entrants because of excess supply and easing of restrictions relative to market entry as well as withdrawal. Fourth, I would revise societal regulations concerning safety. I would revise the contents of regulations which are excessively strict, introduce product liability laws on matters which can be covered by the principle of self-responsibility and simultaneously abolish regulations which can be covered by the new laws. Fifth, I would reinforce policies which support business efforts in the area of enhancing the efficiency of consumer-related sectors and promoting productivity. Policies which were previously concentrated on export industries and leading-edge technologies must be expanded to circulation, marketing, and other services. These measures should lead to lower domestic commodity prices and expanded imports through improved market access and expanded domestic demand, alleviate high-yen pressures occasioned by structural distortions and can be expected to have the effect of reducing domestic-foreign price differentials caused by excessive currency valuations.
