Juri Toomepuu accused Mart Laar and the State Chancellery of concluding a "harmful and illegal", both towards him and the Estonian state, arms deal with the TAAS Israel Industries company and in willfully presenting wrong data. Toomepuu applied for compensation of "financial and moral harm" done to him, correspondingly 1075,86 kroons and 10 million kroons. After the Riigikogu adopted the ratifying law of the arms deal on December 15 last year, it made the agreement lawful starting January 7, 1993, when it was signed, Viilol said. President Lennart Meri ratified the law at the end of December last year. Thus, Toomepuu's accusations that those that signed the agreement had broken the Constitution and that the deal was unfavourable and economically disadvantageous to Estonia, causing him financial harm, were unfounded, Viilol stated. Toomepuu has to pay 15,340 kroons to barrister Urmas Arumae for representing the State Chancellery. Toomepuu has the right to appeal to Tallinn district court in ten days.
