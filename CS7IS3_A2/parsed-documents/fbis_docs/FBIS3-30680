FBIS3-30680 "dreeu026__a94052" FBIS-EEU-94-026-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 February 1994 ANNEX Hungary Goncz Gives Interview on Elections, Prospects AU0702131994 Budapest MTI in English 1700 GMT 5 Feb 94 AU0702131994 Budapest MTI Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Budapest, 5 Feb (MTI) -- "Elections in Hungary this May will be different from what they were in 1990 insofar as electors then definitely said no to the former regime, while now they have to vote for the future," President Arpad Goncz said on radio today. Goncz announced on Friday [4 February] that the first round of elections will be held on May 8. In the interview, the president said that the past four years were a period of looking into the past in many respects -- good and bad alike -- but the next elections will already focus on perspective aims. He noted that no extremist forces had ever come to power in Hungary through elections. According to Goncz, the most important change in the last four years was that society has become aware of its strength and realized that its fate is in its own hands. MPs should mainly pass major economic laws in the remainder of the parliamentary cycle, and abstain from adopting legislation that another parliament of different composition would refuse to accept, he said. Speaking about international issues, the president mentioned his Davos meeting with Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yassir 'Arafat, where he expressed Hungary's readiness to participate in reconstruction work in the Gaza Strip and Transjordan. Arafat welcomed the proposal and said experts' talks would follow. Regarding his Prague consultation with the U.S. President and NATO's peace-partnership plan, Goncz said that security and stability have more aspects than just the military, as they also include human-rights, minority, social-welfare and environmental questions. He said Hungary had definitely come closer to NATO, adding that the country's security can be guaranteed through integration into all-European organizations, among them NATO and the Western European Union.
