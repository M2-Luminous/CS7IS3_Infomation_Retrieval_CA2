He said in an interview with Interfax on Saturday that the president's chair will be under siege. According to Dudayev, it will be difficult for the Russian president to keep his post in the context of such a situation. "The scenario also provides for temporary neutralization of Viktor Chernomyrdin with his further discrediting and pushing out of the political life," the Chechen president added. He said this proved that the government led by Chernomyrdin had been subjected to unfair criticism from the very first days of its work. According to Dudayev, only this government could withdraw the Russian economy from the crisis. He said the position of former Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik was that of a very honest courageous man who realized that all perspectives would be in vain if once to compromise and to sacrifice the lawfulness.
