Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Taba talks, said the Palestinians "once again categorically rejected the attempt to bind them to the Cairo understandings." According to him, "instead of making progress, the sides were busy yesterday with the presentation of documents and discussions of their interpretation, but on this issue, too, no agreement was reached." Sha'th added: "If the Israelis raise the interpretation of the Cairo understandings once again, I will be certain that Israel is trying to hold back the talks. Until now, I thought we may be having trouble communicating, but after today's round of talks I have serious doubts." He added: "If the Israeli delegation plans to entrap or embarrass the other side -- that is us -- or portray us as fools, I do not see how it plans to sign an agreement with us afterward." [passage omitted] Sha'th disclosed to HA'ARETZ all the documents he sent to Major General Amnon Shahaq, the head of the Israeli delegation to the talks, and those he received from him. He also disclosed a document with Prime Minister Rabin's reservations about the Cairo understandings. "Did you know that Rabin also had reservations about them? The document contains nine reservations about the border crossings and the size of the autonomous areas in Gaza and Jericho. Rabin sent me the letter via Shahaq, and I never mentioned it until this moment," Sha'th said. "Here is the famous letter I sent to Shahaq with Yasir 'Arafat's reservations. As you see, 'Arafat has fewer reservations than Rabin. Therefore, these obviously are fluid matters. There is no agreement, and this is merely an attempt to entrap the Palestinians," he asserted. Sha'th even disclosed that the Palestinians submitted to the Israeli delegation a 70-page document yesterday containing their updated versions of the comprehensive agreement and of the security protocol. According to him, "this is a compromise between the positions of both sides, based on the protocols of 8 December. It is a serious effort on our part to prove that the negotiations in Taba can be completed within two to three weeks. We are now awaiting Israel's response." [passage omitted] [A report by No'omi Levitzky on pages 1 and 19 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 11 January notes that the document presented by the Palestinians yesterday "makes no mention of their demand to increase Jericho's autonomous area beyond the 55 square km agreed upon in Cairo."]
