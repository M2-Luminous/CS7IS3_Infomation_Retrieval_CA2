"The Orange Free State defied racial boundaries," said Patrick Terror Lekota said on Sunday [1 May] night. This, and some black support for formerly white parties, showed that voters in the Free State had made decisions based on issues and not race, he said. This was not the view of NP [National Party] Free State leader Kobie Coetsee, who said he was disappointed that voters in SA's [South Africa's] first non-racial election had clearly cast votes according to "the notion of colour". Latest provisional figures from the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) on Sunday evening put the ANC well ahead with 65.9 per cent of votes polled, with the NP on 13.4 per cent. The Democratic Party had 7.6 per cent and the Freedom Front 7.2 per cent. However, unofficial figures obtained from reliable electoral sources, but not yet released by the IEC, indicated a landslide ANC victory with over 80 per cent of the vote. IEC officials said they expected a complete provisional result for the Free State by midday on Monday. A senior NP Free State official said the NP was disappointed with its results and had expected to do better, especially in the northern Free State goldfields where it concentrated its campaign. Reaction to the apparent ANC victory was muted in the Bloemfontein city centre and surrounding townships on Sunday, with residents appearing to go about their normal business. In Freedom Square squatter camp, Jackson Mahope, 25, was watching a soccer match Sunday afternoon and said he did not need to follow the election results too closely. "I know who won," he said with confidence. Mr Lekota said many Free State whites had concentrated on party politics and found in the ANC a program that suited them. This would give the region a big advantage and should be encouraged. The image of the Free State as a peaceful and stable region should be maintained as the best way to empower its new leadership to attract investment that was frightened away from violence in Natal and the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]. Mr Lekota was upbeat about the region's potential for growth and said the ANC planned to urgently begin an intensive education programme and give immediate attention to housing. He urged ANC supporters to behave with discipline and calm and not to loot or cause chaos in townships and city centres when they celebrated the final poll results. "Lets celebrate and have champagne bottles popping, but we must respect the rights now enshrined in the interim constitution." He appealed to police to watch out for troublemakers and not to allow the situation to run out of control. The poll results indicated that the Freedom Front [FF] had reasonable support in the Free State, Mr Lekota said, which meant the rightwing poll boycott had failed. The FF had not, however, got as much support as it thought it had and did not get enough votes for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]. The ANC was concerned that its opposition should make a reasonable showing in the election, Mr Lekota said, so a proper government of national unity could be formed. If not, he would suggest the new government should insist on close consultations with other parties when making decisions.
